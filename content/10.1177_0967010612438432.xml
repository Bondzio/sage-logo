<abstract>
<p>In this article, we examine contemporary ‘resilience’ through UK preparedness – an <italic>apparatus</italic> of security enacted under the legal and organizational principles of UK Civil Contingencies and civil protection legislation and practices. By examining the design, practices and technologies that constitute the exercises performed within Civil Contingencies, the article first suggests that the manner in which exercises have been mobilized as examples of preparedness and apocalyptical imaginations of the ‘unthinkable’ should be understood within the highly specific societal and political contexts that shape them. More substantially, the article then provides a nuanced understanding of the <italic>life</italic> of the security assemblage through an in-depth analysis of the exercise and its design, materials, play and contingent relations. Seeking to deepen and widen concerns for what <italic>matters</italic> in security studies, animated by concern for objects, bodily affects, contingencies and excess, the article contends for a more serious concern with how security and its practices can surprise, shock, enthral and disrupt in a manner that need not only be associated with failure.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In this article, we focus on the <italic>life</italic> of apparatuses of security: badly designed scenarios, moments of boredom or frustration, PowerPoint slides that go wrong, and other elements that not only trouble the success of attempts to secure life but, we will show, are also central to the very constitution of ways of governing life. Accordingly, the article is animated by three interrelated conceptual concerns, each of which we engage with through a case study of the use of one technique of security – the exercise – in contemporary UK Civil Contingencies planning.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0967010612438432">1</xref></sup> First, how do we conceptualize differences in how practices, technologies and people are gathered together to govern complex and uncertain events? Second, if recent work on security has shown how anticipatory action is enabled by complex assemblages of techniques and technologies, how can we take seriously the human experiences and actions that come to constitute the performance of security? And, third, how might we simultaneously conceptualize apparatuses of security not in terms of their strategic goals or the urgent demands to which they respond, but in terms of their excessive properties – the many affective and material contingencies that are part of the processes and procedures of security? Taking greater account of the materialities and affects of security allows us, we will argue, to extend our understanding of the workings of security apparatuses beyond an exclusive concern with the logics that animate it and their apparent success. With regard to the case study of exercises and UK Civil Contingencies, this enables us to treat the exercise in its specificity as one element in an apparatus of security that is always in the midst of being made and unmade, rather than indicative of a broader logic or rationality.</p>
<p>Exercises are techniques that stage events in order to make it possible to practise and address particular scenarios – the what-ifs – by rehearsing response to emergencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0967010612438432">Anderson and Adey, 2011</xref>). Exercise designers attempt to draw equivalences, we suggest, between the present and a possible future event, allowing the ‘players’ in a given exercise to ‘inhabit’ emergency as a distinct situation. On this understanding, exercises within UK Civil Contingencies are one way in which events are made actionable and thus governable. In contrast to other apparatuses of security that have recently received attention (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0967010612438432">Aradau and Van Munster, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0967010612438432">De Goede and Randalls, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0967010612438432">Sidaway, 2008</xref>), exercises in UK Civil Contingencies are in the main not based around apocalyptic or catastrophic scenarios. Not only is the apocalyptic scenario far removed from the problem of resilience, wherein imaginary threats become routine logistical issues for networked life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0967010612438432">Dillon, 2002</xref>), but the arts and technologies of security often aim to render the very banality of the emergency events that are exercised and planned for exciting and enthralling.</p>
<p>The apparatus we seek to expound has some problems in making the event of emergency ‘known’, ‘experiential’ or ‘habitable’. Far from being overdetermined by the exercises’ designers, controllers or players, things can go wrong. The exercised event is hard to simulate realistically and plausibly. Stuff doesn’t work and can refuse intervention. Suspension of disbelief is lost, while matter and people may misbehave. The excessive material and contingent relations of both the event <italic>and its</italic> response disrupt their determination and unsettle any artifice or flow of the game, just as they are common agential concerns that planners, designers and players may consider in the wider ecology of exercises. In taking forward recent calls for a more material analysis of security (see, for instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0967010612438432">Aradau [2010b]</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0967010612438432">Voelkner [2011]</xref> in previous issues of this journal, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0967010612438432">Coward [2006]</xref> elsewhere), the article establishes an account of matter that is attuned to its relational contingencies and material-affective excesses. To do so, we draw on the materialist and vital philosophies of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0967010612438432">Jane Bennett (2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0967010612438432">2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0967010612438432">2001)</xref>, as well as the writings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0967010612438432">Maurice Blanchot (1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0967010612438432">1986)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0967010612438432">Georges Bataille (1985)</xref> and the corpus of work known as ‘non-representational theories’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0967010612438432">Anderson and Harrison, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0967010612438432">Thrift, 2008</xref>). Through a series of close ethnographic studies, in-depth interviews and a nationwide survey of exercise techniques,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0967010612438432">2</xref></sup> the article provides empirical groundwork and conceptual progress on the material-affective sites, spaces and relations of security within the design, management and play of an exercise. The article will break down the exercise, away from its relatively abstract description in the literature (although see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0967010612438432">Aradau [2010a]</xref> for a more careful exploration), to consider the complex layering of technologies and techniques, embodied practices, material agencies and contingent relations that make up security. First, we turn to previous work on exercises and contemporary forms of security and argue that recent work on matter and materiality allows for a focus on the life of apparatuses.</p>

<p>Emergency planning is a modality of future-orientated security that sits within much broader and diverse nested approaches towards the anticipation and governance of events that have their origin in World War II, the emergence of civil defence and air-raid precautions, and the subsequent Cold War context of thermonuclear threat and industrial instability. Elsewhere, we have seen how the catastrophic impact of terrorist events may be averted by action that takes place before such events occur, this being the logic underpinning recent US foreign policy in Iraq under the so-called Bush doctrine or the pre-emptive strikes carried out on terrorist financing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0967010612438432">Amoore and De Goede, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0967010612438432">Butler, 2004</xref>) by ‘petty sovereigns’ at the border (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0967010612438432">Salter, 2006</xref>). A focus on emergency planning demands that we complicate the overgenerality with which logics of pre-emption have been applied to almost every rationality of contemporary security. Under a logic of preparedness, within which our case study UK Civil Contingencies would probably most accurately fit, complex, uncertain and threatening events are not acted upon in advance of their occurrence. Emergency planning under the rubric of civil protection, and co-existing with multiple logics of security, does not seek to stop an event from happening or beginning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0967010612438432">Anderson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0967010612438432">Aradau, 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0967010612438432">Lakoff, 2008</xref>), but rather to manage the way in which it is responded to as an emergency. Governing through the emergency in this context takes the emergency as endemic to societies made up of populations and property (infrastructure, buildings, stuff). Modern societies come to be seen as potential breeding grounds for the incubation and spread of danger by endogenous threat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0967010612438432">Cooper, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0967010612438432">Massumi, 2009</xref>). In other words, emergencies are always possible, and governing them is a matter of planning for how to respond to their occurrence.</p>
<p>Such a focus moves contemporary assertions of a ‘state of exception’ or ‘state of emergency’ dramatically off-centre (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0967010612438432">Neal, 2010</xref>), because Civil Contingencies does not presume the declaration of a state of emergency despite the fact that such a juridico-political suspension of norms was called several times during the formative years of the Civil Contingencies apparatus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0967010612438432">Jeffery, 1983</xref>), as successive governments sought to govern the industrial militancy that threatened the vital infrastructure of the UK and the ‘life of the community’ in the 1970s. This is not to suggest that preparedness is unconcerned with decisional cuts over life and death, but that we should carefully consider ‘emergency’ not only in the terms of ‘exception’ and the <italic>state of emergency</italic> by way of the writings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0967010612438432">Giorgio Agamben (2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0967010612438432">1998)</xref>. Under Civil Contingencies, the exception is dislocated to a portion of emergency powers whose very occurrence has proved to be exceptional. Thus, the example we draw upon is relatively specific and distinctive to the context of UK emergency planning and its particular structure of agencies and legislative framing.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0967010612438432">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Preparedness is first of all a series of discourses, practices, technologies – in short, an apparatus of security. Preparedness does not obey a single logic of performance. Underpinning preparedness, as we have seen elsewhere, are rationalities and logics of security performed through techniques of risk management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0967010612438432">Aradau and Van Munster, 2007</xref>). The risk register is a primary mechanism through which Civil Contingencies assesses and organizes the activities of its responder agencies. According to a methodology of calculation, uncertainties over threat are made legible by transforming those threats into calculable risk under conditions of likelihood and severity. Through this manner of technique, risks may be given orders of severity and priority and are used to direct resources to further plan and exercise plans for meeting the eventuality of those threats. Yet, it is the exercise that has been granted most space and deliberation within the literature around preparedness or ‘readiness’ thus far. Exercises have been discussed in terms of the routine simulated environments that emulate the tightly and uneven urban environments of the Global South, landscapes that the US military uses to train its recruits for urban warfare in Jakarta or Baghdad (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0967010612438432">Graham, 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0967010612438432">2008</xref>), or similarly translated into software code to be practised as a video game (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0967010612438432">Ash, 2010</xref>). Elsewhere, especially within the USA under the rubric of what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0967010612438432">Collier and Lakoff (2008)</xref> term the ‘distributed preparedness’ of civil emergencies, we see that the wider remit of preparedness planning has overseen large-scale public state-led efforts to exercise extensive plans that deal with issues ranging from terrorism to public health to humanitarian emergencies.</p>
<p>But, where we might point to several comparisons with cultures of simulation, modelling and training, understanding Civil Contingencies exercises through these contexts is perhaps too generalized. For <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0967010612438432">Stephen Collier (2008)</xref>, a more useful term is ‘enactment’, because it does not carry the baggage of modelling or simulation, even while the latter may well be implicated as component practices and technologies of preparedness itself.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0967010612438432">4</xref></sup> Enactment also does some more useful work for us in our attempt to understand the exercise as a function of preparedness. For <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0967010612438432">Collier (2008</xref>: 226) once more, ‘enactment “acts out” uncertain future threats’, but it does so by juxtaposing various data, technologies, objects and people. Distinct from the logics of technologies of risk and calculation that may, of course, underpin the exercise or be part of it, for Collier enactment refers to the practices that bring the many parts of the apparatus to life.</p>
<p>Collier’s rich historical rendering of the exercise sees it as a juxtaposition of many elements to ‘act out’ the future, but is this analysis slightly removed from the life and vitality of the very human systems and assemblages of people, plans and the stuff of preparedness? Juxtaposed with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0967010612438432">Jordan Crandall’s (2008)</xref> evocative description of his experience of an exercise at a university campus in the USA, we garner a different perspective. Crandall foregrounds specific techniques and practices wherein ‘experience’ is an essential ingredient to the enactment of the exercise and an apparatus of security:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The man became increasingly agitated, jostling in his stretcher, his bandaged face hot and swollen like a match head. His gaze – though not actually visible through the slits of his bandages – seemed to dart back and forth across the commons. A ‘decontamination engine’ fired up nearby, with several actor-victims beginning to dance gleefully in the spray of a decontamination hosedown. Their heads thrown back, their arms aflail, they emitted a chorus of giggles, which mixed with the hissing of the firehoses and the applause of the appreciative onlookers, who seemed to mistake it for a circus act. The firemen shuffled uneasily. Against this backdrop – and perhaps sensing that he was being upstaged – the man on the stretcher began to emit a low, guttural roar, which seemed to rise up from the depths of his being. The roar vibrated in unison with the mechanical rumble of the generators and emergency machines. It resounded across the commons, a strange hybrid of human and machinic discharge. His guttural emission, having rapidly increased in volume and pitch, then phase-shifted into a wild screech that cut through the commons like a knife. At that very moment, everyone in the vicinity froze – as if a director somewhere had yelled, ‘Cut!’</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Jump back from this to Collier and we have quite a different apprehension of the exercise, which is not figured as the juxtaposition of data, discourses and models but as something quite other, taken from the perspective of inside the apparatus and its enactment of the future. These are the kinds of perspectives performance theorists and scholars have been keen to use in order that they might examine the historical emergence of the civil defence exercise, as shown emphatically in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0967010612438432">Tracy Davis’s (2007)</xref> <italic>Stages of Emergency.</italic> The exercise in these contexts is about <italic>inhabiting</italic> the ‘interval’, space-time or theatre of the future.</p>
<p>What we think is at stake here in the differences between these approaches towards preparedness and the exercise is how security studies becomes attuned to the discursive and representational limits of the analysis of a security apparatus, an issue that several writers within international relations and elsewhere have begun to pursue. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0967010612438432">Claudia Aradau (2010b</xref>: 502) has recently pushed scholarship to go beyond the ‘speech acts’ of enunciation to examine how a ‘thoroughly heterogeneous ensemble’ may consist ‘of the said as much as the unsaid’. In her performative and material-based critique of security, she takes both the emergency exercise and vital systems of infrastructural protection to task. In the context of the Civil Contingencies exercise, Aradau sees subjects caught up in the entrainment of disciplinary power. This is a security ‘theatre’, wherein the exercise trains and enables ‘habits of preparedness’ in the rehearsal of a ‘ritual play’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0967010612438432">Aradau, 2010a</xref>: 4). For Aradau and others, the experiences of the exercise become constitutive of a wider ‘“subjectivity of the state being” – the embodied experiences, identifications and desires of bureaucratic and other professionals’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0967010612438432">Schoch-Spana, 2004</xref>: 8) involved. Elsewhere, the subject positions of emergency preparedness are seen alongside the objects and things that seem, once again for <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0967010612438432">Aradau (2010b</xref>: 502), to be unfairly ‘relegated to the margins of analysis, and the focus of analysis is shifted upon institutions, economic and social processes, systems of norms, techniques, types of classification and modes of characterization’,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0967010612438432">5</xref></sup> a mode of inquiry she is quite rightly eager to correct.</p>
<p>While we are very sympathetic to Aradau’s intervention, we would also like to suggest ways of taking this further. We would contend that Aradau’s formulation of matter (primarily via <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0967010612438432">Barad [2003]</xref>) underplays (somewhat ironically) the very vibrancy and contingency of the objects, matter and indeed bodies that constitute those ‘vital systems’, as well as the procedures and practices used to secure them. Both Aradau and Barad seem to enact a certain removal of the contingent life of an apparatus of security and the excessive dimension of materials over attempts to govern life. How, for instance, might objects <italic>object</italic> to their enrolment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0967010612438432">Bingham, 1996</xref>), to undergo what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0967010612438432">Blanchot (1986</xref>: 109) describes as the ‘subversion of order, transgression, resistance, restitution of a more general economy which would not be dominated by the administration of objects’?<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0967010612438432">6</xref></sup> Indeed, in Aradau’s earlier rendering of the exercise, response could seem closed off to mimetic similitude. The subject here is expected to take ‘on automaton-like qualities. Following expected procedures, performing the right gestures, the subject withdraws from historical action and relinquishes political responsibility’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0967010612438432">Aradau, 2010a</xref>: 5). Although we learn of excitable passions, the exercise is predominantly a scripted ritual, a ‘determined process’, a fiction bearing little resemblance to the real. There is not enough of the ‘corrosive, decaying, slowly disintegrating’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0967010612438432">Aradau, 2010b</xref>: 508) matter that might crucially frustrate the materialization of critical infrastructure, yet seems passively and unproblematically ‘enrolled’ within security systems. What’s more, where is exercise play as creative and surprising or unpredictable and contingent? If there is no ‘doubt’, no uncertainty in the performance of the exercise, why exercise at all?</p>
<p>How, then, to take account of the disruptive and the exorbitant – the excessive nature of the apparatus? How might we conceive of the very openness of objects and relations that may well impede or enable the enrolments of things and people into infrastructures and schemas of security? Furthermore, how might we be more perceptive of the more open-ended narrational structures that enable an exercise to go wrong? How, in other words, might the apparatus of preparedness seek to harness these contingent material and social relations, to allow for play, for fun, for failure, despair and panic, or for exhaustion, fatigue and the contingent unfolding of the exercise?</p>
<p>First, we suggest taking closer account of the felt, sensed, touched and moved – the material relations that come to compose the apparatus, ‘redirecting’ attention from meaning to ‘material compositions and conduct’. Refigured in this way, what matters of matter is not only how we take account of its presence and assembly in enactment, but how that matter complicates practice and subjectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0967010612438432">Dewsbury et al., 2002</xref>). How, then, to think, for instance, of ‘the percept or affect of the material itself, the smile of oil, the gesture of fired clay, the thrust of metal, the crouch of Romanesque stone, and the ascent of Gothic stone’ (Deleuze and Guattari, 1994; cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0967010612438432">Dewsbury et al., 2002</xref>: 438). This, we suggest, means turning to the material-affective relations performed between subject and object, no longer separated but co-involved and ‘enveloped’ with the force and push of material things and relations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0967010612438432">Wylie, 2005</xref>). In this sense, the lively matter of security itself is what comes to matter as experience, as we seek to understand how the representational technologies and anticipatory techniques so often discussed within contemporary analysis of security are performed – generative of their own affects, touches and sensations through the materiality of practice. In the terms of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0967010612438432">Jane Bennett (2010)</xref>, this means attuning to the ‘force of things’ or ‘thing power’ not only of a vibrant and excitable matter, but also of one that might deaden, lessen or refuse intervention. What, moreover, is the ‘agency’ of the collaborations and assemblages of objects and people as they come together in unexpected ways?</p>
<p>Second, we take the exercise seriously as a momentary encounter of governing through events or contingency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0967010612438432">Dillon, 2007</xref>). In short, it is the very uncertainty over emergency response that we suggest animates the doubt that demands that exercises rehearse and enact particular scenarios – and, furthermore, sees the exercise as open to the unpredictable emergence of new relations and potentialities, creative experiences and outcomes, surprises and interruptions and disjunctures. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0967010612438432">Brian Massumi (2002)</xref> has used the example of the rules of a game to characterize this issue. Relatively immutable and met by pre-planned procedures, rules can only result in repeatable play. Instead, we suggest that exercises combine plans, procedures and narratives with unpredictable combinations of players, materials, performances and events. Thus, we must seek to complicate the overdetermining assumptions that power and technique are successful, and remind ourselves, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0967010612438432">Foucault (1977)</xref> did, that practices of power are commonly frustrated, escaped and clearly uncertain.</p>
<p>Third, it is tempting to centre our analysis on the material-affective expressions of feelings such as fear or panic, or <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0967010612438432">Isin’s (2004)</xref> recognition of a contemporary ‘neurotic subject’, within different contexts of security. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0967010612438432">De Goede and Randalls (2009</xref>: 871) outline, the ‘affective subject’ could be understood as a focus for governmental power given its susceptibility ‘to pleas to manage future climate and terror insecurities’. But, while fear and panic may well be the dominant modality of affects that Aradau and others see as urgent expressions demanding careful management, as emotions to govern with in order to irritate and agitate reactionary readiness, how might we be more open to other affective states? What other feelings might trouble exercise planning and response, or equally go beyond the preponderance of fear, anxiety and neurosis as the emotions and affects named and excited by the security apparatus with deliberate purpose?</p>
<p>Back to Crandall’s narration, and the sort of approach we have articulated is performed through his exercise practice. While he is very much located in the perspective of an actor enrolled into events, Crandall shows how the apparatus of the exercise machinery has so much more freight when one considers its material-affective relations upon the more-than-human bodies and subjects at play within its machinery.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>For <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0967010612438432">Crandall (2008)</xref>,</p>
<p>It generates somatic adjustments, optimizing the body to perform.... Like the agitated actor on the pavement, we sometimes squirm as we move and are manoeuvred within the substrates of the machineries. Thousands of stimuli constantly impinge upon us, embroiling us in a larger sensory network that overcomes all regulations. Our bodies negotiate this, but we’re not aware of it. We might sense it as ‘mood.’ Potential actions brew inside us, to be expressed outwardly or infolded/repressed inwardly.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In considering the material-affective excesses of the exercise apparatus, Crandall demands that we first begin to take far more seriously that which escapes discourse, ideology and speech. What happens when matter and relations are more unstable and uncompromising? But, second, by extending our understanding of apparatuses towards the more-than-human material-affective relations that compose those apparatuses, we might also consider how the technologies of exercises attempt to grapple or ‘calibrate’ dispositions rather than simply produce fears. This is, perhaps, a more ‘active concept of the apparatus’ that ‘arranges, or choreographs, acts of preparedness’, that ‘calibrates their tendencies to act’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0967010612438432">Crandall, 2008</xref>).</p>

<p>Emergency response under Civil Contingencies is about the preparations for what will occur in the interval between the occurrence of an event and the expansion of that event from an initial site or set of sites. Events can move or cascade, propagating through space and time, escalating beyond the ability of one or more organizations to handle them. Most notably, one of the ways in which this is characterized by the Civil Contingencies Secretariat is in terms of a fire that must be stopped from spreading or as something that must be ‘nipped’ in the bud, like a monstrous flora – both capable of getting out of hand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0967010612438432">Cabinet Office, 2004</xref>: 48). For example, following the 2007 flood events that caused massive disruption and damage in several large counties in Britain, the Pitt Review’s nationwide analysis of the UK’s preparedness would conclude that the flood’s effects were characteristic of large-scale infrastructural failure. The flood had resulted in the ‘largest loss of essential services since World War II, with almost half a million people without mains water or electricity. Transport networks failed, a dam breach was narrowly averted’. The flood emergency was one that came too quickly, ‘before anyone could really react’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0967010612438432">Pitt Review, 2007</xref>: ix).</p>
<p>Materializing a complex series of events as a fire or a flood that must be stopped in its tracks is a popular characterization of the emergency by the contingencies apparatus. In terms of its very obvious fluvial allegories, the materiality of the emergency is figured as a complex ‘system of systems’ that threatens with infrastructural failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0967010612438432">Little, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0967010612438432">Graham, 2010</xref>). Arteries and tributaries of communications, supply chains, energy and power flows distribute disruption throughout different parts of the network. Because of the interconnectivity of these systems, the emergency cascades across both geography and topology. The placement of power substations and pylons near rivers and railway tracks is often given as an example of local infrastructure that is clustered not only geographically but also within a networked topological space, where ‘an explosion involving a gas storage facility might damage power distribution infrastructure that removes supply from water pumping and purification systems’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0967010612438432">Johnson and Mclean, 2008</xref>: 5). As the Pitt Review explored, the shutdown of a water-treatment plant because of power failure by a flood event could then have the ‘knock-on effect’ of ‘inundation of a wastewater treatment processes, contamination of the water supply due to pipeline damage and ingress of flood water’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0967010612438432">Pitt Review, 2007</xref>: 255), meaning an interruption of the water supply for public needs and private industry (see the Pitt Review’s representation of these interdependent networks in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0967010612438432">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>The metaphor also goes beyond network analogies to an encounter of unpredictable collaborations and affectivities. The flood spills over, cascades and overruns, while with fire comes more complex topology and behaviour, suggestive of ‘plethora and exhaustion’, ‘vertical growth and sudden fall’, ‘accumulation and drought’ (Michel Serres, cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0967010612438432">Bennett, 2010</xref>: 118). Fires and floods similarly capture the materiality of the irreducible. For <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0967010612438432">John Law and Ann-Marie Mol (2001</xref>: 615), the qualities of fire describe the ‘multiple alterities conjoined to a centred presence’ – an emergency characterized by sudden and unpredictable movements and changes of direction, excess and surplus. This volatility is a product of the complexity of the vulnerable systems and the nonlinear character of the emergencies they compose, which flickers between actuality and potentiality, between local and global scales, collapsing the presence and absence of distant relations. What we see here, related to wider genealogies of resilience that draw upon the science and political economy of complex adaptive systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0967010612438432">Zebrowski, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0967010612438432">Walker and Cooper, 2011</xref>), is an imaginary of the material life of events rooted within the language and discourse of computer science, engineering solutions and large technological systems. What these discourses seek to comprehend is the ‘vulnerability of complexity’, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0967010612438432">Stephen Little (2010)</xref> describes it. Taking a ‘systems of systems’ (SOS) approach has seen the Civil Contingencies Secretariat based in the UK Cabinet Office grappling with the ‘operational independence’, ‘heterogeneous composition’, ‘emergent behaviour’ and ‘dynamic reconfiguration’ of networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0967010612438432">Alexander et al., 2004</xref>). Cascading failures means the possibility of first-, second-, third- to the nth-order effects, contingent relations and vortical materialities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0967010612438432">Alexander et al., 2004</xref>) that only temporarily cohere and thus are particularly difficult to enumerate.</p>
<p>Civil Contingencies works on the premise that through action in the interval of the emergency, events can be stopped <italic>before</italic> they have wrought havoc upon the societies they threaten. Making this possible is contingent upon action. How can the emergency be brought to an end within a particular period or threshold of time before it is too late? This is a space-time of imminent danger in which action is demanded. It is an exceptional time, exceptional not in its suspension of the norms of existing law, but as a situation that breaks with the norm, requiring exceptional actions (although those actions may have been practised so that they have become habitual). Exercises propose to manufacture not only an emergency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0967010612438432">Bishop and Phillips, 2002</xref>), but also this ‘interval’. An exercise’s controllers and players may then inhabit the exercise in such a way that emergencies can be stopped, events ended or contained, and loss prevented.</p>
<p>Among their many purposes, exercises are about allowing players to inhabit the event or emergency that they will likely face. Exercises are thus primarily concerned with experiential knowledge, creating experiences from which players will learn and develop habits of action and thinking. They also do other things that draw upon the running or play of events, which might revolve around the testing of plans and capabilities, or analysis of an area of needed improvement. An exercise must seem real in order that a plausible event or experience may be constructed, which will encourage players to take the exercise seriously. We focus now on two main aspects of exercises, including how planners and designers seek to account for these experiences of inhabiting the exercise/event. First, we explore the design of the event-scenario, its relation to the narrative of the emergency and the difficulties involved in enrolling material threats for the purposes of a scenario. Second, we look at the way in which different technologies employed in order to anticipate and mediate the emergency immerse players within a supposedly ‘realistic’ experience that oscillates between distraction or boredom and overwhelming enthralment.</p>

<title>Writing events: Exercise design and the art of the scenario</title>
<p>Exercises are commonly discussed as large-scale national- or regional-type events that achieve media prominence. These exercises are usually spectacular, revolve around the anticipation of mass casualties and (usually) panic, and certainly involve a larger number of onlookers who are there to witness scripted events. We want to problematize this dominant rendering of the emergency exercise, especially within the context of UK Civil Contingencies and the difficulty of <italic>writing</italic> material and highly contingent scenarios. By considering the design of exercises under UK Civil Contingencies, we explore, first, how the usual description of exercises as large-scale events involving hundreds if not thousands of players, controllers and spectators in response to an event of apocalyptic proportions is actually quite far removed from the reality of an exercise; and, second, how the manner in which material events are enrolled – even imaginatively – into the design of a scenario is far less easy than might be assumed</p>
<p>As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0967010612438432">Schoch-Spana (2004</xref>: 8) writes in the context of the United States, ‘scenarios help substantiate the now widely accepted maxim in the US that “it is not a matter of if, but when” terrorists will carry out an assault on American soil involving “weapons of mass destruction”’. The apocalyptic imaginary that has pervaded emergency discourse since the Cold War (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0967010612438432">Ghamari-Tabrizi, 2005</xref>), usually involving the prediction of panicking and distressed civilians evacuating a city centre from a radiological attack, comes from a distinctive context of resilience planning that needs to be contextualized within the US context of preparedness, born to a certain degree from spheres of biosecurity and health protection as well as military dominance. Here, the preparedness exercise takes on the role of communicating knowledge and identifying weaknesses. Exercises demonstrate the gaps in response, the need for budget allocation, the legitimacy of federal vs state spending, and the support of particular research fields. As Lakoff has shown, the scenario-based exercise helped turn public health and disease risks into problems of national security. ‘What kind of experience could convey a sense of urgency and generate knowledge about necessary interventions?’, writes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0967010612438432">Lakoff (2008</xref>: 414), explaining the persuasiveness of the exercise to convince, to ‘authorize knowledge claims in the absence of actual events’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0967010612438432">Lakoff, 2008</xref>: 419).</p>
<p>In the UK, Civil Contingencies exercises do something a little bit different, and are more closely associated with developing ‘capabilities’, ‘testing’ plans and ‘training’ than with demonstration or public legitimacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0967010612438432">Cabinet Office, 2010a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0967010612438432">2009</xref>). While there have been multiple large-scale national exercises involving the coordination of agencies at local, regional and national levels (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0967010612438432">Aradau, 2010a</xref>), most exercises have tended to remain local and small-scale and organized around Local Resilience Forums (LRFs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0967010612438432">Cabinet Office, 2010b</xref>). This reflects the onus Civil Contingencies has placed upon local authorities and individual agencies to exercise their emergency plans: a statutory duty for the Category 1 responder and advisable for Category 2.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0967010612438432">7</xref></sup> Furthermore, it also reflects a more subtle aim for the exercise within the UK context. Exercises here will not <italic>only</italic> demonstrate capability or lack thereof, or simply play a reassurance role to influential statesmen or the wider public. Rather, as we have seen, exercises are led by distinctive and multiple aims. While US biosecurity preparedness may have been explored as a technique to promote the building of capacity into the system of preparedness, in our context the exercise is a <italic>key part</italic> or player in that capacity or capability-building.</p>
<p>That said, the more dramatic scenarios of Hollywoodized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0967010612438432">Dent, 2004</xref>) calamities have certainly been imagined and rehearsed under UK Civil Contingencies. However, the majority of exercise scenarios may well seem less dramatic, although that does not mean they are small-scale or any less disruptive. They are attuned to developing and testing the specific capabilities that plans have been constructed to use in relation to the assessment of risks. Political legitimacy is certainly part of this process, and the external communication of an exercise to the public and key policymakers is an aim of its own, but there are other priorities.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0967010612438432">8</xref></sup> The way events are designed into scenarios is very rarely about the imagining of the ‘unimaginable’ or ‘the unexpected’, or ‘unknown unknowns’ (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0967010612438432">Grusin, 2010</xref>), but definite – albeit complex – material events. Exercise planners explained how, when writing a scenario, they would usually draw upon existing or past events that had befallen their communities. They would use a set of well-known emergencies that had posed difficult and disruptive challenges in the past, or scenarios that had been previously constructed and exercised, although whether such an approach could be described as an off-the-shelf mode of scenario selection is debatable.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0967010612438432">9</xref></sup> How scenarios are chosen may well be influenced by a planner’s experience. What is common, however, is that scenarios are designed and selected to entail the rehearsal and involvement of multiple personnel, plans and capabilities. Scenarios lifted from other contexts will normally act as inspirations, as the chosen scenario will need grounding within the likely risks and characteristics of the local area to realistically simulate the unfolding of an event in that context. What is clear is that there are no founding principles, determinants or formulas for constructing and designing an exercise and scenario. Planners err and debate these issues continuously.</p>
<p>Some emergency plans are risk- or hazard-specific, while others deal with the capabilities likely to be invoked across multiple risks. Within the scenarios designed to test those plans are imaginary objects, things, people, materials – entangled and complex entities that are written into a relationship of irruptive threat and providential emergency response. Even at a design stage, these contingent elements of a scenario demand, push and are lively in ways that trouble the writing of the scenario itself. Take, for instance, the cascading effects of a major flood. Exercised within a UK city, a major-flood scenario saw a shopping centre in dire need of having its customers evacuated before it became impossible for them to leave. The city’s evacuation plan was subsequently activated. This was fine except that the scenario had also seen the flood cause a major industrial-site explosion that drew a noxious cloud over the top of the shopping centre, making evacuation impossible. The effects began to compound on top of one another:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>then at sort of one o’ clock in the morning the reservoir’s about to burst, which in itself is not a problem – we can evacuate it – but it’s going to take out all the electricity to [the city] for two weeks, and oh and by the way, if it happens, we just happen to be in the middle of a big data transfer and the computers – we have an option – do we shut the computers down and lose the data, or do we actually slow time the transfer and then on top of all that, you’ve got sort of gas canisters bouncing down the river hitting big gas pipes that run under all the bridges and bridges get washed away and, and, and, and....<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0967010612438432">10</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The interaction between different environmental and societal systems meant the exercise became potentially unmanageable for the players as it rumbled on and complex and consequential effects compounded, amplifying one another to raise the intensity and seriousness of the flooding in a manner that went beyond the aims of the exercise.</p>
<p>The nuances of a scenario such as this trouble the assumption that exercises are foregone conclusions, ‘controlled’ by their designers. The exercise scenario becomes something on the verge of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0967010612438432">Blanchot’s (1986</xref>) description of a ‘primal scene’, characterized by ‘ineffable, infinite, radical change’. There is a possibility that the scenario could very easily run away from the designers. This is not a scenario, then, as teleological representation of a pre-planned event, but rather a ‘scene’ that is always potentially going to take on a life of its own, ‘a faint gleam, an “almost” with the characteristics of “too much,” of excessiveness’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0967010612438432">Blanchot, 1986</xref>: 114), that sees designers commonly describing how events will overtake, overcome or overload the players and the planners unless they are carefully thought through at the design stage or managed responsively by exercise umpires. In this sense, a scenario has a momentum or inertia that could become unstoppable and unproductive.</p>
<p>What is at stake here is not the wider and very visible scale we see in other examples of exercise scenarios but the intensity, complexity and potential circulation of the event that will ask some very difficult questions of the responders tasked with dealing with the emergency, potentially escalating beyond their abilities or training, or beyond the capabilities of the exercise planners to anticipate the materialization of the scenario into complex, contingent and material events. Indeed, this is a main emphasis within Civil Contingencies planning, that a network of responders must be able to suppress an emergency that surges across interlinked societal systems and connectivities.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0967010612438432">11</xref></sup> Planning a scenario that can exercise this potential is then very useful for rehearsing the relevant capabilities and the planned responses to these sorts of events, but it must be tailored in the right way and in relation to the levels of response that the planners want to exercise, from the strategic to the operational.</p>
<p>Designing a scenario, then, is less a process of authoritative writing or inscribing predictable outcomes upon a blank page, and more a tentative testing and feeling, a materialization of a narrative into plausible and contingent events and consequences that the planners must work through in the way that the players will. This means that designers may ‘go down the road of “we’ll take this scenario” and then half way through it, realise it’s not going to work. So we will backtrack and go and choose something new’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0967010612438432">12</xref></sup> The learning outcomes of a scenario often have to be worked through entirely before they can be known. But, how then to design a scenario that will not be too much or too little? A scenario might push players beyond their capability and simply stretch the scenario beyond the players who can actually be available on the day. It might pose a danger in removing player interest in the event, because it exhausts itself early, failing to challenge players enough. Planners consider the kinds of personnel available to them when designing an exercise; therefore, the writing of the scenario will usually fulfil quite pragmatic functions.</p>
<p>While some exercises prove difficult to design given the need to devise certain scenarios to meet particular training needs – especially for inexperienced personnel – in other instances particular threats are used quite regularly because they contain certain threatening materialities that enable the exercising of capabilities across numerous plans, players and agencies. Toxic clouds and other atmospheric or ‘weather events’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0967010612438432">Massumi, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0967010612438432">Adey et al., 2011</xref>) are notable commonly rehearsed eventualities because of their turbulent properties, amorphous shape and characteristics that penetrate numerous systems, disrespecting jurisdictional boundaries and efforts to marshal their movements. An unpredictable threat redolent of a Don DeLillo novel and as pragmatic as the breeze that suspends and directs it, a toxic cloud may challenge multiple responders and agencies at the same time. Its toxic materials might frighten and worry populations, just as it can easily switch modalities from airborne threat to water-suspended molecules leaching into the water supply. Other more turbulent renderings of atmospheric scenarios see weather events as ‘stand-ins’ for a more sentient threat. Despite the improbability of a tornado scenario even after the Birmingham tornado of 2005, tornados do not attract the same degree of publicity and public nervousness as rehearsing a ‘terrorist’ event might do, yet they can emulate recognizably similar effects of an explosion, even touching down on multiple sites.</p>

<title>Materials and mediations</title>
<p>The information that helps players know and ultimately take hold of an event subjects those players to what, in the context of the anticipatory models of climate change, Kathryn <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0967010612438432">Yusoff (2010</xref>: 1021) describes as a ‘landslide of immensity’, a fluvial thought of matter-emotion wherein the images, visualizations and representations of the event begin to lose their clarity and exceed comprehension or meaning. Within an exercise, this may easily correlate with the exercised event, the disaster that in Blanchot’s terms can never be experienced, but only felt through incomprehension and the failure to act in the face of the ‘too much’. This is not necessarily, however, about too much loss of life, catastrophic damage, the trauma or pain that the preparedness apparatus translates into rational measures of risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0967010612438432">De Goede and Randalls, 2009</xref>) and that the exercise subsequently brings to life. Might this also correspond to the mountain of information, imagery, representational stuff and materials that can deliver a ‘mathematical sublime’ that players have to continuously try to make sense of? The issue here is how players deal with knowledge of the disaster, through graphs and overlays, satellite information, PowerPoint presentations and news reports, and whether the knowledge of the disaster or emergency becomes instead knowledge ‘as disaster’, knowledge that ‘disastrously’ ‘carries us, carries us off, deports us ... straight to ignorance’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0967010612438432">Blanchot, 1986</xref>: 3).</p>
<p>As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0967010612438432">Kathleen Woodward (2009</xref>: 219) explains in the context of modern bureaucracies, the ‘shocking’ technologies of statistics and the visual, rational and calculative technologies of emergency can easily oscillate between panic and boredom, experiences that are both ‘unnerving and numbing’. Overwhelmed by the excess of representations, pictures and graphs – whose meaning implodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0967010612438432">Baudrillard, 1983</xref>) – exercise players are easily turned blasé and distracted. The pressures of performance can bear witness to inattentiveness, as players retreat into apathetic interest in the details of monotonous planning documents and the plethora of flood-radius charts or population demographic maps. The fear of many planners in this situation is whether players will inadvertently turn inward and retreat to their ‘silos’, working within their ‘comfort zones’, escaping critical decisionmaking and deliberation by very actively doing nothing with plans, inattentive to the course of events. Documents become defensive barriers between players, the event and other players. Another alternative to the avalanche to information is distraction, wrought by the technological presentation that promises to enable ‘situational awareness’ or a common informational picture of an omnipresent and desiring ‘god’s eye view’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0967010612438432">Puar, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0967010612438432">Haraway, 1991</xref>): PowerPoint and visual imagery proliferate to such an excess that they lose meaning.</p>
<p>In the face of such proliferation, exercise materials are used in order to enliven and agitate. News media are routinely used to reignite interest in the exercise by rehearsing the event’s intensified presence not simply as seductive or distracting but as a gatherer of attention. Here, player boredom becomes punctuated by excitement:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>to generate a bit of excitement is important.... Everyone comes back from [lunch] and says, ‘oh here we go again, another three hours’. And, suddenly, bam! A telly comes on and bam! Here is the scenario! An update on what it is. And they find that that wakes them up a bit and they try to put a little funny at the end, you know, just – not a silly bit – but something that’s a surprise, you know, like, ‘don’t forget, tonight Big Brother has been cancelled because of this gas’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0967010612438432">13</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The designers of these reports work carefully to build news media that feel realistic and are structured and articulated in such a way that they give the most optimum delivery and the most effective affect. As the respondent suggested: ‘I think it’s better to have flashy moving images and bang, bang, bang like Sky [News or BBC] 24’. Giving the punctual, slick and moving effect of a news broadcast can make an inject realistic; it can drive attentiveness and interest in the process, as well as communicate important information to the players. These surprises appear integral to an exercise’s play and narrative, as television and media reports are used as injects to drive a scenario forward, input new information, or describe subtle and sometimes major changes to the dynamics of the emergency.</p>
<p>While the very activities of media materialities and visualities might add impetus and direction to players, the objects of the emergency and the status of knowledge about those objects can also confuse and easily disorientate. Take a tabletop exercise that rehearsed the response to a plane crash. Having broken up on impact, the aircraft spilled depleted uranium, a radioactive material that is commonly used as ballast or as a counterweight within an aircraft’s tailwing. A strategic coordinating group tasked with the command and control of the emergency set about identifying the risks the crash put at stake, which meant identifying the likely objects of cargo that the plane may have dropped and the threat the radioactive ballast posed to the environment and the health of the population. Both cargo and ballast soon blurred with one another, and knowledge over the materials and their threat became increasingly complex.</p>
<p>First, the ballast had to be made known through a process that saw the players question the realism of the scenario until they realized it rehearsed an actual plane crash some years earlier in the south of England. Once the ballast was fully known, the status of the objects as risky or dangerous required decisions to be made over what sort of warning the group were to make to the public, which they were concerned could lead to panic and unnecessary worrying over the consequences of exposure to the ballast. While the uranium might not be dangerous in its immediate state, there were concerns over whether – with rain – it might leach into the soil and the water supply. The players’ concerns, however, were not only for the likely effect of fluvial actions and hydraulic processes, but also for the affective intensities that could animate the population as ‘an absolute disruption which admits no regimen, region, regulation, direction, erection, insurrection’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0967010612438432">Blanchot, 1986</xref>: 56). The very ‘vital vibrancy’ of the plane’s content, should the identity of the ballast be made known to the public, was articulated through speculation over difficult consequences. The group decided to withhold some of the details for fear of making the situation worse.</p>
<p>At the same time as the group were establishing the relative dangers of the material’s radioactive decay, they were also seeking information on the plane’s cargo manifest. Did the plane contain any further hazardous objects? An inject then came in to suggest that a piece of cargo had been identified by a member of the public, and the media were requesting statements and interviews. The relevant item of cargo had radioactive warning stickers on it, and the member of the public wanted to know what was going on. Concluding that the aircraft must have contained dangerous materials, some of the group’s members then began deliberation over the expansion of the inner cordon of the crash zone and the forthcoming press conference in which they would have to take part.</p>
<p>Yet, there was no hazardous cargo. The identity of the object had been indicated and solidified by an inject of news whose source had not been verified, and it was the actions of the team that subsequently confirmed the materialization of the cargo as hazardous. Herein lies the danger within the network of emergency response. During the exercise debriefing, it was pointed out to the players how their actions not only stabilized the identity and characteristics of the objects that had been supposedly found by the public, but actively brought them to life. This dimension also brought with it the strongest criticism of the exercise, the scenario and the team running the event. The press officer present at the event accused the exercise planners of attempting to divert the players with a fiction, an unlikely occurrence that was mischievous, even unfair. It is diversions of this type that can easily destabilize an exercise, or this is something that planners will try – for a short time at least – to throw exercise players off course. However, the press officer also warned of something else. In the terms of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0967010612438432">Blanchot’s (1986</xref>: 77) sceptical gaiety, which ‘makes seriousness (the seriousness of death for example) pass beyond all seriousness’, the press spokesperson would come to question whether a scenario could ever be taken as real. Exercises are often described in terms of their creation of a safe and trusting player environment, but what if the scenario cannot be trusted? The planners had threatened participants’ trust in more than just the identity of the object; they had threatened their trust in the seriousness of the exercise itself.</p>

<title>Conclusion: Towards a materialism of security</title>
<p>Exercises vary and comprise but one part or element within apparatuses of security that are themselves only temporarily stabilized. Their meaning, use and function will differ as they are assembled alongside risk registers, probabilistic models and the other techniques whereby futures achieve presence. While this is a simple point, it has a number of implications. We should therefore be careful about extracting actual exercises or the exercise as a technique from their societal, institutional and organizational contexts – to erroneously see them as exemplars of broader logics or rationalities. We should also be cautious about understanding exercises – or for that matter any anticipatory technique – as involving a specific relation with the future over others (whether that be framed in terms of premediation, prediction or some other relation). If exercises are themselves various and always articulated with other techniques, logics and rationalities, then they will express different relations to the future and different ways of presencing and absenting futures. In seeking to understand how life is governed in and through contingency, we should take care to remember the contingencies of the apparatus of security – that is, how apparatuses form, endure and change as the elements that compose them are (re)deployed. Failing to do this could mean that analyses of security risk assuming the efficacy of techniques and believing in the power of forms of power. This directs our focus on the <italic>life</italic> of apparatuses to the scenarios that are badly designed; to the moments of boredom, distraction or indifference that change player relations; to the exercise play that overwhelms and cannot be recuperated into the development of new capabilities; and to the technologies of risk calculation that sit alongside with and interact inside the apparatus. Our emphasis on the life of security leads to two wider concluding points that turn us back to the question of how materiality is thought in security studies.</p>
<p>First, to consider the life of security apparatuses is to consider the life of the materials that compose those apparatuses: bits of paper, imaginary barrels of chemicals, television images of a fake disaster – to name some of those encountered in this article. In the midst of these materials, we find that apparatuses are not only reworked in relation to a strategic elaboration and re-elaboration in relation to various problems. They are also reworked through materials that may be recalcitrant, through materials that may act in ways that exceed intentions, or through materials that are redundant or discarded. To be clear, we are not finding in materiality a mythical resistance to power. What we would stress is something different and more modest: that holding together an apparatus is work, and that more attention needs to be paid to the way in which apparatuses of security fall apart, fail, are disrupted, or are held together by very specific and careful consideration of what these material and contingent relations mean.</p>
<p>Second, the materials of security should not be equated with a realm of co-present physical objects always already available to be enrolled for this or that use or purpose. Far from it. Materiality itself is various. The materials that populate security apparatuses stretch from the paper a scenario might be written on to the ambiguous, amorphous, affective atmospheres that animate the site of exercises. They also include things that might appear to hover on the border between the material and immaterial. Think, for example, of the life of data as they circulate through networks of preparedness, or the force with which an image might strike and then move an audience. A thorough materialism of security might learn to attend not only to the excess of matter – the ways in which materials exceed their assembling or <italic>writing</italic> into apparatuses – but also to a stranger sense of materiality as taking place with multiple properties and capacities. To put it differently: in addition to understanding how life is now governed in and through its materiality (through, for example, critical infrastructure), it is also vital to understand apparatuses of security as material compositions populated by things with different powers of expression and action. To do so is to attend to the life of apparatuses of security while, at the same time, showing how life – and in our case the turbulent life of events – is security’s referent object.</p>

<p>‘UK Civil Contingencies’ emerged out of experiences related to a range of emergencies during the period 1989–2001, including flooding and fuel protests in 2000 and an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in 2001. The 2004 legislation resulted in a system of planning and response to emergencies, organized around hierarchical networks of separate organizations that will come together at the onset of an event to prevent it from becoming a disaster. In what follows, we will consider this system as a kind of apparatus.</p></fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn2-0967010612438432">
<label>2</label>
<p>This article builds on a two-and-a-half-year research project in the course of which a series of nationwide interviews were conducted with emergency planners from different levels of national, regional and local government and associated agencies and responders. The project investigators also conducted in-depth ethnographic observation of exercises that ranged from the table top to live action, from scenarios that varied from testing humanitarian assistance plans at a nearby hospital, to a major Chemical Biological and Radioactive Nuclear (CBRN) event, to a nationwide flood scenario. The project continued to focus on the spaces through which resilience is performed, from workshops and conferences to expositions and trade shows.</p></fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn3-0967010612438432">
<label>3</label>
<p>Within this context, and post the 2004 Civil Contingencies Act that set obligations to exercise under the statutory duties of multiple agencies, resilience has gained purchase as a catch-all term, moving beyond just emergency planning and counter-terrorism strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0967010612438432">Coaffee et al., 2008</xref>: 115) to improving ‘security, respect, safety and quality of life in the community’.</p></fn>

<p>As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0967010612438432">Collier (2008</xref>: 244–5) explains, he refers to ‘“enactment” rather than some obvious alternatives such as modelling or simulation for three reasons: first, because experts often refer to “models” (hazard models, for example) as sub-components of an enactment; second, because enactment may take forms such as exercises that do not seem adequately described as simulations or models; third, because these terms (especially simulation) already carry substantial associations in critical social science discussions, whereas enactment does not’.</p></fn>

<p>Vitalist philosophies have achieved a certain predominance in the concerns of human geographers attuned to the project of what has been called ‘non-representational theories’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0967010612438432">Anderson and Harrison, 2010</xref>), although they are not without critique and we would be careful not to overstate the material ‘vibrancy’ of the encounters we describe. Mindful of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0967010612438432">Paul Harrison’s (2008)</xref> illustration of the seeming presupposition of an energetic and active body and materiality, exemplified as the ‘vitalist trap’ by Nietzsche, we must also account for corporeal vulnerability, susceptibility and the rupture of agency. Again, writes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0967010612438432">Harrison (2008</xref>: 104), certain aspects of corporeal existence that would appear to be intrinsic to living-on – such as sleep, rest, recovery and the implicit admission of susceptibility they enact – are rendered anachronistic, with the consequence that ‘manifestations of vital somatic life, of its ascending tendency’ are taken to ‘preclude fatigue and exhaustion’.</p></fn>

<p>At the time of writing, Category 1 responders include local authorities in England, Wales and Scotland, emergency services, fire and rescue authorities, health authorities within Britain, the Environment Agency and the Maritime and Coastal Agency. Category 1 responders have a set of statutory duties under the Act. Category 2 responders are conferred with duties to cooperate with and provide information to Category 1 responders. This list is more open. Category 2 responders cut across the public and private sectors and include utilities, transport bodies (e.g. Transport for London), and health bodies such as the Health and Safety Executive.</p></fn>

<p>Most of the exercises we observed would feature some kind of press statement or write-up after the event in order to announce the presence of the exercise through some variant of awareness-raising.</p></fn>

<p>Some exercise reports, debriefs and lessons are publicly available from the Cabinet Office’s Civil Contingencies Secretariat Public Website.
