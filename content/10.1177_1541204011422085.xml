<abstract>
<p>Objective. There is growing recognition that antisocial behaviors are produced by a combination of environmental and genetic factors. Research has revealed that environmental and genetic factors work interactively and often moderate the effects of the other. Method. We test for gene–environment interactions in the current study by examining whether neighborhood disadvantage interacts with two dopamine receptor genes (<italic>DRD2</italic> and <italic>DRD4</italic>) to predict three different antisocial measures: adolescent victimization, contact with delinquent peers, and involvement in violent delinquency. Results. Analysis of male respondents drawn from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health revealed that the association between the two dopamine genes and the measures of antisocial outcomes tended to be stronger in disadvantaged neighborhoods. Conclusions. Antisocial outcomes appear to be affected by gene–environment interactions between dopaminergic genes and neighborhood disadvantage.</p>

<title>Genetics and the Social Sciences</title>
<p>During the past several decades, a rapidly growing number of studies have shown that genes matter in shaping individual differences in behavior and personality traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1541204011422085">Moffitt, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1541204011422085">Rutter, 2006</xref>). Indeed, an overwhelming amount of empirical research points to the very real possibility that virtually every trait and behavior are under some level of genetic influence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1541204011422085">Plomin, DeFries, McClearn, &amp; McGuffin, 2008</xref>). Findings that have led researchers to this conclusion are generated from thousands of scientific investigations from various countries and samples. These studies have used diverse research methodologies, ranging from heritability studies of twins, siblings, and family members to genotype studies that involve specific genetic polymorphisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1541204011422085">Beaver, 2009</xref>). In short, the results flowing from this line of research are robust, consistent, and unlikely to be explained away as a methodological or statistical artifact.</p>
<p>Historically, social science research has had a tendency to either ignore or reject the evidence that genes matter in understanding human phenotypes, especially antisocial behaviors and traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1541204011422085">Beaver, 2009</xref>). This approach has often resulted in a partition between environmental and genetic risk factors that has restricted our understanding of how social contexts influence biological processes that contribute to human differences. Fortunately, social scientists are becoming increasingly more interested in the various ways that genes and environments interlock to produce human variation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1541204011422085">Bearman, 2008</xref>). Nowhere is this more evident than in the research testing for gene–environment interactions. Gene–environment interactions are grounded in the logic that environmental factors moderate the effects of genes and that genetic factors moderate the effects of the environment. In this way, gene–environment interactions break down the separation of nature competing against nurture and instead highlight their interdependence in the etiology of behaviors and personality traits, including antisocial phenotypes.</p>
<p>To date, a number of genes related to neurotransmission have been associated with antisocial behaviors, antisocial traits, and psychological conditions, but the environments that may moderate the effects of these genes are still largely unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1541204011422085">Moffitt, Caspi, &amp; Rutter, 2006</xref>). While we agree with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1541204011422085">Shanahan and Hofer (2005)</xref> that no single theory of context is applicable to all gene–environment interactions, the neighborhood context in which children and adolescents live may be one particularly important context for gene–environment research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1541204011422085">Hart &amp; Marmorstein, 2009</xref>). Criminological theories of how structural and social aspects of neighborhoods influence criminal behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1541204011422085">Edwards, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1541204011422085">Leventhal &amp; Brooks-Gunn, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1541204011422085">Wikström &amp; Sampson, 2003</xref>) are consistent with two social–contextual typologies (i.e., contextual triggering and social context as a social control) used to explain how genes are expressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1541204011422085">Shanahan &amp; Hofer, 2005</xref>). As will be discussed, these typologies are consistent with research on how neighborhood conditions can affect human development.</p>
<p>One difficulty in examining gene–environment interactions, however, is determining which specific genes may interact with which specific environments. For two main reasons, we examine whether alleles (i.e., alternative copies of genes) of two genetic polymorphisms of the dopaminergenic system (i.e., <italic>DRD2 and DRD4</italic>) are moderated by neighborhood context in the prediction of antisocial outcomes. First, prior research has revealed that certain dopaminergic genes are associated with a number of antisocial behaviors, including delinquency ( Guo, Roettger, &amp; Shih, 2007a; Guo, Wilhelmsen, &amp; Hamilton, 2007b). Second, there is some research indicating that dopaminergic genes are moderated by environmental factors found within the family and within the school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1541204011422085">Guo, Roettger, &amp; Cai, 2008</xref>). Against this backdrop, it seems likely that the effects dopaminergic genes have on antisocial outcomes will be partially due to the presence of certain environments. Still, research has yet to examine whether neighborhood social conditions trigger the effects of dopaminergic genes on antisocial behaviors. Realizing that gene–environment investigations are a relatively new domain of inquiry in the social sciences, we begin by explaining a number of concepts and processes related to gene–environment research. We then explain some possible theoretical mechanisms that link neighborhoods to the moderation of genetic effects on antisocial outcomes.</p>

<title>A Primer on Genetic Expression and Gene–Environment Interactions</title>
<p>Briefly, a gene is a sequence of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) that works together to code for the production of proteins. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1541204011422085">Champagne and Mashoodh (2009)</xref>, DNA can be thought of as a library of books and/or periodicals that are arranged methodically in an unambiguous order. Books and periodicals, which contain endless amounts of information, are sitting on shelves waiting to be read and once read can lead to various consequences. Like books and periodicals, DNA is housed in the cells of our bodies and waits to be read, although not by people. DNA is read by enzymes known as ribonucleic acid (RNA) polymerase, which results in the construction of messenger RNA (mRNA) also known as transcription. Simply stated, mRNA is a copy of a gene, or DNA sequence, which can be converted into a protein. The translation of DNA into protein is how a gene is expressed. Like the information contained in books and periodicals, reading of DNA can have countless consequences, one such consequence is that it can increase the likelihood that antisocial outcomes will occur. Among other things, including biological cell-related environments, a social context can trigger or even inhibit this process.</p>
<p>With the mapping of the human genome complete in 2003, researchers have been provided with a great deal of information about specific genes that might be implicated in the etiology of human development. Genes that are involved in neurotransmission—that is, they aid in the production, transportation, and breakdown of neurotransmitters—have been identified as having particular importance to the study of crime and delinquency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1541204011422085">Morley &amp; Hall, 2003</xref>). For example, genes of the dopaminergic and serotonergic systems have been linked to an array of antisocial phenotypes, including alcoholism, violence, aggression, conduct disorder, delinquency, and victimization, among others (for an overview see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1541204011422085">Beaver, 2009</xref>). It should be pointed out, however, that follow-up studies often fail to replicate the results garnered from the original report and the magnitude of the genetic effect also varies across studies.</p>
<p>Although a number of reasons have been offered for why genetic effects wax and wane from study to study, one of the more dominant explanations is that genetic influences may be modified by certain environmental factors. If this is the case, then the genetic effect may only be detectable when it is paired with particular environments. Given that study samples are often differentially exposed to environmental factors, it is possible that the reason genetic effects vary from study to study is because of this differential exposure.</p>
<p>There is an expanding line of research testing directly for gene–environment interactions in the manifestation of antisocial behaviors. Results from these studies have been relatively consistent in showing that gene–environment interactions are important to a range of criminal and delinquent outcomes. Perhaps the most noteworthy gene–environment interaction in the prediction of antisocial behaviors was found in the study carried out by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1541204011422085">Caspi et al. (2002)</xref>, who examined the effect of childhood maltreatment on later life behavioral problems. Caspi et al. hypothesized that childhood maltreatment would only lead to antisocial conduct among persons who also had genetic risk (as measured by the low-activity allele of the monoamine oxidase A [<italic>MAOA</italic>] gene)—that is, they anticipated a gene–environment interaction between childhood maltreatment and <italic>MAOA</italic> in the prediction of antisocial behaviors. Their analysis of male subjects from the Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study revealed that males who had been maltreated and who also possessed the low-activity <italic>MAOA</italic> allele were at risk of displaying a range of antisocial behaviors and violent tendencies. The <italic>MAOA</italic> gene, however, had no effect on antisocial phenotypes among males who had not been maltreated as a child.</p>

<title>Moderation of Genetic Effects by Social Contexts</title>
<p>Although <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1541204011422085">Caspi et al.’s (2002)</xref> study drew attention to the role of the environment in moderating genetic effects on antisocial behaviors, this study only examined one potential moderating environment: childhood maltreatment. Importantly, social contexts that may moderate genetic effects on antisocial outcomes may come from a collage of other sociological, criminological, and psychological factors that target various units of analysis. For instance, environmental factors could be family contexts where maltreatment may occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1541204011422085">Caspi et al., 2003</xref>), but they could also include peer contexts where friends influence each other in various ways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1541204011422085">Beaver et al., 2007</xref>) or contexts where social control or a lack of control is present at the individual, family, or community levels.</p>
<p>Regardless of specific theories, a number of typologies have been developed that may provide insights into the social contexts that make it more probable for genetic effects to surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1541204011422085">Shanahan &amp; Hofer, 2005</xref>). At least two of these typologies are relevant for understanding how neighborhoods may moderate the effects of genetic polymorphisms on antisocial and violent behaviors. These typologies have been labeled by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1541204011422085">Shanahan and Hofer (2005)</xref> as contextual triggering and social context as a social control. First, contextual triggering suggests that social contexts may trigger a variety of genetic predispositions through stressful conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1541204011422085">Rende &amp; Plomin, 1992</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1541204011422085">Caspi et al.’s (2002)</xref> study is one example of a gene–environment interaction, where a specific stressful environment and genotype were measured. Without the presence of the stressful environmental condition (i.e., severe child maltreatment), the genetic predisposition for antisocial behavior never materialized. Similar results were also reported in another study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1541204011422085">Caspi et al. (2003)</xref>, where they reported that a polymorphism in a serotonin transporter gene had effects on depression but only among respondents who were exposed to stressful life events.</p>
<p>Second, social control is another typology for understanding how social context may influence gene–environment interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1541204011422085">Shanahan &amp; Hofer, 2005</xref>). Social control refers to any structure or process that assists in the continuance of social order and cohesion via relationships with social institutions and persons. The presence of social control may prevent the effect of a particular genetic polymorphism from surfacing. For instance, there could be many adolescents residing in an environment where social control is elevated and these adolescents could vary on their genetic predispositions. Some of them may have risk alleles for a specific genotype that is known to be related to violence. However, a context of high social control prevents the risk alleles from being expressed. When the environment has a lack of social control, the opposite is possible; that is, adolescents with genetic predispositions become more likely than those without to show gene expressions. In sum, high levels of social control can “canalize” genetically dissimilar people, meaning that the potential phenotypic variability associated with genetically different people will be constrained.</p>
<p>A number of twin studies lend support for the social control typology. Generally, these studies show that under conditions of low social control, the heritability coefficient increases, but under conditions of high social control, the heritability coefficient decreases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1541204011422085">Boomsma, de Geus, van Baal, &amp; Koopmans, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1541204011422085">Koopmans, Slutske, van Baal, &amp; Boomsma, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1541204011422085">Rose, Dick, Viken, &amp; Kaprio, 2001</xref>). In these studies, genetic effects are inferred through the concordance of twins’ behaviors under environments that vary in levels of social control. A limited number of studies have investigated gene–environment interactions, where specific genotyped polymorphisms and social contexts known as a form of social control are assessed. One study that has direct application to this issue was conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1541204011422085">Beaver, Gibson, Jennings, and Ward (2009b)</xref>. They analyzed the Add Health data to examine the interaction between religiosity and a polymorphism in the <italic>DRD2</italic> gene. Religiosity has often been considered a form of social control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1541204011422085">Udry, 1988</xref>) because through religious connectedness individuals often tend to internalize norms that discourage antisocial behaviors. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1541204011422085">Beaver and colleagues (2009b)</xref> found that the effects of <italic>DRD2</italic> on violence and serious delinquency were relatively small when religiosity was high, but the effects of <italic>DRD2</italic> were strong when religiosity was weak.</p>
<p>One area of neighborhood research receiving recent attention is how neighborhood contextual factors influence children and adolescents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1541204011422085">Leventhal &amp; Brooks-Gunn, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1541204011422085">Sampson, Morenoff, &amp; Gannon-Rowley, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1541204011422085">Wikström &amp; Sampson, 2003</xref>). Adolescents residing in structurally disadvantaged neighborhoods defined by extreme poverty, inequality, and segregation are at risk of a host of negative outcomes that include antisocial traits and behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1541204011422085">Edwards, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1541204011422085">Pratt, Turner, &amp; Piquero, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1541204011422085">Wikström &amp; Sampson, 2003</xref>). Such adolescents are at increased risk of dropping out of school, for academic underachievement, for decreased verbal ability, and for many other problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1541204011422085">Leventhal &amp; Brooks-Gunn, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1541204011422085">2003</xref>). Disadvantaged neighborhoods linked to negative outcomes for children are also environmental, contextual candidates for understanding how genes, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1541204011422085">Shanahan and Hofer (2005)</xref>, can serve as contextual triggers and social control agents.</p>
<p>Extremely disadvantaged neighborhoods can produce stress for neighborhood residents, including adolescents, due to the disorder and violence often associated with them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1541204011422085">Ross &amp; Mirowsky, 2009</xref>). Several studies have shown that psychological distress is related to neighborhood disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1541204011422085">Hill, Ross, &amp; Angel, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1541204011422085">Latkin &amp; Curry, 2003</xref>) and neighborhoods that are disadvantaged often have more disorder than those that are not. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1541204011422085">Ross and Mirowsky (2009)</xref> argue that living in such threatening, noxious, and dangerous contexts may lead individuals to experience negative affective states such as anxiety, depression, and anger. Residents may experience such distress because conditions related to disadvantaged neighborhoods indicate the potential for dangerous encounters and exposure to threat. Furthermore, such neighborhoods may promote a view of mistrust, that social control does not exist, and that there is a general sense of community chaos.</p>
<p>Structurally disadvantaged neighborhoods often lack social control and cohesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1541204011422085">Sampson, Raudenbush, &amp; Earls, 1997</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1541204011422085">Leventhal and Brooks-Gunn (2003)</xref> discuss ways in which neighborhood structural conditions may influence child and adolescent outcomes. Although they did not discuss how neighborhood contexts moderate genetic effects, one particular pathway they did discuss is highly consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1541204011422085">Shanahan and Hofer’s (2005)</xref> notion of social context as a social control: the collective efficacy model of socialization. This model suggests that structural conditions of neighborhoods influence children and adolescents through informal social control mechanisms, especially the degree to which residents monitor and supervise adolescents’ behavior in a way consistent with socially endorsed practices. The collective efficacy model of socialization originates from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1541204011422085">Sampson, Raudenbush, and Earls’s (1997)</xref> research on violence and crime in Chicago neighborhoods. They defined collective efficacy as social cohesion among neighbors combined with their willingness to intervene for the common good of the neighborhood. Sampson and colleagues found that while neighborhood concentrated disadvantage is related to violence, this relationship was mediated by levels of neighborhood collective efficacy.</p>
<p>Most recently, this model has been theoretically linked to adolescents’ antisocial propensities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1541204011422085">Wikström &amp; Sampson, 2003</xref>) and has garnered empirical attention within criminology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1541204011422085">Pratt et al., 2004</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1541204011422085">Wikström and Sampson (2003)</xref> suggest that adolescents who are exposed to behavioral settings that encourage the development of antisocial propensities will be more likely to reside in neighborhoods that possess lower levels of collective efficacy. They argue that these behavioral settings provide less support, monitoring, and oversight for adolescents outside the home. While mixed support has been found for this claim (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1541204011422085">Gibson, Sullivan, Jones, &amp; Piquero, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1541204011422085">Pratt et al., 2004</xref>), Wikström and Sampson also mention that the effects of antisocial propensities on criminal and antisocial behavioral involvement may be moderated by a lack of informal social controls and cohesion. Although they do not mention genetics, their argument is consistent with the idea of social context as a social control typology to explain gene–environment interactions.</p>

<title>The Current Study</title>
<p>In the preceding discussion, two models were provided as to how neighborhood conditions can serve as social contexts to moderate genetic effects on antisocial behaviors. While both these models are plausible, only a limited amount of research has been conducted examining these models. We address this gap in the current study by examining the interrelationships among two dopaminergic genes (i.e., <italic>DRD2</italic> and <italic>DRD4</italic>), a measure of neighborhood disadvantage, and three antisocial outcomes: victimization, exposure to delinquent peers, and involvement in violent delinquency. Drawing upon both the neighborhood and genetic literatures, we hypothesize that neighborhood context will moderate the effect of <italic>DRD2</italic> and <italic>DRD4</italic> on the antisocial outcomes, where the genes will only have effects for respondents who are residing in disadvantaged neighborhoods.</p>

<title>Data</title>
<p>This study uses data drawn from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1541204011422085">Udry, 2003</xref>). The Add Health is a prospective, nationally representative sample of youths enrolled in 7th through 12th grade during the 1994–1995 academic school year. Initially, more than 90,000 students who were enrolled in middle and high schools completed self-report surveys during regular school hours (i.e., the Wave 1 in-school survey). To gain more detailed information about some of the adolescents, a subsample of youths, along with their primary caregivers (usually their mother), were interviewed again at their home (i.e., the Wave 1 in-home survey). Respondents were asked a wide range of questions about their home life, their social relationships, their involvement in risky behaviors, and a host of other topics relevant to adolescents. Altogether, 20,745 adolescents and 17,700 of their primary caregivers participated in the Wave 1 in-home component of the Add Health study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1541204011422085">Harris et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>About a year to two years later, participants of the Wave 1 in-home survey were reinterviewed (i.e., the Wave 2 survey). Given that relatively little time had lapsed between waves, most of the respondents were still adolescents. As a result, the questions asked during Wave 1 interviews were still applicable and thus the items contained in the Wave 2 instruments were very similar to those on the Wave 1 surveys. For example, adolescents were asked about their peer relationships, their experiences at school, and about their family functioning. Overall, 14,738 youths were successfully interviewed at Wave 2. Then, between 2001 and 2002, the third wave of data was collected. Most of the respondents were young adults during Wave 3 interviews, and thus, the questions asked during the previous two waves were not age appropriate. The Wave 3 survey instruments were redesigned to include items that were related to young adults. For instance, at Wave 3, respondents were asked about their marital status, their educational achievements, and their childbearing history, among others. In total, 15,197 respondents were successfully reinterviewed at Wave 3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1541204011422085">Harris et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Unlike most other large, nationally representative samples, the Add Health data also collected genotypic information from a subsample of respondents. Respondents who had a sibling who was also participating in the Add Health study were recruited to submit samples of their DNA (from buccal cells) to be genotyped for a number of genetic polymorphisms. Overall, 2,574 respondents were included in the DNA subsample, making the Add Health one of the largest samples in the world to include genotypic, phenotypic, and environmental measures.</p>

<title>Neighborhood disadvantage</title>
<p>To examine the effect of neighborhood characteristics on antisocial outcomes, we employed measures drawn from Add Health’s Wave 1 contextual data file (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1541204011422085">Billy, Wenzlow, &amp; Grady, 1998</xref>). More specifically, Add Health researchers collected information at the county, tract, and block level of analysis using data from the 1990 Census. We opted to use data from the block level because this is the smallest aggregate-level unit available in the Add Health. On average, there are approximately four to five blocks within each census tract and each block includes about 1,100 residents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1541204011422085">Cleveland, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Similar to prior Add Health research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1541204011422085">Cleveland, 2003</xref>), we constructed a neighborhood disadvantage scale using five different block-level items: (a) the proportion of households that were single-parent headed (factor loading = .85), (b) the proportion of households with an income &lt;US$15,000 (factor loading = .82), (c) the proportion of households receiving public assistance (factor loading = .88), (d) the proportion Black (factor loading = .70), and (e) the unemployment rate (factor loading = .82). These five items were then subjected to a factor analysis and the factor loadings for each of the measures are listed above. Given that they all loaded on a single factor, we followed the lead of neighborhood researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1541204011422085">Cleveland, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1541204011422085">Sampson et al., 1997</xref>) and created a weighted factor scale called neighborhood disadvantage. Higher values on this scale indicate greater levels of neighborhood disadvantage. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1541204011422085">Table 1</xref>

<title>Dopamine D2 receptor gene</title>
<p>The dopamine D2 receptor (<italic>DRD2</italic>) gene is located on chromosome 11. The Add Health researchers genotyped respondents for a polymorphism that arises from a point mutation which produces two alleles: the <italic>A1</italic> allele and the <italic>A2</italic> allele. Some research has revealed that the <italic>A1</italic> allele is associated with certain antisocial phenotypes. For instance, the <italic>A1</italic> allele has been linked to adolescent victimization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1541204011422085">Beaver et al., 2007</xref>), alcoholism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1541204011422085">Connor, Young, Lawford, Ritchie, &amp; Noble, 2002</xref>), pathological gambling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1541204011422085">Comings et al., 2001</xref>), and violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1541204011422085">Guo, Roettger, and Shih, 2007</xref>). This polymorphism was coded codominantly, where the value on this variable indicates the number of <italic>A1</italic> alleles that each respondent possesses.</p>

<sec id="section13-1541204011422085">
<title>Dopamine D4 receptor gene</title>
<p>The dopamine D4 receptor (<italic>DRD4</italic>) gene has been mapped to chromosome 11 and has a polymorphism (i.e., a variable number of tandem repeats [VNTRs]) in exon III. The alleles for this polymorphism range in length from 2 to 11 repeats; however, the 4- and 7-repeat alleles are the two most common (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1541204011422085">Wang et al., 2004</xref>). The 7-repeat allele has been identified as the risk allele that confers an increased risk of antisocial outcomes, such as conduct disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1541204011422085">Rowe et al., 2001</xref>), gambling problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1541204011422085">Comings et al., 2001</xref>), and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder ([ADHD] <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1541204011422085">Faraone, Doyle, Mick, &amp; Biederman, 2001</xref>). Following prior research, the 2-, 3-, 4-, 5-, and 6-repeat alleles were pooled together into one group (called the 4-repeat group), while the 7-, 8-, 9- 10-, and 11-repeat alleles were pooled together into another group (called the 7-repeat group). This polymorphism was coded codominantly, where the value on this variable reflected the number of 7-repeat alleles that each respondent carried.</p>

<title>Adolescent victimization</title>
<p>There is emerging evidence suggesting that adolescent victimization is driven in part by genetic factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1541204011422085">Beaver, Boutwell, Barnes, &amp; Cooper, 2009a</xref>). To examine whether dopaminergic genes are associated with victimization, an adolescent victimization scale was created. During Wave 1 interviews, youths were asked to indicate how many times in the past year they had been shot, they had been jumped, and they had a knife or gun pulled on them, among others. The items were coded as follows: 0 = <italic>never</italic>, 1 = <italic>once</italic>, and 2 = <italic>more than once</italic>. All of the responses were summed to create the adolescent victimization scale, where higher values indicate more victimization experiences (α = .68). This scale is similar to ones that have been used previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1541204011422085">Beaver et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1541204011422085">Haynie &amp; Piquero, 2006</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section21-1541204011422085">
<title>Delinquent peers</title>
<p>One of the most consistent criminological findings is that measures of delinquent peers are among the strongest predictors of adolescent delinquency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1541204011422085">Akers, 1998</xref>), and there is some evidence that exposure to delinquent peers is scripted, in part, by genetic factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1541204011422085">Fowler et al., 2007</xref>). During Wave 1 interviews, respondents were asked three questions about their contact with delinquent peers. Specifically, they were asked to indicate how many of their three best friends smoked at least one cigarette per day, how many smoked marijuana more than once a month, and how many drank alcohol at least once a month. The responses for these questions were 0 = <italic>zero friends</italic>, 1 = <italic>one friend</italic>, 2 = <italic>two friends</italic>, and 3 = <italic>three friends</italic>. To create the delinquent peers scale, the responses to these three items were summed together (α = .76). Higher values on this scale indicate more contact with delinquent peers. This scale is identical to those that have been used previously by Add Health researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1541204011422085">Bellair, Roscigno, &amp; McNulty, 2003</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section22-1541204011422085">
<title>Violent delinquency</title>
<p>A consistent body of research has revealed that antisocial behavior is partially the result of genetic factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1541204011422085">Rutter, 2006</xref>). To explore whether the dopaminergic polymorphisms explain some of this variance, a violent delinquency scale was created. During Wave 1 interviews, respondents were asked seven questions that tapped the frequency of engaging in violent acts. For instance, youths were asked how frequently in the past 12 months they had hurt someone badly enough to need medical care, they had shot or stabbed someone, and they had pulled a knife or gun on someone. Responses to these items were summed together to create the violent delinquency scale, with higher values representing greater involvement in violence (α = .72). This scale is identical to the one used by Guo, Roettger, &amp; Shih (2007a), except that the item pertaining to whether the respondent had carried a weapon to work/school was removed from the scale.</p>

<sec id="section23-1541204011422085">
<title>Plan of Analysis</title>
<p>The analyses proceeded in a number of sequential steps. To begin, we examined the interaction between the dopamine genes and neighborhood disadvantage in the prediction of antisocial outcomes by estimating split-sample models. For these models, the neighborhood disadvantage scale was split at the 75th percentile, a cut point that has been used previously with the Add Health data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1541204011422085">Cleveland, 2003</xref>). More specifically, respondents who had values at or below the 75th percentile were characterized as residing in adequate neighborhoods, while respondents who had values above the 75th percentile were characterized as living in disadvantaged neighborhoods. Our decision to dichotomize the neighborhood disadvantage scale was grounded in the logic that it is unlikely that incremental increases across this scale would correspond to incremental moderation of genetic effects. Rather, it is more likely to anticipate that there is a tipping point at which neighborhood disadvantage becomes so stressful that it triggers genetic effects. Exactly where the tipping point is located is difficult to determine which is why we allowed prior research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1541204011422085">Cleveland, 2003</xref>) to guide our decision to split the scale at the 75th percentile. We examined whether <italic>DRD2</italic> and <italic>DRD4</italic> were associated with the neighborhood disadvantage scale. Bivariate analyses did not reveal a statistically significant association between the genes and the measure of neighborhood disadvantage. Additionally, there was no evidence indicating that the distribution of alleles for these two genes was different for disadvantaged and adequate neighborhoods.</p>
<p>For each of the dependent variables, two models were calculated: The first model for respondents living in adequate neighborhoods and the second model for respondents living in disadvantaged neighborhoods. These split-sample models tested for gene–environment interaction between the dopamine genes and neighborhood disadvantage. If the dopamine genes had a statistically significant effect in one sample (e.g., the disadvantaged neighborhood sample), but not in the other (e.g., the adequate neighborhood sample), then the effect of the gene was contingent on the presence of a particular environment. Split-sample models have been used previously as a way of testing for gene–environment interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1541204011422085">Beaver et al., 2007</xref>). <italic>z</italic> tests were calculated to determine whether the genetic effect differed significantly between disadvantaged and adequate neighborhoods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1541204011422085">Paternoster, Bram, Mazerolle, &amp; Piquero, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>An examination of the distributional properties of our dependent variables revealed that the victimization and violent delinquency measures were skewed (skewness statistic &gt;2.00 for both scales), while delinquent peers were not skewed (skewness statistic &lt;1.00 for both scales). As a result, negative binomial regressions were estimated when victimization and violent delinquency were the dependent variables and ordinary least squares (OLS) regression were estimated when delinquent peers was the dependent variable.</p>
<p>All models controlled for the effects of race as a way to reduce the possibility that any significant effects were driven by population stratification. In addition, in equations where there was a statistically significant genetic effect, the equations were recalculated separately for Caucasians and minorities. If the genetic effect was due to population stratification, then the genetic effect should be rendered nonsignificant in the within-race models. We note any instances where the genetic effect was driven entirely by population stratification.</p>
<p>The DNA subsample of the Add Health lacks independence in some of the observations because some respondents have a sibling who is also a participant. The lack of independence violates one of the main assumptions of regression and can result in downwardly biased standard errors and artificially inflated <italic>t</italic> tests for the regression coefficients. This problem was addressed in two ways. First, one twin from each monozygotic twin pair was randomly removed from the final analytical sample (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1541204011422085">Haberstick et al., 2005</xref>). Second, all of the models were estimated using Huber/White standard errors. Finally, to stay consistent with much of the genetic research and to make the findings more directly comparable with the extant literature, we only report the results for males. In addition, since the data were drawn from a nonclinical sample, there were relatively few females who were highly delinquent, which is where genetic effects are thought to be the most powerful. Last, there is some reason to suspect that genes involved in neurotransmission may have differential effects on males and females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1541204011422085">Boyd, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1541204011422085">Burnham &amp; Phelan, 2000</xref>), and previous genetic research analyzing the Add Health has made a compelling case for why these genes may only have effects for males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1541204011422085">Guo et al., 2008</xref>). Against this backdrop, we only report the results for males, but we do note that the models were estimated for females and the results were consistently null.</p>

<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1541204011422085">Table 2</xref>
 contains the results of the negative binomial regression models predicting victimization for the adequate neighborhood and disadvantaged neighborhood groups.

For the disadvantaged neighborhood group, the effect of DRD2 on victimization remained null; however, DRD4 emerged as a statistically significant predictor of victimization. This finding can be interpreted in the following way: the 7-repeat allele increased the frequency of victimization but only among respondents from disadvantaged neighborhoods. Post hoc <italic>z</italic> tests failed to confirm that the difference in coefficients for <italic>DRD4</italic> between adequate neighborhoods and disadvantaged neighborhoods was statistically significant (<italic>z</italic> = 1.06, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .05, two-tailed test).</p>

<p>The last set of models examines gene–environment effects on violent delinquency using negative binomial regression techniques. As <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1541204011422085">Table 4</xref>
 shows, <italic>DRD2</italic> and <italic>DRD4</italic> have no effect on violent delinquency for respondents from adequate neighborhoods. A very different set of results are garnered for the analysis with respondents from disadvantaged neighborhoods. In these models, <italic>DRD2</italic> and <italic>DRD4</italic> both emerge as statistically significant predictors of violent delinquency. Substantively, these findings indicate that the <italic>A1</italic> allele of <italic>DRD2</italic> and the 7-repeat allele of <italic>DRD4</italic> increase the frequency of violence but only among respondents from disadvantaged neighborhoods. <italic>z</italic> Tests confirmed that the effects of <italic>DRD2</italic> (<italic>z</italic> = 1.98, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, two-tailed test) and <italic>DRD4</italic> (<italic>z</italic> = 2.17, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, two-tailed test) on violent delinquency were significantly different between the two models. These findings provide evidence of a gene–environment interaction in the prediction of adolescent violent behavior.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Neighborhood context is a recurring theme in the social sciences generally and in criminology specifically. Structural, cultural, and social dimensions of neighborhoods are often viewed by researchers and policy makers as vital factors for understanding negative outcomes. Residing in poor, segregated neighborhoods is linked to perpetrating crime and engaging in delinquency, health problems, becoming a victim of crime, feelings of anxiety and distress, underachievement in school for adolescents, and even verbal deficiencies in adolescents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1541204011422085">Jencks &amp; Mayer, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1541204011422085">Leventhal &amp; Brooks-Gunn, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1541204011422085">Sampson et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1541204011422085">Sampson, Sharkey, &amp; Raudenbush, 2008</xref>). At least for antisocial outcomes, it has been argued that culture, socialization, learning, and control mechanisms may be responsible for this link (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1541204011422085">Akers, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1541204011422085">Anderson, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1541204011422085">Leventhal &amp; Brooks-Gunn, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1541204011422085">Wikström &amp; Sampson, 2003</xref>). Absent from this literature, however, is the possibility that neighborhood conditions may exert part of their influence on antisocial behavior by moderating genetic effects. The current study addressed this possibility by examining whether the effects of <italic>DRD2</italic> and <italic>DRD4</italic> on three antisocial outcomes differed between adequate and disadvantaged neighborhoods.</p>
<p>Three aspects of the current study are particularly worthy of highlighting. First, our study is among the first to include a measure of neighborhood disadvantage drawn from official U.S. census data and to include measured genes in the prediction of antisocial phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1541204011422085">Hart &amp; Marmorstein, 2009</xref>). Second, the effect of the polymorphism in the <italic>DRD2</italic> gene on some of the outcome measures varied depending on whether respondents were from adequate or disadvantaged neighborhoods. Specifically, <italic>DRD2</italic> had effects on delinquent peers and violent delinquency but only for respondents residing in disadvantaged neighborhoods. Third, and similar to <italic>DRD2</italic>, the polymorphism in the <italic>DRD4</italic> gene interacted with neighborhood conditions to increase antisocial outcomes. <italic>DRD4</italic> was associated with adolescent victimization and violent delinquency, but only for those residing in disadvantaged neighborhoods. Of particular importance is that these gene–environment interactions were detected on a range of antisocial outcomes not just violent delinquency. These findings are in line with research revealing that certain genes have effects on multiple phenotypes, a phenomenon known as pleiotropy.</p>
<p>Our findings are among the first to show that a well-known criminogenic environment—neighborhood disadvantage—can modify the effects of two dopaminergic genes—<italic>DRD2</italic> and <italic>DRD4</italic>—on three different antisocial measures. Although we describe two possible theoretical reasons for our results, it is still unknown which, if either, account for our findings. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1541204011422085">Shanahan and Hofer (2005</xref>, p. 71), “the developmental challenges posed by neighborhoods marked by concentrated disadvantage are numerous, intercorrelated, and likely to exert their negative influences in nonadditive ways.” Future research is needed to unpack the ways in which neighborhood conditions may interact with these dopaminergic genes in the production of antisocial phenotypes.</p>
<p>Because this is the first study to reveal a gene–environment interaction between neighborhood disadvantage and <italic>DRD2</italic> and <italic>DRD4</italic>, follow-up studies are needed to assess whether these findings are replicable. In doing so, researchers need to address at least three limitations of our study. First, all of the models are based on cross-sectional data which necessarily call into question whether gene–environment interactions would have any lasting effects. It would seem reasonable to assume that the moderating effect of neighborhood disadvantage would tend to be relatively immediate because adolescents may live in different neighborhoods as young adults. However, neighborhoods have also been shown to have more lasting effects on children. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1541204011422085">Sampson et al. (2008)</xref> found that the verbal abilities of children residing in extremely disadvantaged neighborhoods were low and equivalent to losing an entire year in school, and this influence was still observable years after these children moved out of such neighborhoods. Thus, we believe that it is important to understand the longitudinal, longer-term effects of neighborhoods on gene expression as well as contemporaneous influences. Second, researchers need to employ different samples to determine whether these findings are generalizable. Third, the gene–environment interactions were detected for males but not for females (results not presented). An important line of inquiry for researchers to explore is in studying the gene–environment interactions that might promote criminal and delinquent involvement among females. Despite these limitations, this study adds important new evidence to the growing literature on the intertwined nature of social contexts and genetics in the prediction of problem behaviors.</p>
