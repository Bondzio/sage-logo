<sec id="section2-0069477012471782">
<title>Drug Interaction: Increased Plasma Ticagrelor Concentrations</title>
<p>A randomized crossover study of 10 healthy volunteers (4 women and 6 men) was conducted to identify the increased plasma concentrations of ticagrelor with the intake of grapefruit juice. The mean age was 22 years. Participants ingested either 200 mL of grapefruit juice or water 3 times a day for 4 days. On day 3, they ingested a 90 mg dose of ticagrelor. Use of concurrent medications was prohibited for 1 week before and at least 72 hours after ticagrelor administration. The plasma concentrations of ticagrelor were measured using an API 3000 LC/MS/MS system, and the antiplatelet activity was tested with Verify Now P2Y<sub>12</sub> assay. Grapefruit juice increased the <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> of ticagrelor to 165% and it prolonged the half-life of ticagrelor from 6.7 to 7.2 hours. Grapefruit juice more than doubled the area under the curve of ticagrelor in all the subjects and enhanced antiplatelet effects.</p>
<p>The authors concluded that grapefruit juice markedly increases plasma concentrations and antiplatelet effects of ticagrelor. Grapefruit juice inactivates the CYP3A4 enzyme in the intestinal wall, which inhibits the first-pass metabolism of ticagrelor causing increased concentrations.</p>

<title>Neurotoxicity</title>
<p>A 14-year-old female developed altered mental status for approximately 2 to 4 hours during treatment with intravenous cefepime (1.5 g every 12 hours) for a septic arthritis in the left hip. Concurrent medications included baclofen (50 mg a day), gabapentin (300 mg 3 times daily), hydrocodone/acetaminophen (5/500 mg every 6 hours as needed), calcitriol (0.25 µg twice daily), levothyroxine (25 µg daily), calcium carbonate (500 mg daily), lansoprazole (15 mg daily), senna (10 mg twice daily), docusate (100 mg twice daily), a probiotic, a multivitamin, enoxaparin (30 mg subcutaneously every 12 hours), intravenous immune globulin (8 g once weekly), and tobramycin (130 mg every 24 hours) in addition to cefepime. When the symptoms occurred, the tobramycin level was 1.7 µg/mL. The antibiotic was stopped at the clinic and the patient was sent home but the symptoms worsened. On admission the following day, blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine levels continued to rise and right-sided facial twitching and bilateral arm movements began. It was assumed that the worsening renal function was due to other factors or medications and the patient continued to receive scheduled doses of cefepime during this time period. Shortly after hospitalization, the patient began to show seizure activity, which was treated with intravenous lorazepam. Cefepime was later discontinued on the day of admission after laboratory values were evaluated and meropenem was started. The following day, day 2, seizure activity increased and a loading dose of levetiracetam was administered, and a midazolam drip was started, which was transitioned to phenobarbital. On day 4, meropenem was stopped for potential seizure potentiation. By day 10, the patient was awake and smiling. On day 16, the patient could respond appropriately to yes or no questions and was discharged on day 22. Her original infection was treated with ciprofloxacin and had no remaining or subsequent neurological signs of toxicity.</p>
<p>The authors concluded that the altered mental status and seizure activity were caused by treatment with cefepime. Cefepime toxicity should be considered in pediatric patients when no other identifiable causes are present.</p>

<sec id="section6-0069477012471782">
<title>Metabolic Effects in Pediatric Patients With Tourette Syndrome</title>
<p>In a controlled trial, the metabolic effects were evaluated in 75 children with Tourette syndrome who were treated with aripiprazole (n = 25), pimozide (n = 25), or medication free (n = 25). Measurements were monitored at baseline and at 12 months and 24 months after starting treatment. At the end of the study, significant increases in glycemia had occurred in the pimozide group (+4.53 mg/dL; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05) and in both groups for triglyceride levels (+12.47 and 12.92 mg/dL; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05). Significant increases in cholesterol occurred in the aripiprazole group when compared with baseline (+12.92; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05). No significant changes occurred in body mass index during the study in either group.</p>
<p>The authors concluded that changes in metabolic measurements occur with both pimozide and aripiprazole therapy in children with Tourette syndrome. These data should help guide medication selection for specific patients.</p>

<title>Diaphoresis, Delirium, Agitation, and Choreathetoid Movements</title>
<p>A 37-year-old male patient with a history of chronic progressive multiple sclerosis and depression was admitted with diaphoresis, delirium, agitation, and choreathetoid movements due to a 4-aminopyridine overdose. Concurrent medications included paroxetine and fingolimod. The patient was initially admitted to the emergency department after being found by his brother on the floor. On arrival to the emergency department, blood pressure was 125/104 mm Hg, heart rate was 133 beats per minute, and respiratory rate was 30 breaths per minute. Physical examination revealed that he was agitated and irritated, and electrocardiogram was normal except for sinus tachycardia. A 4-aminopyridine level was obtained 6 hours after ingestion and measured at 140 ng/mL (normal = 17.3-42.7 ng/mL) but concentration decreased to 6 ng/mL 24 hours later. Treatment included intravenous diazepam (110 mg) and diphenhydramine (50 mg). Due to persistent agitation and delirium, the patient was admitted to the intensive care unit and additional diazepam (20 mg) was administered. The patient was also intubated and sedated with intravenous propofol. Gradual improvement was observed over the first 2 hospital days, and he was transferred home in his baseline state on day 7.</p>
<p>The authors concluded that 4-aminopyridine overdose toxicity is due to its mechanism of action of combining cholinergic features with dopamine-related movement abnormalities. 4-Aminopyridine selectively blocks voltage-gated potassium channels increasing calcium influx and prolonging the action potential, and it also enhances the release of acetylcholine from nerve endings leading to an increase in dopamine transmission.</p>

<title>Delirium</title>
<p>A retrospective study of 60 cases, from January 2006 to July 2007, was conducted to compare the incidence of delirium between 2 groups of patients who were treated with H<sub>2</sub> blockers or proton pump inhibitors. Patients were identified as those being treated for anastomotic ulcer prevention following surgical treatment of esophageal cancer in Osaka Medical Center for Cancer and Cardiovascular Diseases. The mean age in both groups was 65.2 years, and the diagnosis of delirium was based on the <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV-Text Revision</italic>, and severity was on rated on the Delirium Rating Scale. Delirium incidence occurred in 16.7% of the proton pump inhibitor group (5 cases; 2 from lansoprazole and 3 from omeprazole) compared to 43.3% in the H<sub>2</sub> group (13 cases; 12 from famotidine and 1 from ranitidine). Delirium incidence was significantly lower in the proton pump inhibitor group, and H<sub>2</sub> blocker discontinuation in the H<sub>2</sub> group had significant alleviation of the delirium. Of the 13 patients who developed delirium in the H<sub>2</sub> group, 11 patients discontinued or switched to proton pump inhibitors. An average Delirium Rating Scale score was significantly lower 3 days after discontinuation (11.8 ± 5.1) compared to the day before discontinuation (16.6 ± 3.1).</p>
<p>The authors concluded that the switching from H<sub>2</sub> blockers to proton pump inhibitors would reduce the incidence of drug-induced delirium from antiulcer drugs.</p>

<title>Heterogeneous Disturbances</title>
<p>Four case reports of late adverse effects in patients treated with a combination of lamotrigine and valproate were described.</p>
<p><italic>Patient 1</italic>. A 6-year-old female patient had a 42-month history of partial symptomatic epilepsy. The epilepsy was refractory to treatment but was finally controlled with a combination of lamotrigine (200 mg/d), valproate (90 mg/d), and nitrazepam (10 mg/d) when she was 4 years old. Nine months after the final dose adjustment, she presented with episodes of vomiting, dizziness, and tremor. A month later, the patient demonstrated opsoclonus, which was characterized as irregular oscillations of the eyeballs. Lamotrigine was decreased by 50 mg (150 mg/d) and observed for 2 weeks, and these disturbances disappeared. Valproate and nitrazepam were continued at the same dose.</p>
<p><italic>Patient 2</italic>. An 18-year-old female patient had refractory epilepsy since she was 8 months. A combination of lamotrigine (300 mg/d) with valproate (1000 mg/d) controlled her partial seizures. Fifteen months after the final dose adjustment, she presented with involuntary neck and head movements (ie, tics). Lamotrigine was decreased by 25 mg (275 mg/d), which led to remission of tics. She also experienced excessive upper-limb tremor, which was resolved when valproate was decreased by 250 mg (750 mg/d).</p>
<p><italic>Patient 3</italic>. A 15-year-old female patient, with an 11-year history of symptomatic epilepsy, was referred for evaluation at age 10.The epilepsy later became refractory, and at age 11, she was controlled receiving a combination of lamotrigine (300 mg/d) and valproate (1.5 g/d). Two years after the final dose adjustment, she presented with an episode of ataxia, tremor, nystagmus, and vertigo. Lamotrigine was decreased by 50 mg (250 mg/d), which resolved the acute episodes.</p>
<p><italic>Patient 4</italic>. A 14-year-old male patient, with a 13-year history of refractory myoclonic epilepsy, was referred at age 12. He was partly controlled with a ketogenic diet, but it was discontinued at age 6, which led to myoclonic status epilepticus. Complete remission of generalized tonic–clonic seizures and partial control of myoclonic seizures were achieved with lamotrigine (400 mg/d) and valproate (1.5 g/d). One year after the combined treatment, he developed gait disturbance, slurred speech, ataxia, and tremor. Lamotrigine was decreased by 50 mg (350 mg/d), which led to the remission of these conditions.</p>

<title>Gingival Overgrowth</title>
<p>A 30-year-old male patient presented to clinic with gingival overgrowth, and the patient had a medical history of epileptic state controlled with phenytoin. A diagnosis of phenytoin-induced gingival overgrowth was made, with no other risk factors identified. Use of other concurrent medications was unknown. Clinical examination revealed generalized edematous gingival tissues, and the presence of plaque and calculus accumulated on the surfaces of the teeth. Treatment included conservative therapy with oral hygiene instructions, root surface instrumentation, scaling, and bacterial plaque was controlled with chlorhexidine mouth washes. Teeth were extracted due to the degree of bone loss, and gingivectomy was performed in both arches. At a 3-year follow-up exam, no recurrence of gingival lesion was observed.</p>
<p>The authors concluded that phenytoin with the presence of irritants favored gingival growth. Drug-induced gingival overgrowth is caused by expanded or fibrotic connective tissues with different degrees of inflammation.</p>

<title>Hypersomnolence (First Report<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0069477012471782">*</xref>)</title>
<p>A 38-year-old male developed course valuolation and demyelination that led to fatal aspiration pneumonia after starting efavirenz 600 mg daily. The patient was previously started on stavudine 15 mg every 12 hours, lamivudine 150 mg daily, nevirapine 200 mg every 12 hours, and cotrimoxazole 480 mg daily. Three months later, with an elevated alanine aminotransaminase level of 561 and when a hepatitis B test returned positive, his nevirapine and cotrimoxazole were stopped. Five days after stopping, efavirenz 600 mg daily was started. The patient complained of headaches and lightheadedness when seen a week later. After a month, he complained of unpleasant dreams and a hangover feeling when awaking. He tested culture positive for mycobacterium tuberculosis, and although it was microscopy negative, treatment of rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol were started. His mental alertness continued to slow and was often confused when waking up. A computed tomography scan showed generalized brain atrophy, and a couple weeks later the patient complained of fatigue and drowsiness. There was a 3-second delay in answering questions, and his pupils were delayed when reacting to light. Slightly more than 3 months after starting efavirenz, his efavirenz and isoniazid was switched to nevirapine and ofloxacin. Two weeks later, despite the change in medication and other laboratory workup, his Glasgow Coma Scale dropped to 8 of 15. He was transported to a tertiary hospital, where he aspirated and died the next day. Postmortem findings showed aspiration pneumonia and extensive axonal vacuolopathy. An efavirenz plasma level 5 days after stopping therapy was 13.7 mg/L, with a recommended range of 1 to 4 mg/L.</p>
<p>The author concluded that the patient’s hypersomnolence leading to coma and death was caused by the use of efavirenz, and although previously unreported, no other sources could be identified. Dose adjustment in patients with elevated levels has been shown to be safe, and the author recommends measuring levels when patients show severe and prolonged neuropsychiatric effects.</p>

<p>A 48-year-old woman developed giddiness, restlessness, and abdominal rash after receiving 2 doses of norfloxacin for suspected urinary tract infection. Concurrent medications were limited to paracetamol (500 mg), and no history of diabetes mellitus was reported. Physical examination was significant for urticarial rashes on the thigh and abdomen. Significant laboratory values included random blood sugar (46 mg/dL) and serum insulin level 37.8 µU/mL (normal = 6.0-27.0 µU/mL). Other hematological and biochemical evaluations were within normal range. No abnormalities were revealed with electrocardiogram, chest X-ray, or abdominal ultrasonography. Treatment included 50% dextrose (50 mL intravenous). Symptomatic relief occurred after 1 dose, and subsequent therapy was not required.</p>
<p>The authors concluded that this was the first report of hypoglycemia associated with norfloxacin. The authors determined a probable relationship between norfloxacin therapy and the hypoglycemia experienced in this patient through analysis by Naranjo Adverse Drug Reaction Probability Scale. The proposed mechanism was enhanced pancreatic β-cell stimulation and insulin release.</p>

<title>Prolactinoma</title>
<p>A 67-year-old female developed a microadenoma after being treated with risperidone 2 mg at bedtime for the previous 10 years. Concurrent medications at the time of risperidone therapy were not reported. The patient’s prolactin levels were checked by request after learning of a link between the medication and risk of tumors. Her initial prolactin level was 83.8 µg/L (normal range is 3.4-24.1 µg/L in nonpregnant women) and was rechecked a couple months later to obtain a morning fasting state level, which returned at 100.1 µg/L. A microadenoma was found by magnetic resonance imaging in her pituitary gland to be 2 mm wide. The patient was transitioned slowly to ziprasidone 40 mg and tapered off of risperidone with a final ziprasidone dose of 80 mg twice daily after approximately 2 months. Within 2 more months the patient’s prolactin levels returned to normal range and remained through a follow-up time of 5.5 years. Follow-up imaging through magnetic resonance imaging about 6 months after discontinuing risperidone showed normal enhancement of the pituitary gland and no suspicion of an adenoma. Positive results were seen while on ziprasidone therapy.</p>
<p>The authors concluded that the microadenoma was caused by her treatment with risperidone. Recommendations were made to check prolactin levels annually in patients taking risperidone and to watch for signs that could suggest a need to switch medications.</p>

<title>Sleep-Related Eating Disorders</title>
<p>A 51-year-old African American male patient experienced sleepwalking and eating during sleep and daytime sleepiness while on quetiapine 150 mg at bedtime. Concurrent medications included bupropion, lisinopril, hydrochlorothiazide, and loratidine. He was taking 150 mg twice daily of bupropion for the past 8 years, and his quetiapine was started 6 years ago with a dose that was gradually titrated up. The onset of symptoms is unknown, but the patient had been witnessed experiencing sleep-related symptoms for more than a year. The patient reports walking, eating uncooked food from the refrigerator, and misplacing things while asleep 3 to 4 nights per week. The patient has no recollection of these events. The patient was advised to stop the medication due to the known association to sleepwalking. At a 3-month and 1-year follow-up, he did not have any further events and no other medications had been changed.</p>
<p>A 50-year-old African American female was seen sleepwalking and eating from the refrigerator while being treated with quetiapine 200 mg daily. She had been taking quetiapine for the past 4 years, but her dose had been more recently increased to 200 mg more than 1 year ago. Her other medication include verapamil, lisinopril, hydrochlorothiazide, bupropion, venlafaxine, and topiramate with no doses reported. She was experiencing these events 2 to 3 nights a week. Her quetiapine was tapered and then stopped. The patient no longer had episodes of sleepwalking or sleep eating since discontinuation of the drug.</p>
<p>The authors concluded that the sleep-related disorder was caused by the use of quetiapine in these patients. The potential for serious harm warrants discussion with patients taking this medication.</p>

<title>Gingival Enlargement</title>
<p>A 60-year-old female had gingival enlargement and halitosis for 6 months since starting sodium valproate 200 mg. The patient was previously on phenytoin after neurosurgery, but after switching to sodium valproate, the gingival enlargement started. The patient had preexisting periodontitis, worsened by the medication, and radiologic examination showed severe bone loss. No other concurrent medications were reported, and substitution of sodium valproate was not feasible for the patient’s neurological condition. One tooth was extracted and a full mouth flap surgery was performed to remove much of the fibrous tissue. After 6 months, a follow-up visit showed decreased mobility of another tooth and improved oral hygiene had resolved the halitosis, both improving the patient’s quality of life.</p>
<p>The authors concluded that the patient’s gingival enlargement was caused by the use of sodium valproate. Although rare and incidence rates are unknown, significant contributing factors include drug variability, plaque-induced inflammatory changes in gingival tissue, and genetic factors.</p>

<title>Acute Necrotizing Pancreatitis With Tetany</title>
<p>A 9-year-old female developed severe colicky abdominal pain, vomiting, and tingling in extremities 8 months after antiretroviral therapy was altered to include stavudine. Weakness developed the preceding month. Concurrent medications included lamivudine, nevirapine, and cotrimoxazole. Significant findings on admission included blood pressure (98/70 mm Hg) and a tonic posture of both upper extremities. Significant laboratory parameters included CD<sub>4</sub> count (179/10%), white blood cell count (19 000/mm<sup>3</sup>), serum amylase (1186 U/L), serum lipase (5410 U/L), ionized calcium (0.56 mmol/L), serum sodium 120 mEq/L, and alkaline phosphatase (378 IU/L). Computed tomography scan of the abdomen revealed acute necrotizing pancreatitis. Treatment included calcium gluconate (2 mL/kg intravenous every 6 hours for 8 days), Isolyte-P (340 mL intravenous every 6 hours for 5 days), and dopamine (5 µg/kg/min intravenous daily for 9 days). Antibiotic therapy included cefotaxime (50 mg/kg intravenous every 12 hours for 5 days), gentamicin (4 mg/kg intravenous daily for 2 days), ciprofloxacin (10 mg/kg every 12 hours for 3 days) started on the third day, amikacin (7.5 mg/kg intravenous every 12 hours for 6 days) and metronidazole (5 mg/kg intravenous every 12 hours for 6 days) started on the fourth day, levofloxacin (10 mg/kg intravenous daily for 4 days), and ceftriaxone (50 mg/kg intravenous every 12 hours for 4 days) started on the sixth day. Repeat laboratory parameters improved with the exception of white blood cell count (20 200/mm<sup>3</sup>). Symptoms of tetany resolved on the third day. General condition progressively declined, ultimately resulting in expiration on the ninth day of admission.</p>
<p>Using the Naranjo Scale assessment, the authors concluded that stavudine was a probable cause of the necrotizing pancreatitis experienced by this patient. The proposed mechanism was inhibition of deoxyribonucleic acid polymerase γ, adenylate kinase, and the adenosine diphosphate/adenosine triphosphate translocator resulting in mitochondrial dysfunction and cellular toxicity.</p>

<title>Delirium (First Report<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0069477012471782">*</xref>)</title>
<p>A 63-year-old male patient developed sleeplessness and agitation shortly after receipt of 1 dose of oral amlodipine (10 mg) for treatment of elevated blood pressure. Concurrent medications included acetylsalicylic acid (300 mg), ramipril (10 mg), and hydrochlorothiazide. Hemiparesis following acute ischemic stroke resulted in initial admission. Cranial computed tomography revealed lacunar infarct in the right capsula interna. Twelve hours after admission, blood pressure increased to 200/120 mm Hg and amlodipine was initiated. Delirium occurred within 3 hours of amlodipine administration and spontaneously resolved within approximately 6 hours. Evaluation of renal and hepatic function, electrolytes, urinalysis, electrocardiogram, and chest X-ray revealed no abnormalities. Delirium recurred and spontaneously resolved 3 times following amlodipine administration. After the third occurrence, amlodipine was discontinued with no further delirium or intervention required.</p>
<p>The authors concluded that the delirium experienced in this patient was related to amlodipine use. They also determined this was the first reported case of amlodipine-associated delirium. The proposed mechanism was decreased acetylcholine concentration in the neuromuscular junction and increased permeability of the blood–brain barrier caused by amlodipine.</p>
