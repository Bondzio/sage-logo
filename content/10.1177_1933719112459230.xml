</sec>
<sec>
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>A total of 20 formerly preeclamptic women and 8 parous controls underwent 2 echocardiograms at 1 and 14 years of postpartum.

<sec>
<title>Results:</title>
<p>Left ventricular geometry and dimensions and systolic function were comparable in the 2 study groups at both time points.

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Preeclampsia (PE), a hypertensive pregnancy disorder complicating 2% to 5% of all pregnancies,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1933719112459230">1</xref></sup> is characterized by new onset hypertension accompanied by new onset proteinuria. It is associated not only with perinatal complications but also with long-term maternal cardiovascular morbidity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1933719112459230">2</xref></sup> Nevertheless, the factors contributing to the higher prevalence of cardiovascular disorders (CVDs) in formerly preeclamptic women are only partly identified. Moreover, there is accumulating evidence for hemodynamic and cardiovascular differences in the postpartum (pp) period after a preeclamptic and an uneventful pregnancy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1933719112459230">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1933719112459230">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>In normal pregnancy, the left ventricular (LV) mass and dimensions begin to increase in the first trimester. This so-called eccentric cardiac remodeling that resolves in the first week of pp resembles the one in athletes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1933719112459230">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1933719112459230">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1933719112459230"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1933719112459230">7</xref></sup> In contrast, women with preeclampsia also elicit an increase in LV mass during pregnancy but with a less pronounced LV widening. The so-called concentric cardiac remodeling seems to develop after the clinical onset of PE and persists for at least several months pp.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1933719112459230">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1933719112459230">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1933719112459230">9</xref></sup> Concentric cardiac remodeling is also known to develop in response to chronic hypertension. Since PE is diagnosed on the basis of new onset hypertension, it is tempting to expect that concentric cardiac hypertrophy develops after its clinical onset.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1933719112459230">10</xref></sup> Concentric cardiac remodeling is known to be positively associated with a higher prevalence of CVD. Several studies have therefore explored the pp fate of this concentric LV remodeling in formerly preeclamptic women. However, the studied follow-up period lasted 12 to 16 months at most.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1933719112459230">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1933719112459230">8</xref></sup> This implies that none of the studies explored the age-related fate of the cardiac remodeling in formerly preeclamptic women.</p>
<p>This study was designed to explore the pp changes in cardiac geometry and dimensions, as well as in cardiac function over a prolonged period in formerly preeclamptic women relative to those in parous controls. We hypothesized that a history of PE is associated with altered cardiac aging relative to that in women with a history of only normal pregnancies.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section3-1933719112459230">
<title>Study Population</title>
<p>The study protocol was approved by the Medical Ethical Committee of Maastricht University Medical Centre (MEC 08-2-130). In this longitudinal explorative study, we assessed cardiac geometry and dimensions as well as cardiac function in women with a history of PE and parous controls approximately at 1  and 14 years of pp. Preeclampsia was diagnosed according to the criteria of the International Society for the Study of Hypertension in Pregnancy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1933719112459230">10</xref></sup> Early-onset PE is defined as PE diagnosed before 34 weeks of pregnancy. We considered newborns to be small-for-gestational-age (SGA) if their birth weight was below the fifth percentile according to the birth weight reference curves of the Perinatal Registry in the Netherlands.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1933719112459230">11</xref></sup> Hypertension was diagnosed on the basis of a mean systolic blood pressure ≥140 mm Hg and/or a mean diastolic arterial blood pressure ≥90 mm Hg.</p>
<p>Women who participated in a previous study on renal and cardiovascular functions in the period between 1996 and 1999 were invited to participate in this follow-up study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1933719112459230">12</xref></sup> At that time 10 controls were recruited by advertisement, whereas 39 women with a history of PE were recruited at the outpatient clinic at their pp checkup visit. Most of them experienced a severe form of PE, which could be either an early-onset PE or PE complicated by fetal growth restriction or fetal demise. We invited all 10 controls and selected those 33 out of 39 women who had neither preexisting renal disease nor (prepregnancy) hypertension.  Three women had moved and could not be traced, one woman died of pulmonary embolism and 1 woman was currently undergoing chemotherapy. Furthermore, 8 formerly preeclamptic women and 2 controls declined participation, because of lack of time and/or emotional reasons. Eventually, 20 women with a history of PE and 8 parous controls agreed to participate in this follow-up study and gave informed consent before enrollment.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1933719112459230">
<title>Measurements</title>
<p>At 1 and 14 years of pp, we performed a similar set of measurements. Both measurement sessions took place in the mid-follicular phase of the menstrual cycle. Participants used a standardized sodium diet (100 mmol sodium day<sup>−1</sup>) in the week preceding the measurement. Antihypertensive drugs (n = 7 in PE group and n = 1 in control group) were discontinued 2 weeks prior. During the 10 hours before the measurements the participants refrained from drinking caffeine- or alcohol-containing beverages and from smoking and eating.</p>
<p>The measurement session started at 8:00 <sc>am</sc> in a temperature-controlled room (± 24°C). Throughout the measurements, participants were lying on a comfortable bed. After an acclimatization period of 30 minutes, we recorded arterial blood pressure for a period of 30 minutes at 3-minute intervals using a semiautomatic oscillometric device (Dinamap Vital Signs Monitor 1846; Critikon, Tampa, Florida) in standardized environmental conditions with external disturbances kept to a minimum.</p>
<p>We obtained the body mass index (BMI) by dividing body weight (kg) by the height in meter square (m<sup>2</sup>). An estimate for total fat mass was obtained by multiplying height (m) with (1.2 × BMI + 0.23 × age − 5.4). Lean body mass (LBM) was obtained by subtracting the total fat mass from the body weight. Body surface area (BSA) was calculated as follows: BSA (m<sup>2</sup>) = 0.007184 × height (cm)<sup>0.725</sup> × weight (kg)<sup>0.425</sup>. Plasma volume (PV, mL [kg LBM]<sup> −</sup>
<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1933719112459230">1</xref></sup>) was estimated using the indicator dilution technique using I<sup>125</sup>-labeled albumin as an indicator as detailed elsewhere.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1933719112459230">13</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1933719112459230">
<title>Echocardiographic Evaluation</title>
<p>After the PV measurement followed by 5 minutes rest, we assessed the cardiac structure and function using cardiac ultrasound while the participant laid on her back in semileft lateral position. We used a phased-array echocardiographic Doppler system (Hewlett-Packard Sonos 2000 and 2500; Hewlett-Packard Company, Palo Alto, California) to perform the measurement at 1 year of pp, and a Philips IE 33 system (Philips Medical System, Best, the Netherlands) to perform the measurement at 14 years of pp. All data were stored on disk and the analysis was performed offline using specific software (Excelera, Philips, The Netherlands) by a single observer (C.G.-D.). The echocardiography was performed according to the guidelines of the American Society of Echocardiography to measure relevant cardiac indices.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1933719112459230">14</xref></sup> Using M-mode in the parasternal long-axis view, we measured LV end-diastolic and end-systolic diameters (LVEDd, LVESd, mm), end-diastolic wall thickness of the interventricular septum (IVST, mm), and posterior-wall thickness (PWT). We estimated left-ventricular mass (LVM, g) using the Devereux formula<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1933719112459230">15</xref></sup> and indexed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1933719112459230">16</xref></sup> it for height in meters<sup>2.7</sup> as follows: LVMi = LVM m<sup>−2.7</sup>. The relative wall thickness (RWT) was calculated using the following formula: RWT = (IVST + PWT)/LVEDd. Fractional shortening (FS) was calculated using the formula: (LVEDd – LVESd) / LVEDd.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1933719112459230">
<title>Systolic Function</title>
<p>The LV systolic function was evaluated as follows: heart rate (HR, beats/min) was obtained by taking the reciprocal of the mean of between 3 and 5 consecutive RR intervals (seconds) on the electrocardiogram and multiplied by 60. The mean aortic velocity time integral (VTI), measured by averaging the outer edge tracings of 3 to 5 consecutive continuous wave (CW) Doppler registrations of the flow across the aortic valve, was multiplied with the cross-sectional area measured at the level of the aortic annulus in the parasternal long-axis view to obtain stroke volume (SV). We obtained cardiac output (CO, L/min) by multiplying SV with HR. Cardiac index (CI) was calculated by the formula: CI = CO BSA<sup>−<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1933719112459230">1</xref></sup>. SV was also indexed for BSA to obtain the SV index (SVi).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1933719112459230">
<title>Diastolic Function</title>
<p>Diastolic function was assessed using pulsed-wave (PW) Doppler echocardiography to obtain transmitral flow determined from the apical 4-chamber view. The PW Doppler sample volume (5 mm) was carefully positioned at the tip of the mitral valve leaflets. The sweep rate was set at 50 mm/s. The E/A ratio was defined as the ratio of peak mitral flow velocity in early diastole (E) and that during atrial contraction (A). Doppler-derived indices were averaged from 3 to 5 consecutive cardiac cycles.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1933719112459230">
<title>Total Vascular Resistance</title>
<p>Total peripheral vascular resistance (TPVR in dynes s/cm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1933719112459230">5</xref></sup>) was obtained by taking the ratio of mean arterial pressure (MAP, mm Hg) and CO, multiplied by 80. TPVR was indexed for BSA to obtain TPVR index (TPVRi).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1933719112459230">
<title>Statistical Analyses</title>
<p>We compared both groups by the nonparametric Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test. Time-related changes were analyzed using the Wilcoxon Signed Ranks test. Categorical data (incidence of SGA, early-onset PE, fetal demise, outcome subsequent pregnancy) were analyzed using the  χ<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1933719112459230">2</xref></sup> test. All analyses were performed using SPSS version 17.0. A <italic>P</italic> value of less than .05 was considered statistically significant. Data are presented as median with interquartile range unless stated otherwise.</p>

In all, 7 former patients and 1 parous control had developed hypertension in the course of the 14 years of follow-up.</p>

<p>Systolic and diastolic BP and MAP had increased significantly only in the former PE subgroup.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first longitudinal study evaluating the post-PE cardiac changes over such a long follow-up period. Despite the small study population, this study provides novel information on the fate of the cardiac remodeling and function in formerly preeclamptic women and parous controls after a follow-up period of 14 years. Most importantly, this study showed that the changes in cardiac geometry, dimensions, and function were similar in both groups. Moreover, both groups showed a similar decline in FS and E/A ratio. As all women were still premenopausal, the effect of menopause on the cardiovascular system did not act as a potential confounder.</p>
<p>Large retrospective epidemiological studies have consistently demonstrated an elevated risk for many types of CVDs in women with a history of PE.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1933719112459230">2</xref></sup> The mechanisms responsible for a higher risk of CVD in women with a history of PE are only partly understood. Our study provides some indirect evidence that differences in cardiac geometry, dimensions, and/or function do not measurably contribute to the elevated risk of CVD in former PE patients.</p>
<sec id="section14-1933719112459230">
<title>Differences Between Both Groups at 1 and 14 Years of pp</title>
<p>At 1-year pp we were unable to discern a measurable difference in LV geometry between former PE patients and controls. Studies up to 6 months of pp found a thicker PWT and IVST and increased LVMi and RWT in the former PE group.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1933719112459230">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1933719112459230">17</xref></sup> We found no differences in LV geometry at 1 year of pp which is opposed to a previous study that found an increased RWT and more hypertrophied ventricles and a lower E/A ratio in formerly preeclamptic women at 1 year of pp compared to controls.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1933719112459230">8</xref></sup> However, this difference in findings could be due to differences in inclusion criteria or due to our small sample size.</p>
<p>We were also unable to discern a consistent difference in systolic function between both groups at 1 year of pp, which is in line with the previous findings.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1933719112459230">4</xref></sup> As FS and LVEDd did not differ between both study groups, it is likely that both study groups have preserved systolic cardiac functioning. Women who experienced preterm PE showed a higher incidence of asymptomatic LV moderate-severe dysfunction/hypertrophy at 1 year of pp, known as stage B heart failure compared to matched controls.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1933719112459230">18</xref></sup> This differs from what was observed in women with a history of late-onset or term PE, who did not show a higher incidence of stage B heart failure at 1 year of pp compared to matched controls. The difference in the incidence of stage B heart failure between women with early-onset and late-onset PE suggests a different pp remodeling. It has also been reported that normotensive women who experienced a preeclamptic pregnancy 13 to 18 years prior have an increased myocardial performance index (MPI) and decreased ejection time.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1933719112459230">19</xref></sup> However, SV and CO as single parameters of systolic function do not differ between formerly preeclamptic women and healthy controls,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1933719112459230">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1933719112459230">19</xref></sup> which is in line with our findings.</p>
<p>In our study, 7 women in the PE group and 1 in the control group were diagnosed with chronic hypertension and were using antihypertensive medication. We asked these patients to discontinue their medication 2 weeks prior to the echocardiographic measurements. Although timely discontinuation of these drugs prior to measurement excludes the short-term effects of antihypertensive medication on cardiac responses, it cannot be ruled out that the preceding chronic use of this medication may have influenced the structure of the heart. If so, the antihypertensive effect of the medication can be expected to have diminished the hypertension-related effects on the cardiac structure. Not only hypertension and antihypertensive medication but also the metabolic syndrome plays an important role in the pp changes in cardiac structure and function. It has been stated that the metabolic syndrome persisting after PE is likely to raise the incidence of diastolic dysfunction in formerly preeclamptic women.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1933719112459230">20</xref></sup> However, information on the E/A ratio without concomitant support of other validated diagnostic algorithms to assess diastolic function is insufficient to draw firm conclusions on diastolic function.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-1933719112459230">
<title>Age-Dependent Changes</title>
<p>Our findings support the concept that in women the increase in IVST with time is larger than that of the posterior wall, irrespective of whether they experienced a PE pregnancy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1933719112459230">21</xref></sup> The parous controls did neither elicit time-dependent changes in LV dimensions and volumes, nor in CO, HR, SV, and CI, an observation in line with previous reports.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1933719112459230">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1933719112459230"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1933719112459230">24</xref></sup> In fact, in healthy adults neither LV systolic and diastolic dimensions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1933719112459230">22</xref></sup><sup>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1933719112459230">23</xref></sup> nor CO and SV<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1933719112459230">24</xref></sup> change with aging.</p>
<p>Our observation of an age-related decline in E/A ratio confirms the previous findings.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1933719112459230">25</xref></sup> We noticed that the rate of decline in E/A ratio did not differ between formerly PE women and parous controls. Apparently, aging is accompanied by loss in cardiac compliance, but at comparable rate in formerly preeclamptic women and healthy parous controls.</p>
<p>Our primary objective in this study was to explore whether a history of PE as a single criterion affects the response of the cardiac geometry and function to aging in formerly PE patients without taking the severity of PE into consideration. Early-onset PE and recurrent PE are known to raise the risk for CVD in former PE patients relative to controls.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1933719112459230">2</xref></sup> Of the women in our PE group, 65% had a history of early-onset PE and 20% experienced recurrent PE. However, despite the fact that more than half of our population consisted of a high-risk population, we did not find significant differences between the PE and control groups. The lack of significant differences between the 2 groups makes it even less likely to find significant differences in cases of mild (late-onset) PE or in the absence of preexisting conditions. Whether we would find persistent remodeling if we studied only a high-risk subpopulation requires further study.</p>
<p>This longitudinal prospective study with paired measurements covers a period of as long as 14 years. Because of the longitudinal design with a very long follow-up period, we were unable to include a large sample of women. The modest sample size of this study mainly weakens the intergroup analysis. However, the use of a repeated measures design, which makes very efficient use of the data, increases the sensitivity of the intragroup results. Despite the statistically efficient design, our results should be interpreted with caution and require confirmation in a larger study.</p>
<p>In conclusion, this study provides evidence for no appreciable long-term negative effects of PE as a single criterion on cardiac structure and function. To unravel the exact mechanism contributing to the higher incidence of hypertension and other CVDs after PE, an adequately powered long-term follow-up study is needed preferably in a population of primarily women with the highest risk of CVD, more specifically those who experienced early-onset PE.</p>
