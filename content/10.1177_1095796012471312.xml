<abstract>
<p>In the mid-1970s, Sue Doro began work as a machinist in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and Donna De Graaf-Smith became a mill worker in East Chicago, Indiana. On-the-job sex-based discrimination (way beyond catcalls, lewd leering, and getting renamed “sweetheart”) quickly ensued. What follows are two stories (Doro’s in regular typeface, De Graaf-Smith’s in italics) detailing how female employees were received in heavy industry as recently as thirty years ago. The extent to which the two narratives overlap is remarkable, which is why we’ve chosen to run them as one.</p>

<body>
<p>I married and started a family right after high school, as did most of my girlfriends. Unlike them, I was also the principal adult of the household, patching a leaky roof and fixing anything else that didn’t work. So it wasn’t out of the ordinary to think of blue-collar jobs when my husband left one morning and never returned. I had five kids to feed and no way to do it in 1968.</p>
<p>From 1976 to 1986, I worked as a machinist at the Milwaukee Road Railway, creating axles and wheels for trains that crisscrossed the country. First and only woman ever hired for that job.</p>
<p>I taped photos of my kids on my tool box and made sure the men knew I wasn’t there for anything except work. I wore clothes baggy enough not to show anything important, but snug enough not to catch on any moving machine parts. I performed my job as well as some men and better than others.</p>

<p><bold><italic>I taped photos of my kids on my tool box and made sure the men knew I wasn’t there for anything except work.</italic></bold></p></disp-quote></p>
<p><italic>In 1977, I was twenty-five years old when I entered a strange new world—a steel mill. I was part of a large group of women Inland Steel hired that year, the year the government started offering tax credits to employers that hired women and people of color (a black woman counted for two credits, one for being a woman and one for being black). This was a huge change for the mill. The men had to take down their girlie pictures in preparation for our arrival.</italic></p>
<p><italic>I was the third woman hired into the Field Force department. The locker room was my home away from home. I stored extra, warmer clothes in my locker and hung a picture (my sister’s art project) on a wall to bring some color into the room.</italic></p>
<p><italic>During my three-month probation period, I was sick and missed a day of work. When I came back the next day, something was off. I was the only one in the locker room, and it wasn’t like I was real early or late. I went across the street to find my boss. He was upset and his eyes didn’t want to meet mine. He told me there was no work for me anymore. My coworker J. B. later gave me the low down. Some upper management man did not want women working in “his” department.</italic></p>
<p><italic>I had so many garbage bags full of stuff from the locker room that I couldn’t fit my sister’s picture in any of them. It would tear through the bag, so I had to leave it behind. I have wondered what happened to it.</italic></p>
<p><italic>I was terminated from Field Force and re-hired into the Blast Furnaces department, all in the same day. I got a new hire date and had to start the probation period all over again. Later, I heard that women were moved into one of these “primary” departments—which were dirtier, smellier, more labor-intensive, and more raw materials-oriented—because they assumed the working conditions would make us want to quit.</italic></p>
<p><italic>When we reported for our shifts, we all parked outside the mill gates, entered through a clock house, and were bused into our respective work areas. I now entered a different, much smaller clock house. The last one featured a long corridor I had to walk through, which was like walking the gauntlet. Groups of men lined up along the wall to wait for their bus. I had to walk by all of them to get to the area where my bus got loaded. One guy would elbow another—look, look, there goes a girl. It was as if they had all been in prison and you were the first woman they’d seen in twenty years. So I was glad for this new clock house.</italic></p>
<p><italic>Women at today’s Inland Steel have no idea what it was like in the beginning. Now, all employees have drive-in passes, and there is no longer a gauntlet to walk—literally speaking, anyways.</italic></p>
<p>I knew I’d feel the familiar sting of isolation but quickly noticed that men of color were also few and far between. Experience taught me that other “firsts” made the best work buddies. Earl Mays, the first African-American apprentice machinist at the railroad soon became my first wheel shop friend. Emmet Jones, a machinist and World War II veteran had been the only black man in the shop before Earl arrived. Emmet retired a month after I started and Earl (having completed his apprenticeship a few years before) took Emmet’s place as the only black machinist at the Railway.</p>
<p>Another “first” was Eddie, also an African-American. He was a Vietnam vet and the best machinist helper on the wheel mounting press. He knew how to brush/slap the oily white lead paint on the axle seats with just the right thickness to mount those wheels with ease and accurate tonnage. He also knew how to stare at bad-news foremen long and hard enough to make them leave the area.</p>
<p><italic>The steel mill was my first real exposure to other racial groups. There were about thirty women working in Blast Furnaces, and the majority of them were black. I learned not to call a black person colored.</italic></p>
<p>Men like Emmet, Earl, and Eddie had witnessed and felt more discrimination and hatred from management and backward-thinking coworkers than I would ever know. But there was one wheel shop employee who was worse than merely “backward” thinking. I’ll call him Mr. Mofo.</p>
<p>Mr. Mofo was the kind of man who bragged about everything from his sex life to the deer he’d shot out of season to the fact that his father-in-law sponsored his membership at the all-white golf course (which remained segregated even after Milwaukee’s racist housing law was abolished). Mr. Mofo didn’t play golf. He just liked “being with [his] own kind.”</p>
<p>In addition to being a racist, Mr. Mofo was a sexist, often declaring that he could machine more wheels than any “damn bitch”—but he actually couldn’t, without having them rejected for poor finish and bad measurements.</p>
<p>The eyes in the back of my head wouldn’t even chance a blink when he was around, just in case he would pinch my butt again (which he did when he first transferred into the shop). I’d reacted by spinning around and whacking him with the wrench in my hand. Red-faced and rubbing his shoulder, he scurried away like the rat that he was.</p>
<p>One afternoon he smeared bearing grease on the rungs of a steel ladder while I was on top of a platform of machined axles, twenty-five feet in the air. I’d caught sight of him as he walked in the isle below. There were no other coworkers in the area. And, of course, there was zero grease on the rungs when I’d climbed up.</p>
<p>I was told Mr. Mofo gave himself away by being the only one around to laugh and point when my unknowing foot slipped on one of those greased rungs on the way down, causing me to tumble to the concrete floor and bang against a cement block wall. At the hospital, they told me I was lucky because I could’ve had more than a dislocated shoulder, sprained ankle, gash in my head, and concussion, considering my hard hat popped off during the fall.</p>
<p>Two months later, I came back to find Mr. Mofo gone. He transferred to another shop. I heard the decision was his, after a few of my friends beat the hell out of him while I had been en route to the emergency room. Management stayed clear because there were “really no witnesses to anything.”</p>
<p>In the end, I honed my craft with some of Milwaukee’s finest working-class men and, in return, earned some friendships, some respect, and every scar and muscle I developed.</p>
<p><italic>The mill developed a Recruitment Training Program (we were shown how pulleys worked, saw which gear moved faster, etc.) to help us pass craft tests. I passed a test that got me into the pipefitter’s gang, the second woman to be a part of that group.</italic></p>
<p><italic>I learned how to cut and thread pipe, and how to use two pipe wrenches to attach or break apart pipes. I was learning a new language. They have a file called a bastard file. I thought the guys were messing with me when I was asked to bring a little bastard back from the storeroom. When Unc, short for Uncle, told me it really was a file, I went to get one. Unc was the most respected person, as well as the best fitter, in the gang. I never got assigned the honor to work with him. I usually got the fix-the-toilet jobs.</italic></p>

<p><italic>In Blast Furnaces, I was living in a fish bowl. With women being such a novelty, all the men wanted to say hi. They would act hurt if you didn’t give them a hello as you walked through the shop.</italic></p>
<p><italic>The small things you did were newsworthy. One day, I was eating lunch outside at the pump house. A guy from another department was walking by to go to the lake.</italic></p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p><italic>“What’s for lunch?” he asked.</italic></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p><italic>I told him it was chicken noodle soup.</italic></p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p><italic>“Why?”</italic></p>
<p><italic>“Well, it’s easy to pack, it’s quick, and even low in calories.”</italic></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p><italic>A few days later, I stopped in at their shop for a cup of coffee. Lo and behold, I hear that I am on a diet, eating chicken noodle soup for lunch. The rumor mill ran 24/7. I heard I was pregnant and had an abortion (neither was true). You have to toughen up and not let things hurt your feelings. You learn to deliver lines like, “since you can’t get the story straight, at least spell my last name right.”</italic></p>
<p><italic>You didn’t need to stand on a scale to weigh yourself. The men around you had your body memorized. You would be told, “It looks like you’re putting on some weight there.”</italic></p>
<p><italic>It was easier to be in a smaller group of guys than working with a large group of them. With larger groups, there was the group mentality factor, where people will do things they would never do if they were by themselves or had less of an audience.</italic></p>
<p><italic>I had one mechanic come up to me in the lunch room, run his two fingers up and down my back, saying “safety check, checking to see if you’re wearing a bra.” I played it off and left the room. I laid in wait to get him alone before telling him he was never to do that again. To his credit, he apologized. He thanked me for telling him one-on-one, and not embarrassing him in front of the guys. Sometimes, you have to nip things in the bud. I sure didn’t want things to escalate. You need to let those who are testing you know where your boundaries are.</italic></p>
<p><italic>Then there were the exams they wouldn’t let certain people pass. After a few weeks of lectures, we took craft tests to work in 4 AC and 5 BH (two different divisions of the Utilities department). We had books that covered things like pumps, motors, boilers, fans, hydraulics, water pH and treatment. We were given sample questions to help us study. Rosemary and I were study partners. She always had the right answer when I asked her anything. We both passed the tests for 4 AC, but not for 5 BH. I know she passed that test. I might have missed it by one or two, but not her. They never let you see your test results or the questions you missed, so they could tell you anything they wanted.</italic></p>
<p><italic>George, from the Blast Furnaces pipe gang, was the first black person to pass the mechanical test. Advancement in the primary departments came quicker for men of color than for women.</italic></p>
<p><italic>Last summer, I talked to one of the first women to have worked at Inland Steel. She started out working summers, while going to college, and worked her way up to an automation manager position. She recently retired, at a fairly young age, and felt that the glass ceiling had thickened in the last fifteen years. I’m guessing that, even in the twenty-first century, fewer opportunities were open to her once she reached a certain level, and that she watched less capable men get promoted before her.</italic></p>
<p>Today’s tradeswomen are here to stay. But sexual harassment and other forms of sex and race discrimination dog their footsteps, continuing to be the major reasons women leave jobs they love and work they perform with skill and pride.</p>
<p>There are still women who never see another female worker at their job site. I know women who couldn’t eat in their own lunch rooms because of porno videos that foremen brought in for the guys to enjoy. I know sisters whose only bathroom at work had walls plastered with graphically accurate drawings of female anatomical parts being molested with tools. There are women serving trade apprenticeships whose total training consists of filling vending machines and standing around with a red stop sign at the corner of a construction area.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p><bold><italic>Blue-collar women are still barely above 2 percent of the total national workforce in the construction industry.</italic></bold></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>How are they fighting back? Some document their work lives in powerful prose, poetry, and art, knowing the future can only change with knowledge of the past. On television screens, we now see skilled craftswomen on house repair shows and other “how-to” programs. But this doesn’t make up for the fact that blue-collar women are still barely above 2 percent of the total national workforce in the construction industry.</p>
<p>Tradeswomen use the internet’s social media mechanisms to reach out to one another for immediate critical support. Additional support, advice, and networking can be found in workshops at the annual “Women Building California and the Nation” conference. Since 2001, thousands of trade sisters have gathered at these events, which have become an international anti-isolation experience.</p>
<p>Today’s smart young women know how to make friends with the good guys (like my old wheel shop brothers, Emmet, Earl, and Eddie). And they make sure their internal “wiring” includes a set of eyes in the back of their heads to watch out for another Mr. Mofo!</p>
