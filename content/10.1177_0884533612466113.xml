<abstract>
<p><italic>Background</italic>: Cystic fibrosis (CF) affects approximately 30,000 people in the United States and is characterized by pulmonary disease and poor nutrition. Optimal nutrition is associated with better pulmonary function, and aggressive nutrition interventions have played a major role in increased survival. Even though the CF Foundation (CFF) has published treatment guidelines for certain areas of nutrition care, there may still be variability in other areas. Thus, the purpose of this study was to survey current practices among CF dietitians. <italic>Materials and Methods</italic>: A 25-item web-based survey was developed and sent to nutrition professionals via the CFF nutrition listserv. Responses were anonymous. Areas of practice surveyed included nutrition care for infants, pancreatic enzyme replacement, vitamins and bone health, and miscellaneous practices. Descriptive statistics were used to report the results. <italic>Results</italic>: Among the 76 respondents (21% response rate), there was general agreement regarding nutrition practices for infants and pancreatic enzyme replacement. Responses varied regarding enzyme administration with gastrostomy tube feeds and in practices related to bone health. Of miscellaneous practices, there was agreement regarding zinc supplementation and appetite stimulants. However, opinions varied regarding concern for coronary artery disease with the CF high-fat diet. Practices related to use of acid blockers also varied. <italic>Conclusion</italic>: The results of this survey demonstrate good agreement among nutrition professionals in some areas and variability in others for the nutrition management of patients with CF. Areas of variability point to the need for further research and continued additions to the guidelines and consensus statements.</p>

<body>
<p>Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common life-threatening autosomal recessive inherited disorder in the white population. Over the past decades, the median predicted survival for individuals with CF has improved dramatically.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0884533612466113">1</xref></sup> One of the major factors contributing to this increased survival has been the understanding of the role of optimal nutrition on overall health status of individuals with CF.</p>
<p>According to the CF Foundation (CFF) nutrition consensus guidelines,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0884533612466113">2</xref></sup> children and adolescents with CF are expected to experience typical growth when appropriate nutrition and pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT) are provided. Studies have shown that in children with CF, better nutrition status was associated with improved linear growth and better pulmonary function,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0884533612466113">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0884533612466113">4</xref></sup> and interventions to establish weight gain led to improvements in pulmonary function.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0884533612466113">5</xref></sup> Since there is a strong association in people with CF between body mass index (BMI) and overall health metrics, especially lung health,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0884533612466113">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0884533612466113">7</xref></sup> the CFF has identified nutrition goals. It recommends that children with CF maintain a BMI ≥50th percentile, women a BMI &gt;22, and men a BMI &gt;23. However, malnutrition is still prevalent in children and adults with CF.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0884533612466113">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although nutrition plays an essential role in the treatment of CF, guidelines were not established until 1992.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0884533612466113">8</xref></sup> Afterward, the CFF released consensus reports on nutrition for pediatric patients with CF in 2002<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0884533612466113">9</xref></sup> and 2008.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0884533612466113">2</xref></sup> In 2009, treatment guidelines for infants with CF, including nutrition recommendations, were published.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0884533612466113">10</xref></sup> These guidelines provide evidence-based and consensus recommendations for many aspects of nutrition in people with CF, but there are still areas of practice not guided by specific recommendations due to lack of definitive evidence in the medical literature. Due to these gaps in knowledge as well as continuous advancement in the evaluation of macro- and micronutrient deficiency in CF, it is likely that nutrition recommendations for patients with CF will continue to change. Therefore, even though there are well-established nutrition practices and consensus guidelines for certain areas of practice, there may still be variability in other areas by individual practitioners who treat patients with CF.</p>
<p>In this study, our objective was to describe current nutrition practices of dietitians who work with CF patients, identify practice differences among the respondents, and highlight areas of uncertainty that may lead to research questions.</p>
<sec id="section1-0884533612466113" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>A 25-item questionnaire was developed by a multidisciplinary team led by a registered dietitian to identify specific nutrition recommendations for CF care. Questions consisted of multiple-choice, yes/no, and free-text items. Areas of practice surveyed included the following: nutrition care for infants, PERT, vitamin supplements and bone health, and miscellaneous practices. The sections for PERT, vitamin supplements and bone health, and miscellaneous practices applied to both pediatric and adult age groups. Respondents were allowed to choose more than 1 option for multiple-choice questions and were given the option to provide additional free text on 16 of the 25 questions.</p>
<p>The CFF accredits 115 CF care centers nationwide, including 96 adult care programs. The CF nutrition listserv was developed to discuss and share information related to nutrition in CF. The survey was approved by the institutional review board and distributed via a web-based survey (SurveyMonkey) to the CFF nutrition listserv. It was addressed to dietitians, and reminders were sent twice via the listserv. Responses were anonymously collected from July to October 2009. Descriptive statistics were used to report the results (SigmaStat version 3.5; Systat Software, Chicago, IL).</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>There were 76 respondents with a response rate of 21% based on a total of 361 listserv members from the United States, Canada, Australia, and the United Kingdom. More than 90% of the respondents were from the United States. Respondents were from various CF care center types, including 42.1% from pediatric, 18.4% from adult, and 39.5% from centers that care for both adult and pediatric patients.

<title>Nutrition Care for Infants</title>
<p>Of the 66 respondents who answered survey questions regarding nutrition care for infants, most respondents preferred breast milk (77.3%), fortified breast milk (54.5%), and/or concentrated formula (48.5%). Other recommendations included standard calorie formula (18.2%), concentrated hydrolyzed formula (6.1%), and hydrolyzed formula (1.5%). For pancreatic enzyme dosing and administration, most respondents dose enzymes based on weight (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0884533612466113">Table 1</xref>) and recommend administration in an acidic food such as applesauce (87.9%). However, only 14 of 46 (30.4%) were able to correctly explain the rationale for administering enzymes in an acidic food (to prevent the enteric coating from dissolving too early). Other responses included the following: enzymes can be given in anything (n = 4), acidic foods are preferred but anything is acceptable (n = 4), or enzymes can be given directly into the mouth (n = 2). Reported starting doses ranged from 500–2000 units of lipase per kilogram per feeding.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0884533612466113">
<title>PERT</title>
<p>PERT practices were consistent (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0884533612466113">Table 1</xref>), as were clinical assessment practices to evaluate therapy. Most respondents indicated that fecal elastase should be used for diagnosis of pancreatic insufficiency and that clinical measures should be used for the assessment of efficacy. In general, enzyme administration practices were similar. However, responses varied regarding how to dose enzymes with gastrostomy tube (GT) feeds. More than half of the respondents also reported using bicarbonate buffered enzymes and/or a powder enzyme formulation, neither of which is currently available in the United States.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0884533612466113">
<title>Vitamin Supplements and Bone Health</title>
<p>Most respondents reported routine use of a multivitamin supplement in patients who are pancreatic sufficient (86.8%). Of these, 52.2% reported using a CF-specific vitamin, 20.9% a regular multivitamin, and 26.9% the use of both. Bone health practices are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0884533612466113">Table 2</xref>. Practices related to vitamin D were similar, with most respondents using cholecalciferol instead of ergocalciferol and measuring vitamin D levels without regard to season. For those who reported measuring during a specific season (n = 9), 55.6% reported measuring during the winter months. The doses of vitamin D varied with a range of 400–5000 international units (IU) daily. The age at initiation of routine bone density scans varied, with most (66.7%) starting during the teenage years and others starting at age 10–12 years (16.7%) or younger than 10 years (16.7%). The youngest reported age for initiating bone density scans was 4 years.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0884533612466113">
<title>Miscellaneous Practices</title>
<p>More than 90% of the respondents reported that they do not use zinc supplements routinely. Less than half of the respondents (44.7%) recommend the use of probiotic supplements when patients are receiving antibiotics. Most (63.2%) respondents do not recommend the use of fiber supplements routinely.</p>
<p>Most respondents reported use of acid blockers. Some centers recommend them for all patients (16.7%) and others for reflux (75.0%) and/or nutrition problems (66.7%). Most (92.1%) respondents reported using appetite stimulants. Of those who reported which appetite stimulants are used at their centers (n = 66), most use cyproheptadine (83.3%), some use dronabinol (30.3%) and/or megestrol (25.8%), and a few use mirtazapine (7.6%) and/or oxandrolone (1.5%).</p>
<p>When asked whether there was concern for the development of coronary artery disease with the typical high-fat CF diet, 69.7% reported that they were not concerned. Of those who expressed concern and provided comments (n = 20), 60% recommend inclusion of healthier fats such as ω-3 and monounsaturated fats. Several comments included a description of the types of patients who would prompt them to recommend heart-healthy dietary recommendations. These included patients who are pancreatic sufficient, obese, and/or those with elevated cholesterol levels.</p>
<p>Finally, only 4 (5.3%) respondents reported routine screening for anorexia nervosa in adolescents.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The results of this survey describe the current clinical practices for CF nutrition care, primarily in the United States. They also highlight that although there is generally good agreement in many areas, practices vary in some aspects of CF nutrition care. Although not surprising, this underscores the continuing need for periodic revision of guidelines and consensus statements.</p>
<sec id="section8-0884533612466113">
<title>Nutrition Care for Infants</title>
<p>The results of this survey demonstrate good overall agreement on practices for the nutrition care of infants with CF. The recommendation by most respondents to use breast milk is consistent with recommendations from the CFF for the care of infants with CF, as is the recommended dosing of PERT.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0884533612466113">10</xref></sup> Responses to the free-text question regarding the rationale for the administration of enzyme beads in an acidic food demonstrate knowledge gaps. For infants and small children who are unable to swallow enzyme capsules, caregivers should be counseled to sprinkle the enzyme beads onto a small amount of acidic food for the child to swallow without chewing. Pancreatic enzymes are acid labile, and the beads are enteric coated to protect them from gastric acid. The coating is designed to dissolve when the pH increases in the duodenum. Administering the beads in an acidic food such as applesauce allows the enteric coating to remain intact. If they are administered in a food with a higher pH, such as pudding, the coating will dissolve and the enzymes will be destroyed when they reach the stomach. Despite the inaccurate explanations, most respondents do recommend administration in an acidic food. However, it is concerning that a subset of respondents does not agree that it is necessary to administer enzymes in an acidic food, which highlights the need for continued education on this topic.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0884533612466113">
<title>PERT</title>
<p>Although there was good overall agreement regarding assessment of pancreatic insufficiency and effectiveness of replacement therapy, there were differences in how enzymes are administered to patients receiving GT feeds. This likely reflects the lack of clinical trial data to assess the best method. The 2002 consensus report for nutrition in children with CF acknowledged the lack of data regarding dosing enzymes in relation to GT feeds.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0884533612466113">9</xref></sup> The report recommended administering the enzyme dose at the beginning of the tube feed and that an additional dose in the middle or at the end of the feeding may be necessary. Our survey results support that this is the current practice, with most of our respondents recommending that enzymes be given before and after feeds.</p>
<p>Another challenge with PERT for GT feeds is administration of enzymes via GT rather than by mouth. This may be necessary because of an inability to swallow or simply letting a child sleep when the dose is in the middle of an overnight feed. However, there is not an evidence-based recommendation for best practice. More than 40% of survey respondents in this study reported using Viokase (Axcan Pharma US, Birmingham, AL), which was available as a powder, either mixed with formula or given as a bolus. However, since April 2010, there is no longer a powder formulation manufactured and available in the United States. Shlieout et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0884533612466113">11</xref></sup> evaluated the potential for clogged tubes and damaged beads using Creon (Abbott Laboratories, North Chicago, IL) and various types and sizes of tubing. Of 4 types of tubing tested, 3 had to be a size of 18 Fr or larger, and the other had to be a size of 16 Fr or larger. This continues to remain a challenge for dietitians as well as caregivers.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0884533612466113">
<title>Vitamins and Bone Health</title>
<p>Although it is common practice to use a CF-specific vitamin in patients who are pancreatic insufficient, there is little guidance regarding vitamin supplementation for those who are pancreatic sufficient. As such, it is not surprising that practices vary. However, it is surprising that more than 50% of respondents to our survey do use a CF-specific vitamin for those who are pancreatic sufficient. We believe that caution and monitoring are warranted in these cases to avoid toxic levels of fat-soluble vitamins.</p>
<p>There has been recent increased awareness of the high prevalence of osteopenia, osteoporosis, and increased fracture risk in children and adults with CF. Calcium insufficiency and low bone mass are major issues of concern in the CF population. The CFF recommends that people with CF 9 years of age and older receive 1300–1500 mg of calcium daily.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0884533612466113">12</xref></sup> This may be with diet alone or with diet plus calcium supplements. Although only 37% of survey responders recommend routine supplemental calcium for people with CF, those who responded that they do not routinely recommend supplements may be recommending adequate calcium through the diet. More than half of survey respondents reported recommending calcium supplementation when decreased bone density or vitamin D deficiency is present.</p>
<p>It is encouraging that most centers report using cholecalciferol instead of ergocalciferol. This is consistent with recommendations in the recently published guidelines for the management of vitamin D in patients with CF.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0884533612466113">13</xref></sup> However, most respondents reported initiating bone density scans during the teenage years. The most recent bone health guidelines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0884533612466113">14</xref></sup> recommend initiating screening for bone disease at age 8 years if certain risk factors for bone disease are present, including suboptimal weight (≤90% of goal), poor lung function (FEV1 &lt;50% predicted), glucocorticoid therapy, history of fracture, or delayed puberty. All adults (≥18 years old) with CF should be routinely screened. As only 64.5% of respondents report routinely screening with bone densitometry, there is room for improvement among CF care centers in screening for CF-related bone disease.</p>
<p>Most respondents report some use of bisphosphonates, even if rarely. However, of the respondents who reported “never” using bisphosphonates, nearly 8% (n = 6) were from either a mixed or adult-only center. As the prevalence of bone disease increases with age, this may represent underutilization of this therapy. Bisphosphonates have been shown to increase bone density in CF patients with osteoporosis and should be considered when the T or Z score is ≤–2.0 and/or when a fragility fracture has occurred or bone mineral density loss is accelerated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0884533612466113">14</xref></sup></p>

<title>Miscellaneous Practices</title>
<p>A number of other nutrition issues have been addressed by dietitian at CF care centers with little guidance on evidence-based best practice. For example, a high percentage of respondents reported use of cyproheptadine as an appetite stimulant. However, only 2 small clinical trials have supported its use.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0884533612466113">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0884533612466113">16</xref></sup> Similarly, a high percentage of respondents report the use of acid blockers in patients experiencing nutrition problems. However, a recent Cochrane review concluded that there is insufficient evidence that this use results in improvement of nutrition status.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0884533612466113">17</xref></sup> There was less agreement among our respondents for issues such as probiotics and concern about coronary artery disease with the typical high-fat CF diet. These results reflect the gaps in the evidence base and can point the way to future research.</p>

<sec id="section12-0884533612466113">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>There are several limitations to this study. This was a survey of dietitian included in the CFF nutrition listserv and thus did not include those who are not. It is possible that the dietitian not included in the listserv practice differently. There is also the possibility of response bias. The dietitian who chose to respond to the survey may be different from those who did not.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In conclusion, the survey results reveal good agreement among the respondents in some areas and uncertainty in others for the nutrition management of patients with CF. This likely reflects the lack of robust evidence to support evidence-based recommendations to guide treatment recommendations for these areas.</p>
<p>Future investigations should focus on best practices for maintenance bone health and treatment of metabolic bone disease, optimal usage and administration of PERT during GT feedings, safe and effective use of appetite stimulants, and evidence-based usage of acid blockers. In addition, conditions associated with non-CF populations such as anorexia nervosa and dyslipidemia and its related complications should not be overlooked.</p>
