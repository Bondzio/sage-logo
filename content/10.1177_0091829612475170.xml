<p>This book is the first volume of the ASAO Studies in Pacific Anthropology series. Its content was developed over several annual meetings of the association through a common set of background readings and research questions. These meetings, as well as the regional focus, produced the highly cohesive data of this book. The text complements a special edition of <italic>Ethos</italic> (36:4, 2008) on the topic of empathy. Both the journal and the book are a plea for more cross-cultural studies on empathy, which is a topic that has been revitalized due to the recent discovery of “mirror” neurons.</p>
<p>The book is organized in four parts. The first part addresses questions of how the understanding of empathy can change throughout history (including the arrival of Christianity) and how the quest for empathy in cross-cultural situations is only partly achievable but crucial. The second part illustrates the universal and particular aspects of empathy, shaped by different cultural contexts. Part three addresses the moral dilemma that arises between cultural obligations for self-governance and concealing thoughts and emotions, while at the same time showing “enacted empathy” for others. The fourth part provides examples of how empathy can vary within the same ethnic group depending on personality, context, and experience.</p>
<p>Among the recurring themes in this volume are the “opacity of other minds” as a cultural value in many pacific societies and the communication strategies that foster non-transparency. In those cases where empathy is encouraged it is less a matter of cognitive understanding and more of practical care and action. Several authors underline that there is no exact equivalent for “empathy” in the local languages, but every language has expressions that overlap with the semantic field of love/compassion/concern/pity. Another recurring theme is the need for empathy as an ethnographic lens; empathy is essential to discover the emic view (54) but it has its limits in cross-cultural situations—it can grow over time through experience, which is why short-term fieldwork produces less accurate data (112). Therefore, “ethnography should be considered a primary tool … not a secondary or optional one” (212).</p>
<p>This volume is not only of value to anthropologists; it is highly recommended for anybody involved in or preparing for cross-cultural work. It can help raise awareness of the importance and the limitation of cross-cultural empathy, encouraging quality fieldwork, as well as more research into empathy elsewhere in the world.</p>
<p>Jutta Blühberger is from Austria, a PhD candidate at Fuller School of Intercultural Studies, who has worked with SIL for nearly 20 years in Africa, first as language surveyor in the Central African Republic and now as anthropological consultant and coordinator in Mali.</p>
