<title>Background:</title>
<p>The impact of various flows for selective cerebral perfusion (SCP) on cerebral oxidative stress in the immature brain is unknown.

<title>Methods:</title>
<p>Twenty piglets, randomly divided into four groups (each n = 5), were placed on cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) at 20<sup>°</sup>C, then underwent DHCA for 60 minutes. SCP was conducted at flow rates of 0, 25, 50 and 80 ml·kg<sup>-1</sup>·min<sup>-1</sup> through the innominate artery in the DHCA, SCP 25, SCP 50, and SCP 80 groups, respectively. The animals were killed at 2 hours off CPB. Brain tissues were examined for the activity of SOD, MDA and caspase-3, and histological damage was quantitatively assayed by light microscopic examinations.</p>

<sec id="section3-0267659112446524">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>There were no significant differences in the activities of SOD, MDA and the SOD/MDA index between the groups. Caspase-3 activity significantly decreased in the SCP 25, SCP 50 and SCP 80 groups compared with the DHCA group.

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Antegrade selective cerebral perfusion (SCP) during deep hypothermic circulatory arrest (DHCA) has been used to reduce cerebral hypoxia-ischemia (HI) injury in patients undergoing cardiac and arch surgery. The flow rates of SCP applied to newborns/infants undergoing deep or moderate hypothermic circulatory arrest varied from 20 to 92 ml·kg<sup>-1</sup>·min<sup>-1</sup> among different centers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0267659112446524">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0267659112446524"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0267659112446524"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0267659112446524">4</xref></sup> The optimal flow rate for SCP in newborns/infants with arch surgery remains unclear.</p>
<p>Clinical, epidemiological, and experimental studies have revealed that oxidative stress is one of the key factors which contribute to cerebral HI injury and the immature brain has a greater susceptibility to oxidative stress than the mature brain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0267659112446524">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0267659112446524">6</xref></sup> Moreover, the pathogenesis of neuronal death after exposure to hyperoxia or hypoxia/ischemia involves oxidative stress in the immature brain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0267659112446524">7</xref></sup> Therefore, it is an essential task to explore the effects of various flow rates of SCP on cerebral oxidative damage.</p>
<p>Accumulated hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), excessive pro-oxidant production and inadequate antioxidant capacities were observed at 24 h after an HI insult in developing brains.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0267659112446524">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0267659112446524">8</xref></sup> At an early stage after HI, malondialdehyde (MDA) levels and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities increased at 1 ~ 2 h after HI in the cortical neurons of rats.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0267659112446524">9</xref></sup> MDA is an important end product of lipid peroxidation, and an elevated MDA level was accompanied by a decline in total antioxidant capacity of the neurons,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0267659112446524">10</xref></sup> while SOD plays a key role in protecting neurons from reactive oxygen species (ROS) in apoptotic cell death. In particular, mitochondrial MnSOD reduces neuronal apoptosis by suppressing lipid peroxidation, peroxynitrite production and mitochondrial dysfunctions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0267659112446524">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0267659112446524">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>Previous studies suggested that brain damage following DHCA varied over time and activation of the apoptotic mechanisms occurred at an early stage (160 min after the onset of DHCA).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0267659112446524">13</xref></sup> Chock et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0267659112446524">14</xref></sup> reported that a flow rate of 40 ml·kg<sup>-1</sup>·min<sup>-1</sup> for SCP reduced apoptotic neuronal injury at approximately 6 h after DHCA. However, at an earlier stage of reperfusion after DHCA, the impacts of various SCP flow rates on apoptotic neuronal injury are unknown and the relationship between neuronal apoptosis and SOD/MDA in the early phase after DHCA has not been documented. We hypothesized that various flow rates for SCP had different effects on cerebral oxidative stress and apoptotic protein activation. Caspase-3, activated by both extrinsic and intrinsic pathways, is a key apoptotic protein leading to DNA fragmentation and cell death and is the most abundant caspase in the brain. In this study, we examined the early changes in cerebral SOD activities and MDA levels, as well as caspase-3 activities and histological outcome after DHCA combined with different flow rates of SCP in a piglet model.</p>

<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<sec id="section7-0267659112446524">
<title>Study protocol</title>
<p>Twenty piglets, 16 to 19 days old and weighing 3.9 to 5.4 kg, were randomized to the DHCA group (n=5), the SCP 25 group (n=5), the SCP 50 group (n=5) and the SCP 80 group (n=5). Three age-matched piglets served as the control group (n=3), Computer-generated randomization was carried out. The three control piglets did not undergo operations. Twenty piglets were placed on CPB and cooled to 20<sup>°</sup>C. Then, DHCA was conducted for 60 minutes and SCP was conducted at 0, 25, 50, and 80 ml·kg<sup>-1</sup>·min<sup>-1</sup> in the DHCA, SCP25, SCP50 and SCP80 groups, respectively.</p>
<p>All animals were humanely treated and in compliance with the Principles of Laboratory Animal Care formulated by the National Society for Medical Research, and the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals published by the National Institutes of Health. The Animal Care and Use Committee of Fuwai Hospital, Peking Union Medical College approved the protocol for this study.</p>
<sec id="section8-0267659112446524">
<title>Anesthesia and perioperative management</title>
<p>The piglets were anesthetized and intubated with a endotracheal tube after intravenous administration of midazolam (0.2 mg·kg<sup>-1</sup>), fentanyl (10 μg·kg<sup>-1</sup>)and vecoronium (0.4 mg·kg<sup>-1</sup>). The animals were mechanically ventilated using a ventilator (Drager, Savina HM02, Lübeck, Germany). The tidal volume was 10 ml·kg<sup>-1</sup>, the respiratory rate was 26 to 28 bpm, the I:E was 1:1.6, and the inspired oxygen fraction was 0.8. Anesthesia was maintained with the inhalation of 0.6% to 1% isoflurane and an intravenous injection of fentanyl (5μg·kg<sup>-1</sup>), midazolam (0.1mg·kg<sup>-1</sup> ), and vecoronium (0.4 mg·kg<sup>-1</sup>) during and after CPB.</p>
<p>An arterial line was placed through an incision in the right axillary artery and a central venous line was placed in the right internal jugular vein. Arterial blood gas was measured using an analyzer (NOVA CCX, Nova Biomedical, Waltham, MA, USA). Probes were inserted into the cranial epidural space, the nasopharynx and the rectum to monitor brain, nasopharyngeal, and rectal temperatures, respectively. Electrocardiograph, arterial blood pressure, central venous pressure, and all temperatures were continuously monitored using a Philips MP50 monitor (Philips Electronics, Aachen, Germany).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0267659112446524">
<title>Operative technique and cardiopulmonary bypass</title>
<p>After a midline sternotomy, the pericardium was opened. Heparin (400 U/kg) was given to keep the activated clotting time over 480 seconds. The ascending aorta was cannulated with an 8Fr arterial cannula and the right atrium with a 20Fr venous cannula. The CPB circuit consisted of roller pumps (Jostra HL20, Hirrlingen, German), a membrane oxygenator (Terumo baby RX, Tokyo, Japan), and a heat exchanger (Hemotherm Cooler/Heater; Jostra). The circuit was primed with 300 ml of fresh donor whole pig blood and 100 ml of colloid solution, together with 2000 IU heparin. CPB was initiated at a flow rate of 100 to 150 ml·kg<sup>-1</sup>·min<sup>-1</sup>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0267659112446524">
<title>Deep hypothermic circulatory arrest and selective cerebral perfusion</title>
<p>Cooling to 28<sup>°</sup>C was undertaken (pH-stat management) after stable CPB was established, then cardiac arrest was achieved by clamping the ascending aorta and adding 20ml/kg St.Thomas’ solution through a cannula into the aortic root. Iced saline, placed in the pericardium, was applied to afford myocardial protection. When cooling to 20<sup>°</sup>C (measured in the cranial epidural space), the left carotid artery, the left subclavian artery and the descending aorta were clamped and SCP was initiated at a perfusion rate of 25, 50, and 80 ml·kg<sup>-1</sup>·min<sup>-1</sup> in the SCP 25, SCP 50 and SCP 80 groups, respectively. The inspired oxygen fraction (FiO<sup>2</sup>) was 0.3-0.5 during SCP. A mean perfusion pressure of 40~60 mmHg and a mixed venous saturation higher than 65% were maintained. DHCA (with or without SCP) duration was 60 min, after which the piglets were re-warmed to a temperature of 35<sup>o</sup>C to 36<sup>o</sup>C, by using an alpha-stat strategy for arterial blood gas management, and weaned from bypass. An electric heating pad was applied to the animals to maintain normothermia up to 2 hours after CPB termination. A temperature difference of more than 5<sup>o</sup>C between the perfusate and brain measurements was avoided. The minimum perfusate temperature permitted during cooling was 17<sup>°</sup>C and the maximum perfusate temperature during re-warming was not allowed to exceed 38<sup>°</sup>C.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0267659112446524">
<title>Brain tissue</title>
<p>The animals were killed at 2 h after weaning from CPB, then the skull was opened and the left frontal cortical tissue samples (400-500mg) were obtained. One sample was saved in a liquid nitrogen-cooled reservoir and the other sample was immersed in 10% formaldehyde. The frozen tissue stored in liquid nitrogen was prepared for detecting the activities of SOD, MDA and caspase-3, and the fixed tissue was prepared for hematoxylin-eosin (H&amp;E) staining.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0267659112446524">
<title>Measurement of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and malondialdehyde (MDA) activities</title>
<p>The activities of SOD and MDA were measured by using a commercial colorimetric kit, according to the manufacture’s instructions (Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute, Nanjing, China). Briefly, the activities of total SOD (T-SOD) were determined by the xanthine-xanthine oxidase reaction. Frozen cortical samples were homogenized and the homogenates were centrifuged, then the supernatants with added reagents were incubated for 40 min at 37°C, followed by detecting the absorbance at 550 nm using a spectrometer. T-SOD activities were calculated and the results defined as U/mg protein. MDA levels were determined by measuring thiobarbituric acid (TBA)-reacting substances at a wavelength of 532 nm. The supernatants were added to trichloroacetic acid and TBA-reactive substance reagent and were incubated for 40 min at 95°C, followed by detecting the absorbance at 532 nm, using a spectrometer. MDA levels were calculated and expressed as nmol/mg protein. Protein content was determined according to the Coomassie brilliant blue method, using bovine serum albumin as the standard.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0267659112446524">
<title>Assay for caspase-3 activity</title>
<p>Caspase-3 activities were measured using a colorimetric assay kit (Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute). Frozen cortical samples were homogenized and the homogenates were centrifuged, then the supernatants were added to 10 μl cell lysis buffer and 80 μl reaction buffer, followed by 10 μl Ac-DEVD-<italic>p</italic>-nitroanalide (Ac-DEVD-<italic>p</italic>NA) substrate. The cell extracts were incubated for 4 h at 37°C. The release of <italic>p</italic>NA from the Ac-DEVD-<italic>p</italic>NA upon cleavage by caspase-3 was detected by following the absorbance at 405 nm. One unit of caspase-3 is the amount of enzyme that will cleave 1.0 nmol of the colorimetric substrate Ac-DEVD-<italic>p</italic>NA per hour at 37<sup>°</sup>C under saturated substrate concentrations.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0267659112446524">
<title>Histological examination</title>
<p>Histological changes in the cortical samples were observed by using H&amp;E staining. H&amp;E–stained slides were calculated for apoptotic and necrotic cells under high-power bright-field (400×) by an independent experienced pathologist. Apoptotic cells were defined by the presence of nuclear karyorrhexis and minimal cytoplasmic change, while necrotic cells were identified by a pyknotic nucleus or no nucleus, along with a swollen, eosinophilic cytoplasm as previously described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0267659112446524">15</xref></sup> The apoptotic or necrotic cell count was averaged from 9 high-power fields from 3 slides from the same region in each animal.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0267659112446524">
<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>Data are presented as mean±standard deviation. Statistical analysis was performed using SAS 9.1 (SAS Inc., Cary, NC, USA). Groups were compared using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) (multiple means were compared with the LSD test). Measurements during and after CPB were compared using repeated measures. When the data were not consistent with normality or equal variance assumptions (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.10), groups were compared using the Kruskal-Wallis test. The Pearson correlation was used to analyze the relationship between the variables. Values of <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05 were accepted as significant.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>There were no significant differences in animal weight and age between the groups (<italic>p=</italic>0.98 and <italic>p=</italic>0.94, respectively). No significant differences of physiologic or hemodynamic data were observed between the groups at baseline, cooling to 20<sup>°</sup>C, 10 min after reperfusion, off CPB, and 2 h off CPB time points during the operation.

<p>Histological injury in the cortical samples was significantly more in the DHCA group compared with that seen in the SCP25, SCP50, SCP80 and control groups: an average of apoptotic or necrotic cells per nine high-power fields (400×) was 15.60±4.9 vs 4.00±2.24, 15.60±4.9 vs 2.40±1.14, 15.60±4.9 vs 7.40±4.16, and 15.60±4.9 vs 0.67±0.58, respectively (Kruskal-Wallis test, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05); apoptotic or necrotic cell count had a marked (but not significant) decrease in the SCP25 and SCP50 groups compared with the DHCA group. Injury in animals undergoing DHCA was a combination of necrosis and apoptosis whereas, in animals undergoing SCP with different flow rates, injury appeared mostly to be apoptosis.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our study demonstrated that, at approximately 4 h after DHCA combined with different flow rates of SCP, MDA and SOD activities in the frontal cortical brain region showed no change, whereas caspase-3 activities had a marked change. The changes in caspase-3 activities were consistent with neuronal injury.</p>
<p>In the present model, no significant changes in cerebral MDA and SOD activities were observed under either DHCA or different flow rates for SCP. Previous studies had reported that SOD and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) provide a primary defense against oxidative stress through the ability to scavenge free radicals.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0267659112446524">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0267659112446524"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0267659112446524">18</xref></sup> However, we didn’t find increased T-SOD activities and MDA levels at 4 h after DHCA. Jiang et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0267659112446524">8</xref></sup> also found no decreased GPx activities in cortical neurons at similar time points after HI. This may be explained by two reasons: first, the oxidative damage might be mild in the early phase after DHCA and second, it was likely that the study with a small number of piglets in each group may have insufficient statistical power to detect a slight effect.</p>
<p>Interestingly, caspase-3, a key apoptotic protein, was significantly activated at 4 h after DHCA. Although SCP at three different flow rates reduced the caspase-3 activation, SCP at 25 and 50 ml·kg<sup>-1</sup>· min<sup>-1</sup> are superior to 80 ml·kg<sup>-1</sup>·min<sup>-1</sup> in reducing activated caspase-3. Caspase-3 is an executioner molecule and is the most abundant caspase in the brain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0267659112446524">19</xref></sup> It was reported that caspase-3 could also activate caspase-activated DNAse, finally leading to DNA fragmentation and cell death.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0267659112446524">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0267659112446524">21</xref></sup> Apoptotic mechanism activations were several-fold more pronounced in immature than in juvenile and adult brains.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0267659112446524">22</xref></sup> Ditsworth et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0267659112446524">15</xref></sup> reported that caspase-3 activities in the neocortex, measured by enzyme assay, increased significantly from 8 h to 72 h after DHCA in newborn piglets, whereas significant caspase-3 active fragments (17-20 kDa) were found at 4 h and 24-72 h after DHCA by Western blotting. In our study, caspase-3 activities measured by colorimetric assay increased significantly at 4 h after DHCA, indicating early activation of caspase-3 in this piglet model of CPB.</p>
<p>Previous studies have suggested that many pharmaceutical neuroprotections are related to the anti-oxidative and anti-apoptotic properties in cerebral and spinal cord ischemic models. However, the direct correlation between neuronal apoptosis and SOD/MDA in the early phase after ischemic reperfusion has not been documented. In this study, we characterized the activities of MDA and SOD in relation to the caspase-3 activities. We found that MDA levels, SOD activities and the SOD/MDA index had no correlation with caspase-3 activities. Studies have shown that ischemic neuronal injury occurs via oxidative stress and/or mitochondrial dysfunction, leading to an apoptotic cascade activation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0267659112446524">23</xref></sup> However, in our model, there was no relationship between oxidative stress indicated by SOD/MDA and apoptotic protein activation in the early phase after DHCA.</p>
<p>Our study also showed that increased caspase-3 activity was consistent with histological damage. Animals undergoing SCP with different flow rates had less injury showing in histopathology than the animals undergoing DHCA and the dead cell count under light microscopy had a trend of decrease in the SCP25 and SCP50 groups compared with the DHCA group. However, there was no significant difference in apoptotic or necrotic cell count at high-power field between the study groups. The reason may be due to the semiquantitative score system, non-parametric statistic test, as well as the small number of animals in each group. From all the above results, we concluded that SCP at 25 and 50 ml·kg<sup>-1</sup>·min<sup>-1</sup> may be superior to SCP at 80 ml·kg<sup>-1</sup>·min<sup>-1</sup> in reducing apoptotic neuronal injury. An ideal flow rate of 50 ml·kg<sup>-1</sup>·min<sup>-1</sup> had been proposed, based on the theoretical calculations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0267659112446524">24</xref></sup> Cerebral blood flow (CBF) at the SCP rate of 50 ml·kg<sup>-1</sup>·min<sup>-1</sup> was equal to the CBF at total body perfusion (100 ml·kg<sup>-1</sup>·min<sup>-1</sup>) during neonatal CPB.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0267659112446524">25</xref></sup> In our center, clinicians use a 40% to 50% body full-flow rate (100~150 ml·kg<sup>-1</sup>·min<sup>-1</sup>) during deep hypothermic (20°C) CPB in newborns and, thus, the SCP flow rate of 80 ml·kg<sup>-1</sup>·min<sup>-1</sup> provides possibly excessive blood flow which could be harmful to the immature brain. To date, lack of standardization in cerebral perfusion rates is one of the major issues in the clinical setting. Our findings suggested that a flow rate between 25 and 50 ml·kg<sup>-1</sup>·min<sup>-1</sup> for SCP might be the optimal perfusion rate. However, the downward trend of the dead cell count in the SCP 25 and SCP 50 groups is still needed to be further investigated in the future.</p>
<p>This study has several limitations. First, MDA and SOD cannot represent a total redox status. To ensure a full evaluation, more oxidative/antioxidant parameters should be involved in future studies. Second, previous studies revealed selective neuronal vulnerability to HI in the developing brain. In our study, only the frontal cortex was detected and, thus, the outcome cannot reflect the overall oxidative damages in the brain. Third, TUNEL staining and/or electron microscopy, which are more sensitive and specific for the detection of apoptosis, have not been used in this study. The result of this study should be interpreted with caution. Finally, given the small number of animals, further studies with a larger sample size are needed to confirm the relationship of oxidative stress and apoptotic neuronal injury.</p>
<p>In conclusion, in the early phase of reperfusion after DHCA, there was no correlation between the oxidative stress indicated by MDA and SOD and the key apoptotic protein activation. However, the changes in apoptotic protein activities were consistent with the histological outcome. Additionally, the results of this study suggested that SCP at 25 to 50 ml·kg<sup>-1</sup>·min<sup>-1</sup>might be the optimal flow rates in order to reduce apoptotic neuronal injury.</p>
