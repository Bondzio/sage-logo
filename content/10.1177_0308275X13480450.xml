<p>Jean Lave is justly famous for her work on apprenticeship and especially her work on apprenticeship among tailors in a place called Happy Corner in Liberia. The original research on this subject was carried on between 1973 and 1978. She has published a number of studies based on this work most notably two major studies in 1988 and 1991. Throughout the period between the field research and the more recent publications she has engaged with a number of anthropological theories of education and of the transmission of knowledge. Her ideas are closely related to those of a group of researchers of which she was a member, many of whom were close associates of Michael Cole. Their original inspiration came <italic>via</italic> him from Vigotsky. The importance of her contribution over this long period fully justifies that, in 1993, she was invited to deliver the Lewis Henry Morgan lectures at the University of Rochester. This book is based on these lectures.</p>
<p>An invitation of this sort is often the occasion for going back over a lifetime's work and this is what Jean Lave has done. The problem this creates, however, is that it implies the obligation of saying something new or at least demonstrating continuing advance. This is what she aims to do here. She wants to criticise other work on apprenticeship and learning more radically than she had done before; this criticism is intended to apply also to her own earlier work. Her criticisms focus on two points. The first is that earlier work had not sufficiently taken into account the full political economic and power context within which the tailors of happy corner live their lives and secondly that her work and that of other anthropologists and ethnographers had not been sufficiently politically engaged. In fact she argues that these two points are really two sides of the same coin.</p>
<p>On the theoretical side what she most clearly wants to distinguish herself from is some of the work of educational psychologists writing in the post war period and up to the 1970s. These are associated to more contemporary figures in anthropology and psychology although these are rarely named. All these people, she tells us, contrasted informal and school learning while implicitly disparaging the former. Even those subsequent writers who were more sympathetic to informal learning were, she argues, still caught in the mind set of formal education when they discussed ‘knowledge transfer’ or when they distinguished between, on the one hand, ‘teachers’ or ‘coaches’ and, on the other, ‘learners’. Instead all aspects of life should be studied and apprenticeship should only be analysed as part of a wider political context. This should avoid justifying any form of hierarchy by incorporating it within the theoretical terms.</p>
<p>Her criticism of these earlier writers is also methodological. She wants to reject the methods of all types of psychologists who use experimental methods to study the subject of education and learning. This is because these ignore the full complexity of the setting in which apprenticeship occurs. The experimental situation inevitably creates a dualism between body and mind and thereby removes social and political context from the focus of study.</p>
<p>This is, by now, a familiar stance more especially in American anthropology. However, even though it thrives in criticising others it is rarely subject to close scrutiny. One problem is that, as here, the identity of the multi headed enemy and his contemporary significance is not all that clear. Admittedly the educational psychologists have stressed the contrast between school education and other forms of learning and have been concerned with the vexed question of whether what is learnt in school is of any use outside school but this concern seems legitimate since they mainly work in institutions which train school teachers and reflect on the efficacy, or otherwise, of what they do. The criticism of the devaluation of informal learning by educationalists is, by now, widely accepted, thanks in part to Jean Lave's own work. Furthermore, her criticism seems to forget that things have moved on in psychology since the work of the main writers she takes to task. The calls for an ‘ecological psychology’ are more than 50 years old. Similarly the championing of a more ‘embodied’ understanding of cognition has been made again and again both in psychology and anthropology. Bourdieu is only mentioned in one foot note, Gibson, Varela, Damásio and A. Clark not at all. These omissions are significant because they mean that she is able to ignore criticisms of positions similar to hers. The main difficulty in saying that all aspects need to be taken into account is that such a call can never be satisfied. This is a really old chestnut. Except for differences in the language used, what she seems to be calling for is in fact very close to what Malinowski wanted with his emphasis on ‘context of situation’ and by his early use of the word ‘embodiment’ as a means for criticising classical theories of meaning. In reality stressing the need to take all aspects of a situation into account can amount to little more than naïve empiricism. After all, it is obvious that experimental methods distort reality but, at least, by abstracting problems, they make them manageable and thus advance understanding. The virulence of her denunciations makes her ignore what could be gained by experimental methods. Thus her discussion of the cognition of mathematics (she uses the word interchangeably with arithmetic), which, furthermore, is a subject to which she has contributed, could be advanced if she took into account recent developments in the study of the subject by cognitive scientists and neurologists which have been obtained by the kinds of methods she dislikes.</p>
<p>Linked to this more academic discussion of embodied cognition is a call for political engagement by social scientists. Like many of us, Lave is frustrated by the apparent political irrelevance of what academic anthropologists study and write about in a world characterised by obscene inequalities and exploitation. Her solution to this dilemma is what she calls ‘critical ethnography’. Sadly I don't think the problem is so easily resolved. Critical ethnography should include a reflection on the practice of anthropology and a rejection of the kind of theories she criticises because, she tells us, they are divisive in a variety of ways. This argument enables her to synthesise her political, theoretical and methodological criticisms and to denounce an apparently single enemy characterised by its fondness for ‘binary’ contrast. Such stance has been familiar in the work of a number of, mainly American, anthropologist and has often been labelled by them ‘Marxist’. Yet, however much we may share their, and Jean Lave's, frustration (I certainly do) one may doubt whether the problem is so easily resolved and whether this type of radical rhetoric is actually political. The suspicion that it is not is increased by the kind of language used. Its obscurity means that it does not seem to be destined to go beyond the academy. It may even be that the obscurity is unconsciously intended to hide, from both the readers and the writer herself, the painful fact that what we do in universities has only very indirect and weak political significance. I cannot but be struck by the contrast between the clarity of the parts of the book which discuss her work among the Tailors of Happy corner and the sheer difficulty of understanding the language by which she attempts to merge politics, psychological and anthropological criticism. It seems no accident that, when attempting such an unlikely feat, a usually clear writer should come up with long and tangled sentences such as: ‘Rather than saying that to get to the truth of human being we must figure out its most basic elements and build up from there, relational ethnography recognises that the truth of human being is its historical processual coming to be and that we can only get at it by starting with our existing, given, social life, that is, with social practice in the historical present, in its political-economic, cultural-institutional arrangements in the conjuncture, working backward and forward in time and space rather than up and down a chain of abstractions’ (p. 154). The reader will enjoy those chapters dealing directly with Happy Corner and apprenticeship, as such, more than this sort of stuff.</p>
