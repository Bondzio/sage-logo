Any canon or corpus of classics identifies excellence and impact, but like any archive is inevitably selective and indicative of contextual power-relations. The marginalisation of excellent work through lack of engagement has impoverished our disciplinary inheritance, notably through gendering our discipline's narrative and epistemology. Any emerging attempt to define even fluid and dynamic canons needs to be inclusive and reflexive.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>canon</kwd><kwd>classic</kwd><kwd>engagement</kwd><kwd>gender</kwd><kwd>inclusive</kwd><kwd>reflexive</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>There are four key points that I would like to highlight in relation to this debate on canonical geographies. The first is my preference for the nomenclature of the ‘classic’ rather than ‘canonical’. The second is the exclusionary nature of the canon, notably the absence of women’s geographical work from the canon. Third, the need for <italic>engagement</italic> with geographical work deemed significant for whatever reason. Finally, a call to appreciate – but also to look beyond – texts when framing the historical legacy of the discipline.</p><p>The terms canonical and classic are often treated as synonymous; but etymological distinctions are quite significant. The term geographical canon is suggestive of a disciplinary family history in textual form: family heirlooms to be passed on generation to generation – all of which imply a certain reverence. Canonical – in so far as the modern use of the term is grounded in Ecclesiastical law – implies a degree of regulation, perhaps even of compulsion. The classic is of the first class, acknowledged as outstanding and remarkable. Hence, I think we should be more concerned with <italic>classics</italic> rather than the canon. However, the very process of identifying a cohort of ‘classic’ texts results in a canon – or perhaps multiple sub-disciplinary canons, which have implications for the way we research, write, teach and referee, and for the ways in which the narrative of our discipline is discursively framed and disciplinary norms perpetuated.</p><p>If ‘classic’ texts are our disciplinary inheritance, how do we view that bequest? Items sacred to one generation are passed on to the next because of their intrinsic or symbolic value. As with all inheritances, the recipients might find the bequest to their taste or not, and some bequests might be rejected outright by the next generation: old fashioned, obsolete, downright wrong. But as with any beneficiary, historians of the discipline should reflect carefully on their inheritance, able to acknowledge what particular artefacts represented to predecessors, as well as to appreciate the quality and skill of their production, even if their final form might not be to our taste. As with all historical evaluations, we need to be aware of the influence of current views and priorities, those that are influential at the time of a text’s production and also <italic>our</italic> reception, that is, sensitive to the influence of presentism. One should also keep a weather eye on circulations of intellectual taste, because fashion is always changing. If we take a historiographer’s view, we may be able to discern the influences of cycles of intellectual fashion and distinguish between the classic and the <italic>fashionable </italic>in the long-term. Classics can be representative of their moment, have ongoing influence on ideas and methodologies, or be resurrected from relative obscurity. Each of these threads of influence is important to understanding the tapestry of our discipline’s history.</p><p>This leads me to my second point, reflecting on who gets included, who gets excluded, and why. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2043820612468548">Powell (2012</xref>: 523–524) notes, ‘the very act or remembering is an act of discipline’, canons – and even lists of classics – are inevitably selective. Given my own research interests, theoretical grounding and politics, I’m bound to ask (once more): where have all the women gone? (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2043820612468548">Monk, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2043820612468548">2004</xref>, on geography in the United States). Wherever there is a received ‘canon’, questions concerning who as well as what constitutes that canon need to be asked (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2043820612468548">Chance, 2005</xref>, on medieval history and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2043820612468548">Dowson, 1995</xref>, on poetry). Although attention given to the likes of Susan Smith’s <italic>Crime, Space and Society</italic>, Anne Buttimer’s <italic>Values in Geography </italic>and the Women and Geography Study Group’s volume <italic>Gender and Geography</italic> (1984) to be found within the journal <italic>Progress in Human Geography’</italic>s ‘Classics in Human Geography’ series is to be applauded, only a small amount of women’s work is featured within this collection. The same is true of anthologies and collections such as <italic>Key Thinkers on Space</italic> (2008) and the <italic>International Encyclopaedia of Human Geography</italic>, both notable for the minimal presence of women’s work. The question has to be asked – why so few? The answer is not ‘blowin’ in the wind’ as Bob Dylan suggested in 1962, but rather in the ether that is disciplinary significance, manifest as reputation.</p><p>Through its inevitable selectivity, any canon reflects power, the power to include and exclude. While it is not a prerequisite to be a woman to read women’s geographical work, the historiography of Anglo-American geography has tended to be a male preserve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-2043820612468548">Withers, 2010</xref>), which may account in part for the degree of gender-bias in our discipline’s identification of key figures and texts. This in turn has implications for our collective sense of family identity and our respective individual place within that family and heritage, but also ultimately for the gendering of geographical knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2043820612468548">Maddrell, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-2043820612468548">Rose, 1993</xref>).</p><p>This leads me to my third point, the significance of <italic>engagement </italic>with academic work. In the course of analysing the production and reception of 120 years of women’s geographical work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2043820612468548">Maddrell, 2009</xref>), the reviews of texts proved significant, but so did the difference between a book’s initial review and its longer term influence through its life-course (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2043820612468548">Maddrell, 2009</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2043820612468548">Keighren, 2010</xref>, on Semple). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2043820612468548">Ormsby’s (1931)</xref> <italic>France. A Regional and Economic Geography </italic>is a prime example of the mobility of received opinion over time and the difference between initial reviews and the reach and performance of the book. The book was welcomed but critiqued by British and French geographers, HJ Fleure and Raoul Blanchard; the critique focused on Ormsby’s use of watersheds to define the boundaries of regions, but also because of her discussion of <italic>economic</italic> rather than <italic>commercial</italic> geography. Watersheds aside, history has vindicated Ormsby’s espousal of economic over commercial geography in the long-term, and the book itself went on to be the leading UK university text on France for over 30 years – at a time when audiences for and the number of practitioners of regional geographies were at their height. It was still in demand in the 1940s when it had gone out of print and a second edition was commissioned in 1950, 10 years after Ormsby had retired, with statistics updated by FJ Monkhouse (who went on to write numerous texts of his own, including <italic>Geography of Western Europe</italic> in 1968). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2043820612468548">Fleure (1932</xref>: 511) described Ormsby as having ‘adopted a position of her own which she maintains with characteristic firmness’, yet neither her innovation nor long-term influence is acknowledged within histories of the discipline, which at best reduce her work to an aside and generally consign regional studies (by both women and men) to a disciplinary Room 101 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2043820612468548">Maddrell, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2043820612468548">2009</xref>).</p><p>Above all, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2043820612468548">Keighren et al. (2012)</xref> have highlighted the speedy nature of both canonization and rejection of texts peculiar to human geography and a disciplinary tendency to ‘throw out the baby with the bath water’ when evaluating antecedent work. Women’s geographical work seems to have fared particularly badly in these sieving processes that result in our collective remembering and honouring of our disciplinary inheritance. In part, this reflects wide if not wholesale rejection of preceding modes of geographical enquiry such as the regional method within our disciplinary story-keeping, thereby bleaching out part of the rich texture and pattern of our inherited tapestry; but we also have to ask whether there is simply a failure to engage with women’s work per se, which has an implication for their status in the discipline as well as what might be considered significant, influential, ‘classic’. ‘As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2043820612468548">Dowson (1995</xref>) has argued of women’s poetry, women’s representation in disciplinary histories has been hampered not by the absence of publications, but by the relative absence of <italic>critical engagement</italic> with that work’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2043820612468548">Maddrell, 2009</xref>: 335). This links to Johnston’s observation that a text might be ‘cited much more often than it is sighted’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2043820612468548">Johnston, 2011</xref>: 244). Citation might be read as indicative of engagement, but as such that ‘engagement’ can be a very superficial one, one which acknowledges the existence of a body of work through name-checking, but which fails to attend to, disseminate, reinforce or critique the detail of that work.</p><p>Finally, a word of caution on the privileging of texts, even classics, as though they were produced in a vacuum. We can argue for acknowledgement of and engagement with a dynamic body of texts which have (and may continue to) manifest excellence and influence, but these are simply the material vehicle of people’s ideas, observations and analysis. As I have argued elsewhere, we need not only broaden the cast in terms of peopling any geographical ‘canon’, but recognise the historical value of a broader body of geographical work found in other spaces and practices, including a wider range of texts (e.g. school texts, guide books, etc.) and the legacy of non-textual work such as field courses, films, public addresses and editorial work, in order to gain a more rounded view of our discipline’s history and our inherited legacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2043820612468548">Johnston, 2011</xref>).</p><sec id="section1-2043820612468548"><title>Conclusion</title><p>If we view our disciplinary history as an inherited tapestry, some sections of that tapestry have been carefully curated and preserved, with each new generation brought to pay homage to the skilled weaving and rich patterns, while other sections are faded and moth-eaten, and tend to be hidden behind other more pleasing objects; the threads are still intact but it is difficult to make out the pattern, especially from a distance, and unless restored, that part of the tapestry will continue to decay.</p><p>The focus here has been on texts and for any text to have an impact on thinking and understanding, in the short- or long-term, it needs critical <italic>engagement</italic>. Engagement with women’s geographical work has been woefully limited within accounts of the Anglo-American discipline. This not only has implications for understanding and repopulating any representative historical canon, but also has implications for present practice. We may enjoy the fashionable in the moment, but the challenge in research and teaching is to look beyond the fashionable for quality to treasure from the past and in the present, in texts, but also in other spaces and practices of geographical work.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bibr1-2043820612468548"><citation citation-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Chance</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name></person-group> (<year>2005</year>) <article-title>Introduction.
