<abstract>
<p>Composting facilities in Thailand have faced various operational problems, resulting in the emission of odours, incomplete digestion of waste organics, and higher than desired costs. Composting technologies imported from developed countries tend to be sized for larger communities and are otherwise not suited for the rural communities that comprise more than 80% of all communities in Thailand. This article addresses the research and development of a novel composting technology aimed at filling this observed need. The study was divided into two parts: (1) the development of a new composting technology and fabrication of a prototype configuration of equipment; and (2) scale-up and study on a pilot-scale using real rubbish. The proposed technology, called ‘serial self-turning reactor (STR)’, entailed a vertical flow composting system that consisted of a set of aerobic reactors stacked on a set of gravity fed turning units. In-vessel bioreactor technology enables the operator to control composting conditions. The researchers found that a tower-like STR results in flexibility in size scale and waste processing residence time. The pilot-scale experiments showed that the proposed system can produce good quality compost while consuming comparatively little energy and occupying a compact space, compared to traditional land-intensive windrow composting facilities.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The current practice of municipal solid waste (MSW) composting in Thailand is most likely an open-pile type, such as windrows and static pile. Some closed systems such as static bed reactor and bio-cell are found in big cities. They were chosen due to their higher performance and ability to control odour and flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0734242X12469675">Lu et al., 2009</xref>). However, the scale inflexibility and cost are the limitations of those technologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0734242X12469675">US EPA, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>The survey found that most of the communities in Thailand generated less than 50 tons of waste per day (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0734242X12469675">PCD, 2006</xref>). Those communities were defined as ‘small size’ which account for 80% of 7000 communities in Thailand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0734242X12469675">PCD. 2006</xref>). The most difficult part was putrescible waste with high moisture content, which needed to be collected and treated before it rotted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0734242X12469675">Guidotti Tee and Abercrombie, 2008</xref>). Many local government authorities (LGAs) used composting but faced problems on operational cost, labour scarcity, and complaints from nearby houses.</p>
<p>The Joint-research Project on Composting Technology (JPCT) was an academic co-operation between Sirindhorn International Institute of Technology at Thammasat University (TU) Thailand and the Department of Civil Engineering, at the University of Tokyo, Japan. It was established in 2005. The aim of this research was to develop a new composting technology for small communities that were generating MSW at a rate that was lower than 50 tons day<sup>−1</sup>.</p>
<p>This article proposes an alternative composting technology that has been developed to solve the above problems and reports a trial of this new technology in actual practice.</p>
<p>The methodology of the study consisted of two parts: (1) developing a new composting technology with regards to the criteria and user requirements, and making a prototype of the new technology for testing; and (2) scaling up to pilot-scale and designing additional equipment for full-scale operation, such as the material preparation and conveying system. This stage also included the modification of the original design, and operation practice for the pilot-scale experimental study with the MSW collected from a real community.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0734242X12469675">
<title>Part 1. Developing a new composting technology</title>
<p>The conclusions from the review found that sets of small-scale MSW facilities operated by LGA would be more appropriate for transitional communities which are referred to as urban-industrial middle-income societies in developing countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0734242X12469675">Amin, 2005</xref>). The treatment facilities can be located and operated in or near a community. Unfavorable conditions such as odour and flies must be controlled and contained. Hence, an in-vessel composting technology was considered, as it is a closed system, and requires less area for operation (Haug, 1994; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0734242X12469675">US EPA, 2000</xref>). This basic technology was improved with regard to four indicators: high performance, low cost, flexibility and environmental friendliness.</p>
<p>The new composting core unit, namely the ‘serial self-turning reactor system’ (STR) has been registered under Thai patent no. 26147. The system consists of vertical aeration-type reactors and sets of self-turning units. These two types of units are connected vertically, making a series of composting and turning processes in alternate sequence.</p>
<sec id="section3-0734242X12469675">
<title>Vertical flow reactors</title>
<p>The aerobic reactor was designed to be a square sectional box to make the ratio of volume to exposed surface (v/s) as high as possible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0734242X12469675">Figure 1</xref>). Hence, the side walls were insulated with 10 mm polyvinylchloride (PVC) with exposed surfaces at the top and bottom. A larger capacity box would lead to a shallower layer, which was not enough to conserve heat and moisture, whereas a large depth of material would make it too dense due to self compaction.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0734242X12469675-fig1.tif"/></fig>
<p>The reactor is made of durable materials to withstand chemical erosion. It uses vertical aeration through perforated pipes and odour venting passages. The reactor door mechanism, located at the bottom of each reactor, controls the composted mass flowing through the self-turning units below. The doors can be closed and opened to adjust the period of composting in the reactor.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0734242X12469675">
<title>The self-turning unit and gravitic mixing technology</title>
<p>The self-turning unit, namely ‘BioMY-BOX’ is the new feature of the STR. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0734242X12469675">Bongochgetsakul et al. (2007)</xref> developed this technology based on the concrete mixing unit ‘MY-BOX’ which was first introduced by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0734242X12469675">Matabee et al. (1998)</xref>. The self-turning units are installed below the reactor unit. They contain no mechanical hardware but only complicated passages to direct flows of different types of material while falling down and impacting the walls of the unit due to gravity. This creates the mixing process of the loaded material.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0734242X12469675">Figure 2(a)</xref> illustrates the gravitic mixing mechanism that is used when materials are put into the mixing unit. There are two types of mixing boxes which are named according to the direction of passage: clockwise type (CW) and counter-clockwise type (CCW). A combination of the two types diverts and separates materials into parts and mixes them together while they are falling through the tower (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0734242X12469675">Figure 2(a)</xref>). This technology was used to develop two components of the STR system: (1) a mixing tower for mixing material in the preparation stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0734242X12469675">Figure 2(b)</xref>); and (2) the self-turning units for pile-turning in the composting stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0734242X12469675">Figure 2(c)</xref>).</p>

<p>A mixture of compost material is prepared and mixed using the gravitic mixing units and it is then loaded into the topmost reactor. After the composting period in the reactor is over, the composted mass passes to the adjacent self-turning unit, and thence to the reactor below in consequential order, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0734242X12469675">Figure 3</xref>. After the compost mass has passed all the unit sequences, the compost product is obtained.</p>

<title>Prototype test on mixing and self-turning performance</title>
<p>The prototype was an STR prototype which consists of a set of self-turning units that are sandwiched between a pair of reactors on the tower truss. The reactors were made of acrylic and aluminium. The reactor’s rotating doors were made of four sets of stainless blades attached to stainless steel shafts, driven by a chain and sprocket. The self-turning units consisted of 18-cell self-turning boxes with each unit was 35 cm × 35 cm × 42 cm and made of laminated plywood, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0734242X12469675">Figure 4</xref> (left). Other necessary equipment such as the air supply pump, an electric winch, weighing scales and instruments were provided for the tests.</p>

<p>The experiments had two objectives: (1) to examine the mixing performance and turning effectiveness of the mixing and self-turning technology, which is a key component of the innovation; and (2) to test the function of the reactor’s parts such as the rotating doors, and an air dispenser.</p>
<sec id="section6-0734242X12469675">
<title>Material and method in the prototype test</title>
<p>Two series of experiments were performed to study the efficiency of: (1) mixing performance of the gravitic mixing technology; and (2) the pile-turning that used the proposed technology in comparison with manual turning.</p>
<p>For the passages, four self-turning units were stacked vertically, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0734242X12469675">Figure 5</xref>. A full bucket of dog food and amendments was dumped into the topmost self-turning unit. The mixture that came out from the tower was weighed and compared before and after the test. Uniformity of the mixture was also observed together with moisture content sampling from the different parts of a pile.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0734242X12469675-fig5.tif"/></fig>
<p>The next series of experiments were to compare the effectiveness of the pile-turning mechanism. Two of the 1.0 m × 1.0 m × 1.0 m boxes with perforated plastic pipes and a thermocouple were made to imitate the reactor; one was set for no pile-turning; another was for pile-turning manually. The third case was composted in the STR using self-turning units.</p>
<p>Amendments in this study consisted of three types of materials: cow manure, rice husk and sawdust. They were weighed and blended at 1 : 1 : 1 proportion on a dry weight basis. For the substrate, two types of material were used; the first batch utilized dog food because it contained viable nutrients. The next series utilized mixed vegetable waste which was collected from the local fresh market. The details of the mixing proportions of materials used in this study are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0734242X12469675">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<p>The composting conditions for the experiment were set, based on recommendation from many studies (Haug, 1994; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0734242X12469675">Sawangpanyangkura, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0734242X12469675">Tang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0734242X12469675">Tchobanoglous and Kreith, 2002</xref>), as tabulated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0734242X12469675">Table 1</xref>.</p>
<p>As for the aeration, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0734242X12469675">Tchobanoglous and Kreith (2002)</xref> found that a rate of 0.023–0.026 m<sup>3</sup> kg<sup>−1</sup> h<sup>−1</sup> is optimal for organic degradation. In Thailand, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0734242X12469675">Sawangpanyangkura (2004)</xref> suggested that aeration at 0.03 m<sup>3</sup> kg<sup>−1</sup> h<sup>−1</sup> would have the optimal result for the MSW composting, which was used in this experiment.</p>
<p>A set of three identical composting cases were conducted under controlled conditions throughout the experimental period (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0734242X12469675">Table 2</xref>). Moisture content and temperature were recorded by data logger. They were left until the temperature dropped to normal. The particular pile-turning method was then applied to the corresponding cases. Temperature profiles were plotted and discussed as they were the key parameter representing the bio-reaction rate (Haug, 1994).</p>

<p>The results from the primary test showed that within the practical moisture content, there was no presence of a clogging problem. Less than 5% of the mass was lost after passing through the units, due to the thickness, and water absorption of the plywood. This problem could be solved if the material for making the box was changed.</p>
<p>The outcome mixture had good uniformity. The moisture content of six samples from different parts of the pile showed no significant differences, which indicated that the gravitic mixing technology worked effectively.</p>

<title>Results and discussion on prototype testing</title>
<p>The temperature records in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0734242X12469675">Figure 6</xref> show the results from the first treatment. Before turning the piles, the profiles for all cases were similar. In all cases the temperatures reached nearly 70 °C at the highest point, in a few days, and decreased to ambient in 2 weeks. Pile-turning by manual and self-turning units in the STR were performed on the fifteenth day. Temperature profiles showed that the manual turning case was the most effective in reactivating the compost reaction by reheating. The STR case also had a similar result in reactivation, but the temperature did not increase as much in comparison with the manual case. However, turning a cubic metre of compost manually took 45 min, and needed 9 m<sup>2</sup> working space whereas the STR took 2–3 min with no direct touching of compost material. This indicates that the proposed self-turning technology required a shorter time, less labour and less working space.</p>

<p>It can be seen from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0734242X12469675">Figure 7</xref> that there was lag phase variation in the early stage of composting, even though the mixtures for all cases were prepared at the same time, and had similar properties. This may be because the containers of manual turnings and no-pile turnings were made of plywood and have a plastic liner, which has different water absorption, and heat capacity from the STR one. This may affect perishable material such as vegetable waste more than denatured material like dog food (in the first treatment).</p>
<p>A nutrient check of the product from the second treatment showed that the samples from manual pile-turning and STR have similar results to the standard recommended by The Department of Agriculture Expansion of Thailand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0734242X12469675">DAE, 2009</xref>), whereas the product from the no-turning case became acidic and had higher moisture content (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0734242X12469675">Table 3</xref>).</p>

<title>Study on flow time during pile-turning</title>
<p>From previous experiments, the temperature profile of reactivation of the STR case was lower than that for manual turning. This may be because the pile-turning by the self-turning units was done too quickly so that ammonia, excess heat and moisture could not be released. If this is the case, control of the flow should be considered.</p>
<p>The third treatment was conducted to study the effect of time used on pile-turning by the self-turning units. Three identical composting cases were prepared according to the experimental conditions shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0734242X12469675">Table 1</xref>. The third treatment used the new STR which had been extended to 1.56 m<sup>3</sup>. Its doors were modified to be able to control the flow rate of the compost at about 4 L in one stroke (back and forth in 1 s).</p>
<p>Temperature records from the experiment showed the time used in pile turning had an insignificant effect on reactivations by turning for between 10 and 30 min by the self-turning units (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0734242X12469675">Figure 8</xref>).</p>

<p>Although, the temperature profiles have no lag phase variation in the third treatment, the composting case without pile-turning had a temperature drop that was greater than the others. It also had significantly lower moisture content and carbon content on the fifteenth day. That may be because of a decrease in the biodegradation reaction which resulted in a product that had poorer quality than the others.</p>
<p>It was concluded that the time spent on pile-turning by self-turning units may not result in a reactivation of the composting process.</p>
<p>It was also concluded that the proposed self-turning technology was effective for reactivation of the composting reaction, similar to the manual method, but it took a shorter time, less labour, less energy and less space.</p>

<title>Part 2. Scale up and pilot-scale experiment</title>
<p>The functional test on prototype STR indicated that both reactor and self-turning unit were functional. However, some modifications were needed in order to put the STR technology into real MSW management practice. The improvements were conducted in two parts: (1) a scaled-up STR; and (2) additional equipment for the pilot-scale plant.</p>
<p>Daily MSW collected from small communities varies from 1 to 50 tons. It consists of organic waste (about 50%) with water content up to 70% by total weight. The amount of waste delivered to a composting site can be reduced. The sorting efficiency rate is 40–70% by weight. Its volume decreased during preparation processes such as shredding, mixing, and conveying. Those preparation processes convert the incoming waste into a volume of about 1.5–75 m<sup>3</sup>. Hence, the smallest reactor can be about 1.5 m<sup>3</sup> according to the conceptual design for flexibility of the capacity. It was extended to 1.3 m × 1.3 m × 1.0 m (1.56 m<sup>3</sup>) as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0734242X12469675">Figure 4</xref> (right). The materials used for the reactors, mixing tower and self-turning units were changed for more durability and lower water absorption.</p>

<p>The STR operation processes were designed to avoid the operational problems that occurred in the past. The processes were designed to be the safest, simplest and easiest to handle, as possible. Each activity of the process can be run by two workers, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0734242X12469675">Figure 10</xref>.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0734242X12469675-fig10.tif"/></fig>
<p>The process starts from the delivery of the pre-segregated organic waste which is shredded and reduced to a size of 25 mm in order to prevent clogging problems. The shredded garbage is weighed and mixed with a bulking agent, using the mixing unit. Water is added in this step to control the moisture content of the mixture. The next step is loading the compost mass into the topmost reactor. Air is supplied through vertically perforated pipes while the mixture is left composting in the reactor for 4–7 days. After the composting period, pile-turning is done by opening the rotating doors to let compost fall through the self-turning units, and enter the reactor below to be left for further composting again. This is counted as a composting cycle. The cycles are repeated until the composting pile does not reheat. This indicates that the putrescible matter has been depleted. The composted product is unloaded from the reactor and moved to curing chambers which takes about 2–3 weeks. After the curing stage, screening is required to remove uncompostable impurities, and obtain the composted product at the end of the process.</p>

<sec id="section12-0734242X12469675">
<title>Additional equipment</title>
<p>Additional equipment is needed with regards to the operation processes. Other factors that need to be considered are general availability, maintenance simplicity and energy conservation:</p>
<list id="list1-0734242X12469675" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Shredder and wood chipper: a 5-hp hammer mill shredder which can be used as a wood chipper with sieve #25 mm to control the size of shredded material.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Conveyor for loading the topmost reactor: a bucket conveyor with fixed rail was designed to be movable to serve a row of reactor towers that included a mixing tower to maximize its utilization.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>A drum screening: 1-hp motor with sieve #12 mm is used to improve the quality of the product.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>An inclined conveyor and dump carts are also required for material handling.</p></list-item></list>
<p>The lay-out of the typical STR plant was designed to be used in the smallest area. The working space consists of two main areas. The first area is the STR towers with additional equipment that was put indoors for security reasons.</p>
<p>The second area is used as a working space, far activities such as material preparation, materials storage, or curing. A building is not necessary for this part although a proper pavement is needed for sanitation.</p>

<title>Pilot-scale experiment with real MSW</title>
<p>The MSW that was used in this stage was collected from Thammasat University Rangsit Campus (TU Rangsit). The university was chosen due to its convenience as well as being a target community for implementation. It has been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0734242X12469675">Wisetsumon 2004</xref>) that TU Rangsit had 15 000 inhabitants in 2003, and generated 4.8 tons day<sup>−1</sup> of waste. The waste composition was also similar to general MSW in Thailand.</p>
<sec id="section14-0734242X12469675">
<title>Material and method in the pilot-scale experiment</title>
<p>The substrate in this stage was garbage collected from the food market on the campus. It consisted of food waste, raw food scraps, fruit peels, etc, with moisture content between 60 and 80% by weight with average carbon to nitrogen (C/N) ratio range from 10 to 15. There was about 600–1000 kg day<sup>−1</sup> during the regular semester time.</p>
<p>This experiment took place at the TU Rangsit garbage station. The amendment was changed to the university‘s garden waste due to its availability and cheapness. Branches and leaves from the landscape work were chipped into pieces that were smaller than 25 mm. These half-dried woodchips contained between 25 and 35% moisture by weight, with a C/N ratio of 46. Cow manure was used in the experiment as a source of bacteria, and to control the C/N ratio of the mixture. It had a moisture content of between 10 and 15% by weight and a C/N ratio of 29.</p>
<p>The proportion of the mixture was calculated to keep the C/N ratio within the range of 25 to 35, with the initial moisture between 45 and 60%, by weight. The mix proportions were converted to a volume basis for practical reasons.

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This research and development project was aimed to develop a new composting technology for small communities in Thailand. It progressed along four stages: (1) developing a new composting technology with regards to the criteria and user requirements; (2) creating the prototype and test, focusing on the gravitic mixing and self-turning technology; (3) designing additional equipments for practical operation; and (4) implementing a trial on the pilot-scale STR with the real MSW.</p>
<p>The new technology, namely, the ‘serial self-turning reactor’ (STR) is a vertical-flow composting system that was created from the experiment. It consists of a set of aerobic reactors, sandwiched between a set of self-turning units. An aerobic reactor enables control of composting conditions. A tower-like STR results in flexibility of scale and composting duration.</p>
<p>The prototype of STR was built and tested at Thammasat University, Lampang Campus. The result show that the key functions, gravitic mixing technology and self-turning units, perform quite effectively. Mixing and pile-turning can be operated with ease. The process is quick with energy efficiency, using only a convenient amount of space for operation.</p>
<p>Trial operation on a pilot-scale STR, using the real MSW, showed that the system has high performance and operational friendliness, and requires comparatively less energy and space.</p>
