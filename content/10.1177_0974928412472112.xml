<p>The ‘rise of China’ debate has become one of the core themes of international discourse in the last decade. With the increase in economic might (the last financial crisis clearly highlighted the fact that the Chinese economy is stronger and sustainable), there has been a sustained increase in the military strength of China. The Chinese government has been investing a big share of its resources in developing the military strength. Even though India and China have developed their economic integration on the military side, a lot needs to be done, as economic relationship does not transform into security. The trade figures have been increasing consistently; however, there has also been an increase in the issues which affect the diplomatic political relationship and peace between the neighbours.</p>
<p>The increase in Chinese military strength and technology is an area of concern for New Delhi, keeping in view that China and India still have unresolved border issue and border incursions. As highlighted by the editor, ‘in relation to India, the PLA (People’s Liberation Army) has a special role as it effectively controls vast tracts of territories (in the name of national security) in and around areas adjoining India’ (p. xviii). The situation is further complicated with the close friendship that China enjoys with Pakistan. In a situation like this, the book, <italic>China’s Military and India</italic>, is a good contribution to the existing literature. The Indian academic and policy-making community have always wanted to have and gain as much information on this area as possible. The question whether China and India will engage in a war has always been debated and discussed. A good overview of the existing military strength of China helps to analyse the gaps and disparity which the neighbours have.</p>
<p>This book has seven chapters covering all the important aspects of the Chinese military (military, navy, air force, nuclear, Comprehensive Nuclear Power, military strategy) as well as the recent area in which China has achieved landmark growth and proficiency—space technologies and security. The chapters are very detailed and provide in-depth information about the level of development which China enjoys. However, the constant theme of the chapters is that New Delhi needs to develop its capabilities if it hopes to keep the Chinese threat at bay. An added factor in this is the fact that Beijing has been constantly extending its relationship with the Indian neighbours (Sri Lanka, Nepal and Bangladesh) by way of aid and trade.</p>
<p>Some of the important conclusions in the book are as follows. While discussing the Chinese military build-up, Gurmeet Kanwal argues that ‘the gap between India and China in overall military potential, particularly the gap in strategic weapons, is increasing rapidly in China’s favour’ (p. 20). He further argues that China perceives itself as the rightful leader of the Asian ‘mountain’. In this tussle for domination, there exists the scope of conflict between India and China (p. 22). On the topic of Comprehensive National Power (CNP), Srikanth Kondapalli argues that ‘the main strands in the Chinese debates on China’s grand strategy, its rise in the recent two decades, and argues that although China’s sights are now set at the strategic levels and it has been concertedly preparing for the realization of “strategic opportunities”, its ability to realize these goals are likely to be challenged by rising countries in the region, in addition to the US’ (p. 28). Navneed Kumar in his chapter attempts to discuss and decode the PLA’s military strategy, which is essential for understanding the overall military thinking of China. On the discourse of nuclear weapons and nuclear policy, M.V. Rappai suggests that ‘it is in India’s interest to pursue a policy of good neighbourliness with China to be in a position to deal with it in an equitable manner at bilateral and multilateral levels. Meanwhile India must guard against US and China forming any mechanism to work against the genuine interests of the nuclear deterrence capability of India’ (p. 106). On the development of the PLA Navy, Vijay Sakhuja argues that ‘the Chinese navy is developing significant power projection capabilities and the current force structure and future acquisitions indicate that it can exercise considerable regional influence’ (p. 107). Another important discussion in the book is about the PLA air force. While discussing this, Vishal Nigam argues that China is undertaking massive developments in its air power. This is also because of the fact that Beijing has learnt from history and ‘China is aware that it has no other option but to forge ahead with the development of its defence sector or it will be lagging behind’ (p. 146). On the developments in the space domain, Ajey Lele concludes that ‘from Indian point of view China is capable of gathering wartime as well as peacetime intelligence over the Indian subcontinent. The growth of the Chinese space capabilities is both a motivator as well as a cause of concern but definitely not a reason to panic. However India needs to evolve a separate approach to address its military requirements in Space’ (p. 165).</p>
<p>An analysis of these conclusions highlights the fact that the primary point which almost all the chapters hint at is the fact that there is a need for New Delhi to try and work towards bridging the gap in the military domain between itself and China. If the gap continues to grow, it will become much more difficult for India to negotiate the border as well as regional peace. India needs to work towards maintaining its strength position in the South Asian region.</p>
<p>The book is going to be helpful to scholars and academicians as well as policy-makers who are working on China and trying to understand the Chinese military and its growth trajectory. The editor has also provided the readers with an annexure which provides an elaborate comparison between the Chinese and Indian militaries. However, what is missing is a chapter on cyber security or Chinese cyber policies. At a time when cyber warfare is being regarded as the most probable mode of warfare, it would have been quite enlightening to read on Chinese perceptions and technological capabilities. Though the chapters do deal with the ‘informationisation’ concept, a full-fledged discussion of cyber policies and security would have added to the overall strength of the book. However, the book completely justifies the editor’s point that ‘this collection is being offered to both the specialists as well as the lay person on the developments in the PLA and their possible impact on India’ (p. xxix).</p>
