<title>Electoral Dysfunction</title>
<p>By Victoria Bassetti</p>
<p>The New Press, 2012</p>
<p>More than fifty million Americans are not registered to vote despite being eligible. About a third of those who are registered don’t vote. Wealthy Americans vote at a far higher rate than working people. This book explains that elections in America do not reflect the will of the people, and that Republican governors and legislatures like it that way. They have been systematically passing state laws to reduce voting participation by people of lower income, students, seniors, people with disabilities, and people of color. Bassetti suggests genuine reforms that would make it easier for all Americans to be heard.</p>

<p>By Ozzie Zehner</p>

<p>Perhaps the best film yet about the roots of today’s economic conditions in the United States, domination of public policy by corporate interests, and grassroots resistance that has emerged in the past few years. Other filmmakers should follow the example of the producers of this film who provide it in three lengths—seventy-six, fifty-eight, and twenty-two minutes—for maximum usefulness in local organizing.</p>

<p>Based on a book with the same name, this ninety-eight-minute documentary is quite timely given the recent controversy generated by the Komen Foundation’s blacklisting of Planned Parenthood. Millions of well-meaning people have donated money and volunteer hours to “races for the cure” and other activities that supposedly fund breast cancer research. The corporate sponsors of these “pink” activities, including drug and cosmetic companies, enhance their brand while ensuring that the research does not target the substances in the environment, workplaces, and consumer products that cause cancer in the first place. The film includes interviews with scientists and cancer prevention experts as well as the heads of Komen, the Avon Foundation, and other key sponsors of the pink establishment.</p>

<p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pipedreamsdoc.com">www.pipedreamsdoc.com</ext-link>, 2011</p>
<p>A thirty-nine-minute documentary features ranchers in Nebraska and South Dakota telling why they oppose the Keystone XL tar sands oil pipeline. They explain why they believe the pipeline will actually raise gas prices, contaminate water supplies, and lead to spills that are far more difficult to clean up than conventional oil spills. They say they are being given no choice but to sell right-of-way access, or else the Canadian pipeline company will get U.S. courts to grant that right through eminent domain. A Laborers union official says in an interview that he does not believe there are significant safety concerns and that constructing the pipeline will create jobs.</p>

<p>As global corporations increasingly depend on the Internet, “hacktivism” that interferes with their operations may become as important in pressuring them to act responsibly as strikes once were in the industrial age.
