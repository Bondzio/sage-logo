<abstract>
<p>The intent of this project was to create a formalized educational program for bedside nurses responsible for inpatient diabetes management. Bedside nurses are recruited to serve as diabetes management mentors. The mentors receive advanced education concerning teaching and learning principles, the AADE7™ Self-Care Behaviors, and diabetes management strategies. They teach their peers, advocate for patients, and facilitate referrals for outpatient Diabetes Self-Management Education (DSME) programs. The focus of these ongoing educational activities is to foster the development of diabetes management mentors and to create teaching tools that mentors can use with peers to address practice gaps or skill deficiencies. The diabetes management mentor is integral in enhancing the care of patients with diabetes in the hospital. The empowerment of bedside nurses as mentors for their peers and their patients is an invaluable asset that helps nurses take ownership of their practice. This role could be applied to other complex disease entities, helping nurses to develop specific management skills to improve patient outcomes and enhance patient satisfaction.</p>

<p>Bedside nurses are on the front lines of managing complex and challenging clinical problems. The interventions required to maintain a patient’s optimal glucose level in the hospital are labor-intensive and require frequent adjustments to the insulin regimen. A number of studies have revealed that both nurses’ and physicians’ knowledge of diabetes management principles is suboptimal.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0145721713480246">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0145721713480246"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0145721713480246"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0145721713480246"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0145721713480246"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0145721713480246"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0145721713480246"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0145721713480246"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0145721713480246">9</xref></sup> Nurses are often unfamiliar with the pharmacokinetics of insulin, target blood glucose goals for hospitalized patients, or appropriate treatment of hypoglycemia.</p>
<p>Approximately 30% of patients admitted to the hospital have a diagnosis of diabetes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0145721713480246">10</xref></sup> Although diabetes is common, many nurses remain bewildered by the intricacies of activities that are required to maintain glucose values within target goals. The challenges associated with managing diabetes effectively in the hospital are multifactorial. In addition to inadequate knowledge by all care providers, organizational barriers can be daunting (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0145721713480246">Table 1</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0145721713480246">11</xref></sup> One strategy designed to promote optimal diabetes care involves preparing interested and motivated bedside nurses with advanced diabetes knowledge to combat these barriers. This article describes the structural components necessary to develop and sustain an inpatient Diabetes Management Mentor program. This program has been in effect at a 1200-bed quaternary health care facility in the Midwestern United States for 4 years.</p>

<title>Description of the Program</title>
<p>Diabetes management mentors are an elite group of staff nurses with advanced education in diabetes inpatient management. They advocate for and empower both patients and nurses with knowledge. The title “diabetes management mentor” is used to identify this group of nurses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0145721713480246">12</xref></sup> The word <italic>mentor</italic> was strategically selected because the program’s objective is to nurture the knowledge of both peers and patients while assisting in solving clinical quandaries. The mentors’ willingness to be intellectually challenged and embrace new methods in teaching, communicating, and problem solving is crucial in achieving the program’s goals. Participating nurses embrace the concept of mentoring and are driven to develop their professional potential.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0145721713480246">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>To become a diabetes management mentor, a staff nurse must have successfully completed a 16-hour comprehensive diabetes course and received a recommendation from the nurse manager. In addition, candidates must participate in a formal interview to evaluate their motivation and basic knowledge of diabetes. As a part of the application process, the nurse must acknowledge all of the requirements associated with the role and commit to 9 months of participation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0145721713480246">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0145721713480246">2</xref>). It is important to delineate the expectations of the role when recruiting new applicants to avoid recruiting those who cannot fulfill the requirements. Following the comprehensive diabetes course, diabetes management mentors participate in an 8-hour advanced class titled Promoting Diabetes Self-Management in the Hospital Setting. The advanced diabetes class is routinely scheduled a month after the comprehensive diabetes course to optimize the knowledge gleaned from the prerequisite course. Prior to the classes, candidates are required to read and complete the preassigned course activities that include worksheets, seminal articles about inpatient diabetes, and case studies. The precourse work takes approximately 4 hours to complete, and the time is included in the contact hours awarded upon successful completion of the course. The class content is based on the American Association of Diabetes Educators (AADE) framework of AADE7™ Self-Care Behaviors and includes lecture, discussion, return demonstration, and role-play.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0145721713480246">14</xref></sup> The lecture and discussion content addresses teaching learning principles and describes the diabetes management mentor role and responsibilities. Following the didactic session, the participants are divided into groups of 3 or 4 individuals and assigned a rotation schedule to visit each of the 5 learning stations: oral medications, blood glucose meters, carbohydrate counting, insulin pumps, and insulin regimens/symptom management. At each station the faculty review assigned precourse work pertaining to the subject and provide clarification of incorrect answers or further explanation of a core concept. The stations are interactive and permit the participants to solve problems they encounter in daily practice or examine equipment that is less familiar to them but essential for a comprehensive understanding of the topic. Each participant is assigned a case study prior to class and must demonstrate mastery of the content via role-playing a simulated patient encounter.</p>

<p>The diabetes management mentors’ role and responsibilities are well defined. They are responsible for identifying, prioritizing, and teaching diabetes survival skills; facilitating patient referrals to outpatient diabetes self-management education programs (DSMEs); and consulting the inpatient certified diabetes educator (CDE) for complex patient learning needs. Mentors are also expected to advocate for patients whose glucose control is suboptimal and direct colleagues to appropriate diabetes resources. Mentors are expected to attend 80% of the monthly meetings, educate peers using the monthly teaching tool, and monitor patients on their units for extreme glucose excursions.</p>
<p>Although the initial mentor preparation course creates the foundation for the program, the infrastructure is provided by ongoing educational support. This is accomplished by organized and structured meetings. The monthly educational meetings are designed to provide a forum where clinical problems can be presented and discussed. New equipment related to diabetes management is introduced at these meetings in addition to policy or procedure updates. Each meeting is planned to devote significant time and attention to addressing organizational barriers and generating strategies to address them.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0145721713480246">
<title>Faculty</title>
<p>Five individuals serve as faculty in this program. All are proficient in diabetes care and are versatile in using myriad teaching styles. Although several of the faculty are CDEs, this is not a requirement for a successful program. One of the CDE faculty is both a registered dietitian and a registered nurse. Similarly, the other faculty members represent specialties with a high incidence of diabetic patients and are involved in the development and implementation of hospital policies related to diabetes care. In addition, they are integral members of the interprofessional inpatient diabetes committee that guides diabetes care in the hospital.</p>
<p>Two of the faculty members coordinate the diabetes management mentor program. These activities include serving as facilitators for clinical problem solving to the mentors, providing feedback individually to the mentors quarterly, designing the agenda for the monthly meetings, creating the teaching tools, and consulting with an educational expert conversant in Montessorian philosophy for the congruence of creativity and content. These faculty members also assimilate and disseminate the quality outcome data gathered by the mentors in their monthly reports to the nursing executive team and the interprofessional diabetes care committee gathered by the mentors in their monthly reports.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0145721713480246">
<title>Peer to Peer Teaching Tools</title>
<p>One of the hallmarks of this program is the creation of teaching tools used by the diabetes management mentors when interacting with their peers. The teaching tools are enticing, novel, and clever presentations that address the survival skills of symptom management, medication administration, and blood glucose monitoring and promote participation by increasing the curiosity of the bedside nurses. Occasionally, topics such as carbohydrate counting, meal planning, or diabetes issues that should be included in handoff communication are presented in a teaching tool. The content of these tools is predicated on a number of factors: suggestion by a mentor, medication error reports, audit of monthly glycemic values, patient feedback, direct observation of mentors, and trends in the literature.</p>
<p>Montessorian education principles of self-direction, cooperation, and facilitation are fundamental to these teaching tools.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0145721713480246">15</xref></sup> Maria Montessori was the first female physician in Italy who became an innovative educator, applying her knowledge of growth, development, and psychiatry to developmentally delayed and physically handicapped children in the poorest and most crime-ridden areas of Rome. Montessori espoused that children were naturally curious and could thrive in a methodically prepared environment. She also believed that learning occurs in a cooperative atmosphere marked by social interaction and peer teaching.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0145721713480246">16</xref></sup> This educational philosophy has relevance for the adult learner focusing on prepared materials that promote curiosity, competence, and creativity. The teaching tools created for this program are designed to visually engage the learner and are assigned clever names to pique nurses’ interest. These tools serve as vehicles for inviting nurses into a brief conversation about a specific diabetes management concept and help to reinforce or reintroduce essential nursing interventions. The tools facilitate learning in a nonthreatening and cooperative environment that inspires curiosity and encourages the nurses to seek additional knowledge on diabetes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0145721713480246">Figures 3</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0145721713480246">6</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>The teaching tools were created initially to assist the mentors with structuring their educational encounters among peers. Descriptions of 4 tools are presented that vary contextually from basic to complex. They have changed over time from 5 questions to 3 after feedback from the mentors identified that 5 questions were too many to permit spontaneous interactions with peers.</p>
<p>The elements of hypoglycemia rescue in conscious patients are reinforced in the first tool created, which introduced Harry Hypoglycemia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0145721713480246">Figure 3</xref>). The colorful character reminds bedside caregivers of the critical elements in the treatment of hypoglycemia including sources and grams of carbohydrate, the commensurate effect of carbohydrate on glucose level, the need to be mindful of rebound hypoglycemia, and the required documentation in the electronic medical record. This simple teaching tool provides a successful vehicle for promoting the critical components involved in hypoglycemia rescue.</p>
<p>The teaching tool Carry Out This Order poses questions about insulin-prescribing decisions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0145721713480246">Figure 4</xref>). Packaged within traditional Chinese food takeout cartons are fortune cookies, and the “fortunes” are slips of paper containing different physician orders. In each of the 5 scenarios, nurses are required to consider the appropriateness of a physician order and explain the clinical rationale for their judgment. The scenarios include the following situations: resuming insulin pump therapy, transitioning from a continuous insulin infusion to subcutaneous insulin, adjusting home insulin regimens to accommodate the acutely ill patient in the hospital setting, and identifying resources for support in the clinical setting. Many of these clinical dilemmas reflect patient scenarios experienced by bedside nurses daily. The goals for this tool are to promote an appreciation of the nuances associated with insulin prescribing, encouraging patient advocacy, and fostering interprofessional communication skills.</p>
<p>Critical thinking and clinical reasoning are addressed in another teaching tool titled Flip Your Thinking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0145721713480246">Figure 5</xref>). The content is case-based and captures the decision making surrounding the management of the acutely ill patient with diabetes. Flip Your Thinking consists of a miniature spatula with 4 word balloons. The tool emphasizes the need for the bedside nurse to understand the glycemic goals and rationale related to insulin management. Nurses’ knowledge is assessed and applied in the following situations: the patient with gastroparesis, the use of basal insulin administration in the preoperative period, correctional insulin as the sole insulin regimen for hyperglycemia, and the advantages of intravenous insulin infusion in the management of hyperglycemic crisis.</p>
<p>Pump It Up is a recent teaching tool that concentrates on care of the patient wearing an insulin pump in the hospital (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0145721713480246">Figure 6</xref>). A “boom box” image with 3 tape cassettes posing questions is used to query nurses about safe nursing practices for such patients. Questions eliciting the components of the insulin order for pump use, glucose excursions while the patient is wearing the pump, and actions to take if the patient has been exposed inadvertently to electromagnetic fields are posed in this tool. As the prevalence of inpatients using insulin pumps increases, it is essential that bedside nurses are aware of hospital policies directing care and strategies to advocate for these patients.</p>
<p>The teaching tools have evolved over time. The mentors requested a summary of critical points contained in the tools. This has resulted in the “key points” handout that accompanies each tool (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0145721713480246">Figures 3</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0145721713480246">6</xref>). The mentors also asked for evidence-based literature supporting the concepts that are contained in the teaching tools. A timely or seminal article reinforcing the teaching tool theme is distributed with the teaching tool. These documents are posted in the nursing unit’s conference room by the mentors for all staff to review</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0145721713480246">
<title>Administrative Support</title>
<p>The success of the program is predicated on nursing executive support. Bally<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0145721713480246">17</xref></sup> purported that chief nursing executives are instrumental in creating a mentoring culture. The chief nursing officer (CNO)/vice president for nursing (VP) must embrace and champion the program or it will not succeed or be sustainable. The CNO serves as a champion by recognizing the need, allocating resources, and providing verbal feedback and recognition of the mentor group at both executive meetings and quarterly updates for nursing staff. The Diabetes Management Mentor course is offered twice a year with a maximum of 15 participants per class. Over the past 4 years, 60 participants have been prepared for the role and 25 have resigned from program. Of the 25 who resigned, 18 individuals either were promoted to a new position or completed nurse practitioner graduate study, whereas 7 individuals resigned from the role because they were unable or unwilling to meet the role responsibilities.</p>
<p>The CNO, after determining that the diabetes management mentor role was integral to enhancing diabetes care, approved the practice of mentors being released from direct care activities for 8 hours a month. The 8-hour commitment includes attendance at the 90-minute monthly educational meeting. The diabetes management mentors spend the remaining 6½ hours per month using the teaching tools with peers, conducting hypoglycemia audits, creating newsletters for staff, and teaching survival skills to patients. The nurse managers have been very supportive in crafting mentor schedules that are flexible and that meet both the patient care need and mentor responsibilities. Nurses work primarily 12-hour shifts and rotate unless they are permanently assigned to work the night shift. In one scheduling option, the mentor does not have a patient assignment for the first 4 hours of the 12-hour shift. Another option allows the mentor to work an 8-hour shift entirely devoted to mentoring activities. There is a unique staffing option called “parent shift” where nurses can work up to a maximum of 6 hours per day. There is no set shift time for the parent shift nurse, which allows for maximum flexibility and coverage of the unit during high-activity times. Three of the mentors are parent shift nurses who are not counted as direct caregivers when they work. Any remaining time is negotiated with the management team throughout the month. Some mentors choose to use the day of the meeting to complete their audits and engage in educational activities with their peers. Many prefer this approach because they feel invigorated after the meeting and use the teaching tools that were just demonstrated with staff. This reflects the use of one of the Montessorian principles of immediacy, which means applying or using what you have just learned.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0145721713480246">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>The time dedicated to mentors’ activities is the greatest expense of this program (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0145721713480246">Table 2</xref>). The mean cost of initial and ongoing education of 1 mentor is $4200. Although this may seem an exorbitant cost to invest in one nurse, the CNO believes that this program is transformative for both patients and nurses and is willing to commit the financial resources to contribute to its success. Furthermore, every mentor has described an interaction with a peer that resulted in prevention of a hypoglycemic event. These interventions alone have resulted in a positive financial impact for the hospital. In a study investigating the economic cost of hypoglycemia, researchers found that the total inpatient charges were higher for those individuals who developed hypoglycemia (mean $85,905; median $33,446) than for patients without hypoglycemia (mean $54,038; median $17,609; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001). Moreover, the length of stay was significantly longer for patients who experienced hypoglycemia (mean 11.7 days; median 8.0 days) than for patients without hypoglycemia (mean 5.1 days; median 3.8 days; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0145721713480246">19</xref></sup></p>

<p>Each mentor is responsible for teaching 10 peers every month using the teaching tools that are distributed at the monthly meeting. The mentors solicit feedback using an evaluation tool. The tool evaluates learner satisfaction and probability of using content in daily practice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0145721713480246">Figure 7</xref>). Mentors also monitor hypoglycemic events using an audit tool (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0145721713480246">Figure 8</xref>). This tool identifies contributing factors, resolution, and adherence to the hospital’s hypoglycemia protocol.</p>

<p>Another key to sustaining a program of this nature is creating a process for communicating with the nurse manager. The nurse managers are kept informed of the salient clinical issues that the mentors are addressing. A synopsis of the meeting’s agenda, discussion, clinical issues, and the topic for the instructional tool is sent to each of the nurse manager immediately after the meeting via e-mail. If a mentor is not meeting core role expectations, the facilitator of the program, the mentor, and the nurse manager meet to discuss obstacles and create an action plan for success. Occasionally mentors resign from the program when it becomes apparent that they are unable to fulfill their obligations. Personal leaves of absence have been granted when mentors anticipate that they will not be able to meet the requirements for up to a 6-month period.</p>
<p>Identifying the impact of the program is the final element in successful program sustainability. Reduction in hypoglycemic events, prevention of insulin errors, adherence to the hypoglycemic protocol, and referrals to outpatient education are metrics that are assessed annually. Hospital-wide, adherence to the hypoglycemia protocol has increased by 50% since the implementation of the program. Staff nurse satisfaction and reported increase in knowledge are also assessed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0145721713480246">Figure 8</xref>). A final measure of impact is the diabetes management mentor’s self-assessment. Increases in knowledge, self-confidence, and willingness to take risks have been reported by the mentors.</p>
<p>The diabetes management mentors actively seek out learning opportunities that will promote their advocacy and discernment skills. They were instrumental in creating the National Diabetes Month Education Fair, showcasing different diabetes management strategies. The first fair focused on the AADE7 Self-Care Behaviors and the second concentrated on evolving strategies designed to address organizational barriers encountered in caring for patients with diabetes in the hospital. The fairs were successful and served as a vehicle for the mentors to educate other health care professionals and promote their contributions to diabetes inpatient management.</p>

<title>Lessons Learned</title>
<p>This program has evolved over the last 4 years, serving as a vehicle for enhancing nurses’ diabetes knowledge as well as contributing to their professional development. Essential to creating a thriving program is selection of the right person. In the beginning, any staff nurse who expressed an interest was accepted into the program. However, it soon became evident that staff members had varying degrees of knowledge, commitment, and tenacity. In addition, nurse managers held different expectations for individuals in this role. Finally, the initial open forum design of monthly meetings was intended to promote discussion of clinical issues; however, the mentors often left the meeting feeling frustrated that problems were not specifically resolved or corrected. As a result, important lessons have been learned: have very clear, specific, and measurable expectations; establish communication mechanisms with nursing leadership; and hold structured meetings that provide clinical rationales for problem solving. These strategies contribute to a successful program in which bedside nurses are transformed into elite, courageous, and confident advocates who eloquently and dynamically intervene for patients and their families.</p>
