<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Accountable care organizations (ACOs) are emerging as a cornerstone of efforts to reform the US health care system. Although naturally occurring networks of care delivery resembling ACOs have existed for years,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922813482181">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0009922813482181">2</xref></sup> the Affordable Care Act (ACA) formalized the ACO model as a central strategy in system redesign. The ACA calls for the establishment of pediatric ACOs after the launch of the adult focused Medicare Shared Savings Program ACOs. The Pediatric Demonstration Project is scheduled to be implemented between 2012 and 2016. It calls for state Medicaid programs to allow pediatric medical providers to form ACOs and receive incentive payments. Whereas there has been robust growth in adult-focused ACOs, the development of a pediatric ACO has yet to materialize, with little accounting for children in current accountable care models. This article explores the defining characteristics of ACOs, the evidence base for ACO implementation, and the conceptual and logistical challenges of applying a model of integrated care and reimbursement designed for adults to children.</p>

<sec id="section2-0009922813482181">
<title>Defining ACOs</title>
<p>The impetus for the ACO model primarily emerged from analysis of health care behavior demonstrating that fee-for-service payment was a major contributor to escalating medical expenditures within a fragmented health care system.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0009922813482181">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0009922813482181">4</xref></sup> An ACO is defined as a group of providers who work together to assume the responsibility and cost of care for the patient population they serve, sharing in savings achieved if predefined quality metrics are met.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0009922813482181">3</xref></sup> Policy makers increasingly postulate that ACOs will incentivize providers across practice settings to improve quality and reduce or slow down spending.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0009922813482181">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0009922813482181"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0009922813482181">7</xref></sup> Under the ACO model, payers establish quality benchmarks and risk-adjusted spending targets for patients served by providers in an ACO. If the ACO meets its benchmarks, it shares in the savings achieved below the specified spending target.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0009922813482181">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0009922813482181">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0009922813482181">9</xref></sup> In some models, the entity is at risk for a portion of any spending exceeding the target. Across all models, organizations build the capacity to achieve their goals through multiple mechanisms: disease management programs, use of nonphysician providers, establishment of medical homes, pay for performance, and information technology.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0009922813482181">10</xref></sup></p>

<title>Evidence Base for ACO Implementation</title>
<p>Even before passage of the ACA, data on ACOs already existed from a number of demonstration projects. The Medicare Physician Group Practice demonstration serves as one of the sentinel demonstration projects assessing the benefits of an ACO model.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0009922813482181">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0009922813482181"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0009922813482181">13</xref></sup> This large-scale demonstration project was implemented during 2005-2010 in 10 large practices comprising 5000 physicians and 224 000 Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries. Nearly all organizations achieved quality benchmarks, but cost savings were variable (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0009922813482181">Table 1</xref>). Since the Physician Group Practice demonstration, ACO experiments by Blue Cross Blue Shield<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0009922813482181">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0009922813482181">15</xref></sup> and Cigna<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0009922813482181">16</xref></sup> have also shown substantial quality improvement and some cost savings. Over the past 2 years, implementation of ACOs has rapidly increased in response to promising results from demonstration projects. As of October 2012, there were 318 ACOs in 48 states, serving either public or private groups, with additional organizations under review.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0009922813482181">4</xref></sup> With increasing numbers of ACOs, accreditation has been incorporated as a means of certifying high-quality entities. In 2012, Kelsey-Seybold Clinic in Houston, Texas, was named the first organization in the United States to become accredited as an ACO.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0009922813482181">17</xref></sup></p>

<title>Challenges to Pediatric ACO Implementation</title>
<p>Whereas ACO implementation among adult groups continues to accelerate, the major question for pediatric stakeholders is how child health fits into the ACO model largely designed for older populations cared for in fee-for-service settings. It is well documented that children in health care settings differ from adults in fundamental ways—development, epidemiology, demographics, health care financing, and dependence.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0009922813482181">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0009922813482181">19</xref></sup> Understanding of these differences suggests that current models of ACOs may not be optimally designed to promote integrated health care delivery for children.</p>
<p>First, whereas adult health care is largely characterized by chronic disease management, child health is predominantly defined by child development. This difference has major implications for ACO design. It necessitates that quality benchmarks for children be oriented more toward development rather than chronic disease management. Measures should appropriately focus on provision of high-quality preventive care, including screenings, counseling, and timely vaccination. Second, children have different epidemiology relative to adults. Despite the increase in the prevalence of children with special health care needs,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0009922813482181">20</xref></sup> children are predominantly healthy. The most impactful outcomes for children may develop over a longer period of time. Thus, cost savings for an ACO may be modest in the short term and not fully realized for years. Therefore, policymakers must work under the premise that costly and chronic diseases of adulthood (eg, obesity and heart disease) can be successfully prevented in childhood.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0009922813482181">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0009922813482181">22</xref></sup> Third, children have unique demographics relative to adults. More US children are disproportionately poor and from minority groups when compared with adults.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0009922813482181">23</xref></sup> Therefore, pediatric ACOs must develop strategies to ensure culturally competent care and continuous data collection according to race/ethnicity across entire organizations. ACOs should also have strategies in place to risk adjust spending targets for vulnerable populations. If such mechanisms are not in place, organizations may have less financial incentive to maintain these groups in their panels. Such behavior may exacerbate inequities in child health.</p>
<p>Health care financing for children is unique, in that more than a quarter of US children through 18 years of age are publicly insured. The major public programs that serve children, Medicaid and State Children’s Health Insurance Plan (SCHIP), differ substantially from Medicare. Whereas Medicare has well-developed quality measures, state Medicaid programs lag far behind in these measures,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0009922813482181">24</xref></sup> and whereas adults remain in Medicare presumably for the rest of their lives, children may primarily use Medicaid or SCHIP as temporary safety nets, such that they may enter and exit care within the ACO repeatedly over time. Therefore, cost savings of ACOs may be difficult to assess within Medicaid. Whereas Medicare is administered by the federal government, Medicaid is operated at the state level. Therefore, pediatric ACOs will have to be adapted to individual state Medicaid policies. Given that Medicaid reimbursement occurs at 72% of Medicare rates,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0009922813482181">25</xref></sup> many pediatric practices restrict access. ACOs will have to be incentivized to accept children with Medicaid.</p>
<p>Fifth, children are defined by their dependence on caregivers. Therefore, pediatric ACOs may need to work in collaboration with the ACO that provides care to the rest of the family. Wellness programs (eg, nutrition and exercise) and mental health programs may be more effective if they address the entire family as a unit and assess collective outcomes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0009922813482181">
<title>Views From Pediatric Organizations</title>
<p>Since passage of the ACA and the call for establishment of pediatric ACOs, pediatric professional organizations have articulated the concerns expressed by a broad spectrum of stakeholders in child health. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) has raised concerns about bundling the care of children and adults into a single organizational structure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0009922813482181">26</xref></sup> Because management of adults has more potential for cost savings, ACOs may tailor organizational functions toward adults or divert resources from children to adults. To develop robust, family-centered ACO models for children, the AAP emphasizes the importance of medical home principles, collaborative relationships with organizations such as Head Start and early intervention programs, networks between diverse providers, incentive systems that recognize the special elements of pediatric care, and quality performance metrics.</p>
<p>Separately, the National Association of Children’s Hospitals (NACH), now known as the Children’s Hospital Association (CHA), has also put forth principles for pediatric ACOs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0009922813482181">24</xref></sup> Their statement emphasizes the unique needs of children and that “Children utilize care at different rates in different settings and for different conditions than do adults.” According to NACH, children’s hospitals are well positioned to be leaders in ACO development. Although children’s hospitals only account for 3.5% of hospitals, they provide care for 45% of all children admitted to a hospital, including 47% of pediatric Medicaid admissions.</p>
<p>Although pediatric ACOs continue to represent a relatively new paradigm, some pediatric institutions have already embraced the principles of integrated care delivery and may serve as models for future endeavors. In 1994, Nationwide Children’s Hospital in collaboration with community pediatricians and subspecialists created Partners for Kids (PFK).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0009922813482181">25</xref></sup> Since 2005, the PFK network has operated as a pediatric ACO serving more than 290 000 low-income children in Ohio. To date, this organization has increased access to physicians for children enrolled in Medicaid, reduced length of stay for neonatal ICU admissions, and reduced surgical site infections and adverse drug events.</p>

<sec id="section6-0009922813482181" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Over the past several years, priorities in health care reform have evolved to embrace principles that couple health care quality and cost reduction within a structure of provider accountability. The emergence of ACOs demonstrates the potential rewards and risks of integrated health care delivery systems for children. While the policy makers continue to modify ACO models to fit the needs of adults, the lack of investment in pediatric ACOs remains a paramount concern for stakeholders in child health. It is increasingly clear that decision makers must start accounting for children in accountable care. The Pediatric Demonstration Project proposed in the ACA may provide the opportunity to consolidate the principles and recommendations articulated by organizations such as the AAP and NACH into a model of integrated care that will serve the unique needs of children.</p>
