<p><italic>Punishing the Dead</italic> offers an engaging and admirably comprehensive analysis of suicide in Scotland, England and Wales between the sixteenth and nineteenth centuries. The discussion takes a thematic approach which first, in Part One, considers official responses to dealing with the aftermath of a suicide. Exploring the complex procedures of forfeiture and the infrastructure in place to administer the estate of the deceased, the work unravels the various roles of officials within the two distinct legal jurisdictions of Scotland, and England and Wales. This appears to be no easy task, with what Houston identifies as overlapping legal responsibilities within each jurisdiction that were purposefully intricate and convoluted. Inevitably, this becomes a treatise on the inner workings of both national and local power as lordship, social networks, and ties and obligations in relation to suicide are explored.</p>
<p>The work then moves onto consideration of the varied treatment of suicides’ bodies, both in their burial and also in their corporal punishment. What comes through strongly is the local variation of such bodily sanction; there was no single general treatment of corpses. Depending on location such corpses might, for example, have been denied burial in sacred ground (or conversely allowed, but without a service), staked, dragged, gibbeted or dissected. While such actions were rare, they were important expressions of the community’s feelings towards the deceased. Here we have a particularly interesting discussion on contested interpretations of suicide deaths, with different versions being created and used for the personal agenda of the living.</p>
<p>Part Two seeks to understand popular attitudes towards those who took their own lives. Drawing upon philosophical arguments, Houston considers religious and secular understandings of suicide, discussing beliefs in the Devil, grace, despair, redemption, and the use of narratives of self-murder as experiential. Identifying developments in religious debate on suicide between the Renaissance and the Enlightenment, he ultimately questions the secularization model of suicide. This discussion of how contemporaries rationalized self-murder, exploring interrelated religious, legal and medical debates about suicide and insanity during the Enlightenment, will probably be of most interest to historians of psychiatry. The connection between insanity and suicide was recognized as early as the fourteenth century, although verdicts of <italic>non compos mentis</italic> did not increase in frequency until after the late seventeenth century. As Houston explains, finding <italic>felo de se</italic> was more about the principle of strict liability than the intent of the suicide. Finally, newspaper accounts are utilized to access popular attitudes to self-murder.</p>
<p>For what was most often such a private and clandestine act, managing the aftermath of a suicide involved a surprising number and range of people: from members of the local community, reaching right up through government and to the Crown itself (after all, the wronged party was the monarch). Ultimately it is neither the suicides themselves, nor their families, who are the central characters in Houston’s book: that role is filled by the community. Legal processes in dealing with self-murder were often (although certainly not always) intended to maintain the health of the community. For example, while the practice of gifting the deceased’s property to a representative of the Crown might appear to cause further harm and distress to the deceased’s family, in fact it was an important mechanism for enforcing trust and accord within the local society. The transferring of goods allowed for good lordship: working to protect the rights of the vulnerable and ensuring that creditors and debtors received their share of the deceased’s estate. Houston argues that forfeitures indicate an attitude of responsibility rather than greed, ‘repairing rather than rending the community’s web of economic relations’ (p. 153).</p>
<p>Similarly, returning a verdict of <italic>felo de se</italic> rather than <italic>non compos mentis</italic> provided a service to the community in conferring a supportive framework in which the affairs of the deceased could be settled amicably. Profane burials, and acts of corporal punishments against the corpses of suicides, were not one-dimensional acts of vengeance but a powerful message about the deceased’s status within the community while alive, and a sensitive negotiation that determined the memory and reputation of that person now departed. However, while acting to heal the rift created, profane burials and bodily sanctions also revealed community tensions, often between the wishes of the deceased’s family and the wider community. Overall, Houston presents a more subtle and nuanced picture of the actions and motivations of officials and community members than is presented in previous discussions of suicide. His argument is also more balanced: self-murderers were never either completely reviled or extended unbounded sympathy. Understanding was given, but suicide, whatever the cause, was considered wrong.</p>
<p>The ambitious breadth of social, political, legal and cultural perspectives makes for an impressively comprehensive exploration of suicide during the early modern period. However, this range in no way hinders the detail and depth provided in the analysis, achieved in part through the use of an array of sources and rich selection of case studies. The decision to compare the two jurisdictions serves well to illuminate fundamental differences in legal practice, which were, as is explained, in part the product of past associations with our neighbours on the Continent. Moreover, the juxta-position of varied national and local practice highlights the fascinating diversity of British history and, as Houston argues, serves as a warning against our partiality for London-based sources. There is no doubt that this book makes a significant contribution to our understandings of suicide during the early modern period. It will surely become a seminal text for scholars of the subject, and for those interested in the early modern period more widely.</p>
