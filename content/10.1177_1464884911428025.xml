<p>In this volume from the Routledge Research in Journalism series, Ansgard Heinrich moves the idea of ‘network’ journalism beyond definitions that group the term with citizen, participatory and public journalism toward a broader framework for understanding the seismic changes in 21st-century news.</p>
<p>Divided into two main sections, <italic>Network Journalism</italic> first explores ‘Theories and Concepts’, placing networked journalism within a framework of globalization as well as the historical rise of news agencies and their creation of linear news flows. The second section, ‘Practitioner Perspectives’, discusses the results from the author’s interviews with a select group of journalists and journalism educators whom Heinrich calls ‘early adopters’ of new technologies and practices that embody network journalism.</p>
<p>Within the theory/concepts section, the cornerstone of Heinrich’s perspective is Castell’s <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1464884911428025"><italic>Network Society</italic> (1996)</xref>, which, along with the work of her PhD adviser, Ingrid Volkmer, inspires her own views on journalism’s future as a series of networked nodes within interactive spheres of communication. Much of this part of the book covers well-trodden ground.</p>
<p>Providing a nice overview of the competing definitions of ‘network journalism’, Heinrich argues that this is not simply citizen or participatory journalism. Just as Castells suggests that our social systems have changed in structure, becoming decentralized and more densely interconnected, so, she posits, has journalism. Thus, network journalism is a ‘structural concept’, referring to the modes of connection ‘within the whole sphere of journalistic work’, whether online or offline (p. 61).</p>
<p>The heart of the book is the second part, which considers the results of her interviews with journalism practitioners and educators at 11 different news outlets or news-related entities in the UK, USA and Germany. The author categorizes them as: Traditional Outlets (BBC, the <italic>Guardian</italic>, and <italic>Zeit</italic> online); ‘Alternative’ (Democracy Now!, OurMedia, Indymedia NYC, and Current TV); Independent Aggregators and Commentators (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://MediaChannel.org">MediaChannel.org</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Alternet.org">Alternet.org</ext-link>); and Educators and Monitors (the Project for Excellence in Journalism and the International Center for Journalism). With the exception of the BBC and the <italic>Guardian</italic>, the study participants offer voices that are often absent in academic research, including the often overlooked, though groundbreaking, pioneering citizen news site, Indymedia.</p>
<p>The interviews include information about the news outlets’ and educators’ practices, but much of the content covers their attitudes and opinions about changes leading to ‘network journalism’. The interview data are not broken down by type (e.g. mainstream vs alternative) but instead are woven together in topical areas in which the author draws on previous research for additional context. This organizational format reflects Heinrich’s argument that the monopoly in terms of gatekeeping and agenda setting by larger, more established news outlets has been broken. The mixing of the interview data, then, suggests an equivalence as all outlets are dealing with the changes that range from fluency with new technologies to an ability to cultivate audience participation in the news process. This data is most interesting when it is specific (for example, Alternet has 20,000 users registered to comment) and less so when it brings in previous research in dialogue with her original data.</p>
<p>There is a repeated turn in the book to what the rise of network journalism means to international news. This is a welcome direction to pursue because the network form as traditionally defined has tended to be identified at least in the USA as ‘hyper-local’, which can overlook the clearly transnational potential these forms also offer. Instead, Heinrich rightly situates these nodes within a global framework for news, drawing on her interviews to lay out the ways both large establishment outlets such as the BBC and smaller, activist outfits such as MediaChannel can produce richer, more contextualized international news by incorporating stories from bloggers, citizen journalists and others on the scene. She also argues that outlets should turn to these voices at the grassroots first for understanding and context, rather than starting with official voices and adding the grassroots as an afterthought. She admits that the various news routines and practices to accomplish this are still in flux and not without problems.</p>
<p>Less considered here are the economics of networked journalism and the impact of de-professionalization as a corporate cost-cutting strategy. While it might help the <italic>Guardian</italic>’s credibility to have thousands of foreign readers, commenters and citizen content creators, monetizing those new audiences continues to be an unsolved problem. Nevertheless, Heinrich argues, the possibilities created by new collaborations made possible in a network society far outweigh the pitfalls because, ultimately, in a networked world, disconnected nodes are unsustainable. News practitioners who fail to adapt to this new reality may wither, or, as one of the interview subjects puts it: ‘at some point you’ve got to figure out some other way of surviving’ (p. 208).</p>
