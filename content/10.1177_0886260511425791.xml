<abstract>
<p>Despite the increased attention to dating violence among adolescents and young adults, limited information is available on ethical and legal considerations specific to this population. Therefore, this qualitative study explores 21 trainees’ and practitioners’ conceptualization of ethical and legal issues pertaining to adolescent dating violence. Data are collected through focus groups included as part of an ethics and legal issues seminar. Six themes are identified to illustrate ethical and legal issues concerning dating violence: knowledge, client welfare, counseling interventions, informed consent and disclosure, barriers, and counselor reactions.</p>

<body>
<p>Dating violence, a means by which one dating partner intends to gain control over another dating partner through actual or threat of emotional, physical, and/or sexual harm, is becoming an increasingly visible public and mental health issue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0886260511425791">Craigen, Sikes, Healey, &amp; Hays, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0886260511425791">Mars &amp; Valdez, 2007</xref>). Part of this increased visibility is related to discrepancies in how it is defined in scholarship and by those who likely are experiencing dating violence. For example, in an exploratory study of Latino adolescents’ definitions of dating violence, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0886260511425791">Smith, Winokur, and Palenski (2005)</xref> found that most (64%) of the participants defined dating violence in terms of physical or forced contact, and only 18% defined it as verbal or mental abuse. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0886260511425791">Gallopin and Leigh (2009)</xref> found that a sample of 41 youth aged between 11 and 19 years were unable to offer a definition of dating violence, yet they provided personal examples. Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0886260511425791">Cyr, McDuff, and Wright (2006)</xref> noted in the case of 126 females aged between 13 and 17 that more than 45% reported experiencing some physical violence in their dating relationships. These results collectively demonstrate that individuals tend to define dating violence as primarily physical, if at all.</p>
<p>Despite differences in definitions and perceptions of dating violence, research indicates that dating violence is a prevalent and serious problem among adolescents and young adults (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0886260511425791">Ackard &amp; Neumark-Sztainer, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0886260511425791">Cyr et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0886260511425791">Hanson, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0886260511425791">O’Keefe, 1997</xref>). In addition, research indicates that women and men report being equally likely to experience dating violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0886260511425791">Ackard &amp; Neumark-Sztainer, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0886260511425791">Schnurr &amp; Lohman, 2008</xref>). Due to the prevalence of dating violence, counselors need to consider ethical and legal implications when encountering minor clients in schools and agency settings.</p>
<p>Counseling professionals are consistently faced with ethical and legal dilemmas when working with minors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0886260511425791">Ledyard, 1998</xref>), including dating violence. Major ethical and legal issues related to dating violence include client welfare, confidentiality, informed consent, and counselor competence. With respect to client welfare, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0886260511425791">Kress, Protivnak, and Sadlak (2008)</xref> suggested counselors should not advise clients to get out of a relationship. Instead, the focus should be on assuring the safety and welfare of clients. The American Counseling Association’s [ACA] Code of Ethics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0886260511425791">ACA, 2005</xref>) indicates that the “primary responsibility of counselors is to respect the dignity and to promote the welfare of clients” (Standard A.1.a). Specializations within the counseling profession echo this notion in their respective codes and standards. The American School Counselor Association [ASCA] Ethical Standards for School Counselors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0886260511425791">ASCA, 2004</xref>) state that a professional school counselor “has a primary obligation to the student, who is to be treated with respect as a unique individual” (Standard A.1.a) and “recognizes his/her primary obligation for confidentiality is to the student but balances that obligation with an understanding of the legal and inherent rights of parents/guardians to be the guiding voice in their children’s lives” (Standard A.2.g, p. 9). The American Mental Health Counselors Association [AMHCA] Code of Ethics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0886260511425791">AMHCA, 2000</xref>) states that “the primary responsibility of the mental health counselor is to respect the dignity and integrity of the client” (Standard A.1.), indicating a similar ethical responsibility as other helping professionals. Therefore, it is important for counseling professionals to respect and support the client exposed to dating violence, while promoting client safety and empowerment.</p>
<p>Other major ethical dilemmas that apply to dating violence are confidentiality and informed consent. The ACA Code of Ethics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0886260511425791">ACA, 2005</xref>) requires that counselors “do not share confidential information without client consent or without sound legal or ethical justification” (Standard B.1.c., p. 12). In regards to confidentiality, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0886260511425791">ASCA (2004</xref>; Standard A.2.f.) notes that confidentiality is protected by the professional school counselor in accordance with relevant ethical standards, state and federal laws, and developed policies. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0886260511425791">AMHCA (2000)</xref> indicates that mental health counselors must protect client information and communicate to others only under certain limits of confidentiality (Principle 3). However, according to Remley and Herlihy, if counselors determine that a child is at risk of harm, they have a legal and ethical responsibility to breach confidentiality and must inform the child’s parent. Thus, adolescents developmentally have a heightened desire for privacy and may consider the breach as a violation of their trust. Moreover, if counselors fail to inform parents of such harm, then they accept legal responsibility if the child is later harmed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0886260511425791">Remley &amp; Herlihy, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Although there may be confusion regarding counselors’ roles in protecting confidentiality when working with minors, counselors are ethically and legally obligated to protect the client. Counseling professionals must be aware of the local, state, and federal laws pertaining to the rights of minors, specifically to confidentiality and informed consent. In addition, counselors must be aware of policies and procedures specific to their setting.</p>
<p>A final consideration is counselor competence regarding dating violence. Specifically, counselor competence includes knowledge, values, and countertransference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0886260511425791">Kress et al., 2008</xref>). For example, it is important that counselors be aware of warning signs of dating violence and personal biases and reactions regarding the issue of violence.</p>
<p>In sum, intervening effectively in dating violence among adolescents and young adults involves intentional consideration of ethical and legal issues. Unfortunately, there are no studies to date that explore the scope and depth of these issues among practitioners. The purpose of this qualitative study was to examine 21 trainees and practitioners’ knowledge, experiences, and concerns regarding ethical and legal issues and dating violence. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0886260511425791">McLeod, Muldoon, and Hays (2010)</xref> noted that due to victims’ discomfort to disclose to a practitioner, various definitions of violence across cultural groups, and the lack of knowledge and awareness by practitioners to screen for dating violence, the prevalence and incidence of dating violence may go unnoticed and contribute to ethical and professional limitations. Furthermore, the curricular standards set forth by the Council for Accreditation of Counseling and Related Educational Programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0886260511425791">CACREP, 2009</xref>) contends that counselors’ roles and responsibilities are to recognize and respond to various trauma-causing events, such as intimate partner violence. Thus, it is important to focus on trainees and practitioners because counselors’ inexperience of adolescent dating violence can lead to ineffective treatment that dissuades students’ disclosure and negatively affects the counseling process and outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0886260511425791">Hays, Craigen, Knight, Healey, &amp; Sikes, 2009</xref>). Results may yield significant implications for future training and research in ethical and legal issues. Two research questions guided this study:</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section2-0886260511425791">
<title>Ethical and Legal Issues Seminar</title>
<p>Data were collected from a seminar addressing ethical and legal concerns related to dating violence intervention. The seminar content and process were developed from a previous needs assessment that involved interviewing 20 practitioners and trainees (independent from this study). The free seminar included didactic information on relevant ethical codes and state statutes regarding violence and experiential activities (i.e., case studies, worksheets). Three case studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0886260511425791">Close, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0886260511425791">Joyce, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0886260511425791">Mayes, 2008</xref>), highlighting adolescent dating violence, safety issues, legal and ethical considerations, and client welfare, were presented and randomly discussed with seminar participants.</p>
<p>Process questions included, (a) based on your experience, what are some common ethical or legal issues that you have encountered pertaining to dating violence? (b) If you have not encountered any legal or ethical issues pertaining to dating violence, what concerns do you have regarding this issue? and (c) How will you apply the information presented today to your setting? The presenters (first and second authors) were school and mental health counselors, respectively, who held expertise in ethical and legal issues and adolescent mental health concerns.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0886260511425791">
<title>Participants and Procedures</title>
<p>Participants were recruited through a mailed or electronic flyer sent to graduate program directors of counseling programs and clinical directors from local agencies and schools throughout a southeastern region of a Southern U.S. state. Participants attended 1 of 4 seminars similar in content and process; the average duration of the seminar was 40 min. Each seminar was recorded and transcribed.</p>
<p>Participants completed a session evaluation form at the conclusion of the session. Using a 6-point Likert-type scale (1 = <italic>strongly disagree</italic>, 6 = <italic>strongly agree</italic>) participants were asked to address four close-ended questions regarding the presenters, material, and presentation style. In addition, participants were asked to include a response to four semistructured questions (e.g., I was most surprised during this session by. . .; see Results section for a summary of findings). In addition to the questions, probes were used to encourage more depth of explanation and clarity. The facilitators were careful to encourage responses from all participants, to clarify and guide the group to discourage group pressure or naive disclosure. The facilitators used the same questions across the groups.</p>
<p>The study sample consisted of 21 individuals who identified themselves as counselor trainees or practitioners (one participant did not complete a demographic inventory). Of those completing the inventory, 17 were female and 3 male. With respect to ethnicity, 11 described themselves as White, 5 as African American, 3 as Native American, and 1 as Latin American. Participants’ age ranged from 18 to 53 years with a mean of 27 (<italic>SD</italic> = 8.99). Eighteen participants identified themselves as heterosexual and one as gay (one participant did not respond to the sexual orientation question). Participants’ counseling experience, in number of months before masters degree, ranged from 0 to 18 months (<italic>M</italic>= 1.80, <italic>SD =</italic> 4.81) and after the masters ranged from 0 to 108 months (<italic>M</italic> = 9.00, <italic>SD =</italic> 27.34). With regards to training experience, 17 participants had never before attended a workshop on intimate partner relationships, whereas 3 participants had previously attended at least one related workshop. Examining data by group, there were similar samples (i.e., 4-6 individuals per group, primarily White female).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0886260511425791">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>Each session of the seminar was audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim by the group facilitators (i.e., first two authors). The authors independently coded the transcripts and met to reach consensus on emerging themes. Specifically, the research team performed content analysis on data to determine the degree of knowledge, experiences, and concerns related to ethical and legal issues surrounding dating violence. Content analysis is a process of examining content and themes from written documents (e.g., transcripts, forms; Insch, Moore, &amp; Murphy, 1997). Next, codes were assigned to meaningful quotes. Content analysis organized information according to six themes. The authors independently coded the transcripts and met to reach consensus on identified themes with respect to the research questions. The authors computed means for the session evaluation of close-ended items (see Results section), and they identified and integrated codes from the evaluation forms with those themes from the interview data.</p>
</sec>

<sec id="section5-0886260511425791" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>Six main themes were gleaned from the ethical and legal issues seminar data sources. These included knowledge of dating violence as an ethical and legal issue, client welfare, informed consent and disclosure, counseling interventions, barriers, and counselor personal reactions. Application of these themes to the research questions is articulated in the Discussion section.</p>
<sec id="section6-0886260511425791">
<title>Knowledge of Dating Violence as an Ethical and Legal Issue</title>
<p>The first theme related to knowledge of dating violence as an ethical and legal issue. At the beginning of the seminars, participants demonstrated a lack of understanding of ethical and legal issues related to dating violence. One participant stated, “Dating violence? I don’t really know of any ethical, I mean, we’ve talked so much about child abuse and elder abuse and disabled person abuse.” In addition, dating violence was expressed as <italic>normative</italic> by participants. For example, comments such as “She’s happy to have a boyfriend, “That is a very typical teenager-ey response,” and “If he keeps hitting her, and she lets him do it, he’s going to think he can do it, all the time.”</p>
<p>Participant responses indicated new knowledge acquired from the seminar. The comments mainly highlighted session format, case study, and general information. Specific feedback regarding the sessions included, “I was most surprised during this session by minor’s confidentiality,” and “I hope future sessions of this topic will include more of the scenarios, provide more information on laws pertinent to dating violence reporting, and be longer.” When responding to an important thing learned during the session, participants indicated, “reporting, safety contract, reiteration of the confidentiality rules, and it is mandatory to report dating violence.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0886260511425791">
<title>Client Welfare</title>
<p>Client welfare was a theme that members from each group expressed and referred to empowering clients and developing a positive counseling relationship. A member expressed, “doing what’s best for the client.” In one group, members were asked, “Instead of giving advice, what would be more appropriate?” One member responded, “encouraging them, helping them, and guiding them to come up with a solution of their own.”</p>
<p>Counseling relationship as a theme referred to the importance of client rapport and trust. One female member expressed, “Have her buy into it. Because, otherwise, it will be just be a battle. You certainly don’t want her to not come back and see you.” Another member described her concern in maintaining a strong relationship while working within a school’s requirements to disclose:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>the student might interpret that as—“You’re betraying me.” And so, how do you create that warm relationship, where you can build that trust—granted, you don’t much time, probably. And still meet those requirements of, “OK. I have to notify parents within 20 minutes, or 30 minutes. I have to create this relationship, where this person feels like they can trust me. And in 30 minutes, we’re going to be making that phone call together, to notify—at least their parents. I think that has to be pretty tricky.”</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>With this comment, there seemed to be a desire to convince the child to disclose to avoid premature termination. In other words, this member seemed concerned with the challenges of developing a trusting relationship with students in a limited period of time, following reporting requirements, while at the same time allowing students to be involved in the reporting process so that they will not end counseling services unexpectedly early. Another participant expanded on this by commenting, “If she’s telling you, on some level, she’s asking for help.”</p>
<p>With respect to having a positive counseling relationship, the betrayal of trust was discussed as a concern when disclosing dating violence. For example, one member discussed her concern as follows:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>but I think if someone came and they were in a relationship of violence or something and they trusted us to do something about it and then, you know, first of all in a way they might feel you are betraying their trust because you have to report it. So you do that, and then it’s like, if nothing happens, you’ve just betrayed their trust and nothing happened.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Another group member indicated, “And then, too, as counselors we try so hard to build trust and rapport with clients and then you take the steps and nothing happens because, I wonder what a client would think about that.” This comment illustrates the group member’s concern of building rapport with clients and reporting violence, but no protective action is taken.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0886260511425791">
<title>Counseling Interventions</title>
<p>Counseling interventions as a theme refers to common components to assist an individual experiencing dating violence. For example, common components included disclosing to parents, creating a support network, and developing empowering interventions such as self-defense, anger management, and education. Safety planning and risk assessment were also identified as important when working with clients involved in violent relationships, although this varied by gender. One male participant stated, “. . .make some headway in counseling with her. And get her believing there are some changes she needs to make. I’m not sure how far a safety plan will work for her, until she wants one.” However, a female group member stated that you should provide resources regardless of the client’s motivation or insight.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0886260511425791">
<title>Informed Consent and Disclosure</title>
<p>A fourth theme related to informed consent procedures for disclosure to others. Participants were aware of limits of confidentiality, yet they did not seem to associate those limits with dating violence. For example, one participant asked, “When do you tell the parents? Right away or. . . .” There was a discrepancy about reporting, where a participant in one group noted that one has to report when there is a chance for greater harm, but then stated if a child “doesn’t want to share with the parent, I can’t share it with the parent because of confidentiality.”</p>
<p>Group members expressed knowledge of informed consent specific to setting factors. For example, factors applicable to school and agency settings were discussed in each session. Illustrative comments for this category are “. . . some schools may have certain procedural steps that you have to take, and that you’re bound by. And that can make it difficult.” “Well, if you’re seeing her in the school setting and you’re a school counselor you don’t need to . . . ,” and “So, in my setting it would be—the child doesn’t have to sign it (informed consent), but then the parent does.” Beliefs regarding reporting dating violence and the need for parental consent were further addressed during the sessions.</p>
<p>A major concern expressed by participants of this study was the “gray area” for disclosing dating violence to others:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Yeah, it’s interesting. Because as we talk about ethics and things like that within relationships; you have an ethical responsibility to report if the perpetrator tells you they’re gonna do something. But, you know, the client is in there expressing that they’re being abused. There’s still no level of responsibility or ethics or you know, it’s just weird.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The requirements of reporting dating violence are not as clearly defined as reporting other types of abuse, such as suspected child abuse and neglect. Therefore, further education and training is needed to address this concern.</p>
<p>There was also uncertainty expressed related to parental disclosure. One participant expressed the uncertainty, “When do you tell the parents? Right away, or . . .” Another participant indicated, “through the police department, and they won’t press charges unless if the child or the parent wants to press charges too, so if they don’t want to share that information with their parents. . . .” This member expressed concern that if the victim or parent of the victim is not willing to intervene, then nothing will be done to protect the victim.</p>
<p>One issue confounding informed consent procedures and parental disclosure relates to the age of clients. One group member stated, “Children, it’s a lot of people that are involved.” When discussing informed consent, a group member commented, “. . . you don’t have to necessarily notify the parents, especially in cases where the child is . . . especially if the child is 15 or 16.” The same group member later states, “. . . notify the parents of students of a certain age, where the danger, so there is a lot of things to consider.” Other illustrative comments are, “There are laws about what you can tell a parent, especially when they are a certain age. I think 12 is like the age . . . ,” and “Would that be statutory rape? They’re two years apart, but she’s still—she’s not 14 or above.” When asked to identify the victim in Case Conceptualization 3, a case describing an abusive dating relationship between a 12-year-old female and 14-year-old male, a group member indicated the female because “Well, she’s the younger one.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0886260511425791">
<title>Barriers</title>
<p>Barriers as a theme referred to legal barriers (i.e., inadequate legal responses) as well as school-based barriers. Members from all the groups expressed inadequate legal response to relationship violence as a challenge. A member of group one commented:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>It seems like when dating violence or something happens and say the person wants to report it. It doesn’t seem that the law—this is the legal side—it doesn’t seem like they do much about it. But you have to report it a certain number of times, before they step in. And I don’t think that’s fair.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Another member commented, “The legal system for abusive relationships, at least in [Southern U.S. state] is horrible.” In addition, a male member of Group 2 expressed, “Our legal system is not particularly threatening.”</p>
<p>Barriers in the schools were also identified. Examples of these barriers included administrators and teachers. For example, one group member indicated, “We also have problems in the school setting, when there are charges being pressed against one of the people. How do you stop them from seeing each other?” When discussing a case study, one member stated, “It’s got to be hard. Because it says that he’s her classmate, too. So they’re in school. . . .” Another member describes a school barrier,</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Because if they have been in school—like, if he took her arm, and pushed her up against the locker in school. That is a whole other ballgame, right there. Because that means he will get ten days suspension and placement. It’s automatic. Because violence is not allowed in school, in any kind of form. But if it happens outside, it’s a little bit harder for the school to intervene, as far as suspension goes.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0886260511425791">
<title>Counselor Reactions</title>
<p>A final theme related to counselor reactions, which related to issues of competence and transference. When discussing a case vignette, a group member stated, “I wonder about if this counselor should be counseling this person. Because I think this counselor may be able to resolve their own experiences from the past, before they take on this individual.” Another participant expressed, “A warning sign for the counselor might be that—you are extremely upset. Something’s happened to her—you’re going to have to distance yourself. Kind of transference.” Recognizing and addressing personal reactions from counselors are significant ethical components of effectively assisting clients involved in violent relationships.</p>

<title>Summary of Session Evaluation Form</title>
<p>Participants (<italic>N</italic> = 21) were presented with and asked to complete a session evaluation form at the conclusion of the session. Four open-ended questions were asked of the participants: (1) Presenters were knowledgeable (<italic>M</italic> = 5.43), (2) there were opportunities for discussion of the material (<italic>M</italic> = 5.62), (3) handouts were informative (<italic>M</italic> = 5.43), and (4) the presentation style was appropriate (<italic>M</italic> = 5.33). In addition, participants were asked to include a response to four semistructured questions. For example, participants were asked what they were surprised most by during the session. Responses included confidentiality information, rights of minor clients, difficulty of ethical decisions, and case studies. An important thing learned today, as reported by participants, included safety contracts and plans, mandatory reporting, rights of parents, and prevalence of adolescent dating violence. Hopes for future sessions included more time to discuss case scenarios, longer sessions, and providing more information on laws pertinent to dating violence reporting. Participants reported general comments such as “Very informative, great job, I really liked the case scenarios—learning in action, and great presentation.”</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Because there are no known or published studies to date that explore the scope and depth of legal and ethical issues among practitioners as it pertains to dating violence among adolescents, the current study set out to determine practitioners’ knowledge, experiences, and concerns regarding this issue. There has been a tendency in previous literature on dating violence to focus solely on survivors and practitioners’ perceptions regarding dating violence, but no known research to date has examined the ethical and legal considerations of adolescent dating violence. As illustrated by the participants’ responses, practitioners had limited knowledge regarding ethical and legal considerations regarding adolescents dating violence. Since there are specific agency/setting reporting and confidentiality procedures, many participants reported conflicts on how and what to disclose and who they disclose to. The participants stated that their training consisted of learning how to respond to child abuse and elderly abuse, but dating violence was often neglected in their training programs. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0886260511425791">Paisley and Benshoff (1996)</xref> asserted that counselor preparation is a continuous process that is primarily the responsibility of the counselor and should be augmented by his or her setting; however, many of the participants stated that they had not attended a workshop/training about dating violence although they stated that dating violence was a normal occurrence with adolescents. Thus, the lack of attention in their training program and the lack of postgraduate training contribute to their lack of knowledge and competence to respond to those in violent relationships. Although the participants stated that the safety plan/contract was an effective strategy, more education and training is needed on laws, policy, and procedures specific to reporting of relationship violence. Training must also be specific to the setting since many settings may have different protocols to attend to such issues.</p>
<p>Several challenges were discussed by the participants as having a significant influence on their level of response to those who are in violent relationships. In fact participants discussed their frustration regarding the lack of response from the legal system. They felt that the legal system was inconsistent and often failed to respond. One of the reasons for the lack of response is that mandatory reporting for those in violent relationship is not clearly defined because many, as indicated by the participants, thought that dating violence was a normal occurrence with adolescence.</p>
<p>This study illustrates that legal and ethical perceptions and experiences of the trainees and practitioners regarding adolescent dating violence were expressed. Recognizing and addressing counselor transference and personal reaction are important pieces to assisting clients involved in relationship violence. Although the counseling relationship, as it pertains to recognizing and responding to adolescent dating violence, is often overlooked in research, it is shown to be important in counseling in this study. The participants were unanimous with the significance of reporting and disclosing the violence relationship, but they were conflicted between reporting and the client’s welfare.</p>

<title>Limitations and Implications</title>
<p>Limitations related to researcher bias were hopefully mitigated by the use of consensus coding. Selection of participations was limited to those within a southeastern region of a Southern U.S. state. The sample was small and not indicative of the larger population of practitioners across the United States. In addition, although the sampling population was diverse in many ways, there were only three men included in the sample. In addition, there was a lack of case-study consistency in which the facilitators of the seminar used different case studies during each of the sessions that contributed to the range of responses from the participants. In addition, many of the participants felt that more time was needed during the sessions, which also could have affected their responses.</p>
<p>The results of this study suggest there needs to be more information in counselor training programs regarding dating violence. Mental health professionals need to advocate for more guidelines from various counseling associations (e.g., ASCA, ACA) to effectively counsel those in violent relationship since dating violence is a common occurrence during adolescence that has significant impact on adulthood. In addition, there needs to be more training workshops that address this issue.</p>
