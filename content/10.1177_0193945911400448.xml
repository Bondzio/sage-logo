<abstract>
<p>Increasing national attention is focused on improving posthospital transitions. Home health patients are in an opportune position to provide insight into this transition as they resume care for themselves with informal caregivers and home health professionals. This qualitative study describes the experiences of patients, informal caregivers, and home health clinicians during the posthospital transition. A total of 40 patients, 35 informal caregivers, and 15 clinicians participated in this study. Patients recalled receiving discharge instructions but with few details and limited information about follow-up actions if they had problems. Discharge instructions were a versatile means of communication. Home health clinicians used these instructions to guide discussions with patients and their caregivers. Both informal caregivers and home health care clinicians emphasized the inadequate preparation of caregivers during the discharge process. More attention is needed to proactively engage informal caregivers and involve home health clinicians who can facilitate the implementation of discharge plans to improve patient outcomes.</p>

<p>Posthospital transitions are often complicated and many lead to costly or poor patient outcomes. A recent report to the Congress emphasized the need to improve coordination of care at hospital discharge as one way to reduce hospital readmissions within 30 days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0193945911400448">Medical Payment Advisory Commission, 2007</xref>). Several studies are making it clear that patients discharged from the hospital are likely to experience adverse events or readmission within this time frame (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0193945911400448">Forster et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0193945911400448">Forster, Murff, Peterson, Gandhi, &amp; Bates, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0193945911400448">Jencks, Williams, &amp; Coleman, 2009</xref>), which illustrates hospital discharge as a high-risk process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0193945911400448">Greenwald, Denham, &amp; Jack, 2007</xref>). Transitional care models and hospital discharge redesign efforts provide encouraging results of cost-effective benefits that improve patient outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0193945911400448">Balaban, Weissman, Samuel, &amp; Woodhandler, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0193945911400448">Coleman, Parry, Chambers, &amp; Min, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0193945911400448">Coleman, Smith, et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0193945911400448">Jack et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0193945911400448">Naylor et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0193945911400448">Naylor et al., 2004</xref>). Still, three areas require further exploration to better understand and improve posthospital transitions to home. First, inadequate attention has been paid to the unique needs of patients who require home health care, which may represent a more complex and vulnerable subgroup. Second, informal caregivers who play a critical and largely invisible role during the posthospital transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0193945911400448">Bull &amp; Jervis, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0193945911400448">Graham, Levy, &amp; Neuhauser, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0193945911400448">Levine, Halper, Peist, &amp; Gould, 2010</xref>) have not received due attention. Third, although home health clinicians are strategically positioned to identify needs not visible to hospital clinicians and facilitate a successful transition home for patients and their families, there have been few if any studies to describe their experiences. The purpose of this study was to describe the hospital-to-home transition from the three perspectives of home health patients, their informal caregivers, and home health care clinicians. An exploratory study aim was to examine the feasibility of conducting a qualitative study in a home health care setting. One of our concerns was patients’ willingness or ability to participate in in-depth interviews after a recent hospitalization because they may still feel ill or tired. In addition, we explored the feasibility of recruiting informal caregivers and home health clinicians caring for patient participants.</p>

<title>Transitional Care Issues</title>
<p>The risks and potential for adverse events among patients transitioning out of inpatient care highlight the need for improved continuity and coordination of care. Between 1992 and 1994, 18% of older adults experienced a transition between health care settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0193945911400448">Murtaugh &amp; Litke, 2002</xref>). Of these older adults, 22.4% required subsequent health care services (e.g., emergency room use and hospitalization) within 30 days of a transition suggesting potential problems. Similarly, Coleman and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0193945911400448">Coleman, Min, Chomiak, &amp; Kramer, 2004</xref>) identified posthospital transition patterns within 30 days of an initial hospitalization. An important subpopulation (13%-25%) was older adults who were transferred to a higher level of care that were deemed to be complicated transitions. In addition, other studies have found that nearly one fifth to one quarter of recently discharged patients (19%-23%) experienced a posthospital adverse event or hospital readmission within the 30 days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0193945911400448">Forster et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0193945911400448">Forster et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0193945911400448">Jencks et al., 2009</xref>). Of the readmitted patients, 50% did not have documentation of being seen by an outpatient physician within the prior 30 days, and 70% of postsurgical patients were readmitted with a medical problem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0193945911400448">Jencks et al., 2009</xref>). These authors and others highlight the need for better care coordination and targeted interventions for high-risk patients as part of a broader initiative to improve transitional care for older adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0193945911400448">Kripalani, Jackson, Schnipper, &amp; Coleman, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0193945911400448">Naylor, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0193945911400448">Snow et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>A recent transitional care consensus policy statement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0193945911400448">Snow et al., 2009</xref>) identified several recommendations to address the quality gaps occurring between hospital and outpatient settings, including the need for better communication and more involvement of patients and informal caregivers at all steps in the process. However, most caregiver studies have largely focused on caregivers of individuals with long-term health needs (e.g., Alzheimer disease) with far less attention to short-term, but often intense, caregiving occurring during the posthospital period. Two exceptions were qualitative studies that explored the needs and strategies used by patients and their caregivers during the posthospital transition home (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0193945911400448">Bull &amp; Jervis, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0193945911400448">Graham et al., 2009</xref>). Both studies highlighted the stressors and informational gaps (e.g., medications, lack of bilingual information) after a loved one is discharged from a hospital. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0193945911400448">Graham and colleagues (2009)</xref> explored the unique needs of ethnic minority and non-English-speaking caregivers. Although some issues (e.g., fulfilling family obligations as barrier to the use of paid caregivers) were specific to the study sample, a more universal concern voiced by caregivers was the inadequacy of information and training for patients and their caregivers, which exacerbated the emotional burden of caregiving. These findings echo issues identified over a decade ago among recently discharged home health patients, their caregivers as well as home health nurses and social workers who noted patients and families do not know what to expect when they come home from the hospital (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0193945911400448">Weaver, Perloff, &amp; Waters, 1998</xref>). Others have identified similar issues of inadequate caregiver preparation, poor communication, and inadequacies in the hospital discharge documentation of plans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0193945911400448">Kripalani, LeFevre, et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0193945911400448">vom Eigen, 2000</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0193945911400448">Nielsen et al. (2008)</xref> described, a typical failure in patient education is assuming the patient—rather than an informal caregiver—is the key learner. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0193945911400448">Levine and colleagues (2010)</xref> advocated for urgently needed changes in the health care system to encompass informal caregivers and their interactions with health care systems, and improve their training to perform medical caregiving tasks. Although there is increasing urgency to improve posthospital transitions, little attention has been paid to the important and vulnerable subpopulation of recently discharged home health care patients and their caregivers or to describe home health clinicians’ role in facilitating better posthospital transitions.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>Qualitative methods were used because of their ability to elicit a range and variability of beliefs, behaviors, and experiences of study populations as well as the natural language people use to discuss these issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0193945911400448">Creswell, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0193945911400448">Pope &amp; Mays, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0193945911400448">Sofaer, 1999</xref>). Qualitative data collection was conducted between September 2007 and October 2008. Participants for this study included patients of a large, urban home health agency, their informal caregivers, and home health nurses and physical therapists from this agency. In this article, we use the terms <italic>patient, caregiver</italic>, and <italic>clinician</italic> to distinguish among the participants of this study. The home health agency’s Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved this study. All participants completed the informed consent procedure and received US$25 gift card as a token of appreciation.</p>
<sec id="section3-0193945911400448">
<title>Participant Recruitment</title>
<p>Potential patients were recruited first as an essential step before their informal caregivers and clinicians could be identified, recruited, and enrolled. Our sample size was based on expectation of reaching theoretical saturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0193945911400448">Guest, Bunce, &amp; Johnson, 2006</xref>). Potential patients were screened based on a standardized admission assessment (e.g., Outcome and Assessment Information Set [OASIS B1]). The study inclusion criteria were (a) admission from a hospital within 14 days (M0175), (b) overall good prognosis or full recovery (M0260), (c) the ability to communicate in English (agency item), and (d) the availability of an informal caregiver (M0360). Potential participants were excluded if the patient assessment indicated (a) cognitive impairment (M0560), (b) behavioral problems (M0610), or (c) hearing impairment (M0400). After the patients consented to participate, they were asked to identify three people who help them with their care and this list was used to recruit informal caregivers. We initially attempted to recruit home health clinicians who were caring for the study patients. However, we were unsuccessful despite vigorous efforts to invite their participation via email. To address this problem, a purposive sampling of home health clinicians was obtained from a list of potential clinician participants generated by frontline managers.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0193945911400448">
<title>Instruments and Procedures</title>
<p>Semistructured interviews were used to collect data from patients, caregivers, and clinicians. The first interviews of patients and caregivers elicited their experiences about (a) being in the hospital, (b) the hospital discharge and procedures, and (c) adjusting to a new daily routine of self-care at home (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0193945911400448">Table 1</xref>). Follow-up interviews focused on changes in medical status, health care needs, or caregiving activities since the first interview. In addition, after most interviews, the interviewers completed field notes to recount complementary data (e.g., descriptions of participant’s environment) otherwise not recorded. Medical records were selectively abstracted. Clinician interviews focused on eliciting typical care activities and the usefulness and helpfulness of discharge instructions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0193945911400448">Table 2</xref>). Baseline interviews took place within 45 days of the patient’s home health care admission, and follow-up interviews occurred 2 weeks after the baseline interview. We modified our protocol to a single interview after data analysis of the first 31 patient, and available caregiver interviews revealed that follow-up interviews were not contributing new data.</p>

<title>Qualitative Analysis</title>
<p>The purpose of the study, to describe three perspectives of the posthospital transition to home health care, guided our data analysis. We used a specific set of data reduction and reconstitution techniques, including a process of coding passages of text to identify responses to specific questions and to capture emergent themes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0193945911400448">Coffey &amp; Atkinson, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0193945911400448">Strauss &amp; Corbin, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0193945911400448">Wolcott, 1994</xref>). Content analysis is one common form of qualitative analysis and appropriate with studies aiming to “describe a phenomenon . . . when existing theory or research literature on a phenomenon is limited” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0193945911400448">Hsieh &amp; Shannon, 2005</xref>, p. 1279). It involves an open coding process that relies on emergent codes developed after immersion in the data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0193945911400448">Kondracki &amp; Wellman, 2002</xref>). Our coding process began with an immersion process during which each research team member was assigned to read approximately one third of participants’ full interview data (e.g., transcripts, field notes) and annotate text with codes that indicated content as well as overarching themes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0193945911400448">Ryan &amp; Bernard, 2003</xref>). The research team then compared coding notes, discussed areas of disagreement, and together developed a final coding list in a process <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0193945911400448">Waitzkin (1991)</xref> describes as “hashing out.” QSR’s NVivo 7 qualitative analysis software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0193945911400448">QSR International, 2006</xref>) was used to electronically code and manage data and to generate reports of coded text for analysis.</p>
<p>To assess consistency of coding among the research team over the study period, each member was randomly assigned to five-page portions of the transcripts previously coded by another member. A total of 31 transcript portions were chosen to represent a mix of participants (patient vs. caregiver) and time of the interview (baseline vs. follow-up). In addition, sections were selected to represent segments from the beginning, middle, or end of each transcript to span topics occurring at different points in the interview guides. Comparison of codes was discussed by the full research team, and when differences occurred, the team discussed the text and codes to reach consensus. Rather than attempting to achieve an interrater reliability coefficient, this exercise assessed whether the consensus reached during the initial coding development process was being maintained and identified whether additional nuances or distinctly new codes were emerging in subsequent interview data.</p>
<p>Several additional steps were taken to maximize the trustworthiness of data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0193945911400448">Lincoln &amp; Guba, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0193945911400448">Miles &amp; Huberman, 1994</xref>). These included (a) use of multiple interviewers, (b) extensive interviewer training and ongoing quality control, (c) rigorous review of transcripts against audio recordings, (d) use of multiple coders, (e) comparison to medical record information, (f) weekly team meetings, and (g) two debrief meetings with all interviewers.</p>

<p>Home health clinicians had worked a mean of 7.7 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 7.06) at the home health agency. The mean age of patients was 64.8 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 14.7). The mean number of prescribed medications was 7.9 (<italic>SD</italic> = 5.3). The majority of patients were female (72.5%) and more than half were from a minority population. Patients were admitted with a range of acute or chronic medical problems or for postsurgical care. Forty percent had a primary diagnosis indicating a need for rehabilitation therapy or postoperative services. Findings presented in this article focus on the hospital discharge process. The parentheses following quotes designate the type of participant and study ID.</p>

<title>Patient and Caregiver Preparation for Hospital Discharge</title>
<p>One important step to a smooth posthospital transition is for patients and their caregivers to know the day of discharge. A majority of patients (75%) recalled learning from the hospital staff of their discharge to home at least 1 day beforehand. However, caregivers did not share the same experience. Often, they reported learning about the discharge from the patient or other caregivers (e.g., sister), when they either directly sought information from staff or at times when the patient was already home. As one caregiver succinctly noted, “when she was released, I was at work. I came home. She was home” (ICG380). Another caregiver characterized the discharge as the hardest part of the hospitalization because she did not know about it as she “never saw a doctor” (ICG281). Another caregiver (ICG016) described the challenges of trying to get information during her visits to the hospital:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>Because I was very upset, I mean very upset. I been going up there, like I said, when I was able to five times while she’s been in there and I haven’t spoken to anybody. It’s weird that, you know, the day I came to get her to take her home, then somebody, the nurse, the discharge nurse, wound up explaining to me, you know, the status and what was happening to her.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Not all patients and caregivers experienced the same level of stress. Patients admitted for a planned surgery (e.g., knee surgery) were typically told what to expect during the hospitalization and the anticipated length of stay after surgery.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0193945911400448">
<title>Adequacy of Discharge Instructions</title>
<p>Most of the patients and their caregivers recalled receiving either verbal or written instructions, but to varying levels of detail. They used vague phrases to describe the discharge instructions. One patient recalled receiving “a list of the medications you’ll be on, you know, your prescriptions. All the discharge things that you could do or not do” (PAT281). Another summarized the information saying “Try to take it easy, not to—take everything slow—take my medication—on time, go to my appointments, it’s the most important thing. Uh, go to my chemotherapy when they ask you to go” (PAT168). Another patient recalled, “I don’t remember much a nurse told me as I was leaving” and later says he “would have liked written instruction because I was groggy after anesthesia” (PAT167).</p>
<p>The topics most frequently mentioned by patients were medications, followed by activity or exercise recommendations and, to a much lesser extent, dietary recommendations. Medical appointments were rarely mentioned by patients or caregivers, other than needing to “keep my medical appointments” or as one caregiver said, “she got to make sure that she make an appointment with this doctor here” (ICG379). Few patients and/or caregivers offered details about what to do if they encountered problems. For those that did, directions typically focused on calling 911 or going to the emergency room. One patient’s quote illustrates this point: “The only instructions they gave me is if you see anything happens to you call the ambulance right away. That’s it” (PAT168). A field note quoted a patient as saying, “[patient’s name], if you get anything or any symptom that you don’t understand, the phone is there, you got a 24 hr number to call” (PAT175).</p>
<p>Overall, patients and caregivers were satisfied with their discharge instructions or had few suggestions for improvement. In terms of the instructions, a few patients commented “more of it should have been in writing” (PAT 167), “some information was not practical” (PAT 268), or indicated an acceptance of the process saying, “They did just what you expect them to do” (PAT 281). One patient identified specific gaps, saying it would have been better “if they would’ve told me a little more about what I contracted, how it was affecting me. Is there a possibility that I could spread it? Is there a probability of reoccurrence?” (PAT 190). Most caregivers had little to say about improving the discharge instructions perhaps because they said they did not receive them or were not present at the hospital when discharge instructions were provided. However, one caregiver expressed frustration saying “[I] would have liked to have been told more about what was going on to him. Just good to be told anything at all” (ICG 167). Two caregivers described being satisfied because the instructions were “simple” (ICG 242) or “pretty thorough” (ICG 281). A few caregivers specifically mentioned wanting more information about medications.</p>

<title>Availability and Legibility of Discharge Instructions</title>
<p>Home health clinicians had varied perceptions of how often patients received hospital discharge instructions ranging from “very rarely” to “most of the time.” However, clinicians agreed that patients are often unaware of the information in those instructions. As one clinician (PT06) noted,</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>50%-60% of the time or very often they’re just in a stack, uh, of a pile of papers, which the patient neglects to read right away, since they’re just good about being home. I doubt that they’re read that often to be honest with you.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Another physical therapist (PT05) shared a similar view of what happens in the home:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>It’s just that they don’t know where they put it because you know, they have like a bag of luggage, a bag of laundry, a pack of paperwork . . . It’s just like coming home from a, from a vacation and all you wanna do is sleep and the next day, there’s somebody there to ask you things, you know.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Home health clinicians discussed legibility of the instructions as an issue, at least for patients. As one nurse (RN13) summarized, “Very few are legible to patients, but I’m able to read it.” A physical therapist (PT03) describes how printed instructions are most likely to be read by the patients, “They actually use it, but if it’s like written they, you know, usually depend on me to explain for them.” Several clinicians commented on similar problems with handwritten instructions and the improvement in legibility when hospitals provided printed information.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0193945911400448">
<title>Home Health Clinician Use of Discharge Instructions</title>
<p>Clinicians portrayed their critical role in accessing and interpreting discharge instructions for patients and their caregivers. One nurse described difficulty locating the instructions because the informal caregiver had taken them home. The nurse (RN13) continued that it,</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>really becomes a little problem. I have to call their daughter or their son or whoever has it. And try to see if they can, you know, they can read it to me over the phone and have them leave it at the patient’s house, so that I can have it the following day.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Both nurses and physical therapists described how discharge instructions helped them when making an initial home visit. As one physical therapist (PT02) recounts,</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>You know, if they’re coming home from a hospital to have the discharge papers ready when I get there . . . the referral document, uh, which is, uh, sometimes it’s very detailed, uh, high—a lot of times they are not. So, you know, giving, being, having a discharge, uh, summary—discharge papers really helps a lot.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>In addition to helping access the discharge instructions, home health clinicians helped patients understand them. As noted above, this was an especially important role when the discharge instructions were handwritten. Clinicians used the discharge instructions to generate conversation about their plan of care. A physical therapist (PT05) related how this strategy could lead to conversation when patients ask about “what’s normal and what’s not normal. What to expect from a recent surgery and what not to expect.” A nurse (RN09) supported this observation recounting, “A majority of them initially do not ask you information about them. If you do not ask them about those discharge papers, they don’t bring it up.”</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study substantiated prior research of patients’ experiences with discharge instructions and revealed some opportunities to improve the transitions for home health care patients and their caregivers. The patients in this study used vague terms when recalling discharge instructions in the hospital often lacking sufficient details, and at times, relying on their caregivers to know what to do. Some studies of patients’ understanding of discharge instructions have targeted key areas such as medications or resumption of normal activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0193945911400448">Calkins et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0193945911400448">Cumbler, Wald, &amp; Kutner, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0193945911400448">Kerzman, Baron-Epel, &amp; Toren, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0193945911400448">Kling, Schommer, &amp; Wirsching, 1998</xref>). Interestingly, most patients reported receiving more discharge information than they felt they needed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0193945911400448">Maloney &amp; Weiss, 2008</xref>), which suggests that discharge teaching may be overwhelming and potentially affect recall. The quality of the discharge teaching was associated with patients’ increased perceptions of being ready for hospital discharge more so than the amount of content received (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0193945911400448">Weiss et al., 2007</xref>). Miller and colleagues described patients as being surprised by the length of time it took to recover and the level of fatigue after they were home (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0193945911400448">Miller, Piacentine, &amp; Weiss, 2008</xref>), which may be a contributing factor to patients limited recall of discharge instructions. Other potential explanations for limited recall or a lack of suggestions for improvement may be patients feeling overwhelmed, accepting the status quo, or they had not experienced any problems to draw their attention to the missed information. Our study highlighted discharge instructions as a necessary component of communication that extends beyond the patient to include caregivers and home health clinicians. Although patients recalled receiving discharge instructions in the hospital, home health clinicians described significant issues concerning their legibility and availability in the home. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0193945911400448">Kripalani and Weiss (2006)</xref> described issues of health literacy and strategies to improve communication and this study underscores legibility of instructions be added as a concern. Whether instructions are printed was a fundamental issue of legibility reported by home health clinicians. Illegible or incomplete discharge summaries or referrals were noted impediments to a proper hospital discharge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0193945911400448">Bull &amp; Roberts, 2001</xref>). In addition to clarifying illegible discharge instructions, the clinicians in our study revealed how discharge instructions served several purposes not previously reported in the literature. Specifically, their strategic actions of finding, reviewing, and interpreting discharge instructions may justify this practice as an explicit and standardized step of the home health admission process to reveal transitional care issues. For example, if the clinician needed to search for the discharge instructions in a pile of papers, it could signal that the patient was overwhelmed, not interested, or may not understand the importance of these instructions. In general, clinicians who reviewed the discharge instructions may have gained valuable insight into patients’ and their caregivers’ understanding of needed care and expectations, as well as it gave them an opportunity to review and clarify key information, including what to do in an emergency.</p>
<p>Caregivers in this study described a peripheral status in care transitions. They experienced frustration with accessing information from the hospital staff, which underscores that the hospital discharge is more of a patient-centered rather than family-centered process. Hospital discharge processes do not systematically include informal caregivers. Instead, each caregiver is left to take the initiative and negotiate the complicated hospital communication system and patient privacy regulations. Caregivers in this study needed to actively elicit information from the patient or other caregivers, or they made efforts to contact the physician or hospital staff to obtain information or answers to questions. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0193945911400448">Bull and Jervis (1997)</xref> described similar challenges faced by daughter caregivers as they confronted problems at home and communicated with home care clinicians. Similar to our study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0193945911400448">Graham and colleagues (2009)</xref> described vague discharge instructions and inadequate caregiver training regarding personal care as well as skilled tasks that their loved ones required after being discharged home from the hospital. Home health clinicians in this study noted similar concerns of inadequate caregiver preparation and an issue they addressed in their work.</p>
<p>The limitations of the study include (a) a longer than planned 45 day window between hospital discharge and the first patient interview, (b) potential clinician selection bias, and (c) the use of one home health agency. The first two limitations were consequences of recruitment challenges and subsequent modifications to the enrollment procedures. We acknowledge that patients’ and their caregivers’ recall may have been affected by the time span between hospital discharge and the first interview, which may have contributed to their use of general statements rather than specific details. However, their lack of recall over time reinforces the need for continued follow-up and support for patients and their caregivers as they are “finding out what works” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0193945911400448">Bull &amp; Jervis, 1997</xref>). We also encountered poor response rates when we used emails to notify clinicians of a study and ask them to participate. Our revised recruitment strategy was more successful when first approaching clinicians via telephone from a list of potential participants generated by frontline managers. This approach may have led to biased sampling. However, the benefits of recruiting through frontline managers’ nomination were (a) participants who were identified as potentially good informants and (b) this strategy may have increased participation because of their administrators’ implicit support of the study. Registered nurses and physical therapists were recruited as the two most frequent disciplines responsible for patient care in home health settings, and as such, we recognize it does not represent the full interdisciplinary team perspectives. The fact that participants were home health patients and clinicians associated with one home health organization limits the generalizability of findings. They do not, however, impede the transferability of findings, that is, the ability to demonstrate applicability in other contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0193945911400448">Lincoln &amp; Guba, 1985</xref>).</p>
<p>In light of the growing attention to preventing hospital readmissions, these findings reveal potentially significant opportunities for improvement. First, patients in our study rarely described the follow-up appointments as critical discharge actions, yet this has been associated with lower hospital readmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0193945911400448">Balaban et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0193945911400448">Jack et al., 2009</xref>). Second, patients described being told to call 911 or go to the emergency room if they had problems. This may be a reasonable action in some instances, but there are likely other situations when early and regular monitoring, clear instructions and earlier contact with home health clinicians, and follow-up medical appointments would avoid costly, resource-intensive use of health services. Home health agencies typically provide patients and their caregivers with written information on how to contact the agency for questions and provide emergency numbers. However, additional detail and follow-up actions seems warranted. Recently discharged patients who had difficulty coping described a general sense of uncertainty about how to manage their illnesses and wanted more information about their anticipated recovery process, managing their fatigue, and knowing more about the “cause of the problem so as to prevent it in the future—reasons for admission” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0193945911400448">Miller et al., 2008</xref>, p. 290). Studies of hospital discharge redesign have illustrated benefits of interventions largely targeted at patients and outpatient physicians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0193945911400448">Balaban et al. 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0193945911400448">Jack et al., 2009</xref>). As this study illustrates, home health clinicians are valuable colleagues who must be more explicitly involved in the transitional care process to help prevent poor patient outcomes. Similarly, this study indicates the need to redesign hospital practices to proactively involve informal caregivers in the discharge planning and teaching efforts, similar to those advocated for by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0193945911400448">Levine and colleagues (2010)</xref>.</p>
<p>Once patients are home, home health clinicians encounter many challenges to implementing and coordinating care and have unique opportunities to intervene. Specific recommendations from this study highlight the need for home health clinicians to verify the presence, legibility, and patients’ understanding of discharge instructions as a standardized practice. In addition, discharge instructions can be an important basis for facilitating discussions with patients and informal caregivers (as allowed by patient) and enhancing interdisciplinary collaboration. To promote this practice, discharge instructions and home health orders need to provide details about symptom management and necessary follow-up care. In addition to such actions, alternative formats for reinforcing discharge information (e.g., podcasts) could provide an effective means of supplying critical, easy-to-understand information in accessible way at the best time—when patients are implementing their discharge plans.</p>
<p>The findings of this study underscore the urgent need of hospital-based actions to (a) proactively involve informal caregivers regarding the discharge plans and instructions, which should ideally include they are present at the time of discharge; (b) provide printed type, legible instructions specific to the patient’s condition and resources; (c) design strategies (e.g., brightly colored folders) that make it easier for patients to locate and use the instructions at home; (d) provide details about follow-up appointments; and (e) give more details about signs and symptoms parameters of when to call home health clinicians, outpatient physicians, or emergency response (911). Recent recommendations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0193945911400448">Kripalani, Jackson, et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0193945911400448">Snow et al., 2009</xref>) target actions to improve communication between hospital and outpatient physicians and include patient and families. An evidence review identified transitional care as a key element to advance excellence in geriatric home health care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0193945911400448">Feldman et al., 2009</xref>). In particular, it highlighted the research of two transitional care interventions developed at the University of Pennsylvania and the University of Colorado that demonstrated advanced practice nurses (APNs) improved posthospital patient outcomes and reduced rehospitalizations. Studies that redesigned hospital discharge processes also relied on nurses as part of the solution to improving posthospital transitional care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0193945911400448">Balaban et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0193945911400448">Jack et al., 2009</xref>). Essential improvements need to include interdisciplinary collaborations with home health clinicians, who are strategically positioned to facilitate better posthospital transitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0193945911400448">Naylor, 2006</xref>). Collectively, these recommendations can promote better partnerships between clinicians in different settings, support patients and their caregivers as they resume responsibility for their own health care, and very importantly, proactively plan for better symptom management and medical appointments, all of which hold promise to reduce hospital readmissions.</p>
