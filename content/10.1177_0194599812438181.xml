<title>Objective</title>
<p>In patients with laryngeal cancer, pretreatment diagnosis of cartilage invasion often warrants a surgical or a bimodal treatment. Controversy exists on whether laryngeal cartilage sclerosis on computed tomography (CT) scan is a sign of tumor invasion.

<body>
<p>In patients with laryngeal cancer, pretreatment diagnosis of cartilage invasion has an important impact on treatment choice and quality of life. It often warrants a treatment that may include total laryngectomy or a bimodal treatment such as concomitant chemoradiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599812438181">1</xref></sup> rather than radiation therapy alone.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599812438181">2</xref></sup> While many radiological signs of cartilage invasion on computed tomography (CT) examination have been described, some controversy exists regarding whether laryngeal cartilage sclerosis is a sign of tumor invasion and whether it has an impact on response to organ-sparing treatment such as primary radiation therapy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599812438181">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599812438181">4</xref></sup> Moreover, in the seventh TNM classification of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC), only the thyroid cartilage is mentioned. To our knowledge, there are no studies that have evaluated multiple survival outcomes in laryngeal cancer patients with evidence of cartilage sclerosis treated with primary radiation therapy. The purpose of this study is therefore to evaluate survival without locoregional recurrence, as well as organ-specific, disease-specific, and overall survival in this population.</p>
<sec id="section7-0194599812438181" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>A historical cohort study of all laryngeal cancer patients treated with primary radiation therapy (with or without chemotherapy) was conducted at the Université de Montréal Hospital Center (CHUM) in Montreal, Canada, between 2002 and 2007. There were no exclusion criteria. Exposed and nonexposed groups were defined as patients with and without laryngeal cartilage sclerosis on pretreatment CT scan, respectively. Images were acquired using Siemens SOMATOM Sensation 16 or 64-slice CT scanners, depending on schedule availability, with a slice thickness of 3 mm. The primary outcomes analyzed during the follow-up period were survival without locoregional recurrence, laryngectomy-free survival, disease-specific survival, and overall survival.</p>
<p>Medical charts were reviewed for demographic characteristics (age, sex, tobacco status posttreatment), tumor characteristics (staging, subsite, pathological differentiation, vocal cord mobility), and treatment characteristics (total radiation dose, radiation fractions, concurrent chemotherapy). The seventh version of the TNM classification system of the AJCC was used.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599812438181">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>A single head and neck radiologist reviewed all CT scans of the head and neck. Laryngeal cartilage sclerosis adjacent to the tumor was identified according to site (thyroid, cricoid, arytenoid) and laterality (ipsilateral to the lesion or bilateral). Cartilage sclerosis was defined as thickening of the cartilage cortex or as increased ossification of the medullary cavity, a definition that is consistent with what has been previously reported in the literature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0194599812438181">6</xref></sup> When cartilage that is contralateral to the tumor showed sclerosis, it was not classified in the sclerosis group as it was considered as having incidental sclerosis. An example of arytenoid sclerosis is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0194599812438181"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref>.</p>

</fig>
<p>Kaplan-Meier survival analyses were conducted for univariate analysis, and Cox proportional-hazards regression was used for multivariate analysis. The log-rank and likelihood ratio tests were conducted, and a <italic>P</italic> value of less than .05 was considered significant. All analyses were conducted using SPSS 17. This study was approved by the Direction des services professionals of the CHUM, which grants ethics approval for retrospective chart reviews.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>A total of 111 patients were identified for inclusion: 84 men (75.7%) and 27 women (24.3%). The mean age was 61.6 years, with a standard deviation of 10.5 years. Involved subsites were the glottis in 63 patients (43.2%) and the supraglottis in 48 patients (56.8%). Differentiation in order was moderate (52 patients, 46.8%), poor (28 patients, 25.2%), and well (13 patients, 11.7%). Vocal cord mobility was preserved in most patients (76 patients, 68.5%), decreased in 12 patients (10.8%), and fixed in 15 patients (13.5%). The male to female ratio was 3.1:1.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0194599812438181"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref> shows the distribution of our patients based on their TNM cancer staging. Cancers classified as T3 or T4 did not have evidence of laryngeal cartilage invasion. They were classified as such for other reasons, such as vocal cord fixation or invasion, or involvement of an adjacent subsite.</p>

The most reliable sign of cartilage invasion is extralaryngeal spread, defined as tumor invasion through a cartilage into the extralaryngeal soft tissues. It is highly specific (overall specificity 95% for all cartilages) but has a sensitivity of 44% because of the presence in only advanced disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0194599812438181">7</xref></sup> Penetration is defined as osteolysis through both cortices without extralaryngeal spread. In a study by Beitler et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599812438181">3</xref></sup> when penetration was read on CT, it was confirmed by histopathology in 74% of patients, and 87% of cases had at least cartilage invasion. Invasion is defined as osteolysis through the inner cortex, without penetration into the outer cortex. In the same study,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599812438181">3</xref></sup> invasion of the thyroid cartilage on CT was confirmed by histopathology in 23.5% of cases, whereas 35% of patients were found to have penetration on histopathological analysis.</p>
<p>In the latest AJCC TNM classification, invasion of the inner cortex of the thyroid cartilage defines a tumor as T3, and invasion of the outer cortex classifies a tumor as T4a. Outer cortex invasion usually commits the patient to more aggressive treatment modalities such as primary total laryngectomy, resulting in the loss of the organ.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0194599812438181">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0194599812438181">9</xref></sup> However, the arytenoid cartilages are not included in the current AJCC classification. Current practice at our institution was not to consider sclerosis as a sign of arytenoid cartilage invasion, resulting in treatment of these patients with primary radiation therapy or chemoradiation.</p>
<p>Sclerosis is defined as radiological thickening of the cortical margin or increased medullary density.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0194599812438181">10</xref></sup> It corresponds to bone remodeling or new bone formation induced by early microscopic intracartilaginous tumor spread, sometimes preceding actual invasion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0194599812438181">7</xref></sup> Sclerosis may also be due to peritumoral inflammatory changes, without actual invasion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0194599812438181">7</xref></sup> Some studies have shown that the specificity of sclerosis on CT scan with regard to tumor invasion varies from one cartilage to another, being lowest in the thyroid cartilage (40%) and higher in the cricoid and arytenoid cartilages (76% and 79%, respectively). Also, asymmetric arytenoid sclerosis was reported in 4.9% of patients without laryngeal cancer, as systemic diseases or vocal process granulomas may affect the arytenoids and cricoarytenoid joints.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0194599812438181">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been reported to be more specific (74%-88%) and sensitive (89%-94%) for laryngeal cartilage invasion, with a high negative predictive value (94%-96%).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0194599812438181">7</xref></sup> However, false-positives occur more frequently than with CT scanning (positive predictive value of 71%), mostly because reactive inflammation, edema, fibrosis, and ectopic red bone marrow in the vicinity of the tumor may display similar diagnostic features as cartilage infiltrated by tumor.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0194599812438181">7</xref></sup> Moreover, motion artifact, increased cost, and limited accessibility make MRI less frequently used than CT scanning. Such is the case at our institution.</p>
<p>Our patient population was composed mostly of men (75.7%), with a mean age of 61.6 years. This is compatible with what has been reported in the literature, with sex ratios ranging from 2:1 to 4:1 in favor of males.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0194599812438181">12</xref></sup> Also consistent with cited rates in the literature, glottic cancer was the most common location of laryngeal cancer in our investigation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0194599812438181">13</xref></sup> We did not document any cases of subglottic cancers treated with primary radiation therapy.</p>
<p>Our results first show that there was no difference in survival without locoregional recurrence between patients with and without laryngeal cartilage sclerosis. These findings are in line with some previously published work. Tart et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0194599812438181">14</xref></sup> showed that the local control rate of T3 glottic cancer patients treated with radiation therapy was the same whether these patients had evidence of isolated laryngeal cartilage sclerosis or not. Hermans et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0194599812438181">10</xref></sup> in 1999 also reported an absence of a significant correlation between cartilage sclerosis, lysis, and tumor visible on both sides of cartilage on CT examination and local or locoregional control rates in patients with supraglottic cancer.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Pameijer et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0194599812438181">15</xref></sup> showed that patients with T3 glottic cancer with sclerosis of the arytenoid and adjacent cricoid cartilage (“the adjacent sign”) have decreased local control compared with patients with either a single or absent cartilage involvement. However, this difference was not significant in their multiple regression model. Hermans et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0194599812438181">16</xref></sup> in a separate article published in 1999, also reported a significantly lower local control rate in glottic cancer patients with sclerosis of the cricoid cartilage on CT, whereas involvement of the arytenoid or of the thyroid cartilages did not yield a similar correlation. However, once again, this difference was not significant on multivariate analyses. Compared with the literature, our study is the first to include all stages and subsites of laryngeal cancer patients and to record sclerosis in all cartilages.</p>
<p>Moreover, this is the first study to analyze laryngectomy-free survival, disease-specific survival, and overall survival. As discussed previously, the goal of cross-sectional imaging was to aid in the pretherapeutic staging of cancers of the larynx in order to guide treatment selection between larynx-sparing procedures and total laryngectomy. Consequently, determining whether evaluation of cartilage sclerosis on CT scans actually affected organ preservation was considered of crucial clinical significance in this study. Our results demonstrate that the laryngectomy-free survival in patients with any evidence of cartilage sclerosis was not significantly different from that of patients without sclerosis (<italic>P</italic> = .381; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0194599812438181"><bold>Figure 2</bold></xref>). Moreover, we did not encounter a significant difference in disease-specific or overall survival, whether on univariate or multivariate analysis.</p>
<p>Although not shown in results, multiple cartilage sclerosis in a single patient did not adversely affect survival whether on univariate or multivariate analysis. This is consistent with previous studies in the literature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0194599812438181">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0194599812438181"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref>, patients with locally advanced disease had higher proportions of cartilage sclerosis. As most patients with advanced disease benefited from chemoradiation therapy, it would be interesting to hypothesize whether the addition of chemotherapy could explain the absence of significant difference on survival analyses.</p>
<p>The biggest limitation of our study is its retrospective nature. Hence, a possible loss to follow-up bias could occur, although the mean follow-up period of 3.4 ± 1.8 years seems to suggest adequate follow-up time, since most recurrences occur in the first 2 years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0194599812438181">17</xref></sup> Another limitation is the relatively small number of cases per group. Unfortunately, our study does not provide clinical and pathological correlates as none of our patients were operated, compared with other studies in the literature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0194599812438181">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0194599812438181">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>Despite these limitations, this study is the first to investigate laryngectomy-free survival, disease-specific survival, and overall survival. Although locoregional recurrence has been reported in the literature, no other previous work has examined this outcome in patients with various T classifications and laryngeal subsites. Because of the high prevalence of carcinomas of the larynx in head and neck oncology, we strongly believe that these analyses were necessary to provide additional insight to physicians who commonly manage laryngeal cancer patients with evidence of cartilage sclerosis on cross-sectional imaging.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Cartilage invasion often dictates the need for total laryngectomy in laryngeal cancer patients. Our results suggest that patients with laryngeal cartilage sclerosis on CT scan do not have significantly different locoregional survival, survival without laryngectomy, disease-specific survival, or overall survival compared with patients without sclerosis when treated nonsurgically. Validation of these results prospectively would be warranted. Moreover, further studies evaluating correlation of sclerosis with histopathological analysis could further specify whether sclerosis represents microscopic tumor invasion or reactive inflammatory changes.</p>
