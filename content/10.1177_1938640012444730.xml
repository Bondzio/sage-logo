<abstract>
<p>Background. The Jones fracture has been a topic of controversy ever since being first described by Sir Robert Jones himself in 1902. The aim of this review is to summarize the classification, management, outcome, and complications of this particular injury. Methods. The authors conducted a systematic review of the scientific literature regarding the Jones fracture. Results. There was no consistent approach to the Jones fracture classification. The rate of nonunion with nonoperative treatment is high in both acute and chronic cases. Surgical intervention reduces the incidence of nonunion, but the complication rate of surgery is high. Conclusions. Surgical intervention for the acute Jones fracture should be reserved for the athletic individual because there is a clear advantage in terms of time to return to sporting activity. Nonoperative treatment remains a viable alternative to surgery in all acute and delayed cases, providing there is no established nonunion and the patient is aware of the implications.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The Jones fracture has been a topic of controversy ever since being first described by Sir Robert Jones himself in 1902.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1938640012444730">1</xref></sup> No specific classification was described by Sir Robert Jones; instead, he referred to the eponymous fracture as being within about three fourths of an inch from the base of the fifth metatarsal. Sir Robert Jones’ article has since been inappropriately used as a source of a classification system, and others have proposed their own classification systems.</p>
<p>The Torg classification system is the most widely used.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1938640012444730">2</xref></sup> This system defines all fractures of the proximal fifth metatarsal as either involving the tuberosity or involving the proximal diaphysis distal to the tuberosity, the latter group being called Jones fractures. Torg then broke the Jones fractures into 3 subtypes. Torg type I fractures were acute fractures in patients who had had no previous fracture but may have had preceding pain or discomfort; radiographically, this type had no intramedullary sclerosis, a fracture line with clear margins, no widening or radiolucency, and minimal cortical hypertrophy or evidence of periosteal reaction to chronic stress. It is important to note that Torg type I fractures included those with some periosteal hypertrophy and some chronic stress. Torg type II fractures or delayed unions have a fracture line that crosses both cortices with associated periosteal new bone, a widened fracture line with adjacent radiolucency; and evidence of intramedullary sclerosis. Torg type III fractures or nonunions have a wide fracture line with periosteal new bone and radiolucency and complete obliteration of the medullary canal at the fracture site by sclerotic bone.</p>
<p>In this context, we conducted a systematic review of the scientific literature regarding the Jones fracture. The aims of this review were multiple. We aimed to review the classification used for Jones-type, proximal base of the fifth metatarsal fractures. We also aimed to assess the outcome in terms of time to radiographic union and how this varied depending on the type of fracture and the treatment strategy. We also assessed the complication rates of the different forms of treatment.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1938640012444730" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods and Search Strategy</title>
<p>The search strategy included a search of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, EMBASE 1980 to 2011, Ovid MEDLINE, MEDLINE and MEDLINE nonindexed items, Journals@Ovid full-text electronic journals, and Journals@Ovid database for searching, The search was undertaken in July 2011.</p>
<p>The following search strategy was used to identify relevant studies in MEDLINE (Ovid): Jones fracture*.mp. Additional studies were located by searching reference lists of short-listed articles. Hand searches of the following journals were undertaken on the following journals to include conference papers: <italic>Foot and Ankle Surgery, Foot and Ankle International, Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery</italic>, and <italic>Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery</italic>, British and American versions.</p>
<p>The citations identified from the searches were combined and duplicates excluded. All citations for articles clearly referring to a topic other than the Jones fracture were excluded, as were others whose title clearly showed that the article was not relevant to the current study. Only articles in the English language were included.</p>
<p>Full copies of the remaining articles were obtained and assessed. Those concerning the Jones fracture were included, and for the purposes of this study, all articles dealing with proximal fifth metatarsal fractures were initially included. Articles relating solely to tuberosity fractures were excluded, and those concerning studies that did include a group of relevant patients were only included if the data for this specific group could be extracted separately. Only articles that followed up the patient outcomes were included. Case reports were excluded. Relevant references were screened and assessed for inclusion.</p>
<sec id="section3-1938640012444730">
<title>Search Outcome</title>
<p>The searches resulted in 292 articles being selected. After duplicates had been excluded, 39 were relevant to the general topic area. However of these 39 relevant articles, only 19 met the specific inclusion criteria.</p>

<title>Fracture Classification</title>
<p>The Jones fracture was described as being within 1.5 cm of the tuberosity (13 studies), as being just distal to the fourth/fifth intermetarsal articulation (2 studies), as involving the fourth/fifth intermetatarsal articulation (1 study), as the proximal metatarsal (1 study), and as the metaphyseal–diaphyseal junction (1 study). No definition was stated in 1 study. Only 1 study subclassified proximal fifth metatarsal fractures as either involving the fourth/fifth intermetatarsal articulation or being distal to this area.</p>
<p>Of the 14 studies that included subacute fractures, 7 used the Torg classification to subclassify fractures as either acute, delayed unions, or nonunions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1938640012444730">
<title>Patient Characteristics, Fracture Chronicity, and Patient Follow-up</title>
<p>In total, 759 patients with 763 fractures were included in the 19 studies. There were 342 male and 142 female patients present in the 12 studies in which the sex breakdown of the patients was stated. The mean patient age was 28 years as calculated from the 15 studies that stated their mean patient age. Four studies included only athletes, whereas the other 15 studies were not selective for athletes solely.</p>
<p>Five studies included only acute fractures in which patients presented with less than 2 weeks of symptom duration, whereas the other 14 studies contained a mixture of both acute and chronic cases. Of the 14 studies that included both acute and chronic cases, 6 differentiated between the results of the 2 different groups of patients. As regards follow-up, 16 studies followed up 100% of patients, and the remaining 3 studies had patient follow-up rates of 96%, 95%, and 63%.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1938640012444730">
<title>Union Rates and Time to Radiographic Union</title>
<p>The mean incidence of nonunion for the acute Jones fracture was 20.8% with nonoperative treatment (14.9% with non–weight bearing and 24.1% with mixed weight bearing). The range of nonunion rates was 0% to 50% in the 8 studies that evaluated acute cases managed nonoperatively.</p>
<p>The mean time to radiographic union was 15.9 weeks in acute fractures treated nonoperatively (8 studies). The mean incidence of nonunion in all Jones fractures (acute and subacute) treated nonoperatively was 16.9% (11 studies). The nonoperative treatment protocols varied significantly from non–weight-bearing casts in some studies to immediate weight bearing without support in other studies.</p>
<p>Overall, 31 acute Jones fractures in 3 studies were treated with screw fixation. The surgical complication rate was 22.6%; there was 1 nonunion complication, and there were 6 screw-related complications, 3 of which resulted in screw removal. The mean time to radiographic union in this group was 7.1 weeks. One study treated the acute Jones fracture with external fixation, and the complication rate was 30% (1 nonunion, 1 infection, and 1 refracture).</p>
<p>In all cases managed surgically (301 patients from the 16 studies that included surgical outcomes), there was a complication rate of 19% (56 patients). Of the 56 surgical complications, 26 were related to screw removal for screw-related symptoms (9% overall rate), 15 were nonunions (5%), 8 were refractures (3%), 6 were screw-related symptoms without screw removal (2%), and 1 was a case of infection.</p>
<p>A total of 8 studies managed all patients surgically (7 with cannulated screw fixation and 1 with external fixation), and 3 studies managed all patients nonoperatively; the remaining 8 studies were mixed in their management strategy.</p>
<p>Of the 19 studies, only 4 stated a precise time frame by which nonunion was defined. In these 4 studies, the time frame used to define nonunion varied from 12 weeks to 26 weeks. Also, 4 studies used purely radiographic assessment, 8 studies used both clinical and radiographic assessment, and in the remaining 7 studies, no definition of nonunion was clearly stated.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1938640012444730" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The Jones fracture is generally defined as including all fractures of the proximal fifth metatarsal distal to the tuberosity and within 1.5 cm of this region, although this is not a universal definition; some describe Jones fractures as having to involve the fourth/fifth intermetatarsal articulation. The majority of authors have not separated out fractures involving the fourth/fifth intermetatarsal articulation from more distal fractures, meaning that detecting any differences between these groups in terms of outcomes with nonoperative treatment or surgery is practically impossible.</p>
<p>The heterogeneous nature of the evidence base makes interpretation very difficult. Not only is the fracture classification variable from study to study, but there are also huge inconsistencies in terms of the chronicity of fractures, the definitions of union and nonunion, operative and nonoperative treatment protocols, and the type of surgical fixation. This heterogeneity means that applying the evidence to the individual patient is not straightforward.</p>
<p>Despite these clear flaws in the evidence, it is clear that acute Jones fractures have a high incidence of nonunion when managed nonoperatively (20.8%). The fact that the nonunion rate was lower (16.9%) when nonoperatively managed subacute fractures were also included is probably a result of several biases. There was a significant selection bias in that the subacute fractures with the best chance of uniting were more likely to be managed nonoperatively than those with the worst chance of uniting. There was also significant bias in the varied criteria used by different studies for defining what constituted a nonunion.</p>
<p>The mean time to radiographic union in acute Jones fractures managed nonoperatively was 15.9 weeks versus 7.1 weeks in those managed by acute surgical intervention. This evidence is consistent with the fact that operative fixation allows a far earlier return to sporting activity than nonoperative management.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1938640012444730">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1938640012444730">21</xref></sup> The complication rate associated with surgical intervention is not insignificant, at around 19%, and almost half of these complications are either nonunions or refractures.</p>
<p>Nonoperative management of the acute and subacute Jones fracture remains a viable option as long as the patient is fully aware of the implications of this decision and the fact that union is often slow. The evidence shows no clear advantage of non–weight bearing over weight bearing for the initial management of acute injuries, although some authors do advocate non–weight bearing for all acute Jones fractures for the first 6 weeks.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1938640012444730">22</xref></sup> Once the decision of proceeding with nonoperative management has been made, hasty decisions to declare the fracture a delayed union or nonunion should be avoided given that the mean time to radiographic union is 15.9 weeks. Early surgical intervention has clear benefits for the athletic individual with a quicker time to radiographic union and a speedier return to sporting action than nonoperative treatment. The differing functional demands of the more athletic patient mean that surgical intervention is often preferred to nonoperative treatment for this very reason. The complication rate is significant, and this should not be forgotten when obtaining informed consent before surgery.</p>
<p>Although a lot more is now known about the Jones fracture than when originally described by Sir Robert Jones himself, some important questions remain unanswered. The best classification system remains that first described by Torg<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1938640012444730">2</xref></sup>; however, there is still some confusion as to the exact definition of a Jones fracture, with some authors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1938640012444730">23</xref></sup> describing the Jones fracture as being a separate entity and distinct from the 3 Torg subtypes (I, II, and III). We feel that it is practically very difficult to discriminate between acute Jones-type fractures with no periosteal hypertrophy or prodromal symptoms and some Torg type-I fractures, which may feature some minimal periosteal hypertrophy in response to chronic stress as well as some prodromal symptoms. To all intents and purposes, it is best to amalgamate these 2 groups in the Torg type-I subtype as was clearly described in the original paper by Torg et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1938640012444730">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>In our opinion, it would be useful to subclassify all fractures that are distal to the tuberosity as being either distal to the fourth/fifth intermetatarsal articulation (zone 3) or involving the fourth/fifth intermetatarsal articulation (zone 2)—both zone 2 and 3 fractures would be regarded as Jones fractures. This would enable any difference between zone 2 and 3 fractures in terms of time to radiographic union and nonunion rates to be determined by further research. A recent small study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1938640012444730">4</xref></sup> has suggested that there may be no significant difference between acute zone 2 and 3 fractures in this regard, but the authors also acknowledged that their small sample size may have resulted in false negative results. A large multicenter trial with greater sample numbers would be better able to address this question regarding any differences between zone 2 and 3 fractures.</p>
<p>A large multicenter trial would also be able to address the question regarding the optimal form of nonoperative treatment: Is there any advantage to a prolonged period of non–weight bearing, or is weight bearing as early as tolerated of no disadvantage in terms of patient outcomes? Other questions that have still to be addressed include the issue of when nonoperative treatment should be abandoned in favor of surgery in cases in which the patient was initially in favor of nonoperative treatment. There is still more to be discovered about the Jones fracture.</p>
