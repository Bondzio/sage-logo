<title>Background</title>
<p>In biomedical research, the signed consent form must be checked for compliance with regulatory requirements. Checking usually is performed on site, most frequently after a participant’s final enrollment.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1740774513480003">
<title>Purpose</title>
<p>We piloted a procedure for remote preenrollment consent forms checking. We applied it in five trials and assessed its efficiency to reduce form nonconformity before participant enrollment.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1740774513480003">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>Our clinical trials unit (CTU) routinely uses a consent form with an additional copy that contains a pattern that partially masks the participant’s name and signature. After completion and signatures by the participant and investigator, this masked copy is faxed to the CTU for checking. In case of detected nonconformity, the CTU suspends the participant’s enrollment until the form is brought into compliance. We checked nonconformities of consent forms both remotely before enrollment and on site in five trials conducted in our CTU. We tabulated the number and nature of nonconformities by location of detection: at the CTU or on site. We used these data for a pseudo before-and-after analysis and estimated the efficiency of this remote checking procedure in terms of reduction of nonconformities before enrollment as compared to the standard on-site checking procedure. We searched for nonconformity determinants among characteristics of trials, consent forms, investigator sites, and participants through multivariate logistic regression so as to identify opportunities for improvement in our procedure.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1740774513480003">
<title>Results</title>
<p>Five trials, starting sequentially but running concurrently, with remote preenrollment and on-site checking of consent forms from 415 participants screened in 2006–2009 led to 518 consent forms checked; 94 nonconformities were detected in 75 forms, 75 (80%) remotely and 19 more (20%) on site. Nonconformities infrequently concerned dates of signatures (7%) and information about participants (12%). Most nonconformities dealt with investigator information (76%), primarily contact information (54%). The procedure reduced nonconformities by 81% (95% confidence interval (CI): 73%–89%) before enrollment. Nonconforming consent forms dropped from 25% to 0% over the period, indicating a rapid learning effect between trials. Fewer nonconformities were observed for participants screened later in a trial (odds ratio (95% CI): 0.5 (0.3–0.8); p = 0.004), indicating a learning effect within trials. Nonconformities were more common for participants enrolled after screening (2.4 (1.1–5.3); p = 0.03), indicating a stricter scrutiny by form checkers.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1740774513480003">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>Although our study had a pseudo before-and-after design, no major bias was identified. Power and generalizability of our findings were sufficient to support implementation in future trials.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1740774513480003">
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>This procedure substantially limited nonconformity of consent forms with regulatory requirements before enrollment, thus proving a key component of a risk-based monitoring strategy that has been recommended to optimize resources for clinical research.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Major ethical requirements of clinical research include adequately informing prospective participants and obtaining timely, freely given informed consent, preferably in writing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1740774513480003">1</xref>]. The guidelines for Good Clinical Practice define the content of the consent form as well as the information that both the participant and the investigator must provide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1740774513480003">2</xref>].</p>
<p>As informed consent is a key ethical element of the legal protection of participants in biomedical research, participants or their families may prosecute investigators or sponsors for failure to comply with the consent process. The investigator is entirely responsible for obtaining the signatures on the consent form and proper storage of signed consent forms. However, to ensure that consent was obtained properly, the sponsor usually takes appropriate measures to confirm the existence of the participant based on clinical records and the compliance of the signed consent form with regulatory and study requirements.</p>
<p>Recommendations on consent form management deal with form content, reading level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1740774513480003">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1740774513480003"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1740774513480003">5</xref>], administration procedure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1740774513480003">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1740774513480003"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1740774513480003"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1740774513480003">9</xref>], understanding of the information provided [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1740774513480003">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1740774513480003"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1740774513480003"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1740774513480003"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1740774513480003"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1740774513480003">15</xref>], or with ethical issues for specific populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1740774513480003">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1740774513480003"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1740774513480003"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1740774513480003">19</xref>]. However, tools aimed at optimizing monitoring and documentation of consent form completeness have received little attention.</p>
<p>Noncompliance with regulatory requirements may arise during the consent form completion process due to forgetfulness and neglect or fraud on the part of the participant or the investigator. Although the participant’s existence can be confirmed only during an on-site visit, other information on consent forms can be checked remotely for presence and consistency, as long as the participant’s anonymity is preserved.</p>
<p>Furthermore, on-site monitoring visits cannot be scheduled on the exact day that each participant is screened. Therefore, regardless of the academic or industrial context, the risk associated with study participation, and the monitoring plan, site visits take place after enrollment, and after randomization when applicable, for most participants. Thus, the delay between enrollment and checking the consent form for compliance depends on the frequency of on-site visits by clinical research associates (CRAs) or other clinic monitors. We hypothesized that remote preenrollment checking of the signed consent forms could prevent many nonconformities with requirements and thereby reduce the possibility of legal proceedings related to consent issues.</p>
<p>Since 2005, our clinical trials unit (CTU) has been using a remote preenrollment procedure to check signed consent forms. The procedure respects participant anonymity and enables the investigators to bring nonconforming forms into compliance with requirements before enrollment. In this article, we describe the procedure, its efficiency in terms of reduction of nonconformity before enrollment, and the determinants of nonconformity that we have identified based on our experience.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>The <italic>Centre de Méthodologie et de Gestion d’Essais Cliniques</italic> (CMG-EC) of the <italic>Centre de Recherche, Institut National de la Santé et de la Recherche Médicale</italic> (INSERM) U897 is a CTU that designs and coordinates human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis studies for the French National Agency for Research on AIDS and Viral Hepatitis (<italic>Agence nationale de recherches sur le sida et les hépatites virales</italic> (ANRS)). It was established in 1995 to assist the ANRS in the methodology and conduct of trials and cohorts, and was certified ISO 9001:2008 in 2009 and 2012 for its trial activities.</p>
<sec id="section9-1740774513480003">
<title>Masked copy of consent form</title>
<p>Although only a duplicate consent form is mandatory, we routinely use a triplicate consent form. The original is collected by the sponsor from the investigator in a sealed envelope; one copy is given to the participant, and the third copy is stored by the investigator. Regardless of the number of copies, our procedure requires an additional copy in which the fields for the participant’s name and signature are partially masked by an overlay pattern added during form printing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1740774513480003">Figure 1</xref>). This pattern is designed so that the participant’s name and signature are illegible on the completed form, but their presence can be detected through the pattern. The choice of the printed masking pattern has been validated experimentally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1740774513480003">20</xref>].</p>

<title>Remote preenrollment checking of consent forms</title>
<p>The information flow related to the procedure is summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1740774513480003">Figure 2(b)</xref>. When a participant is considered as eligible, the investigator faxes (or transmits by some other means) his or her eligibility criteria form as well as the required screening information. The masked copy of the consent form also is faxed and checked by the trial CRA.</p>

</fig>
<p>Conformity with regulatory requirements is confirmed. Nonconformities that can be detected remotely are as follows: missing signature(s) on the consent form faxed to the CTU, incorrect trial identifier, incorrect consent form version, missing or incorrect participant’s anonymized identifier within the trial, missing participant’s name, missing participant’s signature, missing or illegible date of signature by participant, date of signature by participant prior to site initiation or after the participant’s screening visit, missing or illegible investigator’s name, unregistered investigator as defined by the guideline on Good Clinical Practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1740774513480003">2</xref>], missing investigator’s signature, missing or illegible date of signature by investigator, date of signature by investigator prior to site initiation or posterior to participant’s screening visit, investigator’s signature and date of signature obviously not from the same hand, and missing or illegible investigator contact details.</p>
<p>Nonconformities that can be detected on site only are as follows: nonexistent participant, missing signed consent form on site, incorrect correspondence between participant’s anonymized identifier and name, illegible participant name, and participant name and signature obviously not from the same hand.</p>
<p>In case the masked copy is not faxed to the CTU or a nonconformity is detected by the CRA, the participant’s enrollment is postponed until the consent form is corrected or a signed correct version or copy is provided.</p>
<p>Correction may require the participant to return to the site. For instance, when the date of the participant’s signature is missing or after the first examination, the investigator asks the participant to annotate the consent form with the notation ‘I consented on date of &lt;date of screening&gt;’. In some cases, the nonconformity cannot be corrected. In such situations, the correction may consist of a declaration on honor by the investigator that the signature was provided in fair conditions.</p>
<p>When the consent form is corrected or a new version or copy is completed and signed, the new masked copy is faxed by the investigator and checked again by the CRA. The process is repeated until the consent form is judged to comply with regulatory and study requirements. Only then is the participant enrolled, and randomized when applicable.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1740774513480003">
<title>Data collection</title>
<p>The remote preenrollment consent form checking procedure was first implemented in our CTU in 2005 for the extended follow-up period of a trial. To assess the value of the procedure, we identified all trials that screened participants, used a masked consent form and checked consent forms both remotely and on site. We used all consent forms that were checked remotely and on site before January 2010 for all participants screened for any of these trials.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1740774513480003">
<title>Nonconformities and efficiency of the procedure</title>
<p>Nonconformities were counted by type and source and classified according to whether detected remotely or on site. Any additional nonconformity that occurred during the process of correction of a first nonconformity was considered in the calculation as a relapse.</p>
<p>Procedural efficiency should have been calculated as the frequency of nonconformities detected remotely relative to nonconformities detected on site without the remote procedure. However, we did not collect data on nonconformities in the absence of the remote checking procedure. Therefore, we assumed that all nonconformities detected remotely would have been detected on site if the procedure had not been used. Thus, the number of nonconformities detected on site without remote checking was approximated by the total number of nonconformities observed with the procedure in use.</p>
<p>To improve the specificity of our estimator, we excluded from our data set the nonconformities that could not be detected remotely: for instance, consent forms lost after they had been signed and faxed to the CTU.</p>

<title>Analysis of determinants of nonconformity</title>
<p>We searched for the determinants of nonconformity in order to improve our consent forms or our consent form checking procedure. We used a logistic regression to model the occurrence of at least one nonconformity detected remotely or on site on a consent form. We included only generalizable variables as potential determinants in the multivariate analysis: (1) trial characteristics – phase, risk for participants assessed with the Optimon risk scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1740774513480003">21</xref>] as implemented in our CTU procedures, target trial sample size, expected number of sites, and expected average number of participants per site; (2) consent form characteristics – version (screening ± substudy, or subsequent amendment or substudy); (3) site characteristics, that is, proxies of site experience in HIV disease and clinical research – number of HIV-1-infected patients seen at least once in 2009, site participating in the ANRS network since its first trial (1989) and number of participants screened for our CTU trials in 2006–2009; and (4) participant characteristics – screening order in the trial within the site and subsequent enrollment in the trial after screening.</p>
<p>We screened potential determinants using univariate models that identified those yielding p-values of 0.15. Those who met that criterion were included in a multivariate model using backward selection at the 5% risk level. However, we did not include the most recent trial, ANRS 141 TIPI, in the multivariate analysis because of no nonconformity detected. We checked for linearity of quantitative characteristics, although the small number of trials did not permit full demonstration for quantitative trial characteristics. Statistical analyses were conducted with SAS<sup>®</sup> software [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1740774513480003">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1740774513480003">23</xref>].</p>

<title>Nonconformities and efficiency of the procedure</title>
<p>Five randomized trials screened potential participants between 3 May 2006 and 5 January 2010. One vaccine trial enrolled HIV-negative volunteers; the other four trials enrolled HIV-infected patients. Altogether, 415 participants were screened, and they signed 518 consent forms: 415 (80%) as initial consent forms, 73 (14%) for amendments to protocols, and 30 (6%) for a substudy. Altogether, 312 participants (75%) signed one consent form and 103 (25%) signed two consent forms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1740774513480003">Figure 3</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>Among the 518 consent forms checked remotely and on site, 439 (85%) were judged to comply with all regulatory requirements when reviewed initially. Sixty-six (13%) presented at least one nonconformity at the time of remote checking and 19 (4%) at on-site checking, for a total of 79 (15%) with a nonconformity.</p>
<p>Overall, 94 nonconformities were detected in the 79 nonconforming consent forms: 75 (80%) when checked remotely and 19 (20%) when checked on site. The 19 nonconformities detected on site all originated from the three trials that started screening in 2006 and 2007.</p>
<p>Among the 79 consent forms with at least one nonconformity detected remotely or on site, 64 (81%) had one nonconformity and 15 (19%) two nonconformities. For 6 of these 15 consent forms, the second nonconformity was a relapse, that is, a nonconformity created during the process of correcting an earlier nonconformity. The first nonconformity consisted of signatures on an incorrect form version in four cases, the signed consent form was lost on site in one case, and the physician was not registered as investigator in one case.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1740774513480003">Table 1</xref> presents the types and source of nonconformities detected. Investigators always submitted a consent form specific to the trial but sometimes used an incorrect version (12% of all nonconformities; 2% of all consent forms). Nonconformities concerning participant information were infrequent (12%) and mainly concerned date of signature (7%). The most frequent nonconformities concerned investigator information (76%), largely missing contact details (54%). Eighteen nonconformities on consent forms from two trials that began screening in 2006 and 2007 should have been detected during remote checking but were detected at on-site checking only: 5 involved participant information and 13 investigator information. One signed consent form for a trial that began screening in 2006 was lost by the investigator; this problem detected on site could not have been detected remotely.</p>

<p>The characteristics of trials, consent form, investigator sites, and participants are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1740774513480003">Table 2</xref>, with the proportion of nonconformity for each characteristic. The rate decreased over time from 27% for ANRS 129 BKVIR to 0% in the last trial ANRS 141 TIPI, which screened participants in 2009. The majority of the trials were phase II drug trials (76%), had high (D) level of risk for participants (75%), and started screening in 2006 and 2007 (87%). They primarily screened HIV-infected patients (67%). Median trial size (140 participants) was small with respect to phase II and III trials in general, but the number of expected investigator sites (44 sites) was high. Most of the consent forms were signed by participants for initial screening (80%). Most investigator sites were experienced in HIV disease (median of 1800 HIV-infected patients seen in 2009) and in clinical research with our CTU (median of 64 participants screened). Participant characteristics reflected the type of patients enrolled in our CTU trials at that time: men (73%), in middle age (45 years) who were born in France (65%).</p>

<p>The ANRS 141 TIPI trial (n = 69 participants) was excluded from the multivariate analysis because its nonconformity rate was null, thus leading to quasi-complete separation of data points and preventing model fitting.</p>

</table-wrap>
<p>The characteristics remaining in the multivariate model after backward stepwise selection were higher participant screening order within the site (odds ratio and 95% confidence interval: 0.5 (0.3–0.8); p = 0.004), indicating a learning effect within trials, and participant enrollment after screening (2.4 (1.1–5.3); p = 0.03), suggesting more stringent checking for compliance. A screening version of the consent form also was associated somewhat with less nonconformity (p = 0.07), also possibly as a result of more stringent checking initially.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>On-site visits confirmed the existence of all patients declared to have been screened; all had signed a consent form. One consent form was lost on site, but the corresponding masked copy had been received by the CTU. The proportion of consent forms that complied with regulatory requirements was high (85%).</p>
<p>Though nonconformities mainly concerned investigator information (76%), which may be seen as of little importance by investigators themselves, they sometimes concerned participants’ information (12%). These findings justify the use of a remote checking procedure before enrollment to prevent noncompliance. Our goal was to check consent form compliance with regulatory requirements remotely, at the CTU, without infringing participants’ anonymity. The method we adopted uses a copy of the consent forms that masks the identifying information provided by participants. A participant is not enrolled until all nonconformities have been corrected; ideally, there should no longer be any nonconformity in the consent form at enrollment.</p>
<p>After implementation and systematic use, our procedure reduced the number of nonconformities remaining at enrollment by 81% and reduced the number of consent forms with nonconformity by 77% overall. We also observed improvement over time, indicating a learning effect among investigators and CRAs. Altogether, the procedure proved very efficient; we made substantial progress toward our goal of elimination of nonconformities in consent forms.</p>
<p>Annual assessment of quality indicators of the performance of investigator sites belonging to the ANRS network began in 2006 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1740774513480003">24</xref>] for HIV and hepatitis trials conducted by the four French ANRS-sponsored CTUs. The first indicator is the proportion of consent forms in compliance with regulatory requirements, so the effect produced by our procedure probably was reinforced by the yearly communication of individual results to each site. Besides, though training on consent form signature was systematically delivered to sites during trial initiation, a specific training given to sites’ staff through the annual network meetings or a web-based training could also be beneficial.</p>
<p>Identification of factors associated with nonconformity led us to address weaknesses of the remote checking procedure. As already noted, both investigators and CRAs at the CTU demonstrated a learning curve regarding requirements. While the new procedure clearly added to working load of CRAs and investigators, it not only led to correction of nonconformity before enrollment when it occurred, but it also prospectively reduced the number of nonconformities detected during on-site visits and heightened sensitivity to other regulatory requirements for clinical trials.</p>
<p>Second, the risk of detected nonconformity was lower in case of participant’s nonenrollment posterior to screening, or subsequent version of the consent form. This probably signifies some neglect from CRAs in situations perceived as less important. This issue will be corrected by specific training of CRAs.</p>
<p>While our remote checking procedure may be applied to study designs other than clinical trials, it may be less efficient unless the investigator receives, in return, some information or action from the CTU or other coordinating organization, such as a random assignment or notification of identifier assigned to the participant only after the consent form has been judged to be fully compliant with requirements.</p>
<p>Our procedure and our analyses have limitations. First, efficiency should have been assessed through a before-and-after study, whereas we deduced the ‘before’ data after the procedure was implemented, based on the hypothesis that every nonconformity detected remotely would have been detected on site in the absence of the remote procedure. Moreover, we controlled for nonconformities generated by our design, although only one occurred. All in all, we believe that our before-and-after analyses were subject to negligible bias.</p>
<p>Second, we did not calculate any target sample size for our post hoc study but used all data available to us at the time of analysis. Nevertheless, the precision of estimation of the efficiency rates (8% for nonconformities, 9% for consent forms) was sufficient for decision making at all CTUs within the ANRS network.</p>
<p>Third, our study was based on data collected for another purpose; we did not collect detailed information on delay of completion of the procedure posterior to awareness of the nonconformity. We set up a new database management system in January 2010 to manage nonconformities. Of the nonconformities detected remotely among four recruiting trials up to August 2012, we calculated the delay of action or resolution after awareness of nonconformity. The median (interquartile range) delay was 0 days (0–0) for action (n = 21 nonconformities), and 1 day (1–1) for resolution (n = 17 nonconformities). The small number of nonconformities is due to the sharp drop in nonconformity occurrence in our trials since we implemented remote checking of consent forms.</p>
<p>Finally, the assessment of the procedure efficiency was based on the activity of only one CTU with only HIV trials. However, the procedure is being implemented in the other ANRS CTUs; thus, its efficiency will be validated externally, at least for HIV trials. We have no reason to expect efficiency to differ in other clinical fields. The remote checking procedure also will be assessed as a component of a risk-adapted monitoring strategy compared to a current intensive on-site monitoring strategy in the ongoing Optimon trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1740774513480003">25</xref>].</p>
<p>The operational cost for this procedure includes e-mail and mail contacts between the CRA and investigator sites and printing of the consent form, that is, €1–€3 per form depending on the number of carbonless leaves of the form and the number of forms to be printed.</p>
<p>Not only did the remote checking procedure improve the quality of consent forms before enrollment, it also convinced investigators to give more attention to completion of consent forms upon initial submission. We hope that this experience will affect compliance with other regulatory requirements such as toxicity reporting, an issue to be assessed in the Optimon trial.</p>
<p>Although remote preenrollment checking of consent forms has proved to be extremely useful in attempting to separate fraud from forgetfulness or neglect, in no way does it preclude on-site visits. Checking of consent forms during an on-site visit not only allows detection of nonconformities missed or not feasible during remote checking, it is also the only way to confirm a participant’s existence. However, remote checking of consent forms may reduce the frequency or modify the timing of on-site visits.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>We implemented a simple procedure for remote preenrollment checking of the signed consent form. It has been highly efficient with respect to reducing noncompliance with regulatory requirements before enrollment. It also resulted in a steep learning curve among investigators and CRAs. Finally, we believe the procedure helps to separate fraud from forgetfulness or neglect. Although a participant’s existence still must be confirmed through on-site monitoring, remote checking of consent forms for regulatory and study requirements before enrollment is a key component of a risk-based monitoring strategy in clinical research.</p>
