<abstract>
<p>Eighty-five patients had staging laparoscopic retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (L-RPLND) for nonseminomatous germ cell tumors at our institution. The largest lymph node size was measured and presence or absence of metastatic disease was determined. A total of 1139 lymph nodes have been removed and in 27 (31.8%) patients, metastases in one or more lymph nodes were detected. There were 338 (29.7%) hilar, 259 (22.7%) paraaortic, 221 (19.4%) interaortocaval, 171 (15%) paracaval, 133 (11.7%) preaortic and 17 (1.5%) precaval lymph nodes. The total number of lymph nodes with metastases was 74 (6.5%), and 1065 (93.5%) nodes did not have any metastases. The average size of a lymph node with metastases was 1.05 (0.3-3), and without metastases it was 0.55 (0.1-2.5) cm, (p&lt;0.001). If we use &gt; 1 cm size of a lymph node as a “cut-off” value for enlargement and presence of metastases, 60% of metastatic lymph nodes would be missed since they were all ≤ 1 cm. Our results have shown that decreasing size of lymph nodes which are considered positive from &gt; 1 cm to 0.7 -0.8 cm can be recommended, with specificity and sensitivity equal 70%.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The introduction of platinum-based multidrug chemotherapy, careful staging at the time of diagnosis, and adequate early treatment based on interdisciplinary management have contributed to excellent cure rates for low-stage nonseminomatous germ cell cancer of testes (NSGCT).</p>
<p>However, careful staging of lymph node status based on imaging modalities can carry significant risk of false negative results, since 20% to 30% of patients with clinical stage I NSGCT have metastatic disease in the retroperitoneum, which cannot be detected using these methods.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1066896911431452">1</xref></sup> On the other hand, surgical removal of lymph nodes can provide accurate staging and is therefore most likely better treatment for patients. However, it can also cause significant morbidity, although the risk related to surgery has been reduced significantly since the introduction of a modified nerve-sparing technique<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1066896911431452">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1066896911431452">3</xref></sup> and laparoscopic approach.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1066896911431452">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>The purpose of this study was to investigate/correlate the lymph node size and presence of metastases in them in order to find out how sure one can be when deciding on treatment options based on the lymph node size.</p>

<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<p>The patients with histologically proven NSGCT testicular cancer were included in this retrospective study. The initial treatment was orchidectomy. For each patient, serum markers were analyzed before and after the initial treatment. Postorchidectomy abdominal or chest and abdominal computed tomography (CT) were also done. If there were no clinical signs of metastatic disease, if there was normalization in serum markers (α-fetoprotein, β subunit of human chorionic gonadotrophin, and lactic dehydrogenase), negative findings on chest X-ray, and no enlarged lymph nodes on CT, laparoscopic retroperitoneal lymphadenectomy (L-RPLND) was performed 1 to 3 months after the orchidectomy. In total, 85 patients with L-RPLND performed from August 2001 to September 2008 at the Urology Department, Clinical Hospital Center Zagreb, Zagreb, Croatia, were eligible and included in the study. Right side template included all preaortic tissue between the left renal vein and the inferior mesenteric artery, the interaortocaval nodes, and all tissue on the ventral and lateral surfaces of the vena cava extending laterally to the ureter. The template is bounded superiorly by the right renal vessels and inferiorly by where the ureter crosses the iliac vessels. Left side template included tissue between left renal vein (renal hilum) and ureter, which defines the lateral border of the dissection. The inferior border was crossing of ureter and common iliac artery. Dissection was continued along the lateral and anterior surfaces of aorta to the level of inferior mesenteric artery. All the lymph nodes that were removed were reviewed by a single pathologist at our institution. Adipose tissue with lymph nodes was received at the Departament of Pathology in 10% buffered formalin. During gross examination the tissue fragment was measured and carefully dissected, to harvest as many lymph nodes as possible. The size of the smallest and the largest node was noted. All the lymph nodes were embedded in paraffin blocks. Possible foci of tumor encountered during dissection were measured and sampled.</p>
<p>Statistical analyses were performed using software Statistic 6.1 StatSoft. For qualitative data we used frequency tables, cross-tabulation tables, and the hi-quadrat test, whereas we used the analysis of variance for quantitative data. A <italic>P</italic> value less than .05 was considered as a statistically significant difference.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>The average age of patients at the time of operation was 29 years (range 17-48 years). A total of 1139 lymph nodes from 85 patients were removed and 27 (31.8%) patients had metastases in one or more lymph nodes. Out of 27 patients, 23 (85%) had metastatic embryonal carcinoma and 4 had metastatic mature teratoma. There were 338 (29.7%) hilar, 259 (22.7%) paraaortic, 221 (19.4%) interaortocaval, 171 (15%) paracaval, 133 (11.7%) preaortic, and 17 (1.5%) precaval lymph nodes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1066896911431452">Table 1</xref>). The total number of lymph nodes with metastases was 74 (6.5%) and 1065 (93.5%) nodes did not have any metastases. The average size of a lymph node with metastases was 1.05 cm (range 0.3-3.0 cm) and the average size of a lymph node without metastases was 0.55 cm (0.1-2.5 cm), which was a statistically significant difference (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001). The size of metastatic foci in lymph nodes varied from 0.1 to 1.9 cm. Distribution of lymph nodes size in different anatomic regions and presence or absence of metastases is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1066896911431452">Figure 1</xref>. For patients without metastases there were no statistically significant differences in a lymph node size between different anatomical regions (<italic>P</italic> = .101), but for patients with metastases there was a statistically significant difference in size in different anatomical regions (paraaortic, hilar, interaortocaval vs precaval, paracaval, preaortic; <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001). Sensitivity and specificity was calculated for different sizes of lymph nodes from 0.5 to 2 cm (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1066896911431452">Table 2</xref>). For example, for a lymph node that was 0.7 cm in size, sensitivity and specificity were 80% and 60%, respectively, whereas for one that was 0.5 cm in size, they were 88% and 50%, respectively. False positive and false negative results in correlation with lymph node size are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1066896911431452">Figure 2</xref>.</p>

<p>In our group of patients, the average blood loss was 55 mL (range 20-150 mL); 3 patients (3.5%) had prolonged lymphorea (6-12 days) and they were treated conservatively. A patient with horse shoe kidney had temporarily (for 6 months) retrograde ejaculation. No other significant morbidities were recorded.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Next to radical orchidectomy, there are different treatment options, including surveillance, chemotherapy, and retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (RPLND) that are suitable for an early stage of disease. Each of these methods has some advantages and disadvantages. Patients can be treated insufficiently and the disease can relapse in a more advanced form if we choose surveillance and if the compliance is poor. On the other hand, they can be overtreated if we choose chemotherapy, which can be related to significant acute or long-term adverse effects, such as increased chance of cardiovascular, nephro- and neurotoxicity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1066896911431452">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1066896911431452"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1066896911431452">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>Apart from pathohistological findings, regional lymph node status is the major determinant in choosing between these treatment options. Nevertheless, proper staging of regional lymph nodes is not an easy task. CT based on lymph nodes size is the most commonly used noninvasive procedure for staging, but up to 44% of patients will have a false-negative rate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1066896911431452">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1066896911431452"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1066896911431452">10</xref></sup> Magnetic resonance imaging, as another noninvasive method of disease staging, has not shown any significant improvements and it has 2 important disadvantages, including higher price and a limited number of institutions where it is available. Other methods such as magnetic resonance imaging with lymphotrophic nanoparticles and flourodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography are still in an experimental stage.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1066896911431452">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>Surgical removal of retroperitoneal lymph nodes has at least 2 advantages: removal of metastases itself and better staging of the disease. Therefore, it has a possibility of choosing better treatment options for these patients. On the other hand, RPLND is a demanding surgical procedure associated with significant morbidities. With reduction of the operative field (template) by performing nerve sparing unilateral lymph node dissection and introduction of laparoscopic approach, this morbidity has dropped significantly.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1066896911431452">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1066896911431452"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1066896911431452">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>By using L-RPLND we have removed and analyzed more than 1100 lymph nodes from patients who were clinically, biochemically, and CT negative for metastases. However, out of 85 patients, 27 (31.8%) had metastases in one or more lymph nodes, which puts these findings in the range of other studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1066896911431452">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1066896911431452">12</xref></sup> In total, 60% of lymph nodes with metastases in our study were ≤1 cm. Lymph nodes of this size are considered as unenlarged on a CT as well and they are therefore not suspicious for the presence of metastases. So, if we used the criteria of &gt;1 cm as a “cutoff” value for enlargement, they would be missed. By using the smaller size criteria (0.5 and 0.7 cm), there is a decrease of false-negative findings, but there is also a drop in specificity. For 0.7 cm, sensitivity and specificity were 80% and 60%, respectively, and for 0.5 cm they were 88% and 50%, respectively. Similar findings have been shown in studies testing the accuracy of CT in detection of lymph node metastases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1066896911431452">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1066896911431452">13</xref></sup> Optimal size in our study according to false-positive and false-negative values would be between 0.7 and 0.8 cm (approximately 30% false positive and false negative), but one has to be aware that there were metastases in lymph nodes that were only 0.3 cm in size. These small sizes (≤0.4 cm) cannot be measured reliably on CT because of its spatial resolution, and lymph nodes of this size cannot be distinguished reliably from small blood vessels.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1066896911431452">13</xref></sup> This is important to know when deciding about treatment options based on CT.</p>
<p>In all, 85% of our patients with metastases in lymph nodes had metastatic embryonal carcinoma, which is well known for its metastatic potential and is 1 of 2 most important predictors of disease recurrence after initial treatment, along with lymphovascular invasion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1066896911431452">14</xref></sup> The remaining 15% of patients had metastatic teratoma, which is chemoresistant and for these patients, L-RPLND was not only a staging procedure but also a method of treatment.</p>
<p>One weakness of our study is a much higher number of negative lymph nodes compared with the positive ones. This is related to patient selection for the laparoscopic staging procedure itself.</p>
<p>When deciding on which approach to choose, one has to have in mind all the pros and cons for the patients. All imaging methods used for lymph node staging, with CT scan being the most common, have high false-negative rates. Although this can be improved by reducing the size of a lymph node, it is related to the loss of specificity and limitations regarding the small sizes (≤0.4 cm). We have shown that 60% of nodes with metastases were ≤1 cm and would be missed if we considered only those &gt;1 cm for being positive. Optimal size in our study according to false-positive and false-negative values with approximately 30% of false positive and false negative would be between 0.7 and 0.8 cm, but it is important to state that there were metastases in lymph nodes that were only 0.3 cm in size.</p>
