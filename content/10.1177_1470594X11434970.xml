<p>This special issue of <italic>Politics, Philosophy and Economics</italic> explores issues related to applications of complexity theory in the social sciences. The authors are two social scientists (Steven Durlauf and Scott Page) and one philosopher (Kevin Zollman). This range of disciplinary backgrounds is appropriate as complexity can be understood, alternatively, as a description of certain substantive environments, either socioeconomic or physical, or as a set of mathematical systems. These authors all attempt to understand how the ideas associated with complexity, as understood as a class of mathematical systems, can be applied to the social sciences.</p>
<p>The relationship between complexity and the social sciences remains controversial, with strong proponents and equally adamant critics. Some aspects of this controversy are reflected in this special issue. Page’s article entitled ‘A complexity perspective on institutional design’ and Zollman’s article entitled ‘Social network structure and the achievement of consensus’ provide positive evaluations of the use of complex systems methods for policy construction and for understanding social outcomes. In contrast, Durlauf’s article, ‘Complexity, economics, and public policy’, is harshly critical of the uses of complexity by critics of neoclassical economics, but also argues that complex systems methods are capable of contributing to economics if used judiciously with appropriate attention to the behavioral assumptions made about individuals as well as appropriate attention to the environments in which they interact.</p>
<p>While these articles would seem to span the range of opinions about whether complexity has something important to add to the social sciences, they are in fact closer than it would initially appear. Durlauf’s critique involves broad claims about the relationship between complexity and the study of socioeconomic systems, whereas Page and Zollman focus on much more specific contexts in which to employ complex systems methods. In this respect, Page and Zollman follow the implications of Durlauf’s criticisms of existing studies in that they each address the use of complexity in well-defined socioeconomic environments. This is not to say that Durlauf would endorse the analyses in either article or that Page and Zollman would endorse either Durlauf’s article or accept criticisms he would make based on the ideas in his article. Rather, I would emphasize that Page and Zollman should be read as focusing on the application of complex systems thinking to concrete questions, while Durlauf is addressing the relationship between economics and complexity at a more abstract level, and so the articles are not necessarily contradictory.</p>
<p>One reason why complexity remains largely on the fringes of the social sciences is the absence of a body of statistical work that discusses how complex systems features may be identified in socioeconomic data, let alone an empirical literature that applies the same standards of inference and abduction that are used to assess empirical social science in general. Hence, much dispute involving complexity involves the appropriateness of modeling assumptions and is conducted on a priori terms. My personal view is that complexity will continue to play a peripheral role in the social sciences until an empirics of complexity is developed. But this is completely appropriate and should not be regarded as an attack on the potential of complexity. Social science advances have always involved the interplay of theory and empirics, as I believe is true for science in general. Hence, regardless of one’s current view of the state of complexity and social science, there is much that remains to be done if the former’s potential is to be fully developed.</p>
