<p><bold>Objective:</bold> To evaluate stimulant medication on symptoms and functioning for college students with ADHD using double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design. <bold>Method:</bold> Participants included 24 college students with ADHD and 26 college students without psychopathology. Lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (LDX) was examined for ADHD participants over five weekly phases (no-drug baseline, placebo, 30-, 50-, and 70-mg LDX per day). Self-report rating scales of functioning and direct assessment of ADHD symptoms, verbal learning/memory, and adverse side effects were collected (baseline only for control students). <bold>Results:</bold> LDX was associated with large reductions in ADHD symptoms and improvement in executive functioning along with smaller effects for psychosocial functioning. Reduction in ADHD symptoms was found for 86.4% of participants; however, large differences in symptoms and executive functioning remained relative to controls. <bold>Conclusion:</bold> LDX is a safe, efficacious treatment for symptom relief in college students with ADHD. Research documenting medication effects on academic functioning and evaluating psychosocial/educational interventions is needed.</p>

<body>
<p>Symptoms of ADHD typically first appear in early childhood and are chronic for the majority of affected individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1087054711427299">Barkley, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1087054711427299">Barkley, Murphy, &amp; Fischer, 2008</xref>). Due to the chronicity of ADHD and frequent association of symptoms with academic impairment, research has focused on the challenges experienced by college students with this disorder. As college students are not required to disclose their ADHD diagnosis to institutions, the prevalence of ADHD among college students is difficult to ascertain, but various studies have found that between 2% and 8% of college students exhibit clinically significant levels of ADHD symptoms (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1087054711427299">DuPaul et al., 2001</xref>). In a recent survey of college freshmen, 6.4% of men and 3.8% of women (5% overall) reported having ADHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1087054711427299">Pryor, Hurtado, DeAngelo, Blake, &amp; Tran, 2010</xref>). In fact, ADHD was the most prevalent disability of any kind reported by 1st-year students in this survey.</p>
<p>Studies have also examined the extent to which significant ADHD symptoms in college students are associated with deficits in various areas of functioning (for review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1087054711427299">DuPaul, Weyandt, O’Dell, &amp; Varejao, 2009</xref>). By far, the most ubiquitous impairments are found for academic performance with studies indicating that college students with ADHD obtain lower grade point averages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1087054711427299">Heiligenstein, Guenther, Levy, Savino, &amp; Fulwiler, 1999</xref>) and are more likely to experience academic impairment than their non-ADHD peers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1087054711427299">Lewandowski, Lovett, Codding, &amp; Gordon, 2008</xref>). Preliminary findings suggest that academic deficits may be related to symptomatic inattention as well as executive functioning deficits, including inadequate academic coping strategies, poor organizational/study skills, and time management difficulties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1087054711427299">Norwalk, Norvilitis, &amp; MacLean, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1087054711427299">Reaser, Prevatt, Petscher, &amp; Proctor, 2007</xref>). Some studies have found college students with ADHD to exhibit deficits in psychological (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1087054711427299">Rabiner, Anastopoulos, Costello, Hoyle, &amp; Swartzwelder, 2008</xref>), emotional (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1087054711427299">Ramirez et al., 1997</xref>), and social (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1087054711427299">Kern, Rasmussen, Byrd, &amp; Wittschen, 1999</xref>) functioning. Although college students with ADHD may be only mildly impaired relative to standardization samples, a recent study found large effect size differences in executive, academic, psychological, and social functioning in comparison with college students who do not have ADHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1087054711427299">Weyandt et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Psychotropic medications, particularly psychostimulants, are the primary treatment for managing ADHD in adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1087054711427299">Prince, Wilens, Spencer, &amp; Biederman, 2006</xref>). Numerous controlled studies have found stimulants to reduce ADHD symptoms and, in some cases, enhance functioning in adults with ADHD (for review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1087054711427299">D. F. Connor, 2006</xref>). Recent investigations have focused on the prodrug stimulant lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (LDX), given that it was developed to provide longer duration of effect throughout the day; in addition, it may have a lower abuse potential than is found with dextroamphetamine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1087054711427299">Najib, 2009</xref>). The results of open-label (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1087054711427299">Brown, Brams, Gao, Gasior, &amp; Childress, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1087054711427299">Krishnan, Pennick, &amp; Stark, 2008</xref>) and placebo-controlled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1087054711427299">Adler et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1087054711427299">Wigal et al., 2010</xref>) studies have found that LDX usage is associated with reductions in ADHD symptoms among adults with ADHD as well as improved executive and overall functioning, including enhanced performance on structured academic tasks.</p>
<p>Although the prevalence of pharmacotherapy in the college ADHD population has not been studied extensively, available evidence suggests that the majority of college students with this disorder are prescribed stimulants to provide symptom relief (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1087054711427299">Advokat, Lane, &amp; Luo, 2010</xref>). Uncontrolled and qualitative investigations suggest that stimulants may reduce symptoms, particularly inattention, in the college ADHD population (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1087054711427299">Heiligenstein, Johnston, &amp; Nielsen, 1996</xref>). Alternatively, qualitative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1087054711427299">Loe &amp; Cuttino, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1087054711427299">Meaux, Hester, Smith, &amp; Shoptaw, 2006</xref>) and survey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1087054711427299">Advokat et al., 2010</xref>) data indicate that at least some college students treated with stimulants are ambivalent about their treatment, due to adverse side effects and/or perceived limited effects of pharmacotherapy. Further research has raised concerns over the possibility that college students with ADHD may give or sell stimulants to their peers who are seeking to use these drugs for recreational purposes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1087054711427299">Rabiner et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1087054711427299">Upadhyaya et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1087054711427299">Weyandt et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>We are unaware of any prior controlled investigation of any stimulant medication, including LDX, for the treatment of ADHD in a sample exclusively composed of college students. This is an important gap in the literature because results obtained with adults of varying ages operating in noneducational environments cannot be assumed to generalize to the functioning of young adults in college settings, who are expected to demonstrate successful functioning in a postsecondary educational environment. Furthermore, specific examination of stimulant medication in the college population is necessary given the high risk of alcohol and substance use in this age group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1087054711427299">Smith, Molina, &amp; Pelham, 2002</xref>) and the growing problem of medication diversion in the college population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1087054711427299">Weyandt et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The purpose of this study was to investigate the acute effects of three dosages of LDX (30 mg, 50 mg, and 70 mg) relative to placebo and medication-free baseline conditions in a sample of college students with ADHD. This is the first study to investigate medication in this population using a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design. Medication outcomes in two primary areas (ADHD symptoms and executive functioning) were examined, given prior evidence that these are the two areas most frequently impaired in this population. Treatment outcomes were also examined regarding psychological and social functioning. Potential impact on alcohol and drug use, as well as experience of adverse side effects, was evaluated. It was hypothesized that ADHD symptoms and related executive functioning would be significantly improved for all three active dosages relative to baseline and placebo. Furthermore, we explored whether LDX would enhance psychological and social functioning without increasing risk of adverse side effects, including greater use of alcohol or illicit substances. Finally, data were also collected on a non-ADHD control sample to examine whether LDX normalized functioning across these domains.</p>

<title>Participants and Setting</title>
<sec id="section3-1087054711427299">
<title>Students with ADHD</title>
<p>Participants were recruited from student disabilities and health service offices at two universities in the Northeastern United States (one public and one private). Students already identified with ADHD who registered with the student disabilities office at either university were targeted for recruitment. In addition, students with ADHD who were not registered with student disabilities were recruited via undergraduate classes, campus flyers, and campus newspapers; to be eligible for the study, however, students needed to provide written documentation of their ADHD diagnosis.</p>
<p>ADHD diagnoses were confirmed by insuring that all students (a) met <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</italic> (4th ed., text rev.; <italic>DSM-IV-</italic>TR; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1087054711427299">American Psychiatric Association [APA], 2000</xref>) criteria for one of three ADHD subtypes based on diagnostic interview with student or parent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1087054711427299">Barkley &amp; Murphy, 2006</xref>) and (b) scored at or above the 90th percentile on current symptom ratings based on self-report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1087054711427299">C. K. Conners, Erhardt, &amp; Sparrow, 1999</xref>) or had parent ratings of childhood symptoms that met <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</italic> (4th ed.; <italic>DSM-IV</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1087054711427299">APA, 1994</xref>) criteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1087054711427299">Barkley &amp; Murphy, 2006</xref>). In addition, students were excluded from participation if any one of the following were present: (a) significant cardiac condition based on medical history and/or physical examination, (b) significant illicit substance abuse based on self-report and toxicology screen at intake, (c) pregnant based on self-report and blood screen, and/or (d) significant symptoms of major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, or thought disorder based on initial diagnostic interview.</p>
<p>The 24 participants were between 18 and 23 years of age (<italic>M</italic> = 20.17, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.20) and were primarily male (62.5%), White non-Hispanic (91%), in their senior year of college (44%), and had fathers (65%) and mothers (62.5%) with bachelor’s or higher degrees. Of the 24 participants, 6 met criteria for ADHD Predominantly Inattentive type, 1 met criteria for ADHD Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive type, and 17 met criteria for ADHD Combined type based on self-report of symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1087054711427299">Barkley &amp; Murphy, 2006</xref>). In addition, participants met criteria for oppositional defiant disorder (29%), specific phobia (12.5%), social phobia (8%), and generalized anxiety disorder (21%). Prior to the LDX trial, 15 participants were receiving central nervous system (CNS) stimulant medication (4 LDX, 4 methylphenidate, 6 mixed amphetamine salts, 1 dextroamphetamine) and 1 participant was receiving modafinil for ADHD.</p>
<p>Diagnostic interviews and weekly assessment sessions were conducted in laboratories at each university. Although rooms varied for different procedures, they were located in the same building and were similar in size across sessions and universities.</p>

<title>Control student sample</title>
<p>A sample of 26 students without ADHD was included so that possible LDX effects for students with ADHD could be compared with the functioning of typical college students (without medication). These were the same students who participated as nondisordered controls in the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1087054711427299">Weyandt et al. (2011)</xref> study.

Control students were between 18 and 22 years of age (<italic>M</italic> = 20.00, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.17) and were primarily male (54%), White non-Hispanic (81%), in their senior year of college (31%), and had fathers (62%) and mothers (66%) with bachelor’s or higher degrees (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1087054711427299">Table 1</xref>). None of the control participants received psychotropic medication. Chi-square analyses revealed no significant differences between ADHD and control participants for gender, χ<sup>2</sup>(1, <italic>N</italic> = 50) = 0.384, <italic>p</italic> = .536; ethnicity, χ<sup>2</sup>(4, <italic>N</italic> = 48) = 4.724, <italic>p</italic> = .317; year in college, χ<sup>2</sup>(3, <italic>N</italic> = 49) = 2.224, <italic>p</italic> = .527; father’s education level, χ<sup>2</sup>(4, <italic>N</italic> = 49) = 2.669, <italic>p</italic> = .609; or mother’s education level, χ<sup>2</sup>(5, <italic>N</italic> = 50) = 3.695, <italic>p</italic> =.594.

<title>Procedures</title>
<p>The student disabilities offices at each university were informed of the study prior to formal recruitment, and the directors were provided with flyers, frequently asked questions, and detailed information regarding the study that they could pass on to potential participants. Interested students were provided with the project coordinator’s contact information, and the student disabilities office director also received written or oral consent from students to have the project coordinator contact them directly.</p>
<p>This study was conducted in a manner consistent with the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice according to International Conference on Harmonisation guidelines. Each university’s institutional review board approved the study protocol. All students were at least 18 years old and provided written informed consent prior to participation. To ensure confidentiality, the signed consent form was filed in a folder separate from other materials, and participants were assigned identification numbers that appeared on their research materials.</p>
<p>Students then underwent a clinical evaluation to confirm their ADHD diagnosis, or in the case of control participants, to establish the absence of ADHD and other disorders, by meeting individually with the project coordinator (master’s- level psychologist) at their respective university to complete a structured diagnostic interview (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1087054711427299">Barkley &amp; Murphy, 2006</xref>). The interview lasted approximately 1 hr and screened for ADHD symptoms based on <italic>DSM-IV-TR</italic> criteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1087054711427299">APA, 2000</xref>) as well as conduct and antisocial disorders, and mood disorders, including anxiety, depression, and bipolar disorder. Students were asked to report presence of ADHD symptoms during the past 6 months as well as when they were between the ages of 5 and 12 years old. In addition, participants completed an ADHD rating scale concerning their current functioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1087054711427299">Conners et al., 1999</xref>). For students with ADHD, a parent, or parents, was also contacted via telephone by the project coordinator and asked to complete the same diagnostic interview as well as provide current and retrospective symptom ratings of their child. Parent participation was optional and did not exclude students from participation.</p>
<p>In addition, students with ADHD underwent a toxicology (urinalysis) screen, and women underwent a pregnancy screen and were excluded if positive for either. If all inclusion and exclusion criteria were met, then students were determined to be eligible to participate. In all, 55 students with ADHD were initially referred and screened for participation eligibility, resulting in the eventual enrollment of 24 participants. A total of 31 students were excluded for not meeting participation eligibility criteria (<italic>n</italic> = 13), declining participation (<italic>n</italic> = 14), or for various other reasons (e.g., parents requested they not participate; <italic>n</italic> = 4). In addition, 2 students (one from each university) dropped out of the study after the first active medication phase due to adverse side effects. (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1087054711427299">Figure 1</xref> for complete information regarding participant attrition through the course of the study.) One of the two participants who discontinued the trial experienced heart palpitations after ingesting LDX 30 mg; the other participant also dropped out after ingesting LDX 30 mg and experiencing a variety of adverse side effects (e.g., irritable mood, increased anxiety, and social withdrawal). A total of 41 students were screened for participation as controls, with 15 of these students not meeting participation eligibility criteria.</p>

</fig>
<p>LDX (Vyvanse®, Shire US Inc.) effects were examined in the context of a double-blind, placebo-controlled design that included five phases: no-drug baseline, placebo, and three dosages (30, 50, and 70 mg per day) of active medication. Phase orders (following baseline) were assigned in a counterbalanced fashion across participants. To avoid starting any participant with the highest dosage, the 50-mg condition always preceded the 70-mg condition. Thus, there were six possible orders of dosage phases. Each phase was conducted for 1 week, and therefore, the total trial took place over 5 weeks and was able to be completed during a single semester. Participants ingested one pill per day on awakening. Control students only participated in the baseline phase and did not receive LDX.</p>
<p>Medication and placebo were packaged so that dosage was undetectable by sight or taste and used a numbered code that corresponded to the dosage. Participants received a 1-week supply of capsules at each visit (at the conclusion of each previous trial phase) and were instructed to return all unused capsules. Each supply included nine pills, and students were expected to return two at the end of each week. Participants returned the appropriate number of two pills for 87% of all dosage phases. Students were also asked to report whether they missed any dosage administration over the prior week (self-report of adherence). For 9% of the dosage phases, participants returned more than two pills due to reported adverse side effects, illness, or ending the trial a day early due to Thanksgiving break. Participants returned fewer than two pills for 4% of the dosage conditions and reported having lost pills or having to discard pills after difficulties swallowing. During their weekly visits with the health care provider for the study, students also reported any adverse side effects from the week’s dosage, and the health center physician measured their heart rate and blood pressure.</p>
<p>Participants, research assistants, and professors were blind to dosage condition. Only the principal investigators (PIs) and health center clinicians had access to the corresponding codes and dosages. Medical staff was instructed to keep this information confidential from participants unless there was a medical need that prohibited this from occurring (e.g., if the participant experienced a severe adverse reaction to the medication). Medications, information regarding dosage conditions, and all other research material were stored in a locked file cabinet in the offices of the co-PIs and medical staff. Following the completion of the study, the extra medications were destroyed in a manner consistent with Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) regulations and health center policies.</p>
<p>At the end of each 1-week phase, students met individually with a research assistant (who was blind to dosage condition) to complete dependent measures. Participants were instructed to ingest LDX or placebo 2 to 4 hr prior to the weekly session so that assessment data were collected during the active phase of LDX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1087054711427299">Wigal et al., 2010</xref>). During the session, the following measures were administered: Conners’ Adult ADHD Rating Scales (CAARS)–Short Form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1087054711427299">C. K. Conners et al., 1999</xref>), Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Functioning–Adult Version (BRIEF-A; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1087054711427299">Roth, Isquith, &amp; Gioia, 2005</xref>), Expression and Emotion Scale (EESC) adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1087054711427299">Perwien et al.

Research assistants instructed participants to respond to each measure based on the current week’s dosage, ignoring any directions that prompted them to report within different time frames.</p>
<p>The individual measures were presented to the students in a randomized order each week, with the exception of the CVLT-II and the CPT-II. As the CVLT-II requires a 15 to 20 min break that should include nonverbal tasks, these measures were consistently presented in the following order: CVLT-II immediate recall and short-delay recall, CPT-II, and CVLT-II long-delay recall. Therefore, when the measures were randomized, the CVLT-II and CPT-II were considered to be one unit. Research assistants conducted direct observations of student attention and behavior during CPT-II testing. To increase the likelihood that students would complete weekly assessments, participants were given US$50 following each 1-week assessment phase. Those students who completed the entire protocol received an additional US$100 (i.e., total compensation of US$350).</p>

<title>Dependent Measures</title>
<sec id="section7-1087054711427299">
<title>CAARS</title>
<p>The CAARS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1087054711427299">C. K. Conners et al., 1999</xref>) are comprised of three different versions, long, short, and screening, each of which can be completed by self- or observer report. For the purposes of this study, the screening form was used as part of participant inclusion criteria and the short version, self-report for 18- to 29-year-olds was used once each week to assess ADHD symptoms. Normative data from a nationally representative sample are available. Internal consistency coefficients for the short form, self report for 18- to 29-year-olds range from .77 to .86, indicating adequate reliability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1087054711427299">C. K. Conners et al., 1999</xref>). <italic>T</italic>-scores for all subscales on the short version were used as dependent measures with higher scores representing greater ADHD symptomatology.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1087054711427299">
<title>BRIEF-A</title>
<p>The BRIEF-A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1087054711427299">Roth et al., 2005</xref>) is a standardized self-report measure that captures adults’ views of their own self-regulation in their everyday environment. <italic>T</italic>-scores on the nine clinical (Inhibit, Shift, Emotional Control, Self-Monitor, Initiate, Working Memory, Plan/Organize, Task Monitor, and Organization of Materials) and two composite scales (Behavior Regulation Index and Metacognition Index) served as dependent variables in this study. Higher scores indicate greater difficulties with executive functioning. Normative data for a nationally representative sample are available. The BRIEF-A has demonstrated good internal consistency with alpha coefficients ranging from .73 to .90 for the subscales and between .93 and .96 for the composite scales. Test–retest reliability was also adequate, with a range from .82 to .93 over a 4-week period. In addition, convergent and discriminant validity studies have been conducted for BRIEF-A clinical scales and indexes with other measures of executive function, anxiety, and mood for a variety of clinical and healthy adult samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1087054711427299">Roth et al., 2005</xref>).</p>

<title>CVLT-II</title>
<p>The CVLT-II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1087054711427299">Delis et al., 2000</xref>) provides a short, individually administered assessment of strategies and processes involved in learning and remembering verbal information. The CVLT-II measures both recall and recognition of two lists of words over a number of immediate- and delayed-memory trials. Two unique forms of the CVLT-II were available for administration to participants to minimize practice effects. Students were randomly assigned to receive either the standard form or the alternate form during their first weekly session and completed alternating versions of the CVLT-II during subsequent sessions. The CVLT-II has been shown to have adequate internal consistency across age and gender, and factor analyses confirm subscale structure and content validity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1087054711427299">Delis et al., 2000</xref>). Normative data from a nationally representative sample are available, and <italic>T</italic>-scores for all subscales were used as dependent measures. Higher scores indicate better verbal learning and memory.</p>

<title>CPT-II</title>
<p>The CPT-II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1087054711427299">C. K. Conners, 2000</xref>) is a computer-based measure of sustained attention and behavioral inhibition. The test has been shown to be a useful attention and learning disorder measure as well as a particularly sensitive measure to drug treatment effects in children with ADHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1087054711427299">C. K. Conners, 2000</xref>). During the test administration, respondents are required to press the space bar on the keyboard or the left mouse button when any letter except “X” appears on the computer monitor. The interstimulus intervals (ISI) are 1, 2, and 4 s with a display time of 250 min. There are six blocks, with three subblocks, each containing 20 trials (i.e., letter presentations), with ISI varying between blocks. Split-half reliability between trials was shown to be adequate on indices used as dependent variables, including Hit Reaction Time (.95), Errors of Commission (.83), Errors of Omission (.94), Standard Error (.87), Variability (.66), <italic>d</italic> prime (i.e., detectability = .83), and Beta (i.e., response style = .73). Test–retest reliability was shown to be highly satisfactory for most measures. Perseverations were shown to be adequate (.43), Block Change (.08-.28) and ISI change (.05-.51) Response Time and Standard Error were shown to be unsatisfactory, and <italic>d</italic> prime (.76) and Beta (.62) were shown to be adequate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1087054711427299">C. K. Conners, 2000</xref>). Norms are available for a nationally representative sample, and <italic>T</italic>-scores for all subscores were used as dependent variables.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1087054711427299">
<title>Behavior observations during CPT-II</title>
<p>During each CPT-II administration, a research assistant observed the student for Off-Task Behavior (any continuous period of 3 s or longer where the student was not visually looking at the computer or monitor), Fidgeting (a repetitive, purposeless motion of the arms, hands, buttocks, or trunk that occurred at least four consecutive times), Task-Relevant Vocalizations, Task-Irrelevant Vocalizations, and Out-of-Seat Behavior (any time in which the student’s buttocks fully broke contact with the flat surface of their chair). A second research assistant observed 26% of participant sessions across dosage conditions for the purposes of assessing interobserver agreement, resulting in a mean overall agreement of 96.4% and a mean kappa of .48. Behavior observations were only conducted during CPT-II sessions for students with ADHD. Percentage intervals where each behavior category was observed were used as dependent measures.</p>

<title>SCL-90-R</title>
<p>The SCL-90-R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1087054711427299">Derogatis, 1986</xref>) is a 90-item self-report questionnaire assessing psychopathological symptoms, including Somatization, Obsessive-Compulsive, Interpersonal Sensitivity, Depression, Anxiety, Hostility, Phobic Anxiety, Paranoid Ideation, and Psychoticism. Symptom severity is rated on a 5-point Likert-type scale ranging from “not at all” to “extremely”, and outcomes are computed by summing the raw scores and converting them to <italic>T</italic>-scores (<italic>M</italic> = 50, <italic>SD</italic> = 10) with higher scores representing greater pathology. <italic>T</italic>-scores for all subscales as well as for three global indices (Global Severity Index [GSI], Positive Symptom Total [PST], and Positive Symptom Distress Index [PSDI]) served as dependent variables in this study. The SCL-90-R has been shown to have adequate internal consistency with a mean coefficient of .95 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1087054711427299">Edwards, Yarvis, Mueller, Zingale, &amp; Wagman, 1978</xref>), good test–retest reliability with coefficients ranging from .81 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1087054711427299">Edwards et al., 1978</xref>) to .84 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1087054711427299">Horowitz, Rosenberg, Baer, Ureno, &amp; Villasenor, 1988</xref>), and moderate- to high-convergent validity correlations with the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory ranging from .40 to .75 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1087054711427299">Derogatis, Rickels, &amp; Rock, 1976</xref>).

<title>SAS-SR</title>
<p>The SAS-SR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1087054711427299">Weissman, 1999</xref>) is a 54-item scale assessing behaviors in six aspects of life, including work role (i.e., student), social and leisure activities, relationships with extended family, role as spouse, role as parent, and role within family. Each of these scores served as dependent variables. Each item is rated on a 5-point scale with high scores indicating more impairment. Outcomes are calculated by adding up raw scores and converting them to <italic>T</italic>-scores that were used as dependent measures in this study. Higher scores represent greater social adjustment difficulties. The SAS-SR has adequate internal consistency, with a mean coefficient of .74, and test–retest reliability, with a mean coefficient of .78 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1087054711427299">Edwards et al., 1978</xref>).

<title>EESC–College Student Version (EESC-C)</title>
<p>The EESC-C is a self-report rating scale of positive and negative emotional expression adapted from the informant-report rating scale developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1087054711427299">Perwien et al. (2008)</xref> to assess parent perception of emotional expression in children with ADHD who were being treated with atomoxetine. The rating scale contains 29 items, and validation studies show that it is a reliable and valid tool with three factors: Positive Emotional Expression, Flat Emotional Expression, and Emotional Lability. The EESC has adequate internal consistency, with a mean coefficient of .91, and adequate test–retest reliability, with a mean coefficient ranging from .65 to .69 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1087054711427299">Kratochvil et al., 2007</xref>). The EESC-C updates the language of the 29 items to be appropriate for self-report with college-age individuals. Raw scores for the three factors mentioned previously served as dependent variables with higher scores representing greater difficulties with emotional expression. Normative data are not available for this measure.</p>

For each phase following baseline, participants reported information based on their weekly phase; thus, anchors 1, 4, and 5 were the only available rating options during placebo and dosage conditions. Raw scores for use of each substance as well as an overall substance use score were used as dependent variables. Normative data are not available for this measure.</p>

The rating scale requires individuals to rate the frequency of positive and negative behaviors related to study and organization skills as occurring never, sometimes, often, or very often. The total raw score was used to determine student level of study and organizational skills with higher scores representing better functioning. The study and organizational skills rating scale has adequate internal consistency (coefficient alpha = .90) and test–retest reliability (<italic>r</italic> = .91; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1087054711427299">Glutting et al., 2002</xref>).</p>

<title>Pulse and blood pressure</title>
<p>Health professionals recorded resting heart rate (i.e., pulse) in beats per minute and systolic/diastolic blood pressure for participants with ADHD once per week during placebo and LDX dosage conditions. Normal resting heart rate ranges from 60 to 100 beats per minute. Systolic less than 120 mmHg and diastolic less than 80 mmHg is considered normal blood pressure. Systolic readings of 140 mmHg and above or diastolic readings of 90 mmHg and above represent high blood pressure.</p>

<title>Statistical Analyses</title>
<p>It was hypothesized that LDX would lead to statistically significant improvements in symptomatic behavior and executive functioning for college students with ADHD relative to placebo conditions. A series of 2 (site) × 5 (dosage conditions) ANOVAs with repeated measures across dosage were used to assess medication effects on each dependent variable. Statistically significant (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) main effects for dosage were followed by Tukey’s honestly significant difference test (HSD) comparison tests to identify specific between-dosage differences. Trend analyses were used to determine the shape (e.g., linear or quadratic) of the dose-response curves for each measure. It was also hypothesized that LDX would lead to moderate to large effect sizes for symptom change and small to moderate effect sizes for academic functioning, psychological functioning, and social relationships. Thus, effect sizes (partial η<sup>2</sup>) were calculated to determine the amount of variance in each dependent measure that is accounted for by LDX treatment. Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1087054711427299">Cohen’s (1988)</xref> definitions, a partial η<sup>2</sup> value of .01 was considered a small effect, .06 a medium effect, and .14 a large effect. Next, an additional exploratory analysis of adverse side effects with LDX treatment was conducted. A one-way ANOVA was used to assess medication effects on total self-reported side effects as well as systolic and diastolic blood pressure and pulse. A follow-up comparison test using Tukey’s HSD was conducted to determine specific between-dosage differences. Finally, the degree to which dosage effects resulted in reliable change for individual participants was determined using methods described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1087054711427299">Jacobson and Truax (1991)</xref> for placebo and the three active LDX conditions using two primary measures: CAARS ADHD Index and BRIEF Metacognition Index. These two measures were selected because they represented general indicators of ADHD symptoms (CAARS) and planning/organizational skills critical for college success (BRIEF-A). The reliable change index (RCI) compares change in pre- and posttreatment scores to the standard error of the difference for the dependent measure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1087054711427299">Jacobson &amp; Truax, 1991</xref>). The latter represents the spread of the distribution of change scores that would be expected if no actual change has occurred. A RCI of 1.96 or larger indicates that a lack of actual change is unlikely (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05).</p>
<p>A series of independent sample <italic>t</italic> tests was used to compare ratings on the two primary outcome measures (CAARS ADHD Index and BRIEF-A Metacognition Index) for non-ADHD controls (<italic>n</italic> = 26) during no-medication baseline relative to participants with ADHD during placebo, 30-mg, 50-mg, and 70-mg LDX conditions.</p>
<p>Given that multiple outcome measures were investigated, the number of analyses conducted could have inflated experiment-wise Type I error rate. A multivariate approach was precluded due to the small sample size available for analysis. Given that this was an initial study of LDX effects with the college student population, we chose to protect against experiment-wise Type I error rate while also limiting Type II error by correcting alpha levels for each individual analysis to control for false discovery rate using procedures described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1087054711427299">Benjamini and Hochberg (1995)</xref>.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Means and standard deviations for all dependent measures across dosage conditions are provided in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1087054711427299">Table 2</xref>. For the 2 (site) × 5 (dosage) ANOVAs, very few main effects for site or Site × Dosage interactions were statistically significant. For the dosage main effects, using an alpha level of .05, statistically significant differences were observed on 46 of 92 dependent measures (50%). However, the site and interaction effects each achieved significant effects not much greater than chance (15% and 6%, respectively). For the .01 alpha level, only 3% and 1% of the site and interaction effects were significant, respectively (compared with 27% for the dosage main effect). Thus, results are reported for main effects of dosage. Furthermore, we adjusted <italic>p</italic> values to control for the false discovery rate using procedures described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1087054711427299">Benjamini and Hochberg (1995)</xref>. Thus, an alpha value of .021 was used wherein significant dosage effects were found for 39 of 92 dependent measures.</p>

<p>Tukey’s HSD post hoc comparison tests indicated that CAARS ratings for all three LDX dosages were significantly lower than baseline for Inattention/Memory Problems, Hyperactivity/Restlessness, and ADHD Index (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). Inattention/Memory Problems were significantly lower for 30 mg (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05), 50 mg, and 70 mg (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) relative to placebo. For Hyperactivity/Restlessness and ADHD Index, 70 mg was significantly lower than placebo (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). Placebo ratings were lower than baseline CAARS scores for Hyperactivity/Restlessness (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) and ADHD Index (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05).</p>
<p>CPT-II results revealed significant main effects for dosage for the following measures: Commission Errors, <italic>F</italic>(4, 80) = 4.84, <italic>p</italic> = .002, partial η<sup>2</sup> = .20; Hit Reaction Time-Standard Error, <italic>F</italic>(4, 80) = 3.07, <italic>p</italic> = .02, partial η<sup>2</sup> = .13; Variability of Standard Error, <italic>F</italic>(4, 80) = 3.56, <italic>p</italic> = .01, partial η<sup>2</sup> = .15; and Hit Reaction Time-Block Change, <italic>F</italic>(4, 80) = 3.08, <italic>p</italic> = .02, partial η<sup>2</sup> = .13. Significant linear trends (i.e., enhanced performance with increasing dosage) were found for all but one CPT-II score, Hit Reaction Time-Block Change, with the latter showing a significant quadratic trend (peak improvement at 30 mg with declining trend for subsequent dosages). A significant cubic effect was found for Variability of Standard Error with increasing variability from baseline to placebo, decreasing to 50 mg, and then a slight increase at 70 mg. Significant main effect for dosage was not found for remaining CPT-II scores, including Omissions, Hit Reaction Time, Response Style, Perseverations, Hit Reaction Time-ISI Change, and Hit Standard Error-ISI Change.</p>
<p>Tukey’s HSD results showed that Commission Errors were significantly higher in baseline relative to 50 and 70 mg (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). Hit Reaction Time-Block Change was significantly greater for 30 mg than for baseline (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). Hit Reaction Time-Standard Error and Variability of Standard Error were significantly greater for placebo than for 70 mg (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05), with placebo greater than 50 mg for the latter score (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05).</p>
<p>The only dosage main effect for direct observations of behavior during CPT-II was found for Percentage of Task-Related Vocalizations, <italic>F</italic>(4, 84) = 5.02, <italic>p</italic> = .001, partial η<sup>2</sup> = .19. A significant quadratic trend was found wherein Task-Related Vocalizations decreased from baseline to 30 mg with an increase over the two higher dosages. Tukey’s HSD tests indicated that baseline was associated with a significantly higher percentage of Task-Related Vocalizations than 30 mg (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) and 50 mg (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). No dosage main effects were seen for Fidgeting Percentage, Off-Task Percentage, Task-Irrelevant Vocalization Percentage, Out-of-Seat Percentage, or Total Percentage.</p>

<p>Significant main effects for dosage were obtained for most SCL-90-R scores, including Obsessive-Compulsive, <italic>F</italic>(4, 80) = 5.56, <italic>p</italic> = .001, partial η<sup>2</sup> = .22; Interpersonal Sensitivity, <italic>F</italic>(4, 80) = 4.24, <italic>p</italic> = .004, partial η<sup>2</sup> = .18; Depression, <italic>F</italic>(4, 80) = 6.61, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, partial η<sup>2</sup> = .25; Hostility, <italic>F</italic>(4, 80) = 3.0, <italic>p</italic> = .02, partial η<sup>2</sup> = .13; Paranoid Ideation, <italic>F</italic>(4, 80) = 3.46, <italic>p</italic> = .01, partial η<sup>2</sup> = .15; Psychoticism, <italic>F</italic>(4, 80) = 3.16, <italic>p</italic> = .02, partial η<sup>2</sup> = .14; GSI, <italic>F</italic>(4, 80) = 4.95, <italic>p</italic> = .001, partial η<sup>2</sup> = .20; and PST, <italic>F</italic>(4, 80) = 3.54, <italic>p</italic> = .01, partial η<sup>2</sup> = .15. Significant linear and cubic trends were found wherein there was a general decrease in SCL-90-R scores (indicative of improvement) with increasing dosage; however, the pattern was for a decrease from baseline to placebo, flat trend to 50 mg, and then another decrease with 70 mg. Significant dosage effects were not found for Somatization, Anxiety, Phobic Anxiety, or Positive Symptom Distress.</p>
<p>Post hoc comparison tests indicated that SCL-90-R scores were significantly higher (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) in baseline than 70 mg for Obsessive-Compulsive, Interpersonal Sensitivity, Depression, Hostility, Paranoid Ideation, GSI, and PST. Furthermore, baseline scores were greater than 70 mg for Psychoticism (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05), greater than 30 mg for Depression (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05), and greater than placebo for GSI (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). Finally, placebo Depression score was greater than 70 mg (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05), whereas 50 mg was greater than 70 mg for GSI (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05).</p>
<p>No significant main effects were obtained for any of the three EESC-C scores indicating no dosage impact on affect or emotional expression.</p>

<title>Effects on Social Functioning</title>
<p>No significant main effects for dosage were obtained for SAS-SR total score or for any subscale scores.</p>

<sec id="section25-1087054711427299">
<title>Alcohol/Substance Use</title>
<p>Significant main effects for dosage were obtained for self-reported use of hallucinogens, <italic>F</italic>(4, 80) = 9.50, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, partial η<sup>2</sup> = .32, and total use of substances, <italic>F</italic>(4, 84) = 10.32, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, partial η<sup>2</sup> = .33. These effects were subject to linear and cubic trends. There appeared to be an overall decrease in use of substances across dosage conditions with a drop from baseline to placebo, flat trend to 50 mg, and then another decrease with 70 mg. Post hoc comparisons indicated that hallucinogen use and overall substance use was significantly greater at baseline than during all remaining conditions, including placebo (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). No dosage effects were found for stimulants, depressants, or “other” substance use.</p>

<sec id="section26-1087054711427299">
<title>Possible Adverse Side Effects</title>
<p>There was no significant effect of dosage on self-report of total side effects, pulse rate, or systolic blood pressure. The most commonly reported adverse side effects were decreased appetite and trouble sleeping. Only 2 of the 24 participants (8.3%) dropped out due to side effects. A significant main effect for dosage was found for diastolic blood pressure, <italic>F</italic>(4, 80) = 2.65, <italic>p</italic> = .04, partial η<sup>2</sup> = .12. This effect was linear, with increasing diastolic blood pressure associated with increasing dosage. Tukey’s HSD comparison tests indicated that 30 mg was associated with elevated diastolic blood pressure relative to baseline (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). It should be noted that mean diastolic blood pressure readings were within normal limits (i.e., less than 80) across all phases (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1087054711427299">Table 2</xref>).</p>

<title>Individual Response to LDX Versus Placebo</title>
<p>To gauge the degree to which individual students with ADHD responded to each LDX dosage and placebo, a RCI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1087054711427299">Jacobson &amp; Truax, 1991</xref>) was calculated for two primary outcome measures: CAARS ADHD Index and BRIEF Metacognition Index. These two measures were selected because they represented general indicators of ADHD symptoms (CAARS) and planning/organizational skills critical for college success (BRIEF-A). The RCI indicates the degree to which treatment-induced changes are beyond chance levels (i.e., statistically reliable). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1087054711427299">Jacobson and Truax (1991)</xref> asserted that when RCI ≥ 1.96, it is unlikely that a posttest score does not reflect real change. RCIs were calculated for placebo, 30-mg LDX, 50-mg LDX, and 70-mg LDX using baseline scores as a comparison (i.e., RCI represents degree of change from baseline score).</p>
<p>Mean RCIs for CAARS ADHD Index ranged from 1.42 in placebo to 2.90 in the 70-mg condition (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1087054711427299">Table 3</xref> for RCI descriptive statistics). In similar fashion, the percentage of positive responders (i.e., participants with RCI ≥ 1.96) ranged from 39.1% in placebo to 63.6% in 30-mg and 70-mg conditions (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1087054711427299">Figure 4</xref>). Furthermore, 86.4% of participants exhibited a positive response to at least one LDX dosage condition.</p>

<title>Comparison With Non-ADHD Controls</title>
<p>A series of independent sample <italic>t</italic> tests was used to compare ratings on the two primary outcome measures (CAARS ADHD Index and BRIEF Metacognition Index) for non-ADHD controls (<italic>n</italic> = 26) during no-medication baseline relative to participants with ADHD during placebo, 30-mg, 50-mg, and 70-mg LDX conditions. Non-ADHD control ratings were also compared with ratings from participants with ADHD during the lowest effective dosage condition determined by individual response (i.e., lowest dosage associated with RCI ≥ 1.96). In all cases, non-ADHD control ratings were significantly lower for CAARS ADHD Index (<italic>M</italic> = 36.19; <italic>SD</italic> = 4.76; all <italic>p</italic>s &lt; .01) and BRIEF Metacognition Index (<italic>M</italic> = 44.31; <italic>SD</italic> = 7.62; all <italic>p</italic>s &lt; .05). In addition, effect sizes were calculated to estimate the magnitude of ADHD versus non-ADHD control during each medication phase using Glass’s procedure: ADHD rating—non-ADHD control rating divided by non-ADHD control standard deviation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1087054711427299">Kline, 2004</xref>). All effect sizes were in the large range; however, these were systematically smaller as LDX dosage increased (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1087054711427299">Figure 5</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>As hypothesized, all LDX dosages were associated with statistically significant and large reductions in ADHD symptoms relative to nonmedication baseline and placebo. LDX-associated reductions were particularly evident for inattention, variability of attention over time, and hyperactivity/restlessness. Effects were smaller and less consistent for problems with impulse control, presumably because CAARS and CPT-II scores in this dimension were well within the normal range at baseline. LDX dose-response effects on ADHD symptoms were primarily linear indicating symptom decrease associated with increase in dosage. These findings are consistent with prior studies of LDX with adult samples (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1087054711427299">Adler et al., 2008</xref>) and support the efficacy of this medication for symptom relief in college students with ADHD.</p>
<p>Equally strong and linear LDX effects were found for specific aspects of executive functioning related to task management, planning, organization, study skills, and working memory. These results are not surprising given the strong relationship between attention and executive function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1087054711427299">Scope, Empson, &amp; McHale, 2010</xref>). The large magnitude of these effects is particularly compelling given the critical importance of organization, planning, and study skills for academic success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1087054711427299">Hale et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1087054711427299">Peterson et al., 2003</xref>). In contrast, there were weaker and less consistent LDX effects on self-report of behavioral regulation and direct assessment of verbal learning/memory. As was the case for impulse control, behavioral regulation and verbal learning/memory scores at baseline were within normal limits, thereby minimizing the potential impact of pharmacotherapy.</p>
<p>Using the RCI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1087054711427299">Jacobson &amp; Truax, 1991</xref>) as a metric for clinically significant individual treatment response, more than 85% of the sample evidenced statistically significant ADHD symptom reduction in response to at least one of the three LDX dosages. There were fewer positive responders on the executive functioning measure; however, a substantial majority of participants met criteria for positive treatment response in this critical area. A substantial percentage (39.1%) of participants showed a positive placebo response for reduction of ADHD symptoms; however, very few positive placebo responders were found related to improvements in executive functioning (13%). When considering individual responses based on ADHD symptoms, the obtained response rates for placebo and individual dosages are similar to those found previously for adolescents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1087054711427299">Findling et al., 2011</xref>) and adults with ADHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1087054711427299">Adler et al., 2008</xref>), and the overall rate of response to any LDX dosage is very similar to that found for children with ADHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1087054711427299">Findling, Ginsberg, Jain, &amp; Gao, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite the large and clinically significant LDX effects on ADHD symptoms and executive functioning, participants with ADHD still showed large deficits when compared with a sample of typical, nondisordered college students. Effect size differences between groups decreased with increasing dosage but even at the 70-mg dosage condition, this difference was in what is typically considered the large range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1087054711427299">Cohen, 1988</xref>). Thus, although mean standard scores for ADHD symptoms and executive functioning were in the normal range relative to the standardization sample for each measure, college students with ADHD remained at significant disadvantage relative to their peers. Given the relative brevity of this trial, it may be unrealistic to expect college students with ADHD to improve to the point of “normalization.” This finding, however, highlights the need to develop effective psychosocial treatment for the college ADHD population as an adjunct to pharmacotherapy.</p>
<sec id="section30-1087054711427299">
<title>LDX Effects on Psychological and Social Functioning</title>
<p>Although self-report of psychopathological disorder symptoms was reduced by LDX relative to nonmedication baseline, the apparent impact of medication in this area of functioning was relatively small. In fact, only one significant LDX versus placebo difference was obtained, with 70 mg resulting in lower depression scores relative to placebo. Commensurate functioning in this area is a notable finding, however, as it indicates that LDX did not increase symptoms of psychopathological disorders, including anxiety and depression. In similar fashion, LDX did not increase flat affect or emotional lability nor did it diminish positive affect. Furthermore, there were no significant effects of LDX on social functioning. Thus, although LDX was not associated with improved social functioning, it is noteworthy that this medication did not appear to negatively impact social functioning.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section31-1087054711427299">
<title>Adverse Side Effects</title>
<p>There was very little evidence of significant adverse side effects for LDX in this trial. Only two participants (8.3%) dropped out of the trial; this is a substantially lower drop-out rate relative to prior LDX investigations with adults (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1087054711427299">Adler et al., 2008</xref>). Admittedly, the current study was briefer in duration than prior investigations; however, stimulant side effects are most likely to appear early rather than late in treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1087054711427299">D. F. Connor, 2006</xref>). Furthermore, LDX was not associated with an increase in self-reported alcohol or substance use. In fact, participants reported diminished overall use of substances, especially hallucinogens, relative to baseline. Similarly, there was no significant change in self-report of possible adverse side effects, although the percentage of these appears to increase from placebo to 50 mg if the data are viewed descriptively. Consistent with the stimulant medication literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1087054711427299">D. F. Connor, 2006</xref>), insomnia and reduction of appetite were the most common adverse events, and these were uniformly reported to be mild in severity. Finally, there were no significant changes in systolic blood pressure or pulse rate associated with LDX; however, there was a mild increase in mean diastolic blood pressure. This increase was not clinically significant and was only statistically significant for 30 mg relative to baseline.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section32-1087054711427299">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>Conclusions based on this investigation are limited by several factors. First, this study included a small sample relative to prior trials of LDX in the adult ADHD population. Additional investigations with larger samples are necessary to support the efficacy of LDX for treatment of ADHD in college students. A second limitation of the present study is that individuals with cardiovascular conditions and some psychiatric comorbidities (e.g., bipolar disorder) were excluded due to safety concerns thereby limiting the generalizability of these findings to the ADHD college student population as a whole. Third, the relatively short duration of the trial (i.e., only 1 week per dosage condition) limited the opportunity to assess possible longer term impact of LDX, particularly for psychological and social functioning. In addition, direct measures of academic/educational functioning were not included. We attempted to obtain professor and self-report ratings of academic performance; however, complete data on these measures were available for very few participants, and the duration of the study was too brief to adequately assess overall academic functioning.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section33-1087054711427299">
<title>Clinical Implications and Conclusions</title>
<p>Although untreated college students with ADHD may be only mildly impaired relative to the typical young adult population, they are at a significant disadvantage in multiple areas of functioning relative to their classmates. LDX is associated with statistically and clinically significant improvement in the two areas that college students with ADHD are most deficient relative to their nondisordered peers: ADHD symptoms and executive functioning. Therefore, LDX should be considered a primary treatment for ADHD in the college population, and response to treatment should be assessed not only in terms of ADHD symptom reduction but also with respect to executive functions most critical for educational success (i.e., planning, organization, and task management). Less-pronounced LDX effects were found for psychological and social functioning; however, there was no evidence that LDX worsens performance in these areas nor were significant adverse side effects experienced by most participants. It is unclear at this point whether the continued relative deficit in executive functioning despite salutary effects of LDX is associated with continued educational/academic deficits. There is a critical need, therefore, to examine the impact of LDX and similar medications on the academic functioning of college students with ADHD as well as the development and evaluation of psychosocial/educational interventions to supplement pharmacotherapy.</p>
