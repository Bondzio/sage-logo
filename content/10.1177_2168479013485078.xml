A total of 339 pregnant women were included in the study, 63 (18.3%) and 23 (6.8%) of whom used at least 1 supplement during pregnancy and 2 to 4 weeks prior to pregnancy, respectively. Only 3 women were prescribed folic acid during pregnancy. The pregnant women were interviewed to collect supplements use and pregnancy-related information through a pretested semistructured questionnaire.

Supplement use was about 8 times higher among women with &gt; 3 children (adjusted odds ratio, 7.85; 95% confidence interval, 1.69-36.28; <italic>P</italic> = .008) than among nulliparous women, and about 6 times higher among women in their second trimester (adjusted odds ratio, 6.26; 95% confidence interval, 1.91-20.55; <italic>P</italic> = .03) of pregnancy compared to those women in their first trimester.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Overall supplement use, particularly folic acid intake, was found to be negligible during the prenatal as well as antenatal periods. The majority of the women in the study lacked awareness about the benefits of supplementation and potential risks associated with the absence of folic acid during pregnancy. Information by the media and health care personnel given to childbearing women about the need to take folic acid to prevent neural tube defects seems to improve the intake of folic acid during the protective period.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>folic acid</kwd><kwd>pregnancy</kwd><kwd>supplements</kwd><kwd>neural tube defect</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="section1-2168479013485078"><title>Introduction</title><p>Pregnancy is a period in which many maternal transformations such as intense functional and metabolic modifications can occur.

To achieve this goal, most countries have had campaigns to increase knowledge and use of folic acid supplements periconceptionally among women planning pregnancy. These campaigns have been evaluated and all showed an increase in folic acid use up to a limited level and the maximal increase of folic acid use was seen in the UK campaigns, where the proportion of women who took folic acid when planning pregnancy increased from 24% to 38%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-2168479013485078">23</xref></sup> On the other hand, in addition to the supplement strategy, some countries like the US have implemented compulsory folate fortification of selected food items to ensure a proper folate status.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-2168479013485078">24</xref></sup></p><p>However, despite these recommendations, national campaigns, and scientific evidence, periconceptional use of additional folic acid is reported to be suboptimal in many countries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-2168479013485078">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-2168479013485078"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-2168479013485078">27</xref></sup></p><p>Moreover, a periconceptional as well as antenatal supplement use pattern has been studied in many developed and developing countries. However, to the best of our knowledge, no studies done in southwest Ethiopia to assess supplement use patterns during pregnancy have been published so far.

The hospital has a bed capacity of 450, and it provides services for approximately 9000 inpatient and 80,000 outpatient attendances a year from the catchment population of about 15 million. It has 5 departments that offer clinical residency (internal medicine, surgery, pediatrics, obstetrics, and ophthalmology) and other departments, such as psychiatry and dermatology, without residency programs. The antenatal clinic (ANC) provides service to about 2595 clients annually.</p><p>The study population consisted of pregnant women attending the ANC, psychiatry clinic, ambulatory clinics, and female medical wards during the study period. Inclusion criteria were women who came for ANC for the first time and those who were already enrolled in a routine ANC program; who were age 15 years and older; who were treated for comorbidities at psychiatry and ambulatory clinics and female medical wards; and who gave their consent to participate in the study. The sample size for this study was estimated based on a previous study done in a similar setting with a prevalence of medication use during pregnancy to be 71.3%. As a result, the sample size required for this study with 5% nonresponse rate was calculated to be 339. Although all women who were on ANC follow-up at the time of the study were known, the exact number of pregnant women being treated at other selected sites was unknown. For this reason, all pregnant women who came to each selected study site during the study period fulfilling the inclusion criteria were included until the sample size of 339 was reached.</p></sec><sec id="section4-2168479013485078"><title>Data Collection</title><p>A semistructured questionnaire was designed based on previously done studies and contextualized to fit for the setting. It included basic demographic details, types and number of supplements written on each order sheet, relevant medical history, comorbidities and common ailments, educational status, preconception and current substance use status, and other factors associated with supplement use during pregnancy. A face-to-face interview was conducted along with simultaneous review of medical charts. All the information about supplement use was collected from pregnant women via interview and additional information was extracted from women’s medical charts. The questionnaire was pretested to assess its clarity and sensitivity, as well as clients' reactions, time to completion, and materials needed to complete the form. Content and face validity of the questionnaire were checked by 2 clinical pharmacists and 1 gynecology resident using a structured response sheet covering item relevance, clarity, and format. The questionnaire was pretested on 5% of the pregnant women to check its soundness and to make necessary corrections prior to starting the study. Pregnant women included in the pretest procedure were excluded from participating in the study to avoid information contamination.</p></sec><sec id="section5-2168479013485078"><title>Statistical Analyses</title><p>The collected data were clearly categorized, entered into software, edited, cleaned, and analyzed using SPSS for Windows (v 16; SPSS Inc, Chicago, Illinois). Descriptive statistics were performed to obtain summary values of the study variables, binary logistic regression analysis was performed to observe the strength of association between each dependent and independent variable, and multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted to determine the independent predictors of supplement use. The 95% confidence interval (CI) was estimated and variables whose levels were statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05) on bivariate analysis were selected and entered jointly into a multivariate logistic regression model to identify the independent predictors of supplement use. Statistical significance was determined by backward Wald test. Variables with a <italic>P</italic> value of &lt; .05 were considered significant for the final model as an independent predictor.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section6-2168479013485078"><title>Results</title><sec id="section7-2168479013485078"><title>Sociodemographic Results</title><p>A total of 339 pregnant women were included in the study and all of them consented and completed the interview.

Out of a total of 63 women who took supplements during pregnancy, only 3 women took folic acid. The prevalence of overall supplement use as well as folic acid use in the present study is by far lower than reports from both developing and developed countries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2168479013485078">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-2168479013485078">34</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-2168479013485078"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-2168479013485078">36</xref></sup></p><p>The low prevalence of folic acid supplement use during pregnancy in this study might be due to several reasons. One reason is pregnant women’s awareness of the benefit of supplements; 76.4% of the pregnant women claimed no awareness about supplement benefits. In the present study, it was also observed that 89 (83.2%) of the illiterate women and 28 (66.7%) women with a tertiary education level did not have awareness about early folic acid supplementation benefits. The present study also found that 165 (79.7%) housewives, 130 (76.5%) nulliparous women, and 65 (76.5%) women with abortion history claimed no awareness about the benefits of supplementation. Comparable to our study, a study done by Nawapun and Phupong<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2168479013485078">1</xref></sup> in Thailand showed that only 16% of the pregnant women included in their study were aware of the need for supplement use during the preconception period. Other reasons might be late enrollment to ANC and a high prevalence of unplanned pregnancy. For instance, the high (57.5%) rate of unplanned pregnancies in the present study might have contributed to the late prescribing of folic acid. With this low prevalence of supplementation use and inadequate awareness level, it is disturbing that all the study units did not have a protocol or guideline for supplements. In this study, it was found that certain sociodemographic and pregnancy-related factors were significantly associated and seemed to affect women’s supplement utilization. From multiple logistic regression, it was observed that women who had &gt; 3 children were about 8 times more likely to use supplements during pregnancy compared to nulliparous women. On the other hand, women with comorbid conditions were 0.39 times less likely to use supplements compared to those women without comorbid conditions, and women with a history of abortion were 0.34 times less likely to use supplements compared to those women without such history. Similarly, women with an income level of &gt; 1500 ETB per month were 0.25 times less likely to use supplements compared to women with an income level of &lt; 1000 ETB per month. No study was found with which to compare these results, but a study done in Brazil<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-2168479013485078">37</xref></sup> showed that being single was found to be among the independent predictors for not taking supplementation. Similarly, a study in Palestine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-2168479013485078">38</xref></sup> showed that low income level was found to be associated with poor supplement use.</p><p>There are difficulties in achieving correct and effective supplementation, particularly of folic acid. One way to help solve this problem would be fortification of certain foods, which would facilitate access to them for all women who are pregnant and of reproductive age. However, the effects of increased doses of folic acid and some minerals like calcium on the remainder of the population are still unknown and would need to be studied. Thus, the best strategy would be to adopt educational intervention programs. Creation and dissemination of guidelines on this matter among health professionals and the public at large are vitally important. These are simple ways of improving the health of pregnant women and the prospects for good health for the present and future generations.</p><sec id="section11-2168479013485078"><title>Limitations and Strengths</title><p>This study has limitations. Being a cross-sectional study is one possible limitation. Thus, it could not show the cause–effect relationship between the outcome variable (supplement use) and independent variables (sociodemographic and pregnancy-related factors). Moreover, poor record keeping of pregnant women’s follow-up charts might also contribute to underreporting of supplements. Maternal self-reported data cannot exclude the possibility of recall bias, which might have affected our results. However, we think that women tend to remember their gestational period because it is one of the most precious and important events in their lives in addition to being brief, which makes it easier to remember. Moreover, we have used a 2- to 4-week period to collect information in order to minimize recall bias.</p><p>Despite these limitations, it is an explanatory study in an area where scarce information exists. Therefore, it adds to facts already known on the topic by providing the magnitude of the problem and the supplement utilization pattern information during pregnancy at Jimma University Specialized Hospital.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section12-2168479013485078"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The overall use of supplements, particularly folic acid, was found to be below the optimum during the perinatal as well as antenatal periods. Prescribers should be informed about the need to use the best evidence on prescribing supplements, which is usually presented in the form of guidelines. A majority of the pregnant women in this study lacked awareness about the benefits of supplementation as well as potential adverse pregnancy outcomes due to inadequate or lack of supplement use. The results of this study suggest that one possible intervention for better supplement and folic acid utilization is through increasing women’s and prescribers’ awareness level.</p><sec id="section13-2168479013485078"><title>Key Points</title><p>Studying the types and extent of supplements used during pregnancy would provide better knowledge as to the current practice and help in rationalizing supplement use.<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Only 3 women were prescribed folic acid during pregnancy.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Predictors of supplement use were comorbidities, pregnancy stages, monthly income level, and parity.</p></list-item></list></p><p>A majority of the women lacked awareness about the benefits of supplementation as well as potential adverse pregnancy outcomes associated with inadequate or an absence of supplement use.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors are grateful to all the pregnant mothers who participated, as well as the nurses and others who cooperated with this study.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="conflict" id="fn1-2168479013485078"><label>Declaration of Conflicting Interests</label><p>The author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.</p></fn><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure" id="fn2-2168479013485078"><label>Funding</label><p>The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: Jimma University provided financial sponsorship for this research project.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bibr1-2168479013485078"><label>1</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Nawapun</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><name><surname>Phupong</surname><given-names>V</given-names></name></person-group>. <article-title>Awareness of the benefits of folic acid and prevalence of the use of folic acid supplements to prevent neural tube defects among Thai women</article-title>. <source>Arch Gynecol Obstet</source>. <year>2007</year>;<volume>276</volume>(<issue>1</issue>):<fpage>53</fpage>–<lpage>57</lpage>.</citation></ref><ref id="bibr2-2168479013485078"><label>2</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Lumley</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Watson</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><name><surname>Watson</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Bower</surname><given-names>C.</given-names></name></person-group> <article-title>Periconceptional supplementation with folate and/or multivitamins for preventing neural tube defects</article-title>. <source>Cochrane Database Syst Rev</source>. <year>2001</year>;(<issue>3</issue>):<fpage>CD001056</fpage>.</citation></ref><ref id="bibr3-2168479013485078"><label>3</label><citation citation-type="journal"><collab collab-type="author">ACOG Committee on Practice Bulletins</collab>. <article-title>ACOG practice bulletin.
