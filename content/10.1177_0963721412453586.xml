<abstract>
<p>Attention is often imperfect; cognitive control is needed to counteract the tendency to attend to distractors that are incompatible with current goals. Cognitive psychologists have long explored cognitive control by examining Stroop interference—the slowed naming of colors on incongruent trials (e.g., “RED” displayed in blue ink), as compared to congruent trials (e.g., “RED” displayed in red ink), in the color-word Stroop task. The magnitude of interference reflects the effectiveness of cognitive control, but it does not reveal the precise processes used to minimize attention to the distracting word. The need for experimental approaches that accomplish this objective is underscored by the existence of qualitatively different cognitive control processes. Prior accounts stressed the use of top-down filtering processes at a task- or list-wide level to avoid word reading, but recent findings have shown that control of word reading is sometimes stimulus-driven—that is, triggered by the processing of stimuli or stimulus features. In this article, I highlight the critical findings that dissociate top-down and stimulus-driven control in the Stroop task, dissociations that are central to the view that cognitive control operates at multiple levels.</p>

<body>
<p>The terms “stimulus-driven” and “environmentally triggered” have long been used to describe behavior (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0963721412453586">Pavlov, 1927</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0963721412453586">Watson, 1913</xref>). Perhaps surprisingly, these terms are now used to describe cognitive control, the biasing of attention away from distractors in favor of goal-relevant information. Cognitive control was classically thought of as a slow and strategic process (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0963721412453586">Posner &amp; Snyder, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0963721412453586">Shiffrin &amp; Schneider, 1977</xref>) that is initiated in a top-down (i.e., internal, goal-driven) fashion. However, recent evidence has pointed to qualitatively different cognitive-control processes that are quickly and flexibly triggered by the presence of particular stimuli (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0963721412453586">Bugg, Jacoby, &amp; Chanani, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0963721412453586">Jacoby, Lindsay, &amp; Hessels, 2003</xref>) or stimulus features (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0963721412453586">Bugg, Jacoby, &amp; Toth, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0963721412453586">Crump, Gong, &amp; Milliken, 2006</xref>). The purpose of this article is to introduce readers to emerging empirical evidence within the Stroop literature that supports a broader conceptualization of cognitive control, one that views control as operating at multiple, dissociable levels, from the level of individual items (i.e., stimulus-driven control) to more global levels, such as the level of a list (i.e., top-down control).</p>
<sec id="section1-0963721412453586">
<title>Cognitive Control Inside and Outside of the Laboratory</title>
<p>In the laboratory, researchers frequently use the Stroop color-naming task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0963721412453586">Stroop, 1935</xref>) to assess cognitive control. Of primary interest is interference, the slowing of responses that is found on incongruent trials (e.g., “RED ” displayed in blue ink) as compared to congruent trials (e.g., “RED” displayed in red ink; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0963721412453586">MacLeod, 1991</xref>). The magnitude of interference reflects the effectiveness of cognitive control, but it does not reveal the precise processes used to minimize attention to the distracting word. A reduction in interference could result from the use of a top-down process, such as filtering, whereby one controls the influence of the word by attempting to ignore it throughout a task or series (i.e., list) of trials. Such an approach may be optimal when one knows that most stimuli will be interfering (i.e., incongruent). Indeed, in many everyday situations, humans bank on advance information that allows them to adjust attention before an interfering stimulus is even encountered, thereby minimizing its influence. For example, students are frequently faced with the challenge of attending to a lecture in the face of distractions (e.g., a Facebook page on a neighboring student’s laptop). After several days of lecture, one can anticipate the occurrence of such distractions and apply a top-down filter to ignore them.</p>
<p>Interference is not always predictable, however, including in the Stroop task, in which different trials often require differing degrees of control (e.g., 50% of items may be congruent). Recent accounts posit a cognitive-control process that operates in such situations (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0963721412453586">Braver, Gray, &amp; Burgess, 2007</xref>). Specifically, stimulus-driven control of the distracting word occurs quickly and flexibly after the onset of the stimulus. In real-world contexts, such as a classroom, one also finds distractors (e.g., conversations of neighbors) that emerge unpredictably and are differentially interfering. Some types of conversations might usually be distracting, whereas others might usually be facilitative (e.g., they relate to the lecture). Stimulus-driven accounts stress the exploitation of this <italic>item-specific</italic> information. For instance, if Barbara’s conversations tend to be distracting, then when one hears Barbara’s voice, it can serve as a trigger to boost control by quickly attempting to shift attention away from her conversation. By contrast, if Lucy’s conversations tend to be facilitative, Lucy’s voice may serve as a signal to permit greater attention to her conversation. The key is that a top-down filter that is indiscriminately (globally) applied to all distractions (e.g., conversations) is not being used; rather, a more flexible, stimulus-driven control process is active.</p>

<title>Top-Down Control of Interference</title>
<p>Cognitive control sometimes involves use of advance information to bias (i.e., guide) attention away from distractors (e.g., a filtering strategy). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0963721412453586">Logan and Zbrodoff (1979)</xref> implemented a straightforward list-wide proportion congruence manipulation for measuring the influence of cognitive-control strategies on Stroop interference. The logic behind this manipulation is that disproportionately presenting congruent trials (i.e., using a mostly congruent stimulus list; left column in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0963721412453586">Fig. 1</xref>) encourages fuller processing of the words, which facilitates performance on most trials. Disproportionately presenting incongruent trials (i.e., using a mostly incongruent stimulus list; right column in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0963721412453586">Fig. 1</xref>) biases attention away from the words because they produce conflict on most trials (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0963721412453586">Melara &amp; Algom, 2003</xref>). Stroop interference is significantly reduced with the mostly incongruent stimulus list as compared to the mostly congruent list (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0963721412453586">Fig. 2</xref>; e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0963721412453586">Bugg &amp; Chanani, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0963721412453586">Bugg, McDaniel, Scullin, &amp; Braver, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0963721412453586">Kane &amp; Engle, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0963721412453586">Lindsay &amp; Jacoby, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0963721412453586">Logan &amp; Zbrodoff, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0963721412453586">Logan, Zbrodoff, &amp; Williamson, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0963721412453586">Lowe &amp; Mitterer, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0963721412453586">West &amp; Baylis, 1998</xref>). This list-wide proportion congruence effect has become a widely used measure of “list-level” control, the engagement of a global, top-down process for minimizing interference.</p>

<title>Stimulus-Driven Control</title>
<p>Jacoby and his colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0963721412453586">Jacoby et al., 2003</xref>) developed a variant of the list-wide proportion congruence manipulation that seemed to capture stimulus-driven control, particularly the fast and flexible control of attention on an item-by-item basis. A unique feature of their item-specific manipulation of proportion congruence was that words, rather than lists, were designated as mostly congruent or mostly incongruent. For example, the words “GREEN” and “WHITE” were mostly congruent items, whereas the words “YELLOW” and “BLUE” were mostly incongruent items. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0963721412453586">Figure 3</xref>, these words were intermixed and randomly presented to participants. Thus, participants could not reliably predict whether the likelihood of interference on any given trial was high or low. Still, the researchers found significantly less interference for mostly incongruent items than for mostly congruent items, a pattern termed the <italic>item-specific proportion congruence</italic> (ISPC) effect (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0963721412453586">Fig. 4</xref>).</p>

<p>The fact that different levels of interference were found for different items within the same 50%-congruent list (i.e., the ISPC effect) could not be accounted for by a global (i.e., uniform), list-level control process. It appeared instead that attention to the words was controlled on an item-by-item basis. Moreover, because the identity of each word (and whether it was mostly congruent or mostly incongruent) could not be determined until the item was presented, modulation of attention had to occur after the onset of the stimulus.</p>
<p>Much of the excitement surrounding the discovery of “item-level” control centered on how rapidly and flexibly it operates, in sharp contrast to list-level control. According to an alternative account, however, the excitement was premature. This account attributed the ISPC effect to the use of a mechanism that might be thought of as the antithesis of cognitive control—simple associative learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0963721412453586">Schmidt &amp; Besner, 2008</xref>). By this <italic>contingency account</italic>, participants learn to predict the responses that are frequently paired with particular words (e.g., a response of “green” when the mostly congruent item “GREEN” is presented, and a response of “yellow” when the mostly incongruent item “BLUE” is presented; cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0963721412453586">Melara &amp; Algom, 2003</xref>), which speeds responses on two of the four types of trials (congruent trials for mostly congruent items and incongruent trials for mostly incongruent items; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0963721412453586">Fig. 4</xref>), producing the ISPC pattern. It is difficult to disentangle this account from an account of item-level <italic>control</italic>, which posits that participants use the distracting word as a signal of the likelihood of interference for that item and modulate control accordingly (e.g., the word “GREEN” signals participants to process the word more fully, and the word “BLUE” signals participants to quickly curtail word processing). (Indeed, Jacoby and his research group acknowledged that both mechanisms might be contributing; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0963721412453586">Jacoby et al., 2003</xref>.)</p>
<p>Using a simple twist on the standard ISPC manipulation, I and my colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0963721412453586">Bugg, Jacoby, &amp; Chanani, 2011</xref>, Experiment 2) disentangled the two mechanisms. Instead of assigning items to mostly congruent or mostly incongruent sets on the basis of the words in a color-word Stroop task, we used a picture-word Stroop task and assigned items to sets on the basis of the relevant dimension, the to-be-named pictures. For example, pictures of birds and cats were mostly congruent, and pictures of dogs and fish were mostly incongruent (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0963721412453586">Fig. 5</xref>). Critically, this meant that the dimension that signaled the proportion congruency of each item (i.e., the picture) differentially predicted the likelihood of interference but perfectly predicted the correct response for all items. Therefore, the obtainment of an ISPC effect with this design could not be due to participants learning to predict the responses that were associated with each picture. The contingency account would predict equivalent interference across the mostly congruent and mostly incongruent items.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0963721412453586-fig5.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>To understand why this is the case, consider the upper row of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0963721412453586">Table 1</xref>. The relevant dimension dictates which items are mostly congruent and which are mostly incongruent, and that dimension is 100% predictive of the response in <italic>all</italic> four trial types (congruent trials for mostly congruent items, incongruent trials for mostly congruent items, congruent trials for mostly incongruent items, and incongruent trials for mostly incongruent items). Thus, when one compares performance between the mostly congruent and mostly incongruent items, this comparison is <italic>not</italic> confounded by variations in contingency. This contrasts starkly with the lower row of the table, which illustrates the typical design in which words dictate whether items are mostly congruent or mostly incongruent, and the word is highly predictive of the response in only two of the four trial types. In this case, any comparison of performance between the mostly congruent and mostly incongruent items is confounded by variations in contingency.</p>

<p>Contrary to the predictions of the contingency account, our results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0963721412453586">Bugg, Jacoby, &amp; Chanani, 2011</xref>; Experiment 2) demonstrated a significant ISPC effect. Interference was greater for mostly congruent items than for mostly incongruent items, a result consistent with the idea that item-level control attenuated word reading for the mostly incongruent items.</p>
<p>Further corroborating the role of item-level control in the obtainment of this ISPC effect was the following evidence. First, this effect had a different form than the effect discovered by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0963721412453586">Jacoby et al. (2003)</xref> (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0963721412453586">Fig. 4</xref>), to which associative learning may have contributed. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0963721412453586">Figure 6</xref>, the effect was driven almost entirely by a difference in response times for mostly congruent items and for mostly incongruent items on incongruent trials. This is the (interaction-based) pattern that has been suggested to reflect the modulation of word reading via item-level control, “because incongruent trials should be more affected by attention, given that the majority of the Stroop effect is interference” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0963721412453586">Schmidt &amp; Besner, 2008</xref>, p. 516). Second, we (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0963721412453586">Bugg, Jacoby, &amp; Chanani, 2011</xref>, Experiment 2) showed novel evidence for the transfer of control. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0963721412453586">Figure 7</xref>, the ISPC effect was obtained for a set of 50%-congruent transfer items that were introduced in a final block of trials, indicating that participants generalized the control settings they had learned for mostly congruent items (e.g., cats) and mostly incongruent items (e.g., dogs) to new instances of these items. Because these new instances were presented equally frequently (as congruent and incongruent trials), this finding was important in ruling out alternative, frequency-based accounts (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0963721412453586">Logan, 1988</xref>).</p>

<title>Could List-Level Control Be Item-Level Control in Disguise?</title>
<p>One of the major theoretical implications of the discovery of stimulus-driven control is that it calls for a reexamination of effects that have previously been attributed to top-down control. Indeed, a fresh look at the list-wide proportion congruence manipulation reveals that it is perfectly confounded with ISPC (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0963721412453586">Fig. 1</xref>). Might the list-wide proportion congruence effect be accounted for by item-level control?</p>
<p>Results from an initial study suggested it could be (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0963721412453586">Bugg et al., 2008</xref>). The critical evidence stemmed from performance on a set of 50%-congruent items that were embedded within the mostly congruent and mostly incongruent lists, lists whose proportion congruency was determined by a separate set of items that were 75% or 25% congruent, respectively (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0963721412453586">Fig. 8</xref>). Unlike the mostly congruent and mostly incongruent items, the 50%-congruent items had no item-specific proportion congruence bias (they were equally likely to be congruent or incongruent in both lists). They did, however, reside within mostly congruent or mostly incongruent lists, and therefore had different list-level biases. Obtainment of a list-wide proportion congruence effect for the mostly congruent and mostly incongruent items would be ambiguous—it could reflect list-level or item-level mechanisms. By contrast, obtainment of the effect for the 50%-congruent items would be indicative of list-level control, independent of item-specific influences.</p>

<p>The list-wide proportion congruence effect was found <italic>only</italic> for the mostly congruent and mostly incongruent items (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0963721412453586">Blais &amp; Bunge, 2010</xref>), indicating that participants did not implement global list-level control. This was a surprising finding, as it suggested that the classic list-wide proportion congruence effect might be an ISPC effect in disguise, which challenges extant models (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0963721412453586">Botvinick, Braver, Barch, Carter, &amp; Cohen, 2001</xref>). In other words, there may be no such thing as list-level control of Stroop interference; item-level control may be sufficient to explain the putative contribution of list-level control (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0963721412453586">Blais, Robidoux, Risko, &amp; Besner, 2007</xref>, for a computational model that adopts this assumption).</p>
<p>Given these stunning implications, replication was warranted. I and Chanani (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0963721412453586">Bugg &amp; Chanani, 2011</xref>) speculated that participants in the prior study may not have engaged list-level control because interference could be minimized on most trials (75%) simply by exploiting associations within the list. The set of items that I and other colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0963721412453586">Bugg et al., 2008</xref>) had used to create the list-wide bias (25% congruent vs. 75% congruent) was composed of only two items (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0963721412453586">Fig. 8</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0963721412453586">Blais &amp; Bunge, 2010</xref>), meaning that participants could learn to predict the responses typically associated with these items, possibly bypassing control. Using a picture-word Stroop task, Chanani and I increased the set size to four so the responses on the incongruent trials could not be predicted. A significant list-wide proportion congruence effect was then observed for the mostly congruent and incongruent items <italic>and</italic> for the 50%-congruent items, with the last providing unambiguous evidence for the contribution of list-level control to the list-wide proportion congruence effect (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0963721412453586">Fernandez-Duque &amp; Knight, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0963721412453586">Hutchison, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Although this finding challenges item-level models (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0963721412453586">Blais et al., 2007</xref>), it is consistent with models that accommodate both item-level and pathway-level (global) control adjustments (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0963721412453586">Verguts &amp; Notebaert, 2009</xref>; cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0963721412453586">Egner’s, 2008</xref>, idea of multiple conflict-control loops that operate in parallel). Some may, however, question whether list-level control is specific to picture-word stimuli, for which the word may be more easily filtered in a top-down fashion.</p>
<p>I and my colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0963721412453586">Bugg, McDaniel, et al., 2011</xref>) addressed this concern by investigating whether color-naming performance on neutral trials with non-color words (e.g., GOLF, ARM) was affected by list-wide proportion congruence. We manipulated proportion congruence by using a large set of color-word Stroop stimuli, such that responses could not be predicted on incongruent trials. Participants responded significantly faster on neutral trials in the mostly incongruent list condition than in the mostly congruent list condition. Because neutral words were 100% neutral across lists (i.e., they did not have differing levels of ISPC), this difference suggested the use of list-level control.</p>
<p>In a second experiment, we sought converging evidence for list-level control by examining a potential performance <italic>cost</italic>. It was predicted that performance on a secondary task (i.e., remembering to press a key in response to a target stimulus) would be significantly worse in the mostly incongruent list if the secondary task required participants to attend to the word dimension (i.e., if the target stimulus was a word), which was presumably being filtered. In confirmation of this prediction, participants’ performance was significantly worse in the mostly incongruent list than the mostly congruent list when the target stimulus was the neutral word “HORSE.” Because the word “HORSE” was equally neutral in the mostly congruent and mostly incongruent lists, differential performance across the list conditions implies the use of a list-level control process that globally filters words to a greater degree when most trials within a list condition are interfering than when most are not interfering. These findings establish that list-level control can be dissociated from item-level control in the color-word Stroop task, and they lend further support to the view that participants engage list-level control when they cannot simply rely on associative learning.</p>

<title>Concluding Remarks</title>
<p>Cognitive control operates at multiple, dissociable levels. Having the tools to dissociate such levels of control opens up exciting avenues for future research. Manipulations (e.g., divided attention) or individual-difference factors (e.g., age; disorders such as ADHD) that have previously been shown to affect cognitive control may have distinctive effects on different levels of control. To comprehensively address such issues, we should ideally use tools that can dissociate levels of cognitive control in a broader set of domains, including stopping and task switching. Investigators are beginning to identify such tools (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0963721412453586">Crump &amp; Logan, 2010</xref>, for initial evidence of stimulus-driven control of task-set retrieval using a proportion task-switch manipulation).</p>
<p>Although I focused on differentiating list-level from item-level control on the basis of whether participants do or do not have advance information about the likelihood of interference (i.e., proportion congruency), future research is needed to evaluate whether other distinctions might expand our understanding of the differences between levels of control (e.g., strategic vs. nonstrategic; explicit vs. implicit). For example, does list-level control involve willed or voluntary control of word reading, whereas item-level control does not depend on will? Such a distinction is reminiscent of the “emitted” versus “elicited” distinction that characterized operant conditioning and classical conditioning, respectively, and therefore compels the question of whether classical conditioning principles might be used to explain the (relatively abstract) attentional adjustments that underlie stimulus-driven control.</p>
