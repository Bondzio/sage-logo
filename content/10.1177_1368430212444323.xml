<abstract>
<p>This report introduces a series of hypotheses on how intergroup (dis)similarities between the helper’s and the recipient’s group may affect the recipient’s perceptions of the helper’s need-responsiveness. Hypotheses were tested in a real world context of helping (intercultural volunteerism) by using data from two discrete samples of interacting participants. As hypothesized, among culturally similar helper-recipient dyads (but not among dissimilar dyads) feelings of other-focused empathy increased the helper’s perceived responsiveness to the recipient’s needs, whereas among culturally dissimilar dyads (but not among similar dyads) ego-focused concerns decreased the helper’s need-responsiveness. In addition, among culturally dissimilar dyads helper’s need-responsiveness was more strongly contingent upon whether he or she found the recipient attractive or not than among culturally similar dyads. These findings suggest that members of out-groups who may require need-sensitive help most (members of dissimilar out-groups perceived as unattractive) may have a significantly reduced chance to receive it.</p>

<p>The research presented in this article addresses an under-researched phenomenon in the intergroup literature. In the recent years, a mounting body of empirical data suggests that when in-group/out-group categorizations are salient, people help out-group members, especially members of out-groups appearing dissimilar to the in-group, for different reasons than they help members of their own group (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1368430212444323">Hopkins et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1368430212444323">Simon, Stürmer, &amp; Steffens, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1368430212444323">Stürmer, Snyder, Kropp, &amp; Siem, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1368430212444323">van Leeuwen &amp; Täuber, 2011</xref>). Still, to our knowledge, up to now virtually no study has explored whether and to what extent differing motivations for helping have, in fact, different implications for the recipient’s perceptions of the quality of help provided. To fill in this gap the present research explores the idea that, when people provide help to an out-group member, their perceptions of intergroup (dis)similarities may have an important impact on how need-responsive the recipient perceives their help to be (an important feature of the quality of help provided). One reason for this is the differing role that other-focused empathy and ego-focused concerns may play as motivators for helping members of similar and dissimilar out-groups.</p>
<sec id="section1-1368430212444323">
<title>Intergroup (dis)similarities, helping motivations, and need-responsiveness</title>
<p>Empathy can be defined as an other-focused emotional reaction including feelings of compassion, sympathy, and concern for a needy person (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1368430212444323">Batson, 1991</xref>). Recent research suggests that people do not necessarily feel less empathy for out-group members than for in-group members (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1368430212444323">Batson et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1368430212444323">Tarrant, Dazeley, &amp; Cottom, 2009</xref>, Experiment 2). Still, the potential that such prosocial feelings actually translate into prosocial action seems to be significantly reduced when the recipient of help (the “helpee”) is an out-group member, especially a member of an out-group perceived as dissimilar to the in-group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1368430212444323">Siem &amp; Stürmer, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1368430212444323">Stürmer et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1368430212444323">Stürmer, Snyder, &amp; Omoto, 2005</xref>; also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1368430212444323">Penner &amp; Finkelstein, 1998</xref>). One explanation for this phenomenon—on which we also base the present analysis of intergroup determinants of the helper’s need-responsiveness—revolves around the idea that intergroup similarities, on the one hand, and intergroup dissimilarities, on the other hand, convey differing information (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1368430212444323">Stürmer &amp; Snyder, 2010</xref>). Perceptions of intergroup <italic>similarities</italic> may signal to the perceiver that, despite of some differences at the surface, the self and the target are of a “similar kind” (in a biological sense defined by common genes, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1368430212444323">Cunningham, 1986</xref>; in a psychological sense defined by an attributed common essence in terms of, for instance, common values, beliefs etc., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1368430212444323">Leyens et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1368430212444323">Rothbart &amp; Taylor, 1992</xref>). This, in turn, should increase the likelihood that, as people experience empathy they follow this emotion and invest of their personal resources on the other’s behalf. Perceptions of intergroup <italic>dissimilarities</italic>, on the other hand, often function as a warning signal (the other is of a “different kind”), which is likely to evoke negative interaction expectations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1368430212444323">Mallett, Wilson, &amp; Gilbert, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1368430212444323">Pearson et al., 2008</xref>) and negative intergroup emotions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1368430212444323">Pryor, Reeder, Yeadon, &amp; Hesson-McInnis, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1368430212444323">Stephan &amp; Stephan, 1985</xref>). Such processes, in turn, are likely to direct people’s attention away from the needy other and toward the need to maintain or preserve their own welfare. As a result, when people contemplate offering help to an out-group member, especially a member of a dissimilar out-group, they may be generally more hesitant to let themselves be guided by their feelings of empathy and base their decision to help on more self-focused reasons instead (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1368430212444323">Pryor et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>In line with the theorizing and research presented above, previous research could show that people did not necessarily help members of dissimilar out-groups any less than members of similar out-groups or their in-group (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1368430212444323">Saucier, Miller, &amp; Doucet, 2005</xref>), but that their motivations for helping were of a fundamentally different nature. Specifically, while helping “us” (or members of out-groups similar to us) was based on the helpers’ feelings of other-oriented empathy, helping “them” was typically due to more self-focused concerns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1368430212444323">Siem &amp; Stürmer, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1368430212444323">Stürmer et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1368430212444323">Stürmer et al., 2006</xref>; also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1368430212444323">Penner &amp; Finkelstein, 1998</xref>). Still, an important unaddressed question remains: Do such motivational differences also affect the recipients’ perceptions of the help provided? The recipient’s perceptions of the help received are an important issue in its own right, because to be, in fact, truly helpful helping behavior has to meet the target’s specific needs (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1368430212444323">Batson, 1991</xref>). Indeed, there is good reason to assume that, from the helpee’s perspective, the impact of perceived intergroup (dis)similarities on the helper’s motivations matters. According to the empathy literature, when a helper is motivated through feelings of other-focused empathy he or she is more likely to provide help that matches the specific needs of the recipient (an important criterion for the quality of help provided) than when he or she is primarily motivated through self-focused concerns (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1368430212444323">Batson, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1368430212444323">Sibicky, Schroeder, &amp; Dovidio, 1995</xref>). Self-focused concerns, on the other hand, might spur forms of helping that are not beneficial to the helpee or even worse. The research literature suggests a variety of self-focused concerns for helping (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1368430212444323">Omoto &amp; Snyder, 1995</xref>). Still, some are particularly likely to direct the helper’s attention away from the other’s needs. Concerns that centre on the functioning of the helper’s ego—either by protecting the ego from negative features of the self (ego-protection), or by promoting positive strivings associated with the ego (ego-enhancement)—provide a case in point (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1368430212444323">Clary et al., 1998</xref>, especially pp. 1517–1518). If a helper is primarily motivated by ego-focused concerns his or her attentional focus is on the ego’s welfare (and not on the other’s welfare). One could thus expect that he or she may be particularly prone to offer forms of helping which not only ignore the recipient’s needs but also interfere with them. As a consequence, a negative relation between ego-focused concerns and the helpee’s perceptions of the quality of help can be expected.</p>
<p>Putting the pieces together, the foregoing analysis thus suggests the following relationships. When perceived intergroup similarities in a helper-recipient dyad are high the helper is more likely to be motivated to help through empathic feelings, which, in turn, should increase his or her need-responsiveness and likewise the perceived quality of help provided. When intergroup <italic>dis</italic>similarities are high, however, due to the helper’s stronger focus on his or her own welfare, empathic feelings may be de-activated or overridden. The operation of ego-focused concerns may then reduce the helper’s need-responsiveness such that the person in need, although being helped, receives help that he or she perceives as less beneficial.</p>
<p>All other things being equal, one could expect that, due to the differing role of other-focused empathy and ego-focused concerns, recipients in helper-recipient dyads characterized by high intergroup similarities perceive the help provided as more beneficial than recipients in dyads characterized by high intergroup dissimilarities. However, in the real world, helping in intergroup contexts is a complex phenomenon that typically involves a variety of different determinants above and beyond empathy and ego-focused concerns. Recent work on dyadic cross-group helping relationships suggests, for instance, that the helper’s feelings of interpersonal attraction for the recipient play a crucial role in facilitating cross-group helping, and this especially when the helpee comes from a dissimilar out-group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1368430212444323">Siem, Lotz-Schmitt, &amp; Stürmer, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1368430212444323">Siem &amp; Stürmer, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1368430212444323">Stürmer et al., 2005</xref>; also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1368430212444323">Dovidio et al., 1997</xref>). There are several processes potentially underlying the attraction effect. For instance, discovering personal characteristics of an out-group member that one finds attractive may alter the initial categorization of the target (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1368430212444323">Fiske, Lin &amp; Neuberg, 1999</xref>) and might even pave the way for cross-group friendship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1368430212444323">Pettigrew, 1998</xref>). These processes, in turn, are likely to reduce negative interaction expectancies and negative intergroup emotions (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1368430212444323">Page-Gould, Mendoza-Trenton, &amp; Tropp, 2008</xref>) that often go along with perceptions of intergroup dissimilarities. Of particular relevance for the present perspective on need-responsiveness is that people should become more attentive to another person’s needs the more they feel attracted to him or her (see, for instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1368430212444323">Clark, Mills, &amp; Corcoran, 1989</xref>, for effects of friendship on need-orientation). One could thus expect that feelings of attraction may generally increase a helper’s need-responsiveness in intergroup contexts. Based on the theorizing and research on intergroup helping presented above, however, one should expect that the attraction effect is particularly pronounced when intergroup dissimilarities in the helper-recipient dyad are high, because then feelings of interpersonal attraction are particularly important to overcome negative interaction expectancies and intergroup emotions. To control for potential effects of interpersonal attraction on the helper’s perceived need-responsiveness, and to explore a potential interaction with intergroup (dis)similarities, we included a measure of this variable as an additional predictor in our statistical analyses on the role of empathy and ego-focused concerns.</p>

<title>Study context</title>
<p>To investigate the link between the motivational underpinnings of cross-group helping and the recipient’s perceptions of the helper’s need-responsiveness we recruited helper-recipients dyads in the context of an intercultural student volunteer program (“study buddy program”). In this program, German students offer forms of direct and practical assistance to incoming international students (their “buddies”) on a one-on-one basis. Typical activities include showing the buddy around, assisting with administrative issues, facilitating social integration, and others. Registration for the program is open to everyone; there are no specific qualification requirements for the German volunteers or the international students. For the purpose of our investigation, the study-buddy program provided a particularly intriguing real world context because some volunteers are matched with buddies from countries whose cultures appear, from a German perspective rather similar to the German culture (e.g., Sweden or the UK) while others are matched with buddies from countries whose cultures appear rather dissimilar to the German culture (e.g., Cameroon or China). Applying our analyses to this context, we predicted that, among culturally similar volunteer-recipient dyads volunteer’s empathy would contribute positively to their need-responsiveness (as experienced by the recipients). Among culturally dissimilar dyads, however, such a relation should be less likely. For self-focused concerns, especially concerns revolving around protecting or enhancing one’s ego, a reversed pattern of relationships was expected: Among culturally dissimilar dyads ego-focused concerns should decrease the volunteer’s responsiveness to the recipient’s needs while such an effect should be less likely among culturally similar dyads. In addition, we also explored the role of interpersonal attraction as a determinant of the helper’s perceived need-responsiveness. Specifically, we predicted that interpersonal attraction should have a positive effect on need-responsiveness in intercultural dissimilar dyads, which, in fact, may compensate for the attenuating effect of ego-focused concerns.</p>

<title>Participants and procedure</title>
<p>We tested our hypotheses using data from two discrete samples of interacting participants— volunteers and their buddies. The volunteer-buddy dyads were recruited at the beginning of the semester, when volunteers and buddies were registering for the program. Volunteers and buddies were matched through the program coordinators by a quasi-random procedure (“first-come, first-served”). The coordinators advertised our study as a project on the social and psychological aspects of volunteerism across cultural boundaries and encouraged participation. The sample to test our hypotheses consisted of 68 volunteer-buddy dyads composed of 43 female and 25 male German volunteers (<italic>M</italic> age = 23.25 years, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.99) and 47 female and 21 male international students (<italic>M</italic> age = 22.93 years, <italic>SD</italic> = 2.37). Forty-two of the dyads were same-gender dyads. The mean age difference between the volunteers and their buddies was approximately 2 years.</p>
<p>Two independent raters coded the degree of intercultural (dis)similarities in the dyads (Cohen’s κ = 1.00, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001; coded -1 for culturally dissimilar dyads and 1 for culturally similar dyads). Thirty-three dyads were coded as culturally similar (i.e., dyads with buddies from German-speaking, Western European, Northern European, Southern European, or North-American countries representing Western cultures). The remaining 35 dyads were coded as culturally dissimilar (i.e., dyads with buddies from Eastern European, Middle Eastern, Latin American, South and East Asian, or African countries representing Orthodox, Islamic, Latin, Sinic, or African cultures).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1368430212444323">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Volunteers and buddies individually completed separate computer-based questionnaire versions at a time when they had established about one month of interpersonal contact. Both versions included a large number of items related to various issues of cross-cultural volunteerism. In the following, only the measures that are relevant for the hypotheses tests are described.</p>

<title>Other-focused empathy (reported by the volunteers)</title>
<p>We translated and idiomatically adapted four items that have been used in much previous research to assess feelings of empathic concern (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1368430212444323">Batson, 1991</xref>). Specifically, volunteers were asked to indicate how much <italic>sympathy, compassion, tenderness</italic>, and <italic>concern</italic> they felt for their buddy. Volunteers rated each item on 7-point scales ranging from 1 (<italic>not at all</italic>) to 7 (<italic>a great deal</italic>).

<title>Ego-focused concerns (reported by the volunteers)</title>
<p>Measuring ego-focused reasons for helping another person is a difficult issue because, due to normative considerations and self-presentational concerns, people may feel that reporting such motives is rather inappropriate. Therefore, and inspired by similar solutions in the context of research on cooperation (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1368430212444323">Van Lange &amp; Visser, 1999</xref>), rather than blatantly asking participants whether they were motivated to help their buddy for their own benefits, we used four items derived from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1368430212444323">Clary et al.’s (1998)</xref> Volunteer Functions Inventory (VFI) referring to their more general reasons for volunteering in this context. Two of these items referred to ego-protective concerns (“to escape from my own problems,” “to work through my own personal problems”), another two items referred to ego-enhancement concerns (“to feel important,” “to feel needed”). Volunteers indicated for each item how important the specific issue was for their decision to volunteer in the specific study buddy program by using 7-point scales ranging from 1 (<italic>not at all important</italic>) to 7 (<italic>very important</italic>) (Cronbach’s α = .81).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1368430212444323">2</xref></sup></p>

Two items measured feelings of liking and appreciation for the buddy (“How much do you like your buddy?,” “How much do you appreciate your buddy?”) on a scale ranging from 1 (<italic>not at all</italic>) to 7 (<italic>a great deal</italic>). These items were combined with ratings of two pairs of adjectives tapping the buddy’s perceived attractiveness (<italic>unattractive</italic>—<italic>attractive</italic>) and pleasantness (<italic>unpleasant—pleasant)</italic>. Ratings on the adjective items were made on 7-point scales ranging from 1 to 7 such that higher scores indicated more positive evaluations of the buddy.

<title>Socio-demographic variables</title>
<p>Preliminary analyses in which we checked for between-subsample differences with regard to the sociodemographic characteristics of volunteers, buddies (age, gender), and dyads (gender composition, mean age difference between volunteers and buddies) revealed that there were disproportionately more female than male volunteers in the culturally similar dyads (75.76 vs. 24.24%) than in the culturally dissimilar dyads (51.43 vs. 48.57%), χ<sup>2</sup>(1, <italic>N</italic> = 68) = 4.32, <italic>p</italic> = .038 (for all other between-subsample differences, <italic>p</italic>s ≥ .383). We therefore checked whether volunteers’ gender had an effect on our criterion, reported need-responsiveness. This was not the case, <italic>F</italic>(1, 66) = 0.42, <italic>p</italic> = .519. Volunteers’ gender did also not affect the expected Intercultural (Dis)similarities × Predictor (empathy, ego-focused concerns, interpersonal attraction) interaction effects on need-responsiveness, for all three three-way interactions, |βs| ≤ 0.33, |<italic>t</italic>(49)s| ≤ 1.01, <italic>p</italic>s ≥ .317. We also checked whether the gender composition of the dyads (same-gender vs. opposite-gender) served as an alternative moderator of the effects of empathy, ego-focused concerns, and interpersonal attraction on need-responsiveness. This was not the case, however, all relevant two-way interactions involving gender composition as a moderator were not significant, |βs| ≤ 0.28, |<italic>t</italic>(56)s| ≤ 1.12, <italic>p</italic>s ≥ .267. Taken together, these analyses suggest that between-sample differences involving participants’ gender do not provide an alternative account for the predicted moderation effects reported below.</p>

<title>Main analyses</title>
<p>Our hypotheses predict that intercultural (dis)similarities moderate the effects of other-focused empathy, ego-focused concerns, and interpersonal attraction on the helper’s perceived need-responsiveness. To test these hypotheses we first performed a moderated regression analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1368430212444323">Aiken &amp; West, 1991</xref>) with need-responsiveness reported by the buddies as the criterion. In the first step, empathy, ego-focused concerns, and interpersonal attraction (all reported by the volunteers; mean centered) plus the intercultural (dis)similarities variable (coded -1 for culturally dissimilar dyads and 1 for culturally similar dyads) were entered into the equation as predictors (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1368430212444323">Table 3</xref>, upper half). To examine the assumed intercultural (dis)similarities moderation effects, we added the three two-way Predictor × Moderator interaction terms (i.e. Empathy × [Dis]Similarities, Ego-Focused Concerns × [Dis]Similarities, and Attraction × [Dis]Similarities) to the equation in a second step (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1368430212444323">Table 3</xref>, lower half). As predicted, moderation effects were significant for both empathy and ego-focused concerns. Further, we also observed a significant moderation effect for interpersonal attraction.</p>

<p>Following the recommendations of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1368430212444323">Aiken and West (1991</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1368430212444323">West, Aiken, &amp; Krull, 1996</xref>) we first dummy-coded the categorical moderator variable for subsequent simple slopes analyses (to estimate the simple slopes within culturally similar dyads, culturally similar dyads were coded as 0 and culturally dissimilar dyads as 1; to estimate the simple slopes within culturally dissimilar dyads the reversed coding was used). The results of these analyses are depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1368430212444323">Figure 1a</xref> to 1c. As can be seen, across subsamples the helpers’ perceived need-responsiveness was relatively high (presumably due to the benevolent study context). Still, and in line with predictions, for each of the three predictors (empathy, ego-focused concerns, interpersonal attraction) significant Predictor × Moderator interactions emerged resulting from a significant slope in one subsample and a non-significant regression line in the other subsample. Specifically, and as predicted, for culturally similar dyads, buddies whose volunteers experienced higher levels of other-focused empathy reported higher levels of need-responsiveness than buddies whose volunteers experienced lower levels of empathy, β = .49, <italic>t</italic>(60) = 3.13, <italic>p</italic> = .003. For culturally dissimilar dyads, volunteers’ feelings of empathy were unrelated to perceived need-responsiveness, β = −.06, <italic>t</italic>(60) = −0.46, <italic>p</italic> = .650. Conversely, but also as predicted, among culturally dissimilar dyads, the more volunteers were motivated by ego-focused concerns the lower the levels of need-responsiveness reported by their buddies were, β = −.40, <italic>t</italic>(60) = −2.61, <italic>p</italic> = .012, while ego-focused concerns did not contribute to the prediction of perceived need-responsiveness among culturally similar dyads, β = .07, <italic>t</italic>(60) = 0.45, <italic>p</italic> = .651. Finally, and also as expected, among culturally dissimilar dyads, perceived need-responsiveness increased with increasing feelings of interpersonal attraction for the buddy, β = .70, <italic>t</italic>(60) = 5.11, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, whereas this relationship was not significant among culturally similar dyads, β = .26, <italic>t</italic>(60) = 1.66, <italic>p</italic> = .102. In short, all three moderation hypotheses received clear empirical support.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The present study introduced and tested a series of hypotheses on how perceived intercultural (dis)similarities between the helper and the recipient may affect the recipient’s perceptions of the helper’s need-responsiveness—a criterion that has, to our knowledge, received virtually no attention in the intergroup helping literature. We tested our hypotheses in a cross-cultural volunteer program designed to support incoming student migrants. We selected this context for two important reasons. First, in globalized societies supporting immigrants’ adjustment to the hosting society’s culture is an important social issue to which cross-cultural volunteerism provides a promising approach. A better understanding of the social psychological processes affecting the volunteers’ responsiveness to the immigrants’ needs (as perceived from the immigrants’ perspective) is thus of high practical relevance. Second, this context allowed us to systematically test our theoretical predictions on the influences of perceived intercultural (dis)similarities on three distinct psychological determinants of the helper’s need-responsiveness, namely other-focused empathy, ego-focused concerns and interpersonal attraction, in a naturally occurring intergroup situation.</p>
<p>Our results extend prior work on the motivational underpinnings of dyadic cross-group helping in several important ways. Previous research could demonstrate that empathy is a potent motivator for helpers in dyads characterized by high intergroup similarities but not for helpers in dyads characterized by high intergroup dissimilarities (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1368430212444323">Siem &amp; Stürmer, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1368430212444323">Stürmer et al., 2005</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1368430212444323">Penner &amp; Finkelstein, 1998</xref>). The present study goes one step further by showing that the recipients in culturally similar dyads (but not in culturally dissimilar dyads) directly benefit from the helper’s empathic motivation insofar as this motivation translates into greater need-responsiveness. For ego-focused concerns, by contrast, our data point to a dual nature of this class of determinants of helping. Previous research has suggested that ego-focused concerns play an important role in motivating people to help out-group members, especially members of dissimilar or even stigmatized out-groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1368430212444323">Omoto &amp; Snyder, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1368430212444323">Siem &amp; Stürmer, 2012</xref>; also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1368430212444323">Stürmer &amp; Snyder, 2010</xref>). An important novel contribution of the present data is that when intercultural dissimilarity in the dyad is high (but not when it is low) the helper’s ego-focused concerns may have a detrimental effect on his or her perceived need-responsiveness. Thus, on the one hand, ego-focused concerns may prompt people to get involved as cross-cultural volunteers (and to maintain their service, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1368430212444323">Omoto &amp; Snyder, 1995</xref>); on the other hand, however, volunteers primarily motivated by ego-focused concerns may be less attentive to their clients’ needs.</p>
<p>Given the antagonistic effects of empathy and ego-focused concerns on the helper’s need-responsiveness among culturally similar and culturally dissimilar dyads, one may wonder why we did not observe significant mean differences in the helper’s perceived need-responsiveness between the two subsamples. One viable explanation comes from our data on the role of the helper’s feelings of interpersonal attraction for the recipient. Previous research could demonstrate that interpersonal attraction has a positive effect on helping, especially when the recipient is from a dissimilar out-group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1368430212444323">Siem et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1368430212444323">Siem &amp; Stürmer, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1368430212444323">Stürmer et al., 2005</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1368430212444323">Dovidio et al., 1997</xref>). Extending these findings, the current work suggests that, among culturally dissimilar dyads, the helper’s feelings of interpersonal attraction are also an important precursor of his or her need-responsiveness. For the present context, it thus appears that feelings of interpersonal attraction compensated for the detrimental effects of ego-focused concerns and/or a lack of empathic motivation for helping in culturally dissimilar dyads. Viewed from a different perspective, an important implication of our data on interpersonal attraction is that, ironically, those members of out-groups who may in all likelihood require need-sensitive help most—members of culturally dissimilar out-groups perceived as unattractive or unpleasant—may be precisely the ones that have the lowest chance to receive it. In fact, a series of median-split based contrast analyses in which we compared the low attractive/dissimilar buddies subgroup with the three remaining groups revealed in line with this conclusion that this subgroup reported the lowest degree of volunteers’ need-responsiveness (for all comparisons, <italic>t</italic>s ≥ 1.98, <italic>p</italic>s ≤ .057). From a more applied perspective, then, interventions centering on increasing volunteers’ feelings of interpersonal attraction for their clients may provide a promising approach to promote need-responsive help for members of (culturally) dissimilar out-groups. One way to increase interpersonal attraction in the context of intercultural volunteerism could be to assign volunteers to clients on the basis of a match in interpersonal interests, activities, or personal characteristics.</p>
<p>There are several additional aspects of our findings that corroborate their validity. First, we obtained the predicted moderational pattern in a field setting which, due to the variety of influences operating in the field, often makes detecting moderation effects difficult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1368430212444323">McClelland &amp; Judd, 1993</xref>). Moreover, we tested our hypotheses in a very benevolent intergroup encounter. Our research participants—German student volunteers and international students—deliberately decided to get involved in an intercultural volunteer program. Being able to show that under natural conditions and even among well-intended and culturally-open individuals perceptions of intercultural (dis)similarities influence the processes that affect quality of help in the expected ways speaks persuasively for a rather strong influence of the proposed factors and for the external validity of our findings.</p>
<p>However, we also wish to acknowledge possible limitations of the present research. One concerns the correlational nature of our findings. Although there is good theoretical and empirical reason to assume that our predictor variables (empathy, ego-focused concerns, and interpersonal attraction) play a causal role in intergroup helping (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1368430212444323">Siem &amp; Stürmer, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1368430212444323">Stürmer et al., 2005</xref>; also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1368430212444323">Omoto &amp; Snyder, 1995</xref>), the correlational nature of our study does not allow us to draw definite conclusions about cause-effect relationships. One could speculate, for instance, that the buddies’ positive attitudes toward their volunteers (as reflected in our measure of perceived need-responsiveness) may have increased empathic feelings for culturally similar volunteers and decreased ego-focused concerns for culturally dissimilar volunteers. Fortunately, the buddies’ questionnaire also included a measure of buddies’ feelings of attraction towards their volunteers that allowed us to directly explore this alternative (the buddies’ interpersonal attraction measure paralleled the measure for the volunteers; α = .82). If, in fact, depending upon intercultural (dis)similarities, the buddies’ attitudes toward their volunteers had increased (or decreased) the volunteer’s feelings of empathy (or their ego-focused concerns, respectively), one should observe significant interactions between buddies’ feelings of attraction and intercultural (dis)similarities in moderated regressions analyses with empathy or ego-focused concerns as criteria rather than predictors. This was not the case, however (for both interaction terms derived from separate “reversed” moderation analyses,|ts| ≤ 0.71, <italic>p</italic>s ≥ .481). These additional analyses thus strengthened our confidence that the observed moderational pattern can be interpreted most parsimoniously in terms of empathy and ego-focused concerns being differentially important causes of the helpers’ need-responsiveness rather than the consequences of the recipients’ interpersonal attitudes.</p>
<p>Another possible limitation concerns the measurement of ego-focused concerns. While the assessments of empathy and interpersonal attraction were target-specific, to reduce the influence of self-presentational concerns or even denial, and inspired by other researchers’ measurement strategies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1368430212444323">Van Lange &amp; Visser, 1999</xref>), ego-focused concerns were assessed in a more general fashion by asking participants how important these concerns generally were for their decision to volunteer in the study buddy program. Even though there is good theoretical and empirical reasons to assume that such general motivational orientations also structure and influence their goals and expectations towards their specific clients (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1368430212444323">Kiviniemi, Snyder, &amp; Omoto, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1368430212444323">Omoto &amp; Snyder, 1995</xref>) one might argue that our measure represents a rather indirect indicator of the motives of our participants. It should be noted, however, that despite this potential slippage in measurement, our measure of ego-focused provided clear evidence for the theoretically predicted relationships. Given the fact that deficits in measurement typically attenuate the observed relations between variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1368430212444323">Bollen, 1989</xref>), the use of this measure might eventually even be construed as a rather conservative test of our hypotheses.</p>
<p>We also wish to comment on the psychological mechanisms underlying the moderating role of intercultural (dis)similarities. Our group-level perspective suggests that group-based (dis)similarities serve as surface cues for the relative absence or presence of a common essence or make-up shared by the helper and the helpee (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1368430212444323">Stürmer &amp; Snyder, 2010</xref>). Essentialist theorizing proposes that people do not need to know exactly what the common essence that they share with other people actually is. Rather, it is the feeling that there is a meaningful something that distinguishes “us” from “them” that is sufficient to make sense of group processes and intergroup relations (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1368430212444323">Simon, 2004</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1368430212444323">Rothbart &amp; Taylor, 1992</xref>). In line with this contention, our research (including the present study) has established the proposed (dis)similarity moderations across a variety of natural groups differing along various cultural dimensions (e.g., ethnicity, sexual orientation, religious affiliation; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1368430212444323">Siem &amp; Stürmer, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1368430212444323">Stürmer et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1368430212444323">Stürmer et al., 2006</xref>, Experiment 1). Moreover, we even found support for our perspective among artificial groups for which the influence of distinct cultural differences can be ruled out (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1368430212444323">Stürmer et al., 2006</xref>, Experiment 2). In fact, exploratory analyses in the present data set in which we grouped the volunteer-recipient dyads along more specific cultural dimensions (ethnicity, language family, or standard of living) did not provide any evidence that any of these single dimensions could account for the observed moderational pattern. We thus feel confident that the interpretation of the present data in terms of our group-level perspective is valid, and that it was the volunteers’ general sense of “communality vs. otherness” rather than specific stereotypic beliefs that drove their helping motivations in the present context.</p>
<p>Before closing, we also wish to put the present findings in perspective with other researchers’ work on out-group helping. Of particular relevance in this respect is Nadler and colleagues’ research on intergroup helping as power relations (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1368430212444323">Nadler, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1368430212444323">Nadler &amp; Halabi, 2006</xref>). A general premise of this research is that depending on perceptions of the relative (in)security of the intergroup status relations members of high status groups tend to provide different types of help to members of low status out-groups in order to maintain their in-group’s superiority. Building on this reasoning it may feel tempting to interpret our findings on the effects of perceived intercultural (dis)similarities along similar lines such that, as intercultural dissimilarities between the volunteers’ and the buddies’ groups were high, volunteers felt more insecure about their in-group’s superiority and thus responded in a more self-focused fashion to the buddy’s need than when intercultural dissimilarities were low. With regard to this issue it should be taken into account, however, that Nadler and colleagues developed their hypotheses in the context of conflicting in-group/out-group constellations in which intergroup status is a collectively contested issue (e.g., Arab-Jewish relations). In the present study, in which we tested our specific hypotheses on the role of intercultural (dis)similarities in a benign multicultural context (i.e., a student peer-mentoring program), this was clearly not the case, however. In fact, if anything, one could assume that threats to the volunteer’s perceived in-group superiority are provided through international students coming from similar rather than dissimilar cultures because their countries are more likely to emerge as economic competitors. Consequently, self-focused orientation should be higher among similar volunteer-recipient dyads than among dissimilar dyads. Yet, in line with our perspective on the role of intercultural (dis)similarities, the exact opposite pattern was observed. Nevertheless, we feel that systematic investigations of the interplay between perceived intergroup (dis)similarities and socio-structural determinants in determining helping responses in future research are desirable and promising. Such research may not only provide theoretically meaningful information about the boundary conditions of the observed (dis)similarity effects. It has also a strong potential, we believe, to produce practically applicable knowledge to managing the complexities of cross-group helping in the real world.</p>

<p>We also included items in the questionnaire tapping additional motivations of volunteerism (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1368430212444323">Clary et al., 1998</xref>).
