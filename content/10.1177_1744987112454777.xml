<p>All nursing careers are built on the foundation of one’s pre registration nurse education: it is from these foundations that student nurses (and later Registered Nurses) develop their understanding of what it is to be a nurse and to be part of the nursing profession. These foundations lead to aspirations about where careers in nursing may lead (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1744987112454777">Barton and le May, 2012</xref>) and these, in turn, influence the development of the profession of nursing.</p>
<p>As a result of the introduction of the latest Standards for Pre-registration Nurse Education by the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1744987112454777">Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) (2010)</xref>, all pre-registration nurse education programmes in the United Kingdom, like many others across the world, will have to be at degree level from 2013. There have been many differing views expressed in reaction to this requirement, at one end of the continuum is the view that this is nothing new as degree level courses in nursing have existed in the United Kingdom and internationally for over 30 years, indeed some post-graduate courses exist within pre registration nurse education – a point of view explored by Kathryn Jones in her editorial on this topic. At the other end of the continuum, is the somewhat spurious notion that a move to degree level preparation for nurses will distract them, during their studies and once qualified, from their core role of competently nursing people.</p>
<p>Much media attention, public debate and professional re-focussing activities – e.g. the Willis commission on nurse education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1744987112454777">Education Commission, 2012</xref>) and no doubt the Nursing and Care Quality Forum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1744987112454777">Department of Health, 2012</xref>) – has become entwined with this change, so much so that one could be forgiven for thinking that obtaining graduate status for nurses is the only important change introduced within the new standards. This, of course, is not the case – the NMC standards show all of us involved in educating nurses, be that in the lecture room, the simulation suite or at the patient’s side, the key components of this endeavour required to build a 21st century workforce. The standards show prospective nurses what contemporary nursing involves, they show practising nurses areas for updating and they show every member of the public what they can and should expect of nurses and nursing. Frustratingly, it is likely that the ‘graduate or not’ debate will continue for some time to come and in continuing it becomes a distraction from the wider challenges and opportunities of instilling future nurses with the values, knowledge and skills needed to provide and lead safe, effective, confident and compassionate care and develop their careers as nurses alongside developing their profession.</p>
<p>Arguably of more importance than the move to degree level education is the prioritisation of essential focal areas and skills within pre-registration courses that has occurred following the publication of the NMC standards. A series of papers within this focus issue explores the importance of pre-registration nurses’ education, together with the opportunities and challenges that exist. These papers reflect the four domains of practice set out by the NMC (2010) – professional values, communication and interpersonal skills, nursing practice &amp; decision-making and leadership, management &amp; team working.</p>
<p>The importance of professional values and how these underpin all decisions taken in relation to nursing care is reflected across the papers in this issue, as is the need for effective communication and interpersonal skills. There is a risk that the components of these two domains are presumed to be innately present in all selected nursing students, however the contributions of Carr, Cavyae and Watts and the review by McIlfatrick, all demonstrate the importance of giving specific attention to the development of knowledge and skills as well as developing awareness of how our own inherent values influence our actions; their examples from the area of supporting people in pain and supporting people at the end of their life ably make this point. We cannot assume that the necessary values, knowledge and skills are present in all people selected for nursing courses just because they have spoken well at interview about their desire to care and their willingness to study nursing. Neither is it enough to simply have the knowledge about these important areas of nursing or to know what skills could be used, what is central to successful pre-registration learning and subsequent practice is that students are enabled to recognise the inter-relationships between their own values and the required professional values and how these together impact on their interpretation and use of their knowledge in the decisions and actions they take.</p>
<p>Despite all pre-registration nurses in the United Kingdom having to spend 50% of their course (2300 hours) working in practice, it is not possible to provide real-life learning opportunities of all possible situations that may confront students once qualified. The use of simulation in learning can widen the range of learning opportunities available to students so that they can experience some of the less frequently occurring events in healthcare such as mass casualty incidents as well as practising to develop their proficiency in more frequently occurring and perhaps sensitive and challenging care activities, such as breaking bad news or physical examinations, within a supportive and controlled setting. Gobbi and colleagues, together with the review by Ker, acknowledge the potential of simulation to facilitate learning but also highlight the importance of structured and rounded evaluations of these activities.</p>
<p>From a professional perspective a key difference between the student nurse and the Registered Nurse is their personal accountability for decision-making. The centrality of decision making by Registered Nurses is highlighted by its inclusion in the first few words of the widely used definition of the role of the nurse provided by the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1744987112454777">Royal College of Nursing (2003)</xref> which states that the role of the nurse involves ‘The use of <italic>clinical judgement</italic> in the provision of care to enable people to improve, maintain or recover health, to cope with health problems, and to achieve the best possible quality of life, whatever their disease or disability until death.’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1744987112454777">Royal College of Nursing, 2003</xref>). Dowding and colleagues, together with comments from Price, explore the need for student nurses to understand decision making processes and emphasise how skills in decision making need to be developed if errors in practice are to be avoided. Price also reminds us that students need to learn about risk and uncertainty, as contemporary nursing is becoming an increasingly more complicated activity.</p>
<p>Halabi and Hamdan-Mansour and MacGuire add further to the discussions about decision making when exploring the attitudes of nursing students in Jordan towards research and note that despite having an interest in research students reported limited research abilities: these findings are not restricted to nursing students in Jordan – evidence amassed from around the world is available to support them. The challenge we face as educators is to move students from interest to implementation. One solution is surely to develop the hallmarks of <italic>graduateness</italic> that studying to degree level instils. Doing this will enable students to become nurses who are not only interested and understand the relationship between research, critical thinking and the delivery of high quality care but also know how to decide which research findings to implement in which circumstances, with whom in their multi-professional client-centred team and to whom from within their case-load whilst remaining compassionate, clinically competent and thoughtful in their everyday practice of nursing.</p>
<p>The need to continue to invest in one’s learning and adapt in the nursing role is a constant feature throughout one’s nursing career. The two final papers in this issue move beyond pre-registration nurse education, but continue to highlight the need for nurses to be able to adapt to new challenges if their own health changes (Matt) and when they take on new roles, including the role of a professor (Jackson and colleagues; Andrews).</p>
<p>In conclusion, the papers within this issue highlight the necessity of purposeful and structured pre-registration nurse education in order to develop the necessary values, knowledge and skills that will prepare student nurses to become effective Registered Nurses and future leaders in Nursing. Pre-registration nurse education needs to see far beyond the end of the initial nurse education course and consider how the foundations that initial courses provide can be built upon over a career in nursing. In helping students to build on these foundations nurse educators need to also challenge themselves to move beyond what may have been the traditional focus on providing knowledge and skills within a predominately clinical arena and move to using innovative teaching approaches to draw out and nurture the potential of student nurses to not only work as nurses who have a degree, but rather to work as graduate nurses who bring added insights, flexibility, confidence, and critical abilities and understanding to the role of the Registered Nurse.</p>
