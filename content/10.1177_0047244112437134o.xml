<p>This volume, which emerged from a 2008 conference on <italic>Poetics after ‘45 – Crisis and Creativity</italic> at Queens University in Belfast, comprises a co-authored introduction and 16 chapters organized under three headings: ‘Poetics after Auschwitz’; ‘Tradition and Transgression’; and ‘Comparative Explorations’. This arrangement and the opening paragraph of the introduction indicate a timely exploration of the writing-after- Auschwitz debate from the perspective of the memory boom in the age of postmemory. However, this is not borne out by the introduction which offers a detailed and nuanced re-reading of Adorno’s dictum in the context of his <italic>Negative Dialectics</italic>, but does not discuss the question whether Adorno’s position would need to be reconsidered or even revised in the age of postmemory. By positing a crisis of representation and a rupture of civilization from a normative position, the editors have chosen to eclipse the vast body of Jewish and German family narratives, both fictional and autobiographical, that explore the long after-effects of the Holocaust and of the Third Reich from a transgenerational perspective. An unfortunate error has slipped through on p. 9 of the Introduction where Peter Weiss’s seminal <italic>Ästhetik des Widerstands</italic> is cited as <italic>Poetik des Widerstands</italic> and rendered in English as ‘The Poetics of Resistance’. At thematic level, it is particularly disappointing that the introduction leaves the notion of creativity (which appears in the subtitle) under-illuminated.</p>
<p>But the volume contains some really good chapters, such as Elaine Martin’s essay on Nelly Sachs, Gisela Dischner’s chapter on Paul Celan, Marton Marko’s piece on Ingeborg Bachmann and Marko Pajevic’s reflections on Ilse Aichinger. All four authors offer nuanced interpretations and deliberations in dialogue with the Adornian position. Another seminal writer discussed in this section is Rose Ausländer whose hybrid position between tradition and modernity is explored by Annette Runte, albeit in at times heavy-handed fashion. The first section concludes with a lucid and engaging contribution on Charlotte Beradt’s largely forgotten collection of dreams, <italic>Das Dritte Reich des Traums</italic>, which − as Hans-Walter Schmidt-Hannisa rightly argues − offers a political poetology that subverts the distinction between literature and document. The second section opens with Rüdiger Görner’s and Stefan Hajduk’s respective analyses of Benn’s influence on post-war poetry. Chris Bezzel’s chapter on ‘Concrete Poetry’ is not only thematically quite disconnected but also lacking in cogency. The essay begins with an overly long exposition of well-established Saussurian insights in the context of non-conceptual meaning, and it ends with general statements about consumerism in contemporary culture: ‘If we set aside the issue of profitability for publishers and authors, the reader does not look for real poetic enjoyment’ (p. 167). There are two complementary contributions on Heiner Müller: while Renata Plaice’s piece explores Müller’s poetics of transgression and discontinuity with reference to <italic>Hamletmaschine</italic>, Barry Murnane’s outstanding chapter offers a compelling reading of the idea of ‘barbaric creativity’ in Müller’s <italic>Germania</italic> cycle. The section concludes with Aniela Knoblich’s analysis of Thomas Kling’s poetry where tradition and rupture find expression in the confrontation of antiquity with elements of everyday life in the twenty-first century. The final comparative section opens with Manuel Bragança’s chapter on the changing conception of freedom in Sartre’s <italic>Les Chemins de la liberté.</italic> Peter Tame then attempts to reinstate the notion of ‘intuitive and lyrical humanism’ against Adorno (p. 250) in his chapter on Malraux and Spengler. Tatjana Petzer’s chapter on ‘trauma’s topographies’ (p. 253) in the novels by the Yugoslav writer Danilo Kiš argues that this writer’s radical techniques of defamiliarization, ‘bisociation’ and ‘muro/judeomancy’ envisage a ‘new <italic>ars memoria</italic>’ (p. 263). The volume concludes with a highly deconstructivist chapter on Claude Lanzmann’s <italic>Shoah</italic> by Gert Hofmann. Engaging with the ‘aesthetics of non-power’ (p. 267) as an ethical response to the Shoah, this chapter posits more than it is willing to demonstrate: the reader learns little about the documentary and filmic techniques employed by Lanzmann.</p>
<p>While the volume as a whole would have benefited from a widening of the lens from the perspective of post-Adornian contemporary interventions, the majority of the essays offer illuminating and careful readings across a range of post-Holocaust authors who have directly or indirectly responded to the crisis of representation.</p>
