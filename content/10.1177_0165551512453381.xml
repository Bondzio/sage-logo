<abstract>
<p>Exploring ways in which new technology impacts adolescents’ information behaviours and creates a social space requires holistic investigation. A qualitative study of 21 seniors in an upper-middle-class suburban high school revealed highly individualized use of Facebook and its features. These included: (i) Friends groups of 50—3700 members, with even the largest groups representative primarily of face-to-face connections, and (ii) a clear articulation within those groups of various categories, each with its own distinct communicative channel and style. A meaningful connection was found between the social value of various social network (SN)-mediated relationships and the communicative modes used to maintain and enhance them. Through a comprehensive literature review and clearly grounded analysis of rich data, this work supports the contention that adolescent social groups in which SNs are embedded form a distinct domain, and establishes a rationale for further investigation of adolescents’ contextualized use of SNs within social relationships.</p>

<title>1. Introduction</title>
<p>The lives of people aged 13−20 have changed dramatically over the last decade, and the nature and magnitude of this change has become an important focus of scholarly investigation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0165551512453381">1</xref>]. Adolescence is variously considered as a historical, psychological and/or biological process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0165551512453381">2</xref>], or as a discrete life-stage defined by its focus on the creation and maintenance of a distinct culture. Whatever the definition, today’s adolescents increasingly employ social networks (SNs) as primary communicative channels and social ‘spaces’ within which they experience social reality and in which self-image is defined and social interaction carried out.</p>
<p>Important questions arise about the interplay of psychological, sociological and technological factors in the lives of this large and pivotal social group. Questions regarding the most accurate and useful ways in which to categorize these new changes and activities also emerge. Adolescents are increasingly dependent on technically mediated modes of interaction for defining social roles and functioning. The literature of adolescence addresses these factors singly or in dialogic pairs; however it less frequently considers the interdependence of all factors, or their mutual integration within scholarship bounded by academic discipline. There is a clear need for such an integrative investigation of this particular social ‘scene’. An exploratory, ethnographic study was designed as a holistic look at adolescents functioning in stable, established social networks, with the most popular SN, Facebook (FB), embedded as a primary communicative conduit.</p>
<p>A review of relevant literature is presented, noting the gap within which the study situates itself. The Methodology section describes the rationale for the selection of grounded theory as a frame and open-ended interviews as an instrument; the population surveyed is discussed and the interviews described. The Results and Discussion section offers a narrative description of the content of the interviews, with emergent patterns described. Conclusions are offered with suggestions for further research.</p>

<title>2.1. Overview</title>
<p>It is clear that a study intended to highlight the role of SNs as a constituent element in the developmental and information behaviour of an adolescent peer group is in fact addressing an exceedingly complex phenomenon. It sits at the intersection of a number of disciplines, each historically concerned with artificially delineated and thus separate aspects of the subject. The relevant literature, as well as the focus of our work, falls within a number of traditionally discrete academic domains, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0165551512453381">Figure 1</xref>:</p>
<list id="list1-0165551512453381" list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>Adolescent psychology, both sociological and clinical/experimental, has built upon definitions of adolescence. The first offered by Hall [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0165551512453381">3</xref>] established a body of quantitative work devoted to normative/deviant development and behaviours, considering social setting – familial and peer-based – primarily as a ground for individual development. The functioning of normative, stable social groups has been less frequently explored [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0165551512453381">4</xref>]. Friendship groups are infrequently regarded as integrated entities in which the use of embedded SNs mirrors and reflects the nature of interrelationships.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Both human information behaviour and information science have focused upon adolescence primarily within the field of education, only recently integrating a consideration of peer group and social identities into their work on information and learning behaviour. There are, in addition, a number of potentially relevant models for information behaviour in the context of social groups that are just beginning to be considered with respect to the information behaviour of children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0165551512453381">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0165551512453381">6</xref>]. These provide as yet unexplored possibilities for an investigation of the information behaviour of adolescents.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Studies of social media (SM) – the prime venue for communication among adolescent social groups – have recognized the social basis of identity formation and interaction, and established a range of contexts – relational, educational familial, information behaviour-based – within which SM is an essential element. They have less frequently, however, defined those social contexts, or assigned specific purpose to that use. They have not attempted to match the ways in which the affordances of SNs are integrated by users into an overall social functioning, in which ‘affordance’ has personal meaning in terms of the type and quality of relationships.</p>

<p>Although a survey of the literature of these domains shows an increasing trend towards transdisciplinarity, there remains a need to further integrate these approaches with respect to adolescent social networks, identifying essential components, relevant domains, and specific cultural context, synthesizing the perspectives of psychology, information behaviour, social media studies, and any others that are applicable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0165551512453381">7</xref>]. Williams and Merton, in their analytical look at online profiles, expressed the need ‘to learn how online social networking sites could benefit and give direction for future research on adolescent behaviour and development’ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0165551512453381">8</xref>]. They note that ‘to date there has been little research on dynamic social and emotional content provided in blogs [including SNs] and how such content relates to adolescent development, peer relationships, and indicators of emotional well-being’ (p. 254).</p>

<sec id="section4-0165551512453381">
<title>2.2. Social context of adolescence: adolescent information behaviour</title>
<p>Information behaviour (IB) can be defined as patterns of actions performed within a social group, through which members construct reality and share meaning. Interactions are built upon these patterns of behaviour, which determine the kinds of information sought, and the interpretation of the information acquired. Patterns of IB are thus critical for understanding the implementation of SM within social networks. Library and information science (LIS) has extensively investigated the information behaviour of a number of groups, including adolescents both inside and outside of formal educational settings, and has, in several important studies, considered a social dynamic as an element within the focus of the study, or within its design. It has paid less attention to the role of group membership – defined as peers, classmates or members of a common SN site – on the information behaviour of individual members. There is in fact significant disagreement among information scholars about the nature of those patterns of behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0165551512453381">9</xref>]. Savolainen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0165551512453381">10</xref>] compares two IB theories, the Information Grounds of Pettigrew [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0165551512453381">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0165551512453381">12</xref>] and the Small Worlds of Chatman [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0165551512453381">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0165551512453381">14</xref>], defining each IB ‘context’ in terms of (i) theoretical construct, (ii) temporal and spatial parameters, (iii) explicit purpose as understood by members and (iv) the implicit behavioural/developmental task performed within the group, elements of each corresponding in significant ways to the IB context observed within adolescent social networks: Information Ground’s open environments, temporarily created when people come together for a common purpose, ‘but from whose behaviour emerges a social atmosphere that fosters the spontaneous and serendipitous sharing of information’ ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0165551512453381">12</xref>], p. 811); and the Small World’s shared world-view, shared norms and attitudes, restricted physical environment, and reluctance to go beyond the group for group-reinforcing categories of information.</p>
<p>Savolainen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0165551512453381">10</xref>] concludes that these configurations – and others comparable to them – exist in unknown numbers, embedded in a variety of social and cultural scenes. Although these models have been applied only rarely to adolescents per se, their relevance appears clear. Nor has scholarly work addressed the potential effect of computer mediation within these paradigms, an omission that would need to be addressed in any application of the models to adolescents, for whom the online environment is a primary setting for communication. There is thus a need to examine the specifics of SM use in the context of IB, with qualitative research necessarily required in order to establish basic parameters of behaviours and meaning, both in terms of adolescent IB and its integration of SM. Information Grounds and Small World paradigms provide a theoretical lens, and offer a potentially explanatory frame for consideration of IB and SM use to be observed on the part of adolescents.</p>

<title>2.3. Social context of adolescence: social networks</title>
<p>Adolescents have incorporated electronically based vehicles of communication into all aspects of their lives. These include email, texting, Tweeting, Instant Messaging, sharing music, blogging, and participating in Social Network Sites (SNSs) such as FB. In light of the very obvious – but often downplayed – reality that all of these are, first and foremost, functional tools in the service of social interaction, it is essential that any investigation of their ‘physical’ features or possibilities must define and situate them as communicative elements in an explicitly articulated social context. The pioneering work of boyd [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0165551512453381">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0165551512453381">16</xref>], ongoing for over a decade, is a highly relevant starting point for any investigation of social networks. Boyd and Ellison describe the nature of FB as a social network tool at length, recognizing the extent to which it reflects and supports offline ties. Boyd’s definition of a social network is foundational ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0165551512453381">1</xref>], p. 211). She acknowledges SNSs as vehicles for individual ‘impression management, self-presentation, and friendship performance’ (p. 219), allowing users ‘to negotiate presentations of self and connect with others’ (p. 219), and recognizes the distinct nature of categories of friends. She also notes that ‘richer, ethnographic research on populations more difficult to access … [and] would further aid scholars’ ability to understand the long-term implications of these tools’ ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0165551512453381">16</xref>], p. 224). This insight is clearly applicable to the social groupings formed by adolescents, both within and outside the school setting. Interestingly, her recent work supports the intentions of the current study, focusing as it does on the use of individual SM features in the service of social interaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0165551512453381">17</xref>].</p>
<p>Donath [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0165551512453381">18</xref>] proposes perhaps the most radical of potential effects of the new media on social networks. She addresses the question of whether the ‘socially assistive’ properties of social networking sites could in fact facilitate the development of ‘supernets,’ composed of high numbers of both strong ties (ensuring a robust network reliability) and weak ties (making the network versatile in its broad range of connections). Supernets could perhaps expand the scope and scale of social networks to the point of quantitative redefinition, and the assumption of previously unknown roles within the lives of users. An ethnographic investigation of how adolescents utilize SM in the context of a single social group perhaps has the potential to shed light on the feasibility – the real possibility – of such an eventuality.</p>
<p>Subrahmanyam and Greenfield [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0165551512453381">9</xref>] address the overall implications of increasing use of online communication modalities by adolescents. They confirm findings that social network participation reinforces face-to-face (FtF) relationships, for example allowing participants to look up newly acquired FtF friends. Although their focus is an overall evaluation of the benefits and risks of social network participation, it is relevant here in its identification of a behavioural framework – John Hill’s key developmental tasks of adolescence (p. 124) -- and its contention that ‘for today’s youth, media technologies are an important social variable, and that physical and virtual worlds are psychologically connected’ (p. 124). This work makes note of some basic understandings of online actions as reflective of group affiliation, and validates an attempt to further explore adolescent behaviour through its online manifestations.</p>
<p>The work of Walther and Bazarova [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0165551512453381">19</xref>] extends the study of social networks to the role played by those semiotic elements of a FB page that members cannot control: namely, the images of friends and the nature of posts made by friends on the member’s wall. Walther’s work demonstrates that these factors do influence observers’ perceptions of the target member (who is, within the study, not an offline friend). The work indicates that the nature of social evaluations made by viewers (who, outside the parameters of this study, are likely to be offline friends) is subtly – but undeniably – influenced by the specific formal elements and protocols – the semiotics – of FB. It invites close formal analysis of the ways in which this social ‘language’ is used by its native speakers, and supports the contention that formal aspects of FB – the specific modes of communication available – will in fact reflect the nature of the connections between members of school groups</p>
<p>A study by Mikami et al. that does focus primarily on the social determinants of online behaviour, describes the use of network web pages in ‘support[ing] communication with many friends, and encourag[ing] users to recognize connections between individuals’ ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0165551512453381">20</xref>], p. 53). It is interesting to speculate that if individuals do in fact focus greater attention upon the variety of their relationships as a function of FB engagement, it is perhaps not too far-fetched to suppose that those most heavily engaged in FB interactions would perhaps be the most articulate about the nature and purpose of their various groups of friends – that they would in fact be excellent ethnographic ‘informants’.</p>
<p>Within all of those disciplines investigating aspects of the SM use of adolescents, there is in fact a movement towards inclusion of additional perspectives. A search of ScienceDirect, for example, conducted in July 2011, yielded a number of articles focused on the social dimension of SM use, published by journals characterized by transdisciplinary orientation. <italic>Computers in Human Behaviour</italic> is one such, offering empirically based work that is a synthesis of computer technology and behavioural science. Work by Cheung, Chiu and Lee [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0165551512453381">21</xref>], for example, presents a new paradigm, termed ‘We-Intention’, within which to consider the online activity of adolescents (students) as intentional social action. Cheung and Lee [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0165551512453381">22</xref>] had in fact earlier proposed a theoretical model of SM use that regards it as ‘intentional social action’ (p. 24). The question posed by Cheung et al., ‘Why do students use Facebook?’, is answered within that frame. The work’s quantitative orientation provides a category- and numbers-based framework within which to consider the more ethnographic observations offered here, as well as a means of ‘triangulation’ of results for both approaches and perhaps a platform from which to develop next steps for both.</p>
<p>Recent work published in <italic>Computers in Human Behaviour</italic>, that of Smock, Ellison, Lampe, and Wohn [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0165551512453381">17</xref>], describes the specialized applications of individual features, noting, ‘unidimensional measures of SNS use obfuscate motivations for using specific features’. Both Smock et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0165551512453381">17</xref>] and Zhang and Benjamin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0165551512453381">7</xref>] define the core elements of every information context – people, technology, organization or society, and information – and recommend the application of this model to new research, foregrounded by an assumption that recent and current studies lack this perspective. Within the context of these studies, the multipartite confluence of social functioning, SM (people interacting with technology) and information behaviour mutually create the whole, and any investigation of a singular aspect of that whole – focusing on social dynamics or the specifics of media use – must consider its relationship to all others. It is this realignment that is the basis for our investigation of the realities of adolescent SM use.</p>
<p>The literature review thus reveals a shortage of work focused on the intersection of three foundational domains, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0165551512453381">Figure 1</xref>. There exists a need for the holistic consideration of adolescence as it is altered and defined by technological affordances, and on the interplay of technological, psychological and information-behaviour factors, all of which should be seen as essential to an understanding of relevant adolescent behaviours. Where such an approach is taken, its quantitative methodology tends to define it as descriptive and associative, contributing valuable observatory data but perhaps not as useful in delineating the ‘why’ of use of specific technological tools within specific social/informational contexts. It is interesting to note that, in the media-based work of boyd and Donath [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0165551512453381">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0165551512453381">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0165551512453381">18</xref>] or the IB-based work of Pettigrew [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0165551512453381">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0165551512453381">12</xref>], the linking of media use with its social context is indicated, and the great difficulty of understanding one without the other is noted; and that the linking – the interdependence – of two of the elements is present in much recent literature generated within psychology (in that case, the nature of social relationships with identity formation and healthy human development). It was decided that an open-ended, interview-based study could provide a snapshot of this social group, outside of the lenses typically provided in this literature, and including aspects of social performance and affordances not typically considered together. Such an approach was adopted as a means of identifying future directions for inquiry, both in terms of the social performances facilitated by FB use, and the meaning of specific communicative channels to FB participants.</p>
</sec>

<sec id="section6-0165551512453381" sec-type="methods">
<title>3. Methodology</title>
<p>The study was intended to take a direct look at SM use of those adolescents available to us, in order to truly ‘understand the experience of [these] others’ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0165551512453381">23</xref>, p. 434], as it reflects their relationships with their friends and peers, and as it is facilitated by SNs. This orientation reflects the way in which we want to ‘know’ about adolescents, in order to guide further study. It reflects the premise that SM use among adolescents, enlisted in the service of relationship-facilitation within specific interactions, can best be understood within the contexts of social interaction and patterns of information behaviour, and should be keyed to a greater extent to the specific social contexts in which it occurs. Interviews are intentionally open-ended, to allow the participants themselves to define those contexts and social purposes, avoiding as often as possible the making of assumptions or the categorization of ‘adolescents’ or ‘adolescence’. The open-ended, in-depth interview was in fact chosen as an instrument in the current study in an attempt to reduce as much as possible the preconceptions of the interviewer with respect to attitudes towards ‘adolescents’.</p>
<p>Grounded theory – and theoretical sampling – provided the most relevant methodological frame for this kind of exploratory work, intended to examine broad perimeters and potential ranges of behaviour. As Sutton [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0165551512453381">24</xref>] indicated in his influential commentary on qualitative research, so-called ‘second order constructs’ (statements of theory through which observation is filtered in quantitative work) should not overshadow – or over interpret – the ‘first order’ data comprising direct observations (p. 418). Qualitative, even ethnographic orientation was considered since, within that work, there are no ‘outliers’ but rather ‘cases’ and ‘incidents’, each of which contributes to an understanding that is always in process.</p>
<sec id="section7-0165551512453381">
<title>3.1. Participants</title>
<p>All 21 participants for our study were seniors at a suburban high school in New York State, 18 or close to an 18th birthday, and accepted for college. At the time of the study the median age of the community was 59, and the median household income above $80,000. Over 90% of town residents are white and college graduates, and median home value is over $600,000. Some 79% of resident commuters use cars rather than an available rail system. A significant percentage of students of driving age own or have use of a family car. The community is small, and ethnically and culturally homogeneous. The high school itself has a population of 1000, with over 95% graduating and attending a 2- or 4-year college. Although the community has certainly felt the effects of the recent recession, with significant home depreciations and job losses, it remains nevertheless an enclave of relative prosperity, privilege, safety and seclusion.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0165551512453381">
<title>3.2. Procedure</title>
<p>The study was carried out in May 2011. Participants were interviewed about their use of SM in general and FB in particular. The interviews were carried out individually (<italic>N</italic> = 11), in two groups of two (<italic>N</italic> = 4) and in two groups of three (<italic>N</italic> = 6). As seniors, all participants have between one and three periods, each 45 minutes in length, per academic day during which they are unscheduled or ‘free’ – to be with friends and classmates in the cafeteria, the commons (a combined cafeteria and social space) or the learning commons. Although most participants were 18, all were required to acquire parental permission, as per the district Superintendent, who engenders and actively supports close communication between school and home. Respondents each received a $10 payment, though most expressed intrinsic willingness to participate. FB proved the most efficient way of communicating with study participants: although the interviews were set up FtF, messaging reminders to the group yielded the greatest number of timely responses and on-time appearances.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0165551512453381">
<title>3.3. The Interviews</title>
<p>Questions were open-ended, and designed to have a relatively low ‘invasive’ quotient, and participants were forthcoming and trusting in their responses. Participants interviewed who were friends – whether casual or intimate – were more willing to talk freely about their SM usage than were those who were unaccustomed to spending time together. There was no point at which participants declined to answer questions.</p>
<p>A wiki facilitated the sharing and interpretation of data, including notes, synopses and audio recordings. The divergent nature of FB, and the patterned ways in which it is operationalized with respect to hierarchies of associates, emerged as a focus during a pre-test of the initial question set. Questions were added in response to gather additional information on these emerging themes. The small size of the group studied, and the intention of three researchers to follow threads begun by 21 participants, inevitably identified a very broad range of concerns and behaviours: those noted, however, were the most suggestive to emerge.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0165551512453381" sec-type="discussion">
<title>4. Discussion</title>
<p>Interviews revealed a significant range and diversity of FB use, within a group of generally enthusiastic and committed users. Two participants were prohibited by parents from becoming members until college, and felt at a significant social disadvantage as a result. One member, who labelled FB ‘a blight on humanity’, nevertheless updated photos and status, and enjoyed seeing his messages increase until he finally checked them, when they numbered over 100. Friends groups ranged from 50 to 3700. Available site features were known to most users, but those best known and most frequently used – status updates, wall posts and chat – were used across a range of purposes and investments of personal time. Participants whose friend groups numbered over 400 reported a high level of comfort with FB – its communicative capabilities as well as its inherent risks. Female participants paid more attention to means of ensuring privacy than males, but all considered FB a generally safe, ‘user friendly’ and intuitive tool, particularly those who self-identified as members of a ‘wired’ or ‘net’ generation.</p>
<p>Participants chose from a menu of available communicative modes and features, within and in addition to FB, creating meaningful categorizations of associates in terms of the way in which communication was accomplished. (This process is not necessarily explicit: several participants were surprised to notice that they did in fact vary their means of communication according to the closeness or type of association.) One respondent, for example, has a single best friend from a much less stable household with whom he spends most of his free time. The two only talk FtF, regarding that as the most suitable medium for their level of intimacy. Texting is reserved by this participant for a group of four ‘best friends,’ two boys and two girls, with whom he both attends classes and ‘parties’. There is a group of six additional friends with whom he is ‘somewhat close’, and he uses the FB ‘chat’ feature almost exclusively to communicate with girls in order to explore potential romantic associations within his widest circle of associates.</p>
<p>Another participant has a small group of three friends with whom she is very close: through their association with her, two friends have become very close to each other [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0165551512453381">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0165551512453381">26</xref>]. She ‘chats’ with these same-sex friends, and will use the FB ‘message’ feature only to connect with a larger both-sex group of 20 with whom she plans impromptu social get-togethers, seeing this as more ‘formal’ – more appropriate for presenting herself to a group of others, even relatively good friends. She does not augment FB affordances with any others (Twitter, gaming, music etc.).</p>
<p>A third participant is extremely close to an older sister at college, and considers her a ‘very best’ friend. He calls her exclusively. In addition, there is a ‘local’ group of four best friends: these are the only people he will text. FB is augmented by Xbox use: the ‘make a party’ feature allows him to interact with other less intimate acquaintances playing at the same time.</p>
<p>A fourth participant, with over 400 FB friends and a commitment to keeping status updated on a daily basis, nevertheless used IM or texting, ‘depending upon the group’, implying a relationship between the closeness of the connection and the channel believed to be the most appropriate for that type of relationship. Another, also with a large group of FB friends, said that he ‘always texts the same group of people all the time’, and uses Xbox as a conduit for social interaction around games played. Others participants describe ‘poking’ ‘the same six people all the time’, using text messaging only to see if a contact was free to talk over the phone, or with texting a phatic communicative opening gambit: ‘hey, where are you?’</p>
<p>All those respondents asked thus described ‘friends’ groups divisible into a number of distinct subgroups, each with its own clearly articulated style and mode of communication. Students have ‘intimates’ – ‘very best friends’ (<italic>N</italic> = 1−4), almost exclusively same-gender; they have an incrementally larger group, sometimes characterized as ‘slightly-less-close-than-very-best-friends’ with whom they ‘hang’ as a discrete group most frequently, either in school or afterwards and at weekends, attending school functions, seeing films or eating in the local restaurant (<italic>N</italic> = 3$\!$−$\!$4). This group is also primarily same-gender. A third tier consists of associates corresponding most closely to an accepted definition of ‘peers’ – FtF friends drawn from among current and former classmates, club co-members and teammates, whose bonding over past experiences forms the basis for ongoing communication. This group is more closely divided into male and female members.</p>
<p>A fourth group, representing the accumulation of a range of associations made in the course of 10 years of classes, vacations, camp attendance and camping trips, exchange programmes, and recreational travel, represents the main body of the ‘friends’ groups. This group tends to be most evenly divided between genders, and have the greatest variability – in size, geographic definition and degree of familiarity. It is within this group that social capital is thought to accrue most directly, and that includes the most ‘weak ties’ including those at a physical or associational distance. It is important to note that although the intent of the study was not to investigate the effect of the school setting on either participants’ social behaviour or their FB use, the nature of this particular community, into which culturally homogeneous families moved with small children and in which they remained over decades, is productive of cohorts with numerous close associations of long standing, many of which are in fact school-based. Thus, most of the participants have known each other since before the beginning of their formal schooling, in a range of contexts, and show both considerable overlap in terms of the groups with whom they associate, and a distinct degree of congruence between school friends and out-of-school friends. And for many, phone conversations remained the preferred way to carry on a meaningful conversation with close friends. It was in fact almost exclusively reserved for that purpose, with texting or messaging then utilized for brief or formal communications with non-intimates.</p>
<p>Chat is used extensively as a forum for ‘interaction’ within this latter, broad category/range of friends, with ‘interaction’ defined as exchanging topical information, jokes, links, and references to common activities or mutual friends. Interactions encompass ‘casual’ approaches to friends desired as romantic partners, and opportunities to update relationships with friends not recently encountered face-to-face. It is interesting to reflect that this group represents both a pool of potential significant others and a network of associations perhaps intended to appeal to – be attractive to – potential significant others. FB ‘chat’ was also used consistently by a number of respondents when they wished to avoid FtF contact.</p>
<p>Use of the Group feature varied considerably – from intimate family-based communication to highly populated prom groups devoted to acquiring tickets and choosing dresses. FB ‘groups’ perhaps tend to be those not composed of intimates: groups with whom one might wish to put a best social foot forward (prom dress or college), or from whom one might want to keep more frank descriptions of daily activities (families). Many participants did not use the Group feature at all, and several used it infrequently.</p>
<p>The participant who had acquired 3700 ‘friends’ is interesting in terms of the ways in which she both conforms to and deviates from commonly held beliefs about ‘norms’ of FB use. The time this user spends on FB, in contact with these friends, is inevitably extensive. Although the enormous size and global distribution of friends might imply low privacy settings – to maintain maximum exposure and thus maximum attractiveness to sought-after ‘others’ – this is not the case. A first name is paired with a descriptive verb, and wall and photos are locked. The participant has an exclusive significant other, and eschews solicitations by members of the opposite sex. The participant convincingly explains that all contacts are either FtF connections (about 1000) or the friends of friends, with one additional degree of remove permitted to exist in certain cases. In these, potential ‘friends’ must share at least one highly trusted social tie. The user is, perhaps, to be regarded as that excellent ethnographic informant whose breadth and depth of experience affords significant understanding and insight.</p>
<p>Most interesting about this participant’s FB use is, however, not its vast geographical and numerical scope, but its social context and purpose, and clear delineation of associative subgroups, clearly identifiable from the communicative mode used within FB. Family members receive typically joking or disparaging references to family interactions, and school friends are engaged over school activities. The Friends group perhaps provides a window into a globally-distributed culture of adolescence, characterized by exotically styled hair and dress and subtle references to ambiguous sexuality and violence, suggestive of a connection to global youth culture and the indigenization of youth culture constructed around Japanese Manga and anime [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0165551512453381">27</xref>, p. 297; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0165551512453381">28</xref>, pp. 243–245]. They also tended to quote intimates’ remarks, many of which were slang-based, and referenced private events. Although this participant’s use of FB is divergent within the local context, it can plausibly be investigated in terms of the online social ‘supernets’ predicted by Donath [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0165551512453381">18</xref>]. In spite of its singularity, it presents patterns of distinct types and content of communication related to social distance and social purpose consistent with that of other participants.</p>

<title>5. Conclusions and directions for further research</title>
<p>The evidence produced by the interviews clearly indicates a fluent integration of social purpose and technological tool; of FtF and online interactions within all relevant contexts (familial, educational, friendship performance and social role). Although an extensive literature across several disciplines documents the importance of SM – including SNs – in the lives and social functioning of adolescents, the great variety of use revealed within our small group of participants has not been reflected in the literature. Also, many of the specific ways in which FB features are operationalized within social relationships, and augmented by affordances offered by other SM, are not found in the literature. Interviews confirmed that SN members tend primarily to friend FtF contacts, but showed that they did accept unknown others, in particularized circumstances and after an individualized but still strict ‘vetting’ process. Interviews revealed participants’ achievement of a sophisticated balance between privacy settings, identity protection and self-disclosure that reflects their understandings of the risks associated with FB use, their ability to shape self-presentation pro-actively, and their recognition of FB as a social necessity. There was also evidence of significantly increased social energy facilitated by FB group membership around events of local interest that suggests an evolving conceptualization of social performance and group membership.</p>
<p>Quantitative work has addressed descriptions of use and associations of functionality with general intention, and introduced a number of theoretical frames within which to consider its use, but the distinct, personal patterns of use – correlations between specific devices and components of SM and specific social intent – that are reflective of social relationships, and can be framed within what Cheung et al. delineate as ‘We-Intention’, have not been part of these descriptions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0165551512453381">21</xref>]. The observed integration of social purpose with technological affordance supports the contention that additional scholarship is required that adopts a transdisciplinary and descriptive context, perhaps redefining a domain and a discourse around this intersection of traditionally separate elements of behavioural and developmental psychology, information behaviour and SM. Indeed, the need to develop empirical models for the establishment of broad theoretical constructs within which more descriptive, ethnographic work can be framed has been noted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0165551512453381">22</xref>]. Further qualitative investigation of adolescents’ contextualized use of affordances and features within social interaction, such as the one described here, seems necessary to provide the ‘why’ to the proposed ‘how’ of quantitative research.</p>
<p>As is most characteristically the case with grounded theory and qualitative research, a number of questions have arisen as a result of the study, several of which provide direction for additional investigation. How do we account for what seems an intricate variability in SM implementation, and what does this intricacy tell us about the relationships in which they are set? Are today’s adolescents, variously characterized in terms of their level of integration of computer-mediated communication into their social life, most relevantly or most functionally so characterized? Do the discourses that traditionally adhere to adolescence distort the ways in which we characterize their use of SM, and is there evidence to be found within that usage of more accurate and useful ways to define – or redefine – that particular stage of life?</p>
<p>SM participants’ patterns of use and associations of affordances with intent are recognized by the adolescent participants themselves as such, and are understood as meaningful – if reflexive – and highly charged symbolic tools for delineating personal hierarchies of associations within their friendship/peer performance. As Ahn notes, ‘technology alone cannot be hypothesized to affect human outcomes’ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0165551512453381">2</xref>, p. 125], and any attempt to describe adolescents’ behaviour with respect to technology must be framed within social interaction. Individuals of this age group will strive, whatever the technological tools at hand, to develop and tend a ‘tree of friends’ with all its diverging branches – within the stories of their lives. All of the affordances of Smartphones, SM and Web 2.0, variously understood and variously employed, are deeply embedded in a functional social system, both reflective of and determinative of the social identities and communication modalities of succeeding generations of students, workers and scholars. These patterns of social integration, information behaviour and embedded utilization of personalized, intricately differentiated affordances of SM will certainly impact the social and cultural realities that these participants – and the generational cohort they represent – will inherit and shape.</p>
