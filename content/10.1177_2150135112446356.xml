<abstract>
<p>Coagulation factor deficiencies may predispose patients with functionally univentricular hearts to bleeding tendencies preoperatively and perioperatively. Postoperatively, this is altered to a prothrombotic predisposition in these patients. Early and late thromboembolic events secondary to a prothrombotic state following univentricular repair contribute to significant morbidity after establishment of the Fontan circulation. Anticoagulation following univentricular repair is advocated but its benefits are controversial.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Functionally univentricular heart is a term used to refer to nonseptatable hearts with congenital cardiac malformations. A number of cardiac lesions are recognized as univentricular in the recent Congenital Heart Surgery Nomenclature and Database Project.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2150135112446356">1</xref>
</sup> Fontan's operation was devised on the assumption that the right ventricle (as driving force for the pulmonary circulation) is dispensable. Four decades after introduction of the Fontan circulation, early outcomes have improved and the operative mortality has steadily declined to 5% or less.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2150135112446356">2</xref>
</sup> Long-term problems, however, continue to contribute to late failure of the Fontan circulation. Thromboembolic complications are the most common and are reported in as many as one third of this cohort. Of these, spontaneous resolution of thrombus has been observed in less than half and about one fourth (25%) had lethal cerebrovascular events (CVEs) on long-term follow-up.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2150135112446356">3</xref>
</sup> The cumulative rate of thromboembolism is cited at 3.9 per 100 patient-years in patients not receiving prophylactic anticoagulation post-Fontan.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2150135112446356">4</xref>
</sup> Investigation of this entity led to the discovery of a procoagulant state post-Fontan. We review the literature to evaluate the hematologic alterations seen in the pre-Fontan state and the explanation for the procoagulant state that exists in post-Fontan patients. A brief discussion of the current status of antithrombotic prophylaxis is also presented.</p>

<title>Coagulation Cascade: Virchow's Triad and General Mechanisms</title>
<p>Virchow postulated that three factors are essential for the generation of a blood clot. These are recognized as Virchow's triad and include endothelial cell injury, turbulent blood flow, and clotting factor abnormalities. The endothelial injury leads to the generation of tissue thromboplastin (extrinsic pathway) or activates factor XII (intrinsic pathway) to initiate a coagulation cascade.</p>
<p>The intrinsic and extrinsic pathways are depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-2150135112446356">Figure 1</xref>. Three steps are essential for the generation of a blood clot in either of these cascades.</p>

<title>Formation of Prothrombin Activator Complex</title>
<p>The coagulation cascade is initiated by generation of prothrombin activator in either intrinsic or extrinsic pathways. The extrinsic pathway begins with vascular trauma and damages the surrounding tissues. The intrinsic pathway is initiated in the blood itself. A series of plasma proteins (β-globulins) play a major role in both the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways along with the blood clotting factors. The blood clotting factors are proteolytic enzymes that are present in their inactive forms. These are converted to their active forms (in the presence of certain cofactors) which have enzymatic actions leading to successive reactions in the clotting process.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-2150135112446356">
<title>The Extrinsic Pathway</title>
<p>Three basic steps involved in the formation of prothrombin activator in the extrinsic mechanism include:</p>
<list list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>Release of tissue thromboplastin: Phospholipids from the tissue membranes and a lipoprotein complex constitute tissue thromboplastin which contains an important glycoprotein that functions as a proteolytic enzyme.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Formation of activated factor X: Tissue thromboplastin complexes with factor VII, in the presence of tissue phospholipids and calcium ions to act enzymatically on factor X to form activated factor X.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Formation of prothrombin activator: Activated factor X complexes with phospholipids (released from platelets or as a part of tissue thromboplastin) and factor V to form prothrombin activator.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-2150135112446356">
<title>The Intrinsic Pathway</title>
<list list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>Factor XII activation: Trauma to blood or exposure of blood to vascular wall collagen activates factor XII along with damage to platelets, releasing platelet phospholipids containing platelet factor 3.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Factor XI activation: Activated factor XII proteolyses factor XI in the presence of high molecular weight kininogen and prekallikrein to generate activated factor XI.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Factor IX activation: Activated factor XI acts enzymatically on factor IX in the presence of ionized calcium to generate its activated form.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Factor X activation: Activated factor IX proteolytically cleaves factor X in the presence of factor VIII and calcium to generate its activated form.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Formation of prothrombin activator: Activated factor X requires ionized calcium and factor V to generate prothrombin activator complex from platelet phospholipids and platelet factor 3.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>The prothrombin activator complex thus generated in either of the pathways cleaves prothrombin to thrombin in the presence of ionized calcium as a cofactor. Thrombin, once generated, has a positive feedback effect in accelerating the entire process acting via factor V. As explained above, fibrinogen is cleaved to fibrin by thrombin which along with platelets and plasma forms a blood clot.</p>

<title>Developmental Hemostasis</title>
<p>The coagulation system of a neonate will mature and continue to develop over the next 6 to 12 months of life, which coincides with the time in which the procoagulant factors will attain adult values.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2150135112446356">5</xref>
</sup> This phenomenon is recognized as developmental hemostasis. Bleeding is a significant problem after cardiac surgical procedures in pediatric patients. In addition to the presence of complex reconstructions and extensive suture lines, multiple coagulation factor abnormalities contribute to increased blood losses. There are data in the literature to suggest various age-related factors and lesion-specific pathophysiologies that may lead to inadequate hemostasis.</p>
<p>Both the procoagulant and anticoagulant factors are present in reduced concentrations in infants when compared with reference values for the same factors in children and adults. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-2150135112446356">Table 1</xref> emphasizes the gradual increase with age that is noted in the levels of various factors essential to coagulation. Also various tests are available to a clinician to evaluate the two clotting pathways as screening for any abnormality preoperatively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-2150135112446356">Table 2</xref>). In addition, direct factor assays are also available.</p>

<p>Although normal platelet counts have been noted in neonates, lower concentrations of various clotting factors integral to both extrinsic and intrinsic coagulation pathways (specifically II, V, VIII, IX, X, antithrombin III [ATIII], and proteins C and S) have been noted compared with age-matched controls in infants with two-ventricle congenital heart disease, similar to those described in patients with single-ventricle physiology (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-2150135112446356">Table 3</xref>). Kern et al noted significantly lower fibrinogen levels in neonates pre-bypass which deteriorated to critically low levels post-bypass and contributed to postpump bleeding.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2150135112446356">8</xref>

</sup> In a subsequent study, they assayed coagulation factors in 36 infants with single-ventricle cardiac defects (before they underwent bidirectional Glenn procedure) and compared them with 34 age-matched healthy infants. Concentrations of protein C, factors II, V, VII, IX, X, plasminogen, fibrinogen, and ATIII were significantly lower in pre-Glenn infants with single-ventricle cardiac defects (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001). In their study, ventricular dysfunction was a significant predictor of multiple coagulation abnormalities.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2150135112446356">7</xref>

<title>Functionally Univentricular Pathophysiology</title>
<p>Data have been published in literature indicative of an association between increased bleeding and pathophysiology of the single-ventricle lesions.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2150135112446356">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2150135112446356">8</xref>
</sup> The etiology, as to whether the unbalanced coagulation system abnormalities are linked to any functional disturbances in clotting mechanisms as a result of physiological changes imposed by the single-ventricle circulation is yet to be conclusively proved. Preoperative cyanosis associated with these lesions in itself exacerbates bleeding tendency. Reduced platelet function, increased fibrinolysis, and decreased absolute amounts of clotting factors are caused by polycythemia (decreased plasma volumes and decreased absolute concentrations of clotting factors) secondary to cyanosis. It has been shown that platelet microparticles (MPs) are overproduced in patients with polycythemia secondary to hypoxia in cyanotic congenital heart disease. Probably, the sheer stress derived from blood hyperviscosity leads to increased production of the platelet MPs positive for surface antigen (glycoprotein IIb/IIIa) specific to platelets. Platelet-derived MPs have been identified as a sensitive variable of platelet activation.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2150135112446356">10</xref>
</sup> The generation of platelets MPs positively correlates with hematocrit values and is markedly increased at values above 60%. Shear stress that increases in proportion to blood viscosity is an important stimulus for MP production. Horigome and colleagues have shown that MPs decrease after phlebotomy in association with a reduction in hematocrit. Also, the platelet aggregation response to adenosine diphosphate (ADP) significantly correlates inversely with hematocrit, further lending support to the existence of a hypocoagulable state in patients with cyanotic congenital heart disease and the role played by secondary polycythemia in it.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2150135112446356">11</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Shibata and colleagues generated a transgenic mouse line with a hematocrit of 85% due to constitutive overexpression of human erythropoietin in an oxygen-independent manner. Significantly increased bleeding times were noted in transgenic animals. Computerized thromboelastography revealed reduced thrombus formation with increasing age from one to eight months in transgenic mice. Increasing erythrocyte concentrations inhibited thrombus formation reversibly and prolonged clot development times due to mechanical interference secondary to hyperviscosity. It was noted that plasma coagulation activity was significantly decreased.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2150135112446356">12</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>We believe that cyanosis is central to the genesis of coagulation and fibrinolytic defects seen preoperatively in functionally univentricular heart patients. As elucidated above, thrombocytopenia, qualitative platelet defects, and clotting factor deficiencies are common in such patients. These positively correlate with arterial oxygen desaturation and level of secondary erythrocytosis seen in such patients.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-2150135112446356">13</xref>
</sup> In our own experience (Z.M., R.S., unpublished data, 2009-2010), the incidence of central nervous system (CNS) bleeding in hypercyanotic children undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) is significantly higher than in children with hematocrits &lt;70% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-2150135112446356">Figure 2</xref>). We have started conducting a full coagulation profile in this subset of patients preoperatively and have frequently noted defects in bleeding time, clot retraction, prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), and activated clotting time (ACT). We consider 70% hematocrit as the tipping point at which the balance shifts in favor of hypocoagulability, increasing bleeding risk, and use it in our practice to profile these patients. Various methods have been advocated to reduce hematocrit ranging 50% to 60% in order to improve the platelet counts and platelet aggregation preoperatively.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2150135112446356">11</xref>
</sup> This can be achieved by multiple therapeutic phlebotomies or exchange transfusions a few days prior to surgery. However, the advantage is often lost if patients are hemodynamically unstable or the surgery is delayed since these patients have shortened platelet survival times.</p>

</fig>
<p>In our practice, we prefer to transfuse fresh frozen plasma (FFP) to such patients prior to heparinization for CPB in the operating room if their hematocrit is &gt;70% and ACT is deranged (&gt;250 seconds). Our experience with this strategy includes 15 recent patients over the span of one year who satisfied the criteria of hematocrit &gt;70% and ACT outside the normal range prior to heparinization for a Fontan procedure or superior cavopulmonary anastomosis. All these patients were transfused FFP and a decrease in ACT was observed prior to heparinization. The results are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-2150135112446356">Figure 2</xref>.

<title>Post-Fontan Prothrombotic State</title>
<p>The concept of coagulation factor abnormalities in children after Fontan procedure was originally described by Cromme-Dijkhuis and colleagues in 1990.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-2150135112446356">14</xref>
</sup> Using two cross-sectional surveys, the authors described multiple coagulation factor abnormalities in 19 patients which in their report resolved as the duration of follow-up lengthened.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2150135112446356">15</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Jahangiri et al evaluated the coagulation profile of 14 patients undergoing the Fontan procedure. They noted a significant increase in the concentration of factor VIII (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001), factor X (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001), and prothrombin (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001). The ATIII (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001), protein C (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .004), and protein S (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .02) were found to be significantly decreased on postoperative day five. Increased levels of factors VIII and X were persistent at four years postoperatively.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-2150135112446356">16</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>In both these studies, the authors do not describe the sources of their reference ranges. The normal ranges quoted are adult reference ranges and hence are not applicable to the pediatric population. Lack of validation with age-matched normal controls or patients’ preoperative values as control is a major pitfall of these studies. Interestingly, six patients in the Cromme-Dijkhuis series had higher thrombin–antithrombin(TAT) complexes than the age appropriate reference range. This was suggestive of a prothrombotic state post-Fontan.</p>
<p>Procelewska et al prospectively evaluated the coagulation profile of 80 patients who underwent Hemi-Fontan and Fontan procedures and their associations with liver function and hemodynamic variables.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-2150135112446356">17</xref>
</sup> The authors found that the concentration of factor VII, ATIII, fibrinogen, and prothrombin was significantly decreased on the first postoperative day and increased on the fifth postoperative day following both types of procedures. Single-ventricle function, arterial partial pressure of oxygen (Pa<sc>o</sc>
<sub>2</sub>), and central venous pressure (CVP) were significant predictors of factor VIII, factor VII, ATIII, and prothrombin concentrations in the Fontan subgroup. Temporary liver dysfunction was more pronounced after the Fontan procedure. The authors attributed increased risk of postoperative thromboembolic events in these patients to elevated factor VIII levels and hemodynamic changes brought about as a consequence of the Fontan circulation. Factor VIII levels above 150% of normal values occurred in more than one third of patients in the Fontan group on the first and fifth postoperative day. Also children with decreased ventricular function post-Fontan had higher factor VIII levels.</p>
<p>Odegard et al prospectively evaluated coagulation factor abnormalities and hemodynamic variables in 20 children who underwent Fontan procedures and compared them with 24 healthy age-matched controls 3.7 years postoperatively.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2150135112446356">9</xref>
</sup> They found that the concentrations of protein C, factors II, V, VII, X, plasminogen, and ATIII were significantly lower in Fontan patients (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .01). Factor VIII was significantly elevated in 35% of Fontan patients (n = 6) postoperatively and 34% of these (n = 2) had a thromboembolic complication. Higher superior vena cava (SVC) pressure was predictive of elevated factor VIII levels.</p>
<p>These data are indicative of an increased tendency toward coagulation post-Fontan. Increased factor VIII levels coupled with reduced ATIII support a prothrombotic state.</p>
<p>Physiologically, the Fontan circulation generates increased systemic venous pressure that can lead to hepatic dysfunction, development of large venous collaterals, and systemic hypoperfusion. Turbulent flow in the Fontan circuit as time progresses can generate shear forces. Effectively, all three conditions of Virchow triad are satisfied, namely loss of endothelial cell function, low velocity and nonlaminar blood flow in the Fontan circuit, and abnormal clotting factor levels generating a hypercoagulable state postoperatively (compared with hypocoagulable state preoperatively).</p>

<sec id="section9-2150135112446356">
<title>Thromboembolic Events Post-Fontan</title>
<p>Thromboembolic events are a source of major morbidity after Fontan procedures, with an incidence ranging between 7% and as high as 33% in some series.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-2150135112446356">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-2150135112446356">19</xref>
</sup> The reported mortality associated with post-Fontan thromboembolism has been reported to be as high as 25%. Satisfying the conditions of Virchow triad, the increased risk of thromboembolism in this setting can be attributed to hemodynamic factors, presence of prosthetic material (used to fashion extracardiac Fontan conduits or atrial tunnels), and coagulation factor level abnormalities. Thrombin is recognized as an important contributor to this state; its role in platelet aggregation and formation of fibrin threads which stabilize the fragile structure of a thrombus is central to the pathogenetic mechanism. Reduced ATIII levels indirectly facilitate thrombin’s action by quantitatively tilting the balance in favor of coagulation.</p>
<p>Increased systemic venous pressures and hepatic congestion affect the synthesis of vitamin K-dependent proteins in the liver. Protein C is a physiological anticoagulant. It is a vitamin K-dependent serine protease that, after activation, inhibits the coagulation cascade. Protein C is activated in a sequence that starts with protein C and thrombin binding to a cell surface protein thrombomodulin. The activated form, along with protein S, inhibits factor Va and factor VIIIa. Proteins C and S deficiencies (inherited or acquired secondary to post-Fontan state) create a prothrombotic state, further increasing the risk of thromboembolic events.<sup>

<title>Thromboprophylaxis After Fontan Operation</title>
<p>Currently, most pediatric cardiac surgical units prescribe prophylactic thromboprophylaxis with either aspirin or warfarin for varying duration post-Fontan. However, there is a lack of consensus on relative efficacy of these approaches including the dose and duration of prophylaxis.</p>
<p>Kaulitz et al retrospectively reviewed 142 surviving patients post-Fontan with a mean follow-up of 91 months. Of these, 86 patients received prophylactic aspirin, 11 received warfarin, and 45 received no anticoagulation. The overall thrombotic event rate in this study group was 7% with a stroke rate<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-2150135112446356">18</xref>
</sup> of 1.4%. Although thrombus formation in all these patients was associated with at least one predisposing factor, such as prolonged immobilization, protein losing enteropathy, anastomotic stenosis of Fontan circuit, or atrial arrhythmia, no conclusive statistical correlations could be shown. Although the authors believe that routine anticoagulation is not required in all patients undergoing Fontan, it is possible that their risk-stratified prophylactic anticoagulation strategy proved effective in reduction of thrombotic complications. The low number of late clinical events negates any useful statistical inferences.</p>
<p>Barker et al reviewed 402 patients who underwent Fontan palliation at the University of Michigan between 1975 and 1998.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-2150135112446356">22</xref>
</sup> Thirty-eight CVEs occurred in this cohort, with a total incidence of 9%. The incidence of primary post-Fontan CVE was 1.7%. The authors observed a protective effect of aspirin, although surprisingly no significant difference was noted between groups taking warfarin and no warfarin.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-2150135112446356">21</xref>
</sup> This is likely attributable to small numbers. The protective effect of some form of anticoagulation (even aspirin) has been highlighted by du Plessis et al and Day et al in their respective studies.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-2150135112446356">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-2150135112446356">24</xref>
</sup> Jacobs and colleagues have also reported on the effectiveness of long-term administration of aspirin in patients undergoing Fontan procedures.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-2150135112446356">25</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The results of the only multicenter prospective randomized trial comparing heparin/warfarin and aspirin as primary thromboprophylaxis two years post-Fontan were published by Monagle and colleagues.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-2150135112446356">26</xref>
</sup> In all, 111 eligible patients were randomized to receive either aspirin (n = 57; 5 mg/kg per d) or warfarin (n = 54; target international normalized ratio [INR]: 2-3) for two years post-Fontan. The overall thrombotic event rate was 19% after two years in patients who underwent Fontan surgery. There was no significant difference in number of thromboses (clinical/discovered by echo surveillance) or cumulative risk of thrombosis between patients randomized to either aspirin or warfarin prophylaxis. One patient had major bleeding in each group (statistically not significant). The relatively high cumulative thrombosis rate (23%) observed in these patients is not trivial and argues against the practicality of inclusion of a nontreatment limb in future clinical trials to evaluate the effectiveness of various antithrombotic strategies.</p>
<p>Late presentation of patients with cyanotic congenital heart disease is not uncommon in developing countries and children with hematocrits as high as 76% have been encountered in our practice. We concur that a postoperative thrombotic state exists in Fontan patients. However, it is still unclear whether certain parameters of coagulation profile or presence of some specific factors predispose to CVEs and stroke in particular. In our center, we prescribe low dose aspirin (5 mg/kg per d) to cavopulmonary anastomosis patients for life. Patients with extracardiac Fontan circuit receive warfarin prophylaxis and we aim to keep the INR between above 2.</p>

<p>A Turkish report cited 25% heterozygosity for factor V Leiden mutation in patients with congenital heart disease.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-2150135112446356">27</xref>
</sup> A significantly higher frequency of the deletion/deletion genotype of prothrombotic angiotensin 1 converting enzyme and a lower frequency of Thr/Thr genotype which predispose to increased risk of thrombosis have been found in these patients.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-2150135112446356">28</xref>
</sup> Angiotensin-converting enzyme cleaves the carboxyl end of angiotensin and degrades the vasodilator bradykinin. The deletion allele increases the angiotensin-converting enzyme levels and increases the risk of thrombosis. Thr/Thr genotype prevents thrombosis by preventing factor XIIIa-dependent cross-linking of fibrinogen. In addition, prothrombin G20210A and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase C677T are other single nucleotide mutations found in patients who developed severe thrombosis who had undergone cardiac surgery. Low concentrations of proteins C and S have been linked to thrombotic risk in children who undergo Fontan operations. One can hypothesize that probably an association exists between homocysteinemia and increased thrombotic risk in these patients. At present, there is no enough evidence to support the use of any genetic markers in a clinical setting to identify patients at an increased risk of thromboembolic complications post-Fontan.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Evidence that points to the existence of an antithrombotic state prior to and a prothrombotic state following cavopulmonary palliation of patients with functionally univentricular hearts raises severe therapeutic dilemmas. Unsuspected intraoperative hemorrhage in the heparinized state can be devastating if it occurs in the CNS. Postoperatively, the Fontan circulation is an abnormal state of sluggish, procoagulant circulation that can generate thrombi leading to premature attrition of the Fontan state. Further studies are needed to determine the factors that determine the thrombophilic propensity associated with the post-Fontan state. There is a lack of definitive data in the literature to conclusively support an association between postoperative thrombus formation and predisposing factors such as prolonged immobilization, cavopulmonary anastomotic stenosis, use of prosthetic material for Fontan circuit, protein losing enteropathy, and/or atrial arrhythmia. Currently, preoperative screening using genetic markers or above mentioned parameters (coagulation profile, ACT, Hematocrit) is not in use. In general, use of prophylactic antithrombotic therapy of some type is the rule. Since most of the studies have follow-up periods of less than ten years, it remains to be seen if the rate of thromboembolic events rises with increased follow-up times and whether there is sufficient evidence to justify lifelong anticoagulation in the post-Fontan state. Specifically, it remains to be seen if asymptomatic cardiac thrombi detected by echocardiographic surveillance, often reported in studies, will lead to an increased incidence of clinically significant thromboembolic events and/or affect neurological outcomes with long-term follow-up (&gt;10 years) as prolonged survival times are seen in this cohort with improving surgical outcomes.</p>
