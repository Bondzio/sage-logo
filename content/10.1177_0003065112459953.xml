<p>To the Editor:</p>
<p>I am indebted to Arnold Rothstein for calling attention to some crucial issues in my paper. I particularly appreciate the opportunity to address one of Brenner’s most respected students, rather than my constructed image of the theorist, which, after all, could conceivably be a straw man.</p>
<p>Rothstein refers to a suggestion of mine that, as completed, reads, “I think . . . the psychoanalytic term <italic>fantasy</italic> functions in the same way as <italic>compromise formation. Fantasy</italic> refers both to <italic>momentary</italic> phenomenology and to a <italic>fixed</italic> propensity for seeing and doing.” Here I was suggesting that one of Brenner’s principal devices for merging structure and phenomenology is a strategy shared by many current theories. It seems that Rothstein read this while thinking of <italic>fantasy</italic> in its phenomenological sense and <italic>compromise formation</italic> in its nonphenomenological sense, that is, as an abstract convenience in the theorist’s mind, used—he borrows Boesky’s words—“to organize our understanding of the observable data.” That’s why he supposes that I have failed to distinguish between these two levels of abstraction. But then, in the next sentence, we find him writing that “compromise formations are understood to generate both conscious and unconscious fantasies, as well as derivative actions.” Now, clearly, “a theoretic concept employed [by the theorist] to organize [his] understanding of the observable data” cannot <italic>generate</italic> anything in anybody (except the theorist), least of all “unconscious fantasies” and “derivative actions” in the patient.” (That was essentially Boesky’s point.) Here Rothstein obligingly offers an exhibit confirming one of my central arguments, namely, that <italic>compromise formation</italic> can be used in many different ways, as an abstraction, as an event, and as a movement. But whereas Rothstein warns me not to mix these levels of abstraction, I do not object to <italic>his</italic> doing so, since I can see how it lets the analyst, as a theorist, describe the mind in general, while, as a practitioner, he can approach the individual phenomena unbiased by ethically tinged structures that may look like warring “parties.” The ambiguity serves a purpose.</p>
<p>More disturbing to me is Rothstein’s assertion that “when Friedman employs ‘relative’ as a qualifier for objectivity, he is contradicting himself. Objectivity is an absolute term, as is subjectivity.” This proposition comports so poorly with grammar, logic, and the fundamental experience of human life that I struggle to fathom its current popularity. One might as well deny that there are degrees of temperature because things are either hot or cold. Everyone automatically appraises statements on a zillion levels of objectivity and subjectivity. Piaget has shown how children only gradually develop a “decentered” imagination, being visibly less objective when starting out in life. Infant observers are currently fascinated by the threshold children cross when they manage to position themselves in another’s mind. Nobody asks the delirious patient for directions to the exit; no more does one wander about aimlessly because he knows that “exit” has private associations for every informant. I know and respect Rothstein, and I would defend him against anyone who says that he does not try conscientiously to be as objective as he can in writing and teaching. What on earth motivates him—and many other quite reasonable people—to deny it? I can only think that practitioners feel so powerfully drawn by the analytic situation toward the role of mind reader and interpretation peddler that they require a hair shirt of epistemological humility to remind them of their simple humanity. If someone has spotted another motivation, I hope to learn of it.</p>
<p>Or am I being too ornery—reacting too literally to a too strongly phrased criticism? After all, our subject is not (merely) the physical world. In considering persons, hermeneutics rears its shaggy head. It must be granted that when therapists view patients, the relationship of objectivity to subjectivity is not all that simple. I don’t need lessons in this principle: Forty years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0003065112459953">Friedman 1973</xref>), I challenged the same misuses of the ego concept by psychotherapists that eventually worried Brenner and now concern Rothstein. But the meaning of objectivity does not rest on a simplified and idealized version of one particular “function” of the confused concept of the ego, least of all the “reality function” that offers the cheapest convenience for a therapist. Nor can the confusion of the term be resolved by simply trashing the ego basket with all its miscellaneous components. It’s no trick at all to spot those components popping up again with every new attempt to diagram a functioning mind. Perhaps Rothstein has seen the possibility that Brenner’s idea of compromise formation, combined with Boesky’s critical observation that there is no limit to the size or type of item that we might take as compromised within it, yields the rather simple formula that the mind always expresses all of itself in everything it does, with no intrinsic segregation of features, no “joints” to be “cut.” That comes very close to portraying the mind as a work of art, or (we might hope) a work in progress—something we can “analyze” in unlimited and unprescribable ways, with a good deal of subjectivity predominating. (This is, in fact, a theory held by some brilliant analysts.) With that in the back of his mind, Rothstein might be laying before me the challenge “Can anyone claim objectivity for his appreciation of a Vermeer?” (I would reply that this, too, is a more-or-less matter.) Since Brenner was consistent enough to deprive even the analyst of an ego, he may have been persuaded by Rothstein that treatment is an interaction of subjectivities. But most of us will find it hard to conjure up an image of Brenner applauding miscellaneous, inspired “takes” on a patient’s process.</p>
<p>Did I charge Brenner with <italic>undue</italic> pessimism about anything? Rothstein quotes me as complimenting Brenner on bringing us back to “Freud’s final, realistic pessimism.” If a casual reader missed the adjective and the context, I’m glad Rothstein is there to assure him that Brenner was in no way pessimistic about the power of psychoanalytic treatment. Anyone who knew Brenner knows that he was the last man to doubt the efficacy of properly conducted analytic treatment, which he believed to have been confirmed many times over. Indeed, it was exactly that empirical confidence that allowed Brenner to shrug his shoulders when asked for a theory of therapeutic action, and to disdain the usual, shuffling non-answers, such as “explaining” that treatment works by destabilizing pathological compromise formations. He did certainly think that that’s what happens, but it’s pretty much just repeating the happy outcome of treatment in the language of compromise formation, and he didn’t, as do so many others, rechristen his theory of the mind as a theory of therapeutic action. Nor was he willing to trade his liberation from the ego for a mess of transformative mechanisms. Patients are unhappy with their compromise formations, and these formations are evidently destabilized and reassembled by analysis in a way that’s somehow more satisfactory. That’s about it. There is a kind of conceptual pessimism in Brenner’s honest skepticism about explaining therapeutic action. But the particular pessimism I was referring to was the theory’s ultrarealistic limitation on dimensions of possible change, confined, as they are, to a reshuffling of oedipal compromise formations. (You will find no Enlightenment utopia in Brenner, no increasingly realistic view of the world.) We will forever live out our life in our original drama, regardless of the impact of later experience—an implication that haunts the model, if not the mood. In short, the pessimism I referred to was not any sort of personal or therapeutic discouragement in Brenner himself, but rather in the implication of the theory. Perhaps Brenner agreed with Rothstein that “successful analytic work enriches the mind’s creative capacities, lending them greater breadth and flexibility,” but I do not find in Brenner’s theoretical model any features corresponding to creative capacities, or breadth, or flexibility, while many such features were precisely what he excised from the theory he was remodeling. And it’s no oversight. I believe his aim was to relieve the practitioner of a normative mission (it used to be called “educative”), and if that meant forgoing encomiums to the human spirit and nicey-nice descriptions of the analyst’s gifts, well (I think Brenner would say), that is how an analyst attends to business.</p>
<p>I thank Rothstein for his attention to my labors, and for bringing to life the spirit of Brenner’s actual, personal legacy, something that a cut-and-dried theoretical explication like mine necessarily falls far short of.</p>
