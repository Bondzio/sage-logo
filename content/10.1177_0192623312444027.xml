<abstract>
<p>Fenoldopam, a dopaminergic DA1 agonist, induces vasodilatation via nitric oxide (NO), and this may be associated with mesenteric arterial injury. NO is produced from the enzymatic action of nitric oxide synthase (NOS), which is regulated by the shear-stress mediating protein caveolin-1. Profound vasodilatation and accompanied decreased shear are early events that could initiate vascular injury. Therefore, it is of interest to determine the role of caveolin-1 and the NO pathway in fenoldopam-induced vascular injury. At sites of fenoldopam-induced mesenteric arterial injury, decreased caveolin-1 expression and apoptosis were prominent immunohistochemical findings. An additional finding at these sites of injury were loss and/or reduced expression of caveolin-1 regulated structural proteins, connexin-43, (gap junction) ZO-1, and claudin (tight junctions). Because functional loss of caveolin-1 is associated with increased NOS activity and vasodilatation via NO, studies were conducted to show a NO donor produced vascular lesions in the mesenteric arteries morphologically similar to those induced by fenoldopam. Moreover, the incidence and severity of fenoldopam-induced vascular injury were reduced when an NOS inhibitor or a scavenger of NO-generated free radicals were coadministered with fenoldopam. Collectively, these data suggest that caveolin-1 and its regulated NO pathway may play an important role in vasodilatory drug-induced vascular injury.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Clinical development of novel life-saving therapies is often hindered because the nonclinical safety profiles of candidate drugs are associated with occult pathology that are not detected by noninvasive, routine clinical monitoring. In nonclinical safety studies, drug-induced vascular injury (DIVI) is an example of such a profile, because there are no biochemical markers for monitoring this lesion clinically and our understanding of the pathophysiology is limited. This type of vascular toxicity is most often associated with candidate drugs that are pharmacologically active in the vascular bed.  There are a number of drugs from different pharmacologic classes and chemical structures that have been approved for human use but are known to cause occult mesenteric or coronary arterial vascular lesions in animal studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0192623312444027">Albassam et al. 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0192623312444027">Chelly et al. 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0192623312444027">Gans et al. 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0192623312444027">Greaves 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0192623312444027">Joseph 2000</xref>; Kerns, Arena, Macia, et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0192623312444027">1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0192623312444027">Kerns, Arena, and Morgan 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0192623312444027">Kerns et al. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0192623312444027">Louden et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0192623312444027">Louden and Morgan 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0192623312444027">Mesfin et al. 1989</xref>). In dogs, understanding DIVI pathophysiology and potential mode of action has been aided by data describing a relationship between predisposed toxicity site/sites and the distribution, density, type, and ratio of vasoactive endothelin receptors in the heart and coronary arteries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0192623312444027">Louden et al. 2000</xref>). Additionally, the composite analysis of receptor subtype profiles, messenger RNA (mRNA) expression and regional blood flow measurements clearly supported the hypothesis that a disproportionate receptor distribution was responsible for the marked functional differences in regional blood flow at the affected sites of injury, the right atrium and right coronary arteries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0192623312444027">Chelly et al. 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0192623312444027">Louden et al. 2000</xref>). Collectively, these data in conjunction with other published reports strongly suggest that mechanistically, exaggerated pharmacology causing profound regional vasodilatation, increased regional blood flow and dysregulation of arterial tone are the basis for selective, site-specific, mesenteric, or coronary arterial damage in rats and dogs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0192623312444027">Chelly et al. 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0192623312444027">Joseph 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0192623312444027">Louden et al. 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Fenoldopam, a dopaminergic-1 agonist, mediates renal vasodilatation through the nitric oxide (NO) pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0192623312444027">Venkatakrishnan et al. 2000</xref>) and induces renal and mesenteric arterial lesion in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0192623312444027">Bugelski et al. 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0192623312444027">Yuhas et al. 1985</xref>). NO mediates the vasodilatation that can be induced by antagonism of endothelin receptors and/or opening of potassium ion channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0192623312444027">Kuhlmann et al. 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0192623312444027">Tirapelli et al. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0192623312444027">Yamaguchi et al. 2003</xref>). There is growing evidence that vascular injury may be a consequence of exaggerated pharmacology of receptors or ion channels that have downstream signaling activity in the nitric oxide synthase (NOS) pathway either directly or indirectly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0192623312444027">Kerns et al. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0192623312444027">Louden and Morgan 2001</xref>). It is possible that in drug-induced vascular injury, NO mediates the prolonged and sustained vasodilatation that causes dysregulation of arterial tone leading to arterial damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0192623312444027">Joseph et al. 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0192623312444027">Louden et al. 2000</xref>). Concomitantly, there is loss of regulation and control of key biochemical pathways in endothelial cells (EC) and smooth muscle cells (SMC), breakdown in cell-to-cell communications and ultimately, arterial wall damage.</p>
<p>Cav-1, the major structural protein of caveolae, is expressed within the vascular wall, specifically on the phenotypically anchored primary targets of drug-induced vascular injury EC and SMC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0192623312444027">Drab et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0192623312444027">Zhao et al. 2002</xref>). Within these cells, cav-1 is an important mediator of many signal transduction pathways including regulation of vascular tone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0192623312444027">Liu et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0192623312444027">Martens et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0192623312444027">Shaul and Anderson 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0192623312444027">Yu et al. 2004</xref>). Functionally, caveolae appear to be the focal point for compartmentalizing, organizing, and modulating signal transduction activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0192623312444027">Linder et al. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0192623312444027">Liu et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0192623312444027">Martens et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0192623312444027">Shaul and Anderson 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0192623312444027">Yu et al. 2004</xref>) for many receptors such as adenosine, dopaminergic-1, and endothelin, and enzymes including phosphodiesterase (PDE), NOS, and adenylyl cyclase. These and other proteins are regulated by cav-1. An example of this regulation is seen in mice with targeted gene disruption of cav-1. This induced genetic defect causes impairment of NOS, NO, and calcium signaling in the cardiovascular system causing aberrations in endothelium-dependent relaxation, contractility, and maintenance of vasculomyogenic tone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0192623312444027">Drab et al. 2001</xref>). Functionally, genetic loss of cav-1 was also associated with a 5-fold increase in systemic NO but no major changes in NOS expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0192623312444027">Drab et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0192623312444027">Zhao et al. 2002</xref>), suggesting that deregulation and/or hyperactivity of NOS was responsible for the massive increase in NO production. Collectively, these data suggest that cav-1 plays an important role in regulating NOS activity and potentially vascular tone. </p>
<p>Data from our previous studies reported loss of cav-1 in SMC and/or EC in DIVI (Brott, Jones, et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0192623312444027">2005</xref>; Brott, Gould et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0192623312444027">2005</xref>). Furthermore, studies in vitro showed loss of cav-1 was an early event that preceded SMC apoptosis/necrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0192623312444027">Brott, Jones, et al. 2005</xref>). Based on these data, we hypothesized that DIVI is mediated in part through the cav-1 regulated NO pathway and the principal objective of this study was to define and characterize the potential role of NO and components of the NO pathway in the development of DIVI.</p>

<sec id="section3-0192623312444027">
<title>Animals</title>
<p>Studies were approved by the institutional animal care and use committee (AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals, Wilmington, DE) and were designed to minimize clinical signs of toxicity. All studies were conducted in 8- to 10-week-old male Han Wistar rats (Charles River Laboratories Wilmington, MA). Rats were single housed, had free access to water, and fed a complete pelleted rodent diet. The testing facility is illuminated with a 12-hr light/dark cycle, and temperature, humidity, and air changes were controlled.</p>

<sec id="section4-0192623312444027">
<title>Test Preparation and Administration</title>
<p>Fenoldopam (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) as the mesylate salt was prepared as a 6 mg/ml solution in sterile 0.9% aqueous sodium chloride. Sodium nitroferricyanide (III) dihydrate (sodium nitroprusside; SNP; nitric oxide donor; Sigma), L-NAME (NOS inhibitor; Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI), and Tempol (extracellular superoxide dismutase [ecSOD] mimetic; EMD Biosciences, La Jolla, CA) were dissolved in sterile 20% (v/v) propylene glycol:80% (v/v) of 0.9% (w/v) sodium chloride. Saline (0.9% sodium chloride) was used as the test article vehicle control. All compounds were administered as continuous infusions using Harvard<sup>®</sup> minipumps.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0192623312444027">
<title>Study Design, Treatments (Infusion Studies)</title>
<p>Briefly, groups of rats (3–5/group) were administered fenoldopam, sodium nitroprusside, L-NAME or tempol at a rate of 0.3 mL/hr. In a pilot study, fenoldopam dosages of 1, 10, or 100 µg/kg/min were infused for 3, 6, 12, or 24 hr. From the pilot study, the dose (100 µg/kg/min) and infusion duration (24 hr) were selected for fenoldopam. For the NO donor sodium nitroprusside, dosages evaluated were 20, 50, 100, and 200 µg/kg/min; for L-NAME 50 and 200 µg/kg/min and for Tempol 500 µg/kg/min. In combination studies (fenoldopam +L-NAME or fenoldopam+Tempol), rats were pretreated with L-NAME and Tempol for at least 90 min before co-infusion with fenoldopam was initiated. In all studies, rats were subjected to a complete necropsy ∼26 hr post dose initiation.</p>

<sec id="section6-0192623312444027">
<title>Necropsy, Tissue Preparation</title>
<p>At necropsy the entire mesentery was dissected free from the viscera and prepared using the methods described by Newsholme et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0192623312444027">2000</xref>). The tissues were fixed in NBF (neutral buffered formalin, 10%) for all studies or ZF (zinc-buffered formalin fixative, Anatech Ltd., Battle Creek, MI) in the fenoldopam only study to allow immunohistochemistry staining. The NBF-fixed tissues were processed and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E). This method of preparation enabled microscopic evaluation to be standardized and optimized so that numerous profiles of variable sized mesenteric arteries could be examined. The severity of arterial lesions within the profiles were graded and scored as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0192623312444027">Slim et al. 2003</xref>).</p>

<p>The immunohistochemistry staining procedures were done using the Discovery XT system (Ventana Medical Systems Inc., Tucson, AZ). ZF-fixed tissues were processed and paraffin sections (5 µm) of mesenteric arteries from control and treated rats were immunostained for caveolin-1, activated caspase-3, tight junctions (ZO-1 and claudin), gap junctions (connexin 43), plasma proteins (von Willebrand Factor [VWF] and fibrinogen), nitrotyrosine (NT), and ecSOD.

<title>Fenoldopam-Induced Vascular Injury</title>
<p>Continuous intravenous infusion of fenoldopam was associated with macroscopic and microscopic vascular lesions 26 hr post dosing. The dose of 100 µg/kg/min consistently induced severe lesions in all rats (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0192623312444027">Table 1</xref>). Additionally, there was a dose–response in incidence and severity of vascular toxicity in rats administered 1, 10, and 100 µg/kg/min. Regardless of the dose, vascular lesions were only evident when fenoldopam was infused for more than 12 hr (data not shown). Briefly, the typical histologic appearance was segmental medial SMC necrosis/apoptosis with multifocal hemorrhage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0192623312444027">Figure 1</xref>). Positive staining for activated caspase-3 confirmed apoptosis of SMC at these sites of injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0192623312444027">Figure 2</xref>). Based on these data, continuous intravenous infusion of 100 µg/kg/min of fenoldopam for 24 hr was used to assess the potential role of the NO pathway in the initiation and development of fenoldopam-induced vascular injury. </p>

<title>Reduced Vascular Smooth Muscle Cell cav-1 in Vivo and in Vitro</title>
<p>From rats treated with vasculotoxic doses of fenoldopam, mesenteric arteries with histologic evidence of segmental medial hemorrhage and necrosis were evaluated immunohistochemically, to determine whether caveolin-1 was reduced at the specific sites of SMC damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0192623312444027">Figure 3</xref>). Within damaged mesenteric arteries, caveolin-1 immunoreactivity, used as an indicator of expression, was markedly reduced or absent only at the localized sites of SMC damage. Loss of immunoreactivity was segmental and confined to the focal areas of damage, while histologically normal arterial segments of SMC expressed caveolin-1 similar to unaffected or vehicle control arteries. Furthermore, caveolin-1 immunoreactivity in affected mesenteric arteries was linked to the severity of vascular damage with some variation in the intensity of immunoreactivity. Interestingly, in some damaged areas where necrosis was not apparent, there was reduced but not complete loss caveolin-1 immunoreactivity.</p>

<p>While these data suggest an association between DIVI and changes in SMC caveolin-1 expression, it is unknown if caveolin-1 loss is an early event that precedes SMC damage induced by fenoldopam and other <italic>in vivo</italic> vasculotoxicants.

Based on caveolin-1 ELISA analyses, there was a significant dose-related reduction in SMC caveolin-1 expression 6 hr post-treatment with IBMX and at this time point cell viability was not affected and caspase-3 activation was similar to untreated or vehicle control SMC. However, at 24 hr posttreatment, at high doses, reduced cell viability and caveolin-1 expression was accompanied by a significant increase in caspase-3 activation indicating SMC apoptosis and possible necrosis. At the intermediate dose at this time point, there was significant reduction in caveolin-1 with increased caspase-3 activation and no loss in cell viability. Interestingly, after 24 hr of treatment, the low dose of the PDE inhibitor was associated with a slight increase in caveolin-1 (not statistically significant) and caspase activation but with no loss of cell viability. Both fenoldopam and minoxidil<sup>®</sup> caused a similar response in caveolin-1 expression and apoptosis (Brott, Jones, et al. 2005).  </p>

<title>Caveolin-1 Loss Correlates with the Breakdown of Vascular Wall Integrity</title>
<p>Fenoldopam-induced mesenteric arterial injury is associated with excessive vasodilatation, extensive medial hemorrhage, and edema that indicates there is a breakdown in the structural integrity of the vessel wall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0192623312444027">Yuhas et al. 1985</xref>).

<p>Because gap and tight junctions are vital structures in the maintenance of vascular wall integrity, breakdown and/or functional loss of these proteins would lead to changes in the spatial relationship of the phenotypical anchoring cells within the vascular wall. As a result, there would be extravasation of red blood cells, edema, and leakage of plasma proteins all of which are early morphologic features of fenoldopam-induced vascular injury. This was confirmed when increased immunoreactivity to the plasma proteins von Willebrand Factor (VWF and fibrinogen were observed within the damaged vascular wall of mesenteric arteries from fenoldopam treated rats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0192623312444027">Figure 5</xref>). Taken together these data could suggest that the pathophysiological mode of action for fendoldopam-induced vascular injury may involve an interrelationship between caveolin-1 loss, sustained and prolonged NO mediated vasodilatation, functional loss of tight and gap junctions that results in subsequent breakdown in vascular wall integrity.</p>

<title>Evidence for Peroxynitrite as a Mediator of Fenoldopam-Induced Vascular Injury</title>
<p>Increased vascular NO can cause excess production of NO free radicals that leads to vascular SMC apoptosis, tissue injury, and vascular damage. Because fenoldopam-induced vasodilatation and potential vascular damage could be mediated through NO-derived oxidizing free radicals, it was of interest to determine the presence and spatial relationship of NT residues as a footprint of peroxynitrite at the sites of vascular injury induced by fenoldopam.  Peroxynitrite, a NO-derived free radical, is produced when NO binds to superoxide, an endogenously produced oxidant.</p>
<p>Very weak NT immunoreactivity was detected in mesenteric arteries from control rats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0192623312444027">Figure 6</xref>). Whereas, focal, segmental, intense positive NT immunoreactivity was localized to the area around the sites of SMC damage in mesenteric arteries from fenoldopam or SNP-treated rats. Within damaged mesenteric arteries, positive NT immunoreactivity was seen around similar sites where there was evidence of caspase-3 activation, loss of caveolin-1, ZO-1, Claudin, and Connexin 43. Positive NT immunoreactivity was also seen at sites of SMC necrosis. Weak NT immunoreactivity was observed in the endothelial layer. </p>

</fig>
<p>Based on the strong positive NT immunoreactivity, it was of interest to determine ecSOD activity in mesenteric arteries damaged by fenoldopam treatment. Extracellular SOD activity limits the amount of NT formed because ecSOD inactivates superoxide thus reducing its availability to react with NO and form the cell destroying peroxynitrite free radicals. In normal uninjured mesenteric arteries, ecSOD is expressed abundantly within the SMC layer, in contrast to fenoldopam-damaged mesenteric arterial segments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0192623312444027">Figure 6</xref>). Specifically, at the sites of SMC damage, there was loss of ecSOD immunoreactivity suggesting that this loss and/or reduced activity enabled NO to bind with superoxide, form peroxynitrite, and induce free radical damage in SMC, resulting in necrosis and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0192623312444027">Figure 6</xref>). Because the level of ecSOD could affect the development and/or severity of vascular damage, the cell permeable, ecSOD mimetic Tempol was evaluated to determine the effect of pre- and co-treatment with fenoldopam to induce vascular injury. When fenoldopam was infused for 24 hr at a rate of 100 µg/kg/min, Tempol had no effect on fenoldopam-induced vascular injury (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0192623312444027">Table 3</xref>). In a dose–response study, however, Tempol reduced the severity and incidence of vascular injury induced by a lower dose (1 µg/kg/min) of fenoldopam.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Data from this series of experiments demonstrates that the NO pathway and its regulatory protein cav-1 may play an important causal role in the development of fenoldopam-induced vascular injury seen in nonclinical safety studies. Mesenteric arterial lesions were macroscopically and microscopically identical to those described in previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0192623312444027">Joseph et al. 1997</xref>; Joseph 2000; Kerns, Arena, Macia, et al. 1989; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0192623312444027">Kerns, Arena, and Morgan 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0192623312444027">Yuhas et al. 1985</xref>). Our <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> data clearly shows that vascular injury mediated by prolonged vasodilatation induced by NO is associated with loss of cav-1 that precedes apoptosis and necrosis of EC and SMC. Furthermore, at these sites of SMC damage, breakdown in the structural integrity of the vascular wall, hemorrhage, and extravasations of plasma proteins such as vWF and fibrinogen were noted. Fenoldopam is a well-recognized vasodilatator in multiple species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0192623312444027">Kerns, Arena, and Morgan 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0192623312444027">Ventura et al. 1984</xref>) and there is strong evidence that binding of fenoldopam to specific dopaminergic receptor subtypes (DA1) leads to activation of the NO pathway and increased vascular NO that causes marked vasodilatation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0192623312444027">Venkatakrishnan et al. 2000</xref>). Data from our series of experiments provide the in situ evidence that fenoldopam-induced vascular injury may be mediated in part by excess production of NO-derived oxidizing radicals that can cause apoptosis and necrosis. In support of our findings, data from other studies show that NO-derived oxidizing radicals can induce apoptosis and necrosis of vascular SMC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0192623312444027">Lau 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0192623312444027">Li et al. 2004</xref>).  Additionally, this report also describes the spatial relationship between the signature footprint of peroxynitrite, apoptosis, and loss of cav-1 in EC and SMC of mesenteric arteries damaged by fenoldopam administration. A relatively novel finding in our studies is the in situ expression of NT residues in areas localized to loss of ecSOD and the ability of an exogenous ecSOD mimetic to confer partial protection from the vascular injury induced by fenoldopam. NT levels were not measured in our studies, but evaluation of this parameter in plasma could serve as a potential diagnostic as well as mechanistic biomarker of NO-mediated vascular injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0192623312444027">Radabaugh et al. 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Extracellular superoxide dismutase (ecSOD) is the most prevalent antioxidant within the vascular wall and its activity reduces the availability of endogenous superoxide to react with NO thus preventing the formation of the toxic peroxynitrite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0192623312444027">Fukai et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0192623312444027">Marklund 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0192623312444027">Strälin et al. 1995</xref>). In our studies, we provide evidence showing that fenoldopam treatment resulted in loss of vascular ecSOD specifically at the sites of injury and these data suggest that the loss of ecSOD enabled NO to bind with superoxide and form peroxynitrite that induced free radical SMC damage and apoptosis. Therefore, the presence of peroxynitrite fingerprints and the inhibitory effects of an ecSOD mimetic suggest that vascular damage is mediated in part through NO-derived oxidizing free radicals. </p>
<p>Explanations for the loss of vascular ecSOD during drug-induced injury are complex and multifactorial. Biologically, the major isoform of SOD within the vessel wall is ecSOD and this potent antioxidant comprises one-third to one-half of the total vascular SOD activity, and in comparison to other tissues, ecSOD activity is ∼10-fold higher in the vessel wall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0192623312444027">Fukai et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0192623312444027">Strälin et al. 1995</xref>). Based on immunohistochemical studies, ecSOD is expressed in high concentrations between the endothelium and smooth muscle cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0192623312444027">Oury et al. 1996</xref>). This enzyme is made predominantly by vascular SMCs but it binds to heparin sulfates on the EC surface where it undergoes internalization and so the protein can be detected by immunohistochemistry (IHC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0192623312444027">Ohata et al. 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0192623312444027">Oury et al. 1996</xref>). Because of its location, it regulates the vascular redox state in the extracellular space and is also considered the principal regulator of endothelium-derived NO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0192623312444027">Fukai et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0192623312444027">Oury et al. 1996</xref>). Therefore, ecSOD provides antioxidant activity to endothelial and vascular SMCs as well as the vascular extracellular matrix. Given this complexity in biology, location and biochemical regulation, loss and/or decreased expression of vascular ecSOD can be attributed in part to (1) exhaustion of the enzyme because of the high levels of peroxynitrite formed during NO-mediated DIVI, (2) decreased synthesis and production of ecSOD as a result of injury to SMC, (3) displacement of extracellular matrix-bound ecSOD, and/or (4) proteolytic degradation of ecSOSD by cellular and plasma proteins that are released during injury within the vascular wall.</p>
<p>As a result of tissue damage, necrosis, and subsequent vascular injury, there is release of oxygen-derived radicals that bind with NO to form nitrosating products including peroxynitrite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0192623312444027">Fukai et al. 2002</xref>). Peroxynitrite is a potent oxidant and within the vascular wall ecSOD is the primary scavenger and antioxidant, so, it should not be surprising that expression of this enzyme is reduced at the site of vascular damage mediated by NO. Additionally, because SMCs are the primary site of production, injury, necrosis, and/or apoptosis could reduce the ability and/or number of viable SMCs to synthesize ecSOD. Therefore, this lack of production could contribute to reduced ecSOD expression at the sites of vascular injury.</p>
<p>A small portion of the extracellular matrix-bound ecSOD can be displaced, thus increasing circulating levels of this enzyme in plasma while decreasing vascular wall expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0192623312444027">Fukai et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0192623312444027">Karlsson and Marklund 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0192623312444027">Oury et al. 1996</xref>). In our studies, it is possible that as a result of increased vascular oxidative stress and/or SMC damage and necrosis, there is a release of cellular and plasma proteins that cleave matrix-bound ecSOD releasing it into circulation and therefore reducing expression at the site of injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0192623312444027">Karlsson and Marklund 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0192623312444027">Landmesser et al. 2002</xref>). Unfortunately, plasma ecSOD was not measured in our studies but evaluation of this protein in circulation could add significant value in determining if it is a suitable mechanistic biomarker of NO-mediated vasodilatatory injury. It is also possible that within the vascular wall proteolytic cleavage destroys ecSOD that ultimately reduces expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0192623312444027">Fukai et al. 2002</xref>). Because the enzyme would be destroyed in this situation, measurement of plasma ecSOD would not be beneficial.</p>
<p>It is worthy to note, that compared to other species, dog and rats have the lowest level of ecSOD, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0192623312444027">Marklund 1984</xref>) an observation that may explain the unique susceptibility of these species to vascular injury seen in nonclinical safety studies when large doses of vasodilatators are administered. It is clear that the ecSOD mimetic did not prevent the vascular lesions induced by high-dose fenoldopam (100 µg/kg/min). This could be due to insufficient ecSOD reaching the tissues, or because fenoldopam can exert vasodilatation via poly pharmacologic action through non-NOS pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0192623312444027">Bugelski et al. 1989</xref>; Joseph 2000; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0192623312444027">Yuhas et al. 1985</xref>).</p>
<p>Excessive vasodilatation, loss of vascular tone regulation, and changes in shear stress have been identified as the critical early events of vascular injury induced by vasodilators with a wide range of pharmacologic activity in rats, dogs, and monkeys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0192623312444027">Albassam et al. 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0192623312444027">Chelly et al. 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0192623312444027">Dogterom et al. 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0192623312444027">Gans et al. 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0192623312444027">Greaves 1998</xref>; Joseph 2000; Kerns, Arena, Macia, et al. 1989; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0192623312444027">Kerns, Arena, and Morgan 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0192623312444027">Kerns et al. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0192623312444027">Louden et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0192623312444027">Louden and Morgan 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0192623312444027">Mesfin et al. 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0192623312444027">Nyska et al. 1998</xref>). Inter-endothelial breaks, gradual breakdown of vessel wall integrity, breaks in the internal elastic lamina, and hemorrhage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0192623312444027">Bugelski et al. 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0192623312444027">Yuhas et al. 1985</xref>) are the morphologic manifestations and consequence of excessive vasodilatation that also includes markedly increased blood flow, decreased shear stress (EC), and increased hoop stress on the vessel wall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0192623312444027">Chelly et al. 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0192623312444027">Humphrey and Zins 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0192623312444027">Kerns et al. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0192623312444027">Louden et al. 2000</xref>). Data from our studies show that there is a breakdown in the structural integrity of the vascular wall causing increased permeability and leakage of plasma proteins such as vWF and fibrinogen. In addition, we report that at these localized sites of SMC vascular damage, there was concomitant reduction in the expression pattern of caveolin-1, tight junctions (ZO-1 and claudin), and gap junction (connexin 43). </p>
<p>An alternative interpretation to the loss and/or reduced immunoreactivity is that within the injured vascular wall the antigenic epitopes of caveolin-1 and related structural proteins were destroyed by the presence of red blood cells, plasma proteins, and cellular enzymes released during tissue damage and inflammation. The presence of a large number of red blood cells within the vascular wall could potentially have an adverse effect on caveolin-1 immunoreactivity and this must be at least considered as a contributory factor. In order to address the effects of inflammation, multiple sections from the mesenteric vascular bed were evaluated histologically and immunohistochemically to characterize any adverse effects on caveolin-1 and gap junction protein immunoreactivity. In the perivascular space and surrounding tissues, inflammation and edema did not adversely affect caveolin-1 and gap junction protein immunoreactivity in SMC of adjacent arteries, arterioles, and veins with perivascular inflammation. Therefore, loss and/or reduced expression were consequences of the pathological process and not a secondary event or a bystander phenomenon related to inflammation. In support of this, we found that <italic>in vitro</italic>, caveolin-1 loss was an early (6 hr) dose-dependent event that preceded apoptosis of SMC when they were treated with a broad spectrum PDE inhibitor (IBMX) that belongs to a pharmacologic class of known <italic>in vivo</italic> vascular toxicants. This corroborates our previous finding in that, when SMC were treated with fenoldopam or minoxidil and caveolin-1 was evaluated using fluorescent microscopy, western blot analysis and flow cytometry, decreased expression was observed prior to any increases in annexinV that was used as marker of apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0192623312444027">Brott, Jones, et al. 2005</xref>). However, in our current study, at the 24-hr time point, the low dose of this PDE inhibitor was associated with slight, increase (nonstatistically significant) in caveolin-1 and a statistically significant increase in activated caspase-3. A possible explanation for this paradox is that the increase in caveolin-1 is a physiological, compensatory, adaptive response to regulate NOS and reduce the magnitude of apoptosis and sustain cell viability. This explanation may be plausible because cell viability was not affected significantly at the low dose at 24 hr.</p>
<p>Because gap and tight junctions proteins as well as the NO pathway are regulated in part by caveolin-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0192623312444027">Feron and Kelly 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0192623312444027">Garcia-Cardena et al. 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0192623312444027">Linder et al. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0192623312444027">Liu et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0192623312444027">Nusrat et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0192623312444027">Shaul and Anderson 1998</xref>) these data suggest that in EC and SMC, loss of caveolin-1 could be an obligatory step that initiates a series of biochemical events culminating in excessive vasodilatation, loss of vascular wall integrity, and cell death.  </p>
<p>Collectively, the <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> data suggest that loss or reduced caveolin-1 expression occurs early, precedes apoptosis/necrosis, and could be the critical event in DIVI mediated by NO-induced excessive vasodilatation in sensitive arterial beds.</p>
<p>Functionally, caveolin-1 is a cell surface, shear stress mediating protein whose signaling activities include both vascular tone regulation and maintenance of vascular wall structural integrity through gap and tight junctions. Recently, it has been shown that through genetic disruption leading to functional deficiency of cavolin-1, there is impaired NO and calcium signaling, aberrations in endothelium-dependent relaxation, contractility, and maintenance of myogenic vascular tone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0192623312444027">Drab et al. 2001</xref>). Additionally, vascular shear stress response, flow-mediated mechanotransduction, and vascular remodeling are reportedly cav-1 regulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0192623312444027">Frank and Lisanti 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0192623312444027">Yu et al. 2006</xref>). In cav-1 KO mice, chronic changes in blood flow and shear stress caused vascular remodeling characterized by increased wall thickness and EC proliferation in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0192623312444027">Drab et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0192623312444027">Zhao et al. 2002</xref>). Similar morphologic descriptions of vascular lesions are associated with long-term administration of low doses of vasodilatators such as theophylline, fenoldopam, and caffeine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0192623312444027">Collins et al. 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0192623312444027">Johansson 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0192623312444027">Kerns, Arena, and Morgan 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0192623312444027">Nyska et al. 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>Because functional loss of cav-1 is associated with increased NOS activity and vasodilatation via NO, <italic>in vivo</italic> studies were conducted to show that in the rat mesentery, continuous intravenous administration of SNP (NO donor) caused vascular lesions, morphologically and immunohistochemically similar to vascular lesions induced by fenoldopam. The SNP vascular lesions, however, were not as severe as those induced by fenoldopam and occurred at a lower incidence. In our studies, higher doses of SNP caused severe prostration, systemic hypotension, and cardiovascular collapse, while 50 µg/kg/min was associated with mesenteric vascular injury. In concordance with a previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0192623312444027">Kerns, Arena, and Morgan 1989</xref>), our data confirm that when 20 µg/kg/min of SNP is infused, mesenteric vascular lesions do not develop. The reason/reasons for these observations are not clear but may be attributable to the level of vasodilatation in the rat mesenteric arteries induced by SNP at respective doses versus fenoldopam. This assumption is supported by data that report an additive effect when a non-vasculotoxic dose of SNP (20 µg/kg/min) is coadministered with a low dose of fenoldopam (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0192623312444027">Kerns, Arena, and Morgan 1989</xref>). This combination caused an increased incidence and severity of vascular lesions when compared to low, vasculotoxic doses of fenoldopam. Another possible reason for this difference between SNP and fenoldopam may be attributed to the synergistic poly pharmacologic action of fenoldopam via dopamine receptors, alpha-adreno receptors, NO, and other cellular mediators of vasodilatation. Our data support this because using two different approaches, inhibiting the NO pathway was only effective in attenuating, but not preventing, vascular lesions when coadministered with fenoldopam at low doses. These data suggest that the NOS pathway does contribute to the initiation and development of fenoldopam-induced vascular injury, but it may not be the sole mode of action. In rats, morphologically similar lesions involving the mesenteric arteries have been described following oral administration of PDE4s including the prototypic inhibitor rolipram (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0192623312444027">Larson et al. 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0192623312444027">Slim et al. 2002</xref>). However, oral administration of IC542, a selective PDE4 inhibitor, was associated with a pro-inflammatory response in the rat mesentery with minimal vascular injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0192623312444027">Dietsch et al. 2006</xref>). Coadministration of IC542 with a potent anti-inflammatory agent dexamethasone completely blocked the inflammation in the rat mesentery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0192623312444027">Dietsch et al. 2006</xref>). These results were in contrast to other published studies using a similar study design (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0192623312444027">Slim et al. 2002</xref>). The differences in response may be related to the selectivity of various molecules for members within the PDE family. Based on these data, one cannot exclude the possibility that inflammatory cytokines may be a contributing factor to the mode of action of mesenteric arterial injury induced by vasodilators.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the events of gap and tight junction loss, increased expression of NT residues, and early loss of the NOS regulated protein caveolin-1 suggest that the vasodilatator NO in part mediates fenoldopam-induced vascular injury. Moreover, infusion of a NO donor caused mesenteric vascular injury similar to fenoldopam and direct or indirect interference of NO or its toxic radicals attenuated this vascular injury. Collectively, these data suggest that the NO pathway may play a crucial role in vasodilatatory DIVI. The mechanistic data derived from our studies clearly suggest that caveolin-1, NT, and ecSOD activities are potentially mechanistically linked, candidate biomarkers of vasodilatatory induced vascular injury mediated through the NO pathway. Therefore, in nonclinical safety studies, measurement of these biomarkers in plasma could improve our overall assessment of DIVI and this could lead to the development of a clinically translatable marker.</p>
<p>Further <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> studies are necessary to determine if other well-recognized vascular toxicants of different pharmacologic classes induce injury to the phenotypically altered cells through cav-1 and the NO pathway. This will be of great interest because (1) the regulatory role of caveolin-1, (2) co-localization of caveolin-1 with various receptors and ion channels that increase cAMP levels as a consequence of pharmacology, and (3) exaggerated pharmacology of these receptors and ion channels is associated with vascular injury in rodents and non-rodents. (Kuhlmann et al. 2004; Linder et al. 2005; Martens et al. 2001; Nusrat et al. 2000; Shaul and Anderson 1998; Tirapelli et al. 2005; Yamaguchi et al. 2003; Yamamoto et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0192623312444027">1999</xref>; Yu et al. 2004). Data from studies of this nature could also identify additional candidate biomarkers with clinically translatable application for monitoring DIVI.</p>
