<p>This article aims to optimize the synthesis parameters and to establish the appropriate value of pressure for the design of polyurethane/hydroxyapatite organic matrix composites with an enhanced thermal and chemical stability. Strong interactions between Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions and COO<sup>−</sup> groups are favoured at 60 atm. For the first time, the potential of polyurethane/hydroxyapatite material to be used as synthetic scaffold for bone cancer diagnosis was tested. The ability of polyurethane/hydroxyapatite coatings to be used as substrates for N2a cells attachment was studied using inverted optical microscopy. N2a cells presented a high birefringence and projected small prolongations of the soma comparable to control conditions, thus indicating the healthy state of the cells seeded on the composite substrates, especially in the case of composites prepared at 60–80 atm.</p>

<p>Biomedical engineering remains one of the most challenging application fields for nanostructured materials.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021998312443396">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021998312443396">2</xref></sup> Rapid advancements have been already made in a wide variety of biomedical applications using nanostructured materials, such as tissue engineered scaffolds, site-specific drug delivery systems, non-viral gene carriers and biosensors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021998312443396">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021998312443396">3</xref></sup> As an example, polyurethane (PU)-based scaffolds have been reported to be useful in bone matrix stabilization and regeneration, as well as in several other medical devices, including heart valves and artificial skin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0021998312443396">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0021998312443396"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0021998312443396">6</xref></sup> Despite its bio-absorbability and bio-stability, PUs have some drawbacks that limit their use in biomedical field: very slow biodegradation rates, no bioactive groups and toxic by-products generated through degradation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0021998312443396">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0021998312443396">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>The successful use of PUs in medical applications was made possible by introduction of various functional groups into the polymeric chain, which led to the generation of various ceramic–polymer nanocomposites with several improved properties.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021998312443396">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0021998312443396">10</xref></sup> These properties include strength via the ceramic phase, toughness and plasticity via the polymer phase, more favourable degradation and resorption kinetics and graded mechanical stiffness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021998312443396">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0021998312443396">12</xref></sup> Hydroxyapatite (HAP), one of the most popular bioceramic, was successfully used for the preparation of ceramic/polymer nanocomposites with applications in bone tissue engineering.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0021998312443396">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0021998312443396"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0021998312443396"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0021998312443396">16</xref></sup> However, a major difficulty related to the use of nanoHAP-polymer composites is the weak binding strength between the nanoHAP filler and the polymer matrix. This is because they do not covalently interact during the mixing process, being structurally different materials.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0021998312443396">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Trying to overcome this problem, several publications have assumed that it might be possible to obtain stronger interactions between HAP nanoparticles (NPs) and the polymer using special functional groups of polymer able to interact with the hydroxyl groups of the HAP NPs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0021998312443396">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>Based on these findings, we have systematically addressed the synthesis and characterization of a novel PU/HAP composite material using hydrothermal method as an innovative preparation route and a 100% hard segment PU functionalized with COOH groups on its surface which ensures a better interaction with HAP and an increased hydrophilicity. Resulting composite could be used as synthetic scaffold for imaging tools in the detection of cancer and/or drug delivery system in bone cancer.</p>
<p>In a previous paper,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0021998312443396">18</xref></sup> we have studied two types of composites: (a) with inorganic matrix (PU:HAP = 1:4 molar ratio) and (b) with organic matrix (PU:HAP = 4:1 molar ratio), establishing the role of pressure in the formation of strong interactions between the two components. The next step was to investigate the influence of pressure on PU treated in hydrothermal conditions, in the absence of HAP.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0021998312443396">19</xref></sup> We have concluded that significant effects on PU conformation and thermal properties appear in the pressure range of 60–80 atm. The potential of molecular dynamics method to simulate composite structures depending on synthesis conditions has been exploited in Popescu et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0021998312443396">20</xref></sup> Preliminary experiments of cellular viability were reported.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0021998312443396">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>This article aims to optimize the synthesis parameters and to establish the appropriate value of pressure for the design of PU/HAP organic matrix composites (PU:HAP = 4:1 weight ratio) with an enhanced thermal and chemical stability. The effect of pressure on composite’s structure, morphology and biocompatibility is discussed in detail. For the first time, the potential of PU/HAP material to be used as synthetic scaffold for bone cancer diagnosis was tested. Thus, the ability of PU/HAP coatings to be used as substrates for mouse neuroblastoma (N2a) cells proliferation was studied using inverted optical microscopy. N2a cells were selected because they are adherent to biomaterial surface<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0021998312443396">21</xref></sup> and could help to identify bone lesions as neuroblastoma knowing that the surface charge applied to polarized HAP promotes specific orienting of neuroblastoma cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0021998312443396">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0021998312443396">23</xref></sup> The possibility to obtain PU/HAP thin films able to discriminate between normal and transformed (cancerous) cells and the design of an imaging tool based on PU/HAP composite as synthetic scaffold for bone cancer diagnosis will be addressed in near future.</p>

<p>Acid PU with a proportion of 100% of hard segments was synthesized by a polyaddition performed in dry dimethylacetamide starting from 5 g isophorone diisocyanate (22.52 mmol) and a corresponding stoechiometric amount of tartaric acid (3.378 g).

<p>Organic–inorganic nanostructured composites were prepared by hydrothermal process.

The synthesized PU was dissolved in 5% (w/v) N,N-dimethylacetamide solvent. After complete mixing, polymer solution was added to the inorganic slurry and then stirred at room temperature for 20–30 min to obtain a homogeneous mixture. Theoretical weight ratio of the PU/HAP nanocomposites was 4:1. The organic–inorganic slurry was transferred into stainless steel autoclave for 3 h of hydrothermal treatment at high pressure (40–80 atm) and low temperature (&lt;120°C), and then cooled to room temperature naturally. After hydrothermal process, nanostructured composites were washed with distilled water until the pH value approached 7. The resultant powder was dried at 60°C for 8 h.</p>

<p>The substrate used in this case was Si/SiO<sub>2</sub>/Ti/Au. Thin films based on PU/HAP composites could be further used for cancer detection, as mentioned above.

<sec id="sec7-0021998312443396"><title>Characterization</title>
<p>Different physicochemical characteristics (morphology, shapes, agglomeration and spectral signature) of the particles are linked to their toxicity. Therefore, it is necessary to thoroughly characterize the particles prior to toxicity assessment.</p>
<p>The calcium and phosphorus contents in PU/HAP composites treated at various pressures were determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS ZEEnit 700, Analytic Jena AG, Germany) and inductively coupled plasma (ICP) spectrometry (Spectroflame P – Germany), respectively. Molecular structures of the samples synthesized at different pressures were characterized using FT-IR spectroscopy. FT-IR spectra were recorded in the transmission mode on a ABB MB 3000 spectrometer between 4000 and 550 cm<sup>−1</sup> wavenumbers, and consisted of 64 scans at 4 cm<sup>−1</sup> resolution. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of nanostructured powders were obtained using Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer with monochromatic Cu-Kα radiation. Scans were obtained in the 2<italic>θ</italic> range = 4 ÷ 74°, with a step size of 0.02° every 2 s. Morphological observations were carried out by electron microscopy using a Tecnai G2 F30 S-Twin Field Emission high resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM), with a 50–300 kV electron source and magnifications of 58 × −970 k × (transmission electron microscope) and 150 × −230 M × (scanning transmission electron microscope). Particle size measurements have been performed through DigitalMicrograph™, Gatan Inc. image acquisition and processing software. Thermal stability of the composites was studied using thermogravimetric (TG) analysis. TG measurements were carried out at a ramp rate of 10°C/min<sup>−1</sup>, from 0°C to 700°C in a nitrogen flow with a TA Instruments TGA Q5000 V3.13 Build 261. Platinum pans were used.</p>

<p>Ca:P atomic ratio for pure HAP with chemical formula Ca<sub>10</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>6</sub>(OH)<sub>2</sub> is 1.66. The values obtained for PU/HAP composites suggest that the formation of HAP NPs is favoured by pressures above 40 atm. Based on Ca and P content given by AAS and ICP, respectively, chemical composition of the organic–inorganic material was calculated. PU matrix represents about 81–85% (wt.%) and the amount of HAP increases slowly with pressure. These results are confirmed by XRD where HAP has been identifed as the major crystalline phase in the case of PU/HAP 60 and PU/HAP 80 samples, in good agreement with that of the standard HAP crystallites (Ca<sub>5</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub>OH, PDF reference 09-0432), as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0021998312443396">Figure 3</xref>. Samples prepared at 40 atm, with higher Ca:P atomic ratio showed another crystalline phase, namely brushite CaHPO<sub>4</sub> 2H<sub>2</sub>O (PDF reference 01-072-0713). It means that the formation of nanocrystalline HAP is not favoured by this pressure or HAP crystallites are too small to be detected by XRD. Optimum conditions for the synthesis of PU/HAP composites are around 60 atm.

<p>The absorption bands confirm the chemical structural characteristics of carboxylic PU. Band at 3326 cm<sup>−1</sup> is assigned to N–H stretching mode of PU. In polymer composites, this band is shifted to 3314 cm<sup>−1</sup> as a possible effect of pressure on PU structure. The bands at 2954, 2906 and 2846 cm<sup>−1</sup> corresponded to symmetric or asymmetric stretching vibrations of CH<sub>2</sub> and could be found in all samples presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0021998312443396">Figure 4</xref>. Other PU peaks were observed at 1462, 1386, 1366, 1310 and 1246 cm<sup>−1</sup> and belong to bending vibration of CH<sub>3</sub> or CH<sub>2</sub> groups.</p>
<p>The peak at 1746 cm<sup>−1</sup> is the free C = O group in polymer, but it is not observed in composites spectra, showing that a chemical bond was formed between carboxyl groups (PU) and Ca<sup>2+</sup> (from HAP structure).</p>
<p>Characteristic PU bands at 1634 and 1558 cm<sup>−1</sup>, assigned to amides I and II, respectively, were identified in samples prepared at 40 and 60 atm. Amide I band was shifted to 1646 cm<sup>−1</sup> in the case of PU/HAP80 composite.

<p>By increasing pressure, morphology of HAP in PU/HAP composites changes from thin whiskers to needle like particles. PU particles which represent the composite matrix could not be highlighted because the hard PU used is completely amorphous, as it may be observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0021998312443396">Figure 5(e)</xref>. Length of HAP crystallite increases with pressure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0021998312443396">Figure 5</xref>). HAP whiskers with a maximum length of 20 nm and about 2 nm in thickness could barely be seen inside composite structures prepared at 40 atm. Higher pressure leads to needle like HAP crystallites of 50 nm (for samples prepared at 60 atm) or 100 nm (for samples prepared at 80 atm), embedded in polymer matrix.</p>

<p>Decomposition of the organic–inorganic materials is observed around 315–320°C, irrespective of the applied pressure. In a previous paper,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0021998312443396">19</xref></sup> it has been shown that hydrothermally treated PUs decompose in two steps, starting at 250°C and lying on a wide range of temperature, respectively, until 360°C. Based on these findings, the decomposition of PU/HAP nanostructures in one step, at a higher temperature than that where polymer decomposition or melting starts could be due to PU–HAP interactions and formation of composites. The residual weight at 700°C (around 20% of the original mass) could be attributed to HAP and corresponds with theoretical gravimetric composition of the composite (PU:HAP = 4:1). PU/HAP nanostructured materials are more stable than acid PU due to the formation of chemical bonds between organic and inorganic components. Composite materials prepared at 60 atm are the most thermally stable and no thermal effects are observed until 321°C, with the exception of water evaporation.</p>

<sec id="sec16-0021998312443396"><title>Proliferation of N2a cells on PU/HAP thin films</title>
<p>In terms of cellular viability, PU/HAP composites synthesized at 60 atm represent the best substrate for N2a proliferation, followed by samples prepared at 80 and 40 atm, respectively, as it was shown in Popescu et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0021998312443396">20</xref></sup> These results could be correlated with samples morphology presented above. It is known that surface area to volume ratio increases with the decrease of particle size, meaning that the number of surface molecules increases exponentially with the decrease of particle size. This leads to a massive increase in chemical and biological activity potential, but it is a two-sided issue. On the one hand, increased biological activity can be very beneficial for ‘antioxidant activity, carrier capacity for therapeutics, and penetration of cellular barriers’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0021998312443396">26</xref></sup> However, toxicity and oxidative stress of cellular functions may also dramatically increase.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0021998312443396">27</xref></sup> In our case, the smallest crystallite size has been observed for PU/HAP composites prepared at 40 atm. Bigger particles of HAP (around 100 nm) appeared in samples synthesized at 80 atm. Morphology of N2a cells growing on three representative composite coatings after 24 h of culture is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0021998312443396">Figure 7</xref>, compared to, uncoated Si/SiO<sub>2</sub>/Ti/Au substrate used as control.

Cells presented a high birefringence and projected small prolongations of the soma comparable to control conditions, thus indicating the healthy state of the cells seeded on the composite substrates, especially in the case of composites prepared at 60–80 atm. As a remark, one could say that PU/HAP composites obtained at 60 atm, with HAP crystallites of 50 nm in length and homogenously distributed inside PU matrix could be used as synthetic scaffolds for the design of an imaging tool with potential applications in bone cancer diagnosis. The use of PU with 100% hard segments ensures an increased solubility in aqueous solution and a better interaction with HAP, leading to scaffolds with controlled porosity. These scaffolds will be studied in future works as possible delivery systems for anti-cancer drugs, assuming that they are stable enough in the biological medium without decomposing or releasing toxic secondary products in the surrounding tissue.</p>

<sec id="sec17-0021998312443396"><title>The influence of pressure on composite structure</title>
<p>According to Rivalain et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0021998312443396">28</xref></sup> the pressure dependence <italic>P</italic> of the Gibbs energy is given by the following equation:
<disp-formula id="disp-formula1-0021998312443396"><mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline" id="math1-0021998312443396"><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>δ</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>Δ</mml:mi><mml:mi>G</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:mi>δ</mml:mi><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi/><mml:mrow><mml:mi>T</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mi>Δ</mml:mi><mml:mi>V</mml:mi><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:mi>RT</mml:mi><mml:mo>&lt;</mml:mo><mml:mi>label</mml:mi><mml:mo>&gt;</mml:mo><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mo>&lt;</mml:mo><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:mi>label</mml:mi><mml:mo>&gt;</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math><graphic alternate-form-of="disp-formula1-0021998312443396" xlink:href="10.1177_0021998312443396-eq1.tif"/></disp-formula>
in which Δ<italic>V</italic> is the reaction volume change of the system, including intrinsic (van der Waals volumes) and solvational (contraction of the solvation shell and change in volume of the cavities). Consequently, the main effect of pressure is to displace the equilibrium towards the state characterized by the smallest volume.</p>
<p>Under high pressure conditions (<italic>P</italic> = 80 atm), the dissociation of water is increased and the value of the equilibrium constant is improved. But high pressure can cause the rearrangement of Ca<sup>2+</sup> or PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3−</sup> ions in a more compact structure which hinders some vibration modes of the phosphate group, as it can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0021998312443396">Figure 5</xref>. If the pressure is too high (80 atm), polymer would shrink, which is not favourable for interactions with HAP. Instead, a pressure of 60 atm favours stronger interactions between Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions and COO<sup>−</sup> groups and lead to a composite material which represents a better substrate for N2a cells proliferation. In this case, the main factor characterizing the hydrothermal reaction system is the compressibility (negative value of Δ<italic>V</italic>) of the solution which leads to the reduction of the average distance between the solvated species. All these phenomena lead to an improvement of chemical reactivity and to the stabilization of PU/HAP composite structure.</p>

<sec id="sec18-0021998312443396" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Nanostructured composites based on acid PU matrix and HAP NPs have been prepared by hydrothermal synthesis at high pressure (40–80 atm) and low temperature (&lt;120°C). It has been observed that pressures of 60 atm favour stronger interactions between Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions from HAP and functional COO<sup>−</sup> groups of the polymer and leads to composites with an enhanced thermal and chemical stability, which determined us to assume that they are stable enough in the biological medium without decomposing or releasing toxic secondary products in the surrounding tissue.</p>
<p>Under higher pressure conditions (<italic>P</italic> = 80 atm), Ca<sup>2+</sup> or PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3−</sup> ions might be rearranged in a more compact structure which hinders some vibration modes of the phosphate group. Also, PU shrinkage occurs and coordinative interactions between organic (PU) and inorganic (HAP) components are not favoured in this case. Pressure is the main factor which determines the interaction between organic and inorganic components in hydrothermal conditions, by decreasing distances between functional groups of PU and inorganic species.</p>
<p>For the first time, the potential of PU/HAP material to be used as synthetic scaffold for bone cancer diagnosis was tested. N2a cells presented a high birefringence and projected small prolongations of the soma comparable to control conditions, thus indicating the healthy state of the cells seeded on the composite substrates, especially in the case of composites prepared at 60–80 atm. Viability of N2a cells depends on composite morphology (nearly like a porous network at 60 atm, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0021998312443396">Figure 5(b)</xref>) which is dictated by pressure. These results are also promising for future preparation of an anti-cancer drug delivery system based on PU/HAP composite scaffolds with controlled porosity and good dispersability in aqueous media. Further in vitro test will be done in the near future to establish a possible mechanism for cellular adhesion at bio/non-bio interface.</p>
