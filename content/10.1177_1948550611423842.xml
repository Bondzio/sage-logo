<abstract>
<p>When do people respond to obstacles by mentally “stepping back” and taking a more distanced perspective? Manipulating obstacles to social goals, to personal goals, and in a computer game, three studies tested the hypothesis that people should increase psychological distance upon facing an obstacle primarily when distancing is relevant, that is, when the obstacle appears on their own path to a goal or when they are engaged and motivated to follow through with activities. As expected, participants who imagined a goal-relevant versus a goal-irrelevant obstacle indicated greater estimates for an unrelated spatial distance (Study 1). Moreover, chronically engaged participants provided smaller font size estimates after thinking about how to reach a personal goal with versus without an obstacle (Study 2), and participants primed with engagement indicated greater estimates for an unrelated spatial distance after navigating a maze with versus without an obstacle (Study 3). Implications for related research are discussed.</p>

<body>
<p>When facing an obstacle during goal pursuit, people might do several things: They might disengage and attend to more attractive things to do. If they stay engaged, they might try to ignore the obstacle, move on as if nothing happened, and run the risk of the obstacle firing back at them. They might also acknowledge the existence of the obstacle and focus on it so much that they loose sight of their goal. Or they might mentally step back, look at the situation from a more distanced perspective, and thereby hopefully understand how the obstacle relates to their goal, see potential ways around it, or think of rather unusual means to reach their goal. The current research deals with the last possibility, which to us seems the most promising of the above. Specifically, our research examines to what extent the well-known metaphor of “mentally stepping back” reflects a response that is common to dealing with obstacles.</p>
<p>But what do we mean by obstacles? Just as the goals that people pursue can vary, the obstacles they might encounter can take different shapes (e.g., social, mental, physical) and may appear in diverse settings (e.g., work, private, clinical). Therefore, we define obstacles by what they all have in common: They constitute interfering forces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1948550611423842">Higgins, 2006</xref>) that <italic>impede the standard course of action</italic> and thus require people to figure out how they might achieve their goal despite the obstacle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1948550611423842">Marguc, Förster, &amp; Van Kleef, in press</xref>).</p>
<p>The notion that mentally stepping back might be useful for dealing with obstacles can be traced back to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1948550611423842">Lewin (1935)</xref>. He theorized that to overcome a barrier standing in the way of a desired object, people need to perceive the entire problem situation so that the “path to the goal becomes a unitary whole” (p. 83). In addition, he proposed that adopting an overall perspective on a problem situation should be easier to the extent that people can psychologically distance themselves from the situation at hand and detach from the directional pull of the goal without disengaging altogether. In other words, when people try to overcome an obstacle, adopting a more encompassing perspective might go hand in hand with greater <italic>psychological distance</italic>, a variable that has gained considerable interest in social psychology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1948550611423842">Liberman &amp; Trope, 1998</xref>; for reviews, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1948550611423842">Liberman &amp; Trope, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1948550611423842">Liberman, Trope, &amp; Stephan, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1948550611423842">Trope &amp; Liberman, 2010</xref>) and has been defined as “a subjective experience that something is close or far away from the self, here, and now” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1948550611423842">Trope &amp; Liberman, 2010</xref>, p. 440).</p>
<p>Numerous antecedents of increasing versus decreasing psychological distance have been identified, including, for example, global versus local perception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1948550611423842">Liberman &amp; Förster, 2009a</xref>), abstract versus concrete construal levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1948550611423842">Liberman, Trope, &amp; Sherman, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1948550611423842">Bar-Anan, Liberman, &amp; Trope, 2006</xref>), high versus low power (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1948550611423842">Hogg, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1948550611423842">Hogg &amp; Reid, 2001</xref>), fluency versus disfluency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1948550611423842">Alter &amp; Oppenheimer, 2008</xref>), anticipated effort (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1948550611423842">Proffitt, Stefanucci, Bandon, &amp; Epstein, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1948550611423842">Stefanucci, Proffitt, Banton, &amp; Epstein, 2005</xref>), or stereotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1948550611423842">Macrae, Bodenhausen, Milne, &amp; Jetten, 1994</xref>). Psychological distance is also associated with various outcomes that could be useful for dealing with obstacles. For instance, greater distance was shown to decrease emotional involvement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1948550611423842">Williams &amp; Bargh, 2008</xref>), enhance creative thinking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1948550611423842">Förster, Friedman, &amp; Liberman, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1948550611423842">Jia, Hirt, &amp; Karpen, 2009</xref>), promote integrative agreements among negotiators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1948550611423842">Henderson, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1948550611423842">Henderson, Trope, &amp; Carnevale, 2006</xref>), and align people’s behavioral intentions with their values rather than with feasibility concerns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1948550611423842">Eyal, Sagristano, Trope, Liberman, &amp; Chaiken, 2009</xref>). This suggests that mentally stepping back, or increasing psychological distance, might help people keep their higher-order goals and values in mind without becoming too entangled in their affective response to obstacles, obtaining better outcomes when obstacles appear in the context of negotiations, or discovering unforeseen ways around an obstacle.</p>
<p>Despite the prevalence of obstacles and the potential benefits of responding to them by mentally stepping back, the relationship between obstacles and psychological distance has not been examined. Our research aims to close this gap by investigating whether and when people respond to obstacles by increasing psychological distance. Four dimensions of psychological distance have been identified: spatial distance, temporal distance, social distance, and hypotheticality. Because the stepping back metaphor directly implies increasing the space between oneself and another object and the spatial dimension has been proposed to underlie other dimensions of psychological distance (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1948550611423842">Boroditsky, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1948550611423842">Trope &amp; Liberman, 2010</xref>), we start by examining the impact of obstacles on spatial distance.</p>
<p>We propose that as people deal with obstacles throughout their lives, they might implicitly learn that adopting a more distanced perspective can help them overcome obstacles to their goals. Over time, they might develop an “if obstacle, then distance” routine that is stored in procedural memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1948550611423842">Tulving &amp; Schacter, 1990</xref>) and that can be triggered spontaneously (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1948550611423842">Liberman &amp; Trope, 1998</xref>) whenever they are trying to overcome an obstacle. Such <italic>procedural priming</italic> has been found to carry over to completely unrelated tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1948550611423842">Wyer, Shen, &amp; Xu, in press</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1948550611423842">Förster, Liberman, &amp; Friedman, 2007</xref>); therefore, obstacles might lead to a more <italic>general</italic> sense of increased spatial distance between oneself and other objects. To illustrate, experiencing an obstacle while writing a review might result in perceiving greater distance between oneself and the computer screen, or between oneself and another city.</p>
<p>A recent series of studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1948550611423842">Marguc et al., in press</xref>) revealed a similar link between obstacles and global processing: Upon facing an obstacle in one task, participants broadened their perception and used more inclusive categories in subsequent, unrelated tasks. However, these effects were mainly found when participants’ engagement and motivation to follow through with ongoing activities was high rather than low, which suggests that a global processing response to obstacles reflects attempts to solve a problem. Because global processing and psychological distance are related (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1948550611423842">Liberman &amp; Förster, 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1948550611423842">2009b)</xref> and because mentally stepping back would seem of little use when an obstacle is irrelevant to one’s current goal pursuit or if one is not very engaged, we propose that obstacles should increase psychological distance only when they appear on one’s own path to a goal rather than on other people’s paths to their goals and when engagement is high rather than low.</p>

<title>Overview</title>
<p>In Study 1, participants read a scenario in which an obstacle occurred on their path to a social goal or on an irrelevant path. Afterward, they estimated the distance between two Dutch cities, Amsterdam (i.e., their current location) and Roosendaal (i.e., a location unrelated to the scenario). Study 2 examined the role of chronic engagement and explored a new way of measuring psychological distance based on the notion that faraway objects tend to look smaller and on research showing that goal-related motivational states influence size perception (e.g., van Koningsbruggen, Stroebe, &amp; Aarts, 2010; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1948550611423842">Veltkamp, Aarts, &amp; Custers, 2008</xref>). After specifying an important personal goal, participants imagined how to reach their goal either with or without an obstacle. Next, they estimated the font size of various letters presented on the screen. We reasoned that smaller font size estimates reflect greater psychological distance. In Study 3, participants were primed with high versus low engagement and completed a computerized maze with or without an obstacle. Subsequently, they estimated the distance between “here” and central station. In all studies, we controlled for potential effects of mood after the manipulation. We also asked how important the goal was for participants (Study 1), how much they valued it (Study 2), how motivated they were to reach it, and how confident they were about reaching their goal (Studies 1 and 2). In Study 3, we asked how difficult the maze task was for participants and how much they enjoyed it. Whereas enjoyment had an effect that we will describe in more detail below, none of the remaining measures influenced psychological distance when controlled for as a covariate. Therefore, we will not address them further. All participants were probed for suspicions, remunerated, thanked, and debriefed.</p>

<p>A total of 124 first-year students (mean age 29 years; 86 females) participated in this study. They received course credit in return.</p>

<sec id="section4-1948550611423842">
<title>Materials and Procedure</title>
<p>After several unrelated tasks, this study was introduced as a study on “Planning and Implementing Everyday Activities.” Participants were asked to imagine, as vividly and realistically as possible, one of several ostensibly randomly selected situations. They were encouraged to take all the time they needed for this, as we would get back to it later. All participants read that they were en route to the birthday party of their best friend who lives in another city and whom they have not seen for a while. To strengthen motivation, the scenario contained statements such as “you would really like to take this opportunity to see your friend” and “you have bought a nice present and even baked your friend’s favorite chocolate cake.” Participants in the obstacle (no-obstacle) condition further read about a newscast interrupting the radio program and reporting that due to heavy storms the road they were driving on (a road elsewhere in the Netherlands) was blocked by a fallen tree. Participants were asked to think of how they could get to their friend’s birthday party despite the blockage (how they would drive to their friend’s birthday party by car). In other words, everybody was asked to think of concrete means for <italic>how</italic> they might reach their goal.</p>
<p>After several control questions (i.e., mood, importance, motivation, confidence), participants were introduced to an ostensibly unrelated study and were asked to estimate the distance between Amsterdam (i.e., their current location) and Roosendaal (i.e., a city not mentioned in the scenarios) in kilometers. We borrowed this measure from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1948550611423842">Liberman and Förster (2009a)</xref> who showed that global perception influences spatial distance estimates with the self, here, now as a reference point. No suspicions regarding the purpose of the study were expressed.</p>

<title>Results and Discussion</title>
<p>Some participants indicated rather extreme distances. Therefore, values deviating 2 <italic>SD</italic> or more from the sample mean (2.42%) were excluded prior to analyses. Because Levene’s test suggested that equal variances cannot be assumed, <italic>F</italic>(1, 119) = 9.38, <italic>p</italic> = .003, adjusted statistics are reported. As expected, participants in the obstacle condition indicated larger distance estimates (<italic>M</italic> = 111.97, <italic>SD</italic> = 69.90) than participants in the no-obstacle condition (<italic>M</italic> = 89.90, <italic>SD</italic> = 49.35), <italic>t</italic>(103.86) = −2.00, <italic>p</italic> = .048. Because in both conditions a road from A to B was “blocked by a fallen tree,” it is reasonable to assume that the concept of obstacles was activated for all participants. However, only in the obstacle condition participants actually had to solve a problem. One may thus conclude that distancing occurs only when people encounter an obstacle <italic>they</italic> need to overcome rather than an obstacle <italic>other people</italic> might need to overcome.</p>
<p>Indeed, the manipulation and the dependent measure in Study 1 were rather similar in that both might involve mental simulations of traversing a spatial distance between A (i.e., here) and B (i.e., somewhere else). Participants might thus have misattributed a longer distance or increased effort (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1948550611423842">Proffitt et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1948550611423842">Stefanucci et al., 2005</xref>) involved in overcoming the obstacle to an unrelated spatial distance. To address this issue, participants in Study 2 were asked to imagine an important personal goal and estimate the font size of single letters presented on the screen. This dependent measure was only indirectly related to spatial distance and therefore unlikely to involve mental simulations of traversing a distance between A and B. Moreover, because single letters are content-free, it was completely unrelated to the manipulation and thus better suited to show carryover effects from obstacles to unrelated objects. We are not aware of any research showing carryover effects of anticipated effort on the perceived size of objects that are entirely unrelated to the manipulation.</p>
<p>The main aim of the next two studies was to examine the moderating role of different variables related to engagement. The first such variable is <italic>locomotion</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1948550611423842">Kruglanski et al., 2000</xref>), a self-regulatory orientation in which people are concerned with moving from state to state and committing the psychological resources necessary to initiate and maintain goal-directed movement in a straightforward manner. A person high in locomotion can be characterized as task-oriented, attending to activities, and persisting conscientiously until completion even in the face of obstacles or setbacks—in other words, as highly engaged. A person low in locomotion can be characterized simply by a lesser amount of these attributes, as locomotion is a unidimensional construct.</p>
<p>We predicted an Obstacle × Engagement interaction, such that very engaged individuals should be more likely than less engaged individuals to increase psychological distance upon facing an obstacle. In Study 2, this should be evidenced in participants high in locomotion being more likely than those low in locomotion to indicate smaller font size estimates after facing an obstacle compared with not facing an obstacle.</p>

<title>Study 2 Method</title>
<sec id="section7-1948550611423842">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>A total of 81 first-year students (mean age 21 years; 61 females) participated for course credit. Four participants who noticed a link between the manipulation and the dependent measure and two participants who failed to follow instructions were excluded from the analyses.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1948550611423842">
<title>Materials and Procedure</title>
<p>Several weeks before the main study, chronic locomotion was measured using the regulatory mode questionnaire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1948550611423842">Kruglanski et al., 2000</xref>). Sample items are “Most of the time my thoughts are occupied with the task that I wish to accomplish” or “When I get started on something, I usually persevere until I finish.”</p>
<p>The main study was introduced as “a study on personal goals.” To ensure that participants understood what kind of goals we meant, several examples were provided (e.g., “to succeed in my studies/work” or “to stop smoking”). All participants specified their most important personal goal for the next 6 months. Participants in the obstacle condition were then asked to name the biggest possible obstacle that might interfere with reaching their goal. These participants were instructed to think about how they could reach their goal despite the obstacle, that is, how they could overcome the obstacle they had just described. Participants in the no-obstacle condition did not specify any obstacle, but were directly asked to think about how they could reach their goal, that is, how they could get from their present situation to the goal they wanted to achieve. As in Study 1, we encouraged participants to take all the time they needed for this.</p>
<p>After several control questions (i.e., mood, value, motivation, confidence), the dependent measure was introduced as a test of “Detailed Estimation Skills.” Participants were presented with 20 different letters, each on a separate screen. Their task was to estimate the font size of each letter. The mean of all font size estimates was our measure of psychological distance.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1948550611423842">
<title>Results and Discussion</title>
<p>We regressed font size estimates on the main effect of obstacle (contrast coded: <italic>obstacle</italic> = 1; no-obstacle = −1), the main effect of locomotion (mean-centered), and the Obstacle × Locomotion interaction. There were no main effects (all <italic>F</italic>s &lt; 1). However, as predicted, a significant Obstacle × Locomotion interaction emerged, <italic>B</italic> = −2.34, <italic>SE</italic> = .91, <italic>t</italic>(74) = −2.57, <italic>p</italic> = .01 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1948550611423842">Figure 1</xref>
). To further inspect the nature of this interaction and test our hypothesis that individuals high in locomotion should be most likely to increase psychological distance upon facing an obstacle, we examined regions of significance using the Johnson-Neyman (J-N) technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1948550611423842">Bauer &amp; Curran, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1948550611423842">Johnson &amp; Neyman, 1936</xref>). In contrast to the more common pick-a-point approach, in which an arbitrary point (e.g., 1 <italic>SD</italic> above and below the sample mean) is used to test the effect of the focal variable at “high” versus “low” levels of a continuous variable, the J-N technique allows researchers to avoid such arbitrariness and specify <italic>where</italic> on the entire continuum of the moderator the effect of the focal variable is significant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1948550611423842">Aiken &amp; West, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1948550611423842">Hayes &amp; Matthes, 2009</xref>). More specifically, the J-N technique mathematically derives points at which the effect of the focal variable transitions between statistically significant and nonsignificant. In the present study, these points were −.46 and .92 (noncentered values: 3.49 and 4.87 on a scale from 1 to 6), meaning that for participants scoring high on locomotion (above 4.87), font size estimates were significantly smaller in the obstacle condition compared with the control condition. By contrast, for participants with moderate scores on locomotion (between 3.49 and 4.87), font size estimates did not differ as a function of condition, and for participants scoring low on locomotion (below 3.49) font size estimates were bigger in the obstacle condition compared with the control condition.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1948550611423842">1</xref></sup></p>

</fig>
<p>Further qualifying Study 1, this study examined whether chronic levels of engagement moderate the effect of obstacles on psychological distance. Operationalizing engagement in terms of locomotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1948550611423842">Kruglanski et al., 2000</xref>), we hypothesized and found that psychological distance is most likely to increase upon facing an obstacle when chronic engagement is high rather than low. Moreover, because the obstacle manipulation was content-wise and procedurally very different from the dependent measure, misattributions that might have explained results in Study 1 were unlikely to occur in Study 2.</p>
<p>In Study 3, we sought to replicate Study 2 with a validated measure of psychological distance, that is, a variant of the distance estimate from Study 1 (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1948550611423842">Alter &amp; Oppenheimer, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1948550611423842">Liberman &amp; Förster, 2009a</xref>). We also examined another variable related to engagement: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1948550611423842">Kuhl’s (1994)</xref> concept of <italic>volatility</italic>. Individuals low in volatility (hereafter referred to as engaged) are similar to those high in locomotion in that they are not easily distracted and are inclined to follow through with what they do. They are the ones for whom mentally stepping back in response to obstacles should be most relevant. Individuals high in volatility (hereafter referred to as volatile) are similar to those low in locomotion in that they are not very engaged in <italic>ongoing</italic> activities. However, whereas the latter are generally not very concerned with movement, the former move quite a lot: They tend to think about attractive alternatives while they are still busy with something and disrupt ongoing activities prematurely to start something new.</p>
<p>Examining volatility in addition to locomotion allows us to rule out the possibility that a propensity toward movement or action rather than engagement is driving our effects. Moreover, because we did not measure chronic volatility, but used a recently developed and successfully validated manipulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1948550611423842">Marguc et al., in press</xref>), we could test our hypothesis experimentally, assign equal numbers of participants to all groups, and demonstrate causality. Finally, we left the scenario technique and replicated effects with yet another, physically visible obstacle manipulation: A computerized maze in which an obstacle does or does not suddenly appear and block the most direct path to the goal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1948550611423842">Marguc et al., in press</xref>). We predicted that participants primed with engagement, but not those primed with volatility, should indicate greater distance estimates after facing an obstacle compared with not facing an obstacle.</p>

<title>Study 3 Method</title>
<sec id="section11-1948550611423842">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>A total of 133 undergraduates (mean age 21 years; 78 females) participated in this study. They received €7 or course credit as compensation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1948550611423842">
<title>Materials and Procedure</title>
<p>After several unrelated tasks, participants were introduced to our manipulation of volatility, an ostensible test of social competence. On a sheet of paper, they saw several statements and photographs of young men and women. Half of the male and female faces had a neutral facial expression; the other half was smiling. Depending on condition, half of the statements represented engagement (e.g., “When I’m watching an enthralling movie, I wouldn’t even think of doing something else.”) or volatility (e.g., “Even the most enthralling movie doesn’t stop me from getting up and doing something else for a while.”). Irrespective of condition, the remaining statements were neutral fillers (e.g., “I like the color white, even if it’s technically not a color. I just like it.”). Participants were instructed to read the statements carefully, look at the photographs until they felt they knew which statement belonged to which photograph, and map each statement onto one photograph. They worked at their own pace until they were finished. In a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1948550611423842">Marguc et al., in press</xref>, Study 6), this manipulation increased persistence among participants primed with engagement versus volatility.</p>
<p>The subsequent task was an allegedly unrelated pretest for games to be used in future studies. Participants read that they were randomly assigned to the “maze game,” which involved moving a figure from the upper left corner to a specified goal on the right side of the screen. They were asked to perform as well as possible, supposedly because we were interested in the average difficulty of the game. After a simple practice maze, a more complex maze followed. Everyone received the same maze, except that in the obstacle condition, a large obstacle would suddenly appear and block the most direct path to the goal (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1948550611423842">Figure 2</xref>
).</p>

<p>All participants reached the finish flag and answered several control questions (i.e., difficulty, enjoyment). In a seemingly unrelated study, participants were asked to “estimate the distance between ‘here’ and central station (in meters).” No suspicions regarding the purpose of the study were expressed.</p>

<title>Results and Discussion</title>
<p>As in Study 1, estimates deviating 2 <italic>SD</italic> or more from the sample mean (3.01%) were excluded prior to analyses. A 2 (Obstacle: Yes vs. No) × 2 (Prime: Engaged vs. Volatile) analysis of variance (ANOVA) on the estimated distance between “here” and central station revealed no main effects, <italic>F</italic> &lt; 1. However, as predicted, a significant Obstacle × Prime interaction emerged, <italic>F</italic>(1, 125) = 6.92, <italic>p</italic> = .01, η<sub>

). Simple-effects analyses further revealed that participants primed with engagement indicated greater distance estimates in the obstacle condition (<italic>M</italic> = 2,811.03, <italic>SD</italic> = 1,359.47) compared with the no-obstacle condition (<italic>M</italic> = 2,118.64, <italic>SD</italic> = 1,465.50), <italic>F</italic>(1, 125) = 4.24, <italic>p</italic> = .04, η<sub>

For participants primed with volatility, this difference was not significant (obstacle: <italic>M</italic> = 2,406.16, <italic>SD</italic> = 1,469.51; no-obstacle: <italic>M</italic> = 2,990.32, <italic>SD</italic> = 1,188.38), <italic>F</italic>(1, 125) = 2.79 <italic>p</italic> = .10, η<sub>

<p>Replicating Study 2 with a different variable related to engagement, Study 3 lends further support for the idea that engagement moderates the impact of obstacles on psychological distance. In addition to establishing causality by manipulating rather than measuring engagement versus volatility, this study also demonstrates that both chronic <italic>and</italic> situational differences in engagement influence how people respond to obstacles.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1948550611423842">
<title>General Discussion</title>
<p>Three studies show that obstacles increase psychological distance when they appear on people’s own path to their goal rather than on an irrelevant path and when people are highly engaged in what they are doing. More specifically, participants who had to overcome an obstacle on the way to their best friend’s birthday party provided larger estimates for an unrelated spatial distance than participants who did not have to overcome an obstacle because it appeared on a different route (Study 1). In line with the idea that faraway objects tend to look smaller, participants who are typically very engaged in what they are doing also provided smaller font size estimates after thinking about how to reach a personal goal despite an obstacle compared with thinking only about how to reach their goal (Study 2). Finally, participants primed with engagement provided larger estimates for an unrelated spatial distance after navigating a computerized maze with rather than without an obstacle (Study 3).</p>
<p>In the latter studies, less engaged participants did not respond to obstacles by increasing psychological distance, presumably because they were not very concerned with overcoming obstacles and thus mentally stepping back was of little use to them. Somewhat surprisingly, there was even a reverse effect in Study 2, such that participants low in locomotion indicated bigger font sizes after facing an obstacle. Although the only prediction we had for these participants was that they should not increase psychological distance in response to obstacles, it seems possible that individuals low in locomotion, who are generally not very concerned with movement, might have started to examine the obstacle more closely rather than trying to find ways around it. Importantly, the finding that highly engaged participants increased psychological distance in response to obstacles suggests that mental stepping back does not reflect avoidance but rather an attempt to solve a problem. Future research needs to show whether and how this response really helps people overcome obstacles to their goals.</p>
<p>Given that a lack of fluency has been associated with increased psychological distance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1948550611423842">Alter &amp; Oppenheimer, 2008</xref>), one might wonder whether our effects could be due to obstacles decreasing the feeling of fluency associated with a goal pursuit. Although this explanation seems plausible at first, it is unclear how a fluency-based account would explain the moderation effects we found in Studies 2 and 3. Would, for example, engaged individuals be more likely than less engaged ones to estimate  written in a disfluent font to be further away than <bold>New York</bold> written in a fluent font? From a fluency perspective, stimuli naturally feel close or distant to the extent that they are easy versus difficult to process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1948550611423842">Alter &amp; Oppenheimer, 2008</xref>). Hence, to predict results similar to ours based on fluency, one would need to assume that individuals low in engagement would not even experience a difficult-to-read font as disfluent.</p>
<p>More generally, our research not only introduces a hitherto unexplored antecedent of psychological distance. It also makes a methodological contribution by measuring psychological distance via size perception. If psychologically driven size estimates map onto distance estimates, then psychological distance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1948550611423842">Trope &amp; Liberman, 2010</xref>) might provide a new theoretical framework for interpreting findings on size perception. From this framework one could in turn derive interesting predictions. For example, would dieters perceive apples to be bigger <italic>and</italic> closer if a dieting goal is active? Would a basketball player estimate the basket to be smaller <italic>and</italic> further away when thinking about how to overcome a personal problem? Granted, the font size measure used in Study 2 needs further validation. However, because Study 3 replicated Study 2 with a common measure of psychological distance, there is reason to assume that greater psychological distance might indeed co-occur with smaller size perceptions.</p>
<p>Our results are also in line with research showing that motivational factors influence psychological distance. Such factors have been examined in the context of size estimates (see van Koningsbruggen et al., in press; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1948550611423842">Veltkamp et al., 2008</xref>) and, to some extent, in the context of distance estimates. For example, research has shown that greater anticipated effort from carrying a heavy versus light backpack increases perceived physical distance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1948550611423842">Proffitt et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1948550611423842">Stefanucci et al., 2005</xref>) and that a lack of progress toward personal goals makes people feel closer to others who are instrumental to goal attainment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1948550611423842">Fitzsimons &amp; Fishbach, 2010</xref>). In light of such findings, interesting questions emerge: Would obstacles influence other known dimensions of psychological distance, including temporal distance, social distance, and probability (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1948550611423842">Trope &amp; Liberman, 2010</xref>) in the same way as they influence spatial distance? Would obstacles have different effects depending on whether the target of an estimate is instrumental (e.g., alternative means) or detrimental (e.g., unsuccessful means) to goal attainment? Might motivational factors in general determine when the four distance dimensions vary together and when not?</p>
<p>Finally, it would be fascinating to examine whether people also <italic>physically</italic> move back upon facing an obstacle. This would link the present findings to theories of embodied cognition (for a review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1948550611423842">Barsalou, 2008</xref>) and would further elucidate the processes involved in dealing with obstacles.</p>
<p>To conclude, our research revealed that an “if obstacle, then distance” routine exists and that this routine is only triggered when adopting a more distanced perspective is relevant (i.e., when an obstacle appears on one’s own path to a goal; when engagement is high). The notion of “stepping back” is thus more than a suggestion one might read about in self-help books: It reflects what people are doing psychologically when they are trying to overcome obstacles to their goals.</p>
