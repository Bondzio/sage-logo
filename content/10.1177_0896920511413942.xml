<abstract>
<p>The debate on global governance points to shifts in the type and nature of regulation as well as in the set of actors involved. The article introduces a novel way of conceptualizing the changes, namely a move towards <italic>post-political</italic> forms of regulation (see also Garsten and Jacobsson, 2007). Drawing on Chantal Mouffe’s notion of ‘the post-political vision’, the article argues that many contemporary forms of regulation are premised on consensual relationships as the basis for regulatory activity. These regulatory practices tend to narrow down the conflictual space, thereby exerting a form of soft power. Moreover, in the post-political forms of regulation, unequal power relations tend to be rendered invisible. The empirical cases discussed are voluntary regulatory arrangements, more specifically the Open Method of Coordination of the EU (OMC) and CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility) initiatives.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Global governance continues to energize and challenge academics, politicians, and policy-makers alike. There are plenty of interesting contemporary debates trying to make sense of what is happening in our global world, a world characterized by interdependencies, transnational flows of resources and ideas, and re-ordering of social relationships across time and space, as well as re-negotiations of established dichotomies such as public–private, individual–social, and national–transnational. These globalization processes pose in turn challenges for regulators and governors. The re-thinking of regulation is captured in phrases such as ‘from government to governance’, ‘from deregulation to re-regulation’, ‘from hard to soft regulation’, and a move towards ‘new forms of governance’. These phrases point to shifts in the type and nature of regulation, as well as in the sets of actors, and forms of power involved.</p>
<p>We will introduce another way of conceptualizing what is happening, namely a move towards <italic>post-political forms of regulation</italic>. This refers to the fact that, increasingly, attempts to regulate presuppose the existence of consensus rather than conflict as the basis of regulatory efforts; that is, regulatory attempts are increasingly premised on perceptions of basically harmonious social relationships. We borrow the notion of ‘the post-political’ from Chantal Mouffe, and draw on some of her thoughts. Mouffe, as a proponent of a conflict perspective on politics and democracy, takes issue with the consensus orientation of much contemporary political discourse, which tends to hide fundamental differences in interests and power resources. The trend towards post-political forms of governance, we suggest, implies that conflictual relationships are overshadowed by an appeal to agreement and consensus. While Mouffe provides weak empirical evidence of this trend, we illustrate our argument by examples from voluntary regulatory arrangements referred to as ‘soft law’, exemplified in the open method of coordination of the European Union, and Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiatives. Our aim is to critically analyze the conceptual assumptions underpinning such governance efforts, which, we contend, are post-political in nature. The organizing principles behind these forms of governance provide little space for different and conflicting interests to be articulated. This does not mean that conflicts disappear, but that they may take other routes, or are put ‘on hold’, as it were. Furthermore, we argue that in the move towards post-political forms of regulation and governance, unequal power relations tend to be ‘invisibilized’ and made irrelevant.</p>
<p>Post-political regulation typically also involves greater space for market forces to operate. Regulatory codes generally work by way of voluntary engagement of partners, built on a general appreciation of market dynamics in the balancing of financial and social priorities. It builds on trust in the ability of business corporations and other organizational actors to agree on joint commitments and mutually beneficial solutions, rather than on the use of mandatory state force in the regulation of business. In our reading, the transformation of politics into ethics and/or economics demonstrates the trend towards post-political forms of governance. Their articulation into, for example, codes of conduct and rating schemes exemplify how political realities may be brushed out of sight – all the while performing political operations (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0896920511413942">Ferguson, 1990</xref>). Finally, then, we point to the fact that these (post-political) forms of regulation in themselves imply an exertion of soft power, that is, subtle forms of steering and control, constraining and limiting the options available for political choice.</p>

<title>An Excess of Consensus?</title>
<p>In Chantal Mouffe’s agonistic conception of politics and democracy, conflicts are a constitutive part of ‘the political’ and necessary for a functioning democracy.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0896920511413942">1</xref></sup> While liberal democracy requires consensus around the democratic rules of the game, Mouffe argues that it also ‘calls for the constitution of collective identities around clearly differentiated positions and the possibility of choosing between real alternatives’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0896920511413942">Mouffe, 1993</xref>: 4). Political life must allow for articulation of alternative visions, based on conflicting identities. For her, an ‘adversary’, as a ‘legitimate enemy’, is someone with whom one shares a fundamental agreement about the ethical-political principles of liberal democracy, but may disagree about its meaning and its forms of implementation. Mouffe argues that ‘By creating the conditions for possible conflicts to take the form of confrontations among adversaries (agonism), it attempts to avoid a frontal struggle between enemies (antagonism)’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0896920511413942">Mouffe, 1999</xref>: 4). For Mouffe, ‘democracy is peril not only when there is insufficient consensus and allegiance to the values it embodies, but also when its agonistic dynamic is hindered by an apparent excess of consensus’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0896920511413942">Mouffe, 1993</xref>: 6). The excess of consensus is potentially socially explosive, and Mouffe illustrates with right-wing populism, which is on the rise in Europe. ‘When the channels are not available through which conflicts could take an “agonistic” form, those conflicts tend to emerge on the antagonistic mode’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0896920511413942">Mouffe, 2005</xref>: 5).</p>
<p>Mouffe also takes issue with what she sees as a ‘liberal illusion’, namely, that we can free ourselves from power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0896920511413942">Mouffe, 2000</xref>: 20ff). For her, every consensus exists as a temporary result of provisional hegemony, as a stabilization of power, which means that it always entails some form of exclusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0896920511413942">Mouffe, 2000</xref>):<disp-quote>
<p>Consensus in a liberal-democratic society is – and will always be – the expression of hegemony and the crystallization of power relations … To deny the existence of such a moment of closure, or to present the frontier as dictated by rationality or morality, is to naturalize what should be perceived as a contingent and temporary hegemonic articulation of ‘the people’ through a particular regime of inclusion-exclusion. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0896920511413942">Mouffe, 2000</xref>: 49)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Compromises are possible and necessary but should be seen as temporary respites in an ongoing confrontation.</p>
<p>Mouffe particularly takes issue with the consensus model implicit in the third-way policy thinking, since in this formulation the Social Democratic project is drained of its anti-capitalist component (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0896920511413942">Mouffe, 2000</xref>). She explains this development by the blurring of class identities and of the social bipolar system of confrontation: the left–right dimension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0896920511413942">Mouffe, 1999</xref>). Instead of confronting legitimate alternatives, current political discourse postulates the possibility of win-win politics, and promotes solutions that are supposedly beneficial for all people in society. Mouffe sees this vision as anti-political because it refuses to acknowledge the conflictual dimension of politics. It is post-political in that it believes that we have reached a stage where antagonisms can actually be transcended.</p>
<p>Mouffe’s position provides an interesting vantage point for our argument. The key idea that we would like to borrow from Mouffe is that conflicts are increasingly considered illegitimate in political life. We will argue that a post-political vision, implying that conflicts can readily be transcended, lies beneath many of the contemporary regulatory practices. However, for our purposes, we do not need to fully embrace Mouffe’s agonistic concept of politics, which is a strong and controversial one (see note 1). While Mouffe conceives of politics as inherently conflictual, we do not need to take the, arguably, essentialistic stand that conflicts are constitutive of ‘the political’. For our purposes, it is enough to encompass a concept of politics that allows for the articulation of different positions of interests and sees conflicts as a legitimate and natural component of political life. Only so can politics retain its capacity to be a vehicle for social change. Moreover, in order for politics, and in our case regulation, to be <italic>legitimate</italic>, conflicts of interest must be allowed articulation and be resolved in a process of accommodation of positions and compromise. Yet, the regulatory practices that we examine give little space for such processes; instead, a harmony of interests tends to be presumed. In other words, while consensus as an <italic>end-result</italic> of a process is not problematic, consensus as the <italic>premise</italic> at the point-of-departure is. The post-political vision does not rest on the assumption that there is an a priori divergence of interest between parties. It is precisely such a consensus-orientation of contemporary forms of regulation that leads us to speak of it as ‘post-political’ (rather than any connotation to a temporal process with post as in ‘after’ politics).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0896920511413942">2</xref></sup> This resonates as well with Laura Nader’s concept of ‘harmony ideology’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0896920511413942">Nader, 1990</xref>), which is centered on the belief that the existence of conflict is necessarily a bad thing and that a healthy society is one that achieves harmony between people and minimizes conflict and confrontation. Harmony ideology, Nader argues, has been an important ingredient in recent forms of conflict resolution in the US, forms that emphasize harmony, compromise, and the language of therapy over talk of injustice.</p>
<p>In addition to the third-way thinking, we can think of numerous other examples of confrontations and conflicts being increasingly considered outdated in contemporary political discourse, such as the conflict between environment and growth where sustainability as a figure of thought entails that the two can be combined without applying force on the other, or the poor–rich distinction and idea that growth and trade will benefit all. Any trade-off is concealed in this way of thinking. Another example is the ‘we are all in the same boat’ argument, as in the discourse on climate change. In dominant political discourses, zero-sum games in general have been de-legitimized and the notion of win-win games promoted. ‘Win-win’ is a hegemonic ideal, and a typical expression of a harmony ideology, as is the notion of ‘partnership’. Such consensual discourses are very much reflected in contemporary forms of regulation and governance, we suggest.</p>
<p>Following Mouffe, there are different types of ‘post-political’ forms of governance. One is juridification where political conflicts are translated into juridical issues to be resolved by legal experts. Another is technocratization where politics is turned into administration. A third type is moralization where political conflicts are played out in the moral register (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0896920511413942">Mouffe, 2005</xref>: 3, 75). Mouffe, however, provides weak empirical evidence to support her argument about the post-political trends. In our view, it is fruitful to look into the field of regulation to find evidence of discourses of moralization replacing politics. This is clearly expressed in the rise of Corporate Social Responsibility, where moral arguments underpin codes of conduct. Political conflicts are here translated into ethical issues to be handled by moral codes of conduct. Of special interest to us in this article is the transformation of politics into ethics or economics. And these two forms tend to go very well together. Ethical codes of conduct tend to work by way of voluntary engagement of partners, built on a general appreciation of market forces and on trust in the ability of involved organizational actors to find jointly beneficial solutions, rather than on mandatory state force as a way to regulate transnational business. In fact, the Market, and liberal modes of thought, are constitutive of post-political forms of regulation, we suggest. Post-political regulation occurs precisely at the crossroads between the economic, the social, and the ethical. In addressing transnational issues of common concern, such as human rights, workers’ rights, social policy, and employment policy, the financial priorities of the involved parties are to be balanced by social commitments as well as ethical considerations. This does <italic>not</italic> mean, however, that ethics is subsumed under the economic, or that social priorities are automatically outweighed by financial. On the contrary, there is ample evidence for continuous debates about the need for recognizing the multidimensional responsibilities of transnational actors. But what it <italic>does</italic> mean is that arguments favoring moral responsibility and/or market-based solutions to regulation come into play in what is essentially a political sphere.</p>
<p>Even if post-political forms of regulation are also much present in national and sub-national forms of governance, we look in this article particularly at forms of global regulation and governance. This is the level at which the challenges of regulation and legitimacy are most clearly visible.</p>

<title>Transnational Regulation in the Absence of a Global State</title>
<p>The weakening of the regulatory capacity of states through economic globalization has not led to a regulatory vacuum. Our world has seen an exponential growth of international organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0896920511413942">Boli and Thomas, 1999</xref>) and also a proliferation of regulatory activities across national borders: not only rule-setting, but also monitoring, evaluating, and auditing practices with regulatory ambitions and consequences (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0896920511413942">Djelic and Sahlin-Andersson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0896920511413942">Sassen, 1998</xref>). This has led scholars to speak of re-regulation rather than de-regulation. Moreover, we see a multiplicity of actors being involved in transnational governance activities: state actors, corporations, non-profit organizations, professional associations, and intergovernmental organizations, sometimes in networks of private and public actors. Indeed, globalization has created new operational and formal openings for the participation of a variety of organizational actors in regulatory activities. These organizations are vital in opening up ‘new sites of normativity’ alongside the normative order represented by the nation-state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0896920511413942">Sassen, 1998</xref>: 94-95; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0896920511413942">Fraser, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>In transnational affairs, states are one type of actor among others involved in regulatory activities, and the state must share rule-making authority with other actors. Sometimes this is conceptualized as ‘hierarchy’ being replaced by ‘network governance’ or by ‘governance without government’, that is, systems of steering are developed which lack an authoritative center and have a dispersed power and authority structure (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0896920511413942">Cutler et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0896920511413942">Hall and Biersteker, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0896920511413942">Strange, 1996</xref>). Scott has used the concept of ‘post-regulatory states’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0896920511413942">Scott, 2004</xref>) to capture the blurring between public and private actors and the introduction of more de-centered forms of regulation, relying less on state authority and sanctioning power. This can also be conceptualized as ‘post-sovereign’ forms of regulation and governance. Governments still govern but increasingly in partnership with other actors (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0896920511413942">Balloch and Taylor, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0896920511413942">Mörth, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The multiplicity of actors involved in global governance has its correspondence in the variation in regulatory modes: self-regulation by private actors, co-regulation of public and private actors, or the use of soft law, such as guidelines, recommendations, codes of conduct, etc., by public as well as private actors. Soft law bridges the dichotomy of law and non-law as well as of public and private actors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0896920511413942">Mörth, 2006</xref>). Soft law is normative in content but is not backed up by sanctions or hierarchy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0896920511413942">Mörth, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Others have spoken of post-regulatory forms of governance:<disp-quote>
<p>While traditional regulation imposes mandates that are relatively specific and uniform, hierarchically determined, static, and substantive, in post-regulatory governance there is a preference for procedures or general standards with wide allowances for variation rather than detailed rules, for intensive consultation to set and modify standards, for standards that are wholly or partly voluntary, and for adjustments over time in response to feed-back. Post-regulatory governance is flexible in the face of different conditions across space and time. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0896920511413942">Mosher, 2000</xref>: 6)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>‘New governance’ is procedural, heterarchical and flexible in contrast with ‘old-style’ governance, which is regulatory, top-down and uniform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0896920511413942">Eberlein and Kerwer, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0896920511413942">Mosher and Trubek, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>New forms of governance appear as functional equivalents to legislation in transnational affairs where the state cannot rule in a traditional way, but they are sometimes chosen for their virtues even when traditional legislation is available as an option. Network forms of governance and the ‘new governance’ tools, such as soft law, are considered particularly appropriate in situations where the policy problem is ill-defined and the solution is complex or uncertain, where circumstances are diverse or may vary across time and space, where specialized knowledge is required, in situations of resource dependencies, where there are many stake-holders and the conflict potential is large. Network governance is considered capable of producing flexible and adaptable solutions, enhancing the knowledge base needed for appropriate policy decisions, and bringing together various types of actors, thereby generating trust and also empowering stake-holders, enhancing legitimacy, lowering political transaction costs, and facilitating consensus or compromise (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0896920511413942">Héritier, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0896920511413942">Scott and Trubek, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0896920511413942">Shelton, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0896920511413942">Torfing, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>As put by Torfing, new governance ‘takes us <italic>beyond both hierarchical state regulation and competitive market regulation</italic>. Hence, the “visible” hand of the state and the “invisible” hand of the market should be supplemented by the “continuous handshake” of negotiated interaction through partnerships and governance networks’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0896920511413942">Torfing, 2005</xref>: 4). The very notion of ‘network’ signals horizontal and equal relationships, as does the notion of ‘partnership’, which also presumes voluntariness, trust, mutual understanding, and consent. Moreover, governance networks are often networks of actors held together by common principles, procedures, and norms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0896920511413942">Sahlin-Andersson, 2004</xref>). The concept ‘responsive regulation’ has been used to emphasize the dialogue between regulators and regulated whereby common norms and understandings are developed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0896920511413942">Ayres and Braithwaite, 1992</xref>). Yet, what is problematic, in our view, is the implicit consensus model in much of the new forms of governance. The multi-stakeholder model, partnerships, and network governance, along with notions of trust, voluntarism, and win-win games, all illustrate the ideal of consensual relationships and what we choose to call the post-political character of many temporary forms of governance.</p>
<p>The above shift in forms of governance also points to the shifting nature of power in contemporary regulation. In our conception of power, we take inspiration from Rose and Miller’s standpoint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0896920511413942">1992</xref>: 175) that ‘political power today is exercised through a profusion of shifting alliances between diverse authorities’ to govern a multitude of facets of economic activity and social life. In their view, the political vocabulary structured by differences between government and market, public and private, coercion and consent, and the like, is unable to characterize the diverse ways in which power is exercised in advanced liberal democracies at global level. To analyze these aspects of contemporary power, we need to re-locate the state and the market, as well as the concept of politics and non-politics, within an investigation of the ‘problematics of government’, in this case post-political forms of governance. Also, we draw freely on the concept of ‘soft power’ as a form of power resting not on inducement (carrots) or punishments (sticks), but primarily on ‘the ability to shape the preferences of others’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0896920511413942">Nye, 2004</xref>: 5). With <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0896920511413942">Lukes (2005)</xref>, we aim, however, to move beyond the agent-centered, strategic view of Nye by asking ‘to what extent, in what ways and by what mechanisms do powerful agents influence others’ conceptions of their own interests?’ As Lukes maintains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0896920511413942">2005</xref>: 492), power is intimately connected to ‘interests’, and it is in denying the articulation of interests that post-political forms of regulation are exerting a form of soft power, we suggest.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0896920511413942">
<title>Three Cases of Transnational Post-Political Regulation</title>
<p>We will now substantiate our argument by looking at three types of post-political regulation, which are currently widely promoted. We draw here on our own original research on the use of soft law in the EU (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0896920511413942">Jacobsson, 2004a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0896920511413942">2004b</xref>), as well as on global ethics and practices of transparency in CSR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0896920511413942">Garsten, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0896920511413942">Garsten and Hernes, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0896920511413942">Garsten and Montoya, 2008</xref>). (For more empirical detail, see those studies.)</p>
<sec id="section5-0896920511413942">
<title>The Open Method of Coordination as a New Governance Tool in the EU</title>
<p>The European Union has become something of an experimental field for new modes of governance. New forms of governance have replaced or, mostly, supplemented the traditional Community method of regulation through legislation (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0896920511413942">CEC, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0896920511413942">Scott and Trubek, 2002</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0896920511413942">3</xref></sup> Most inventive has been the creation of a new method of cooperation and policy coordination, called the open method of coordination (OMC), formally invented at the Lisbon summit in March 2000 and applied in areas where the EU does not have legislative competence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0896920511413942">Borrás and Jacobsson, 2004</xref>; for a review of the literature on the OMC, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0896920511413942">Kröger, 2009</xref>). Despite many skeptical voices concerning the actual effectiveness of the method, its application has proliferated into a large number of areas in only a few years: employment policy, social inclusion policy, pension and health care system reform, immigration, innovation, research and development policy, and education policy. It has allowed the EU to influence member state policy in areas where the legal competence rests with the member states. It has been a means to resolve deadlock in the integration process, when member states have not been willing to concede national sovereignty to supranational law-making while at the same time have wanted to respond to common challenges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0896920511413942">Schäfer, 2004</xref>), some of which might, arguably, be seen as functional spillovers from the economic integration process. It has also been considered a flexible instrument in light of the diversity of welfare systems and country contexts. The pace with which the method has developed is quite amazing.</p>
<p>The procedures of the OMC are slightly different in different areas, but basically policy is made based on soft law combined with monitoring procedures by which the member states open up to scrutiny (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0896920511413942">Jacobsson, 2004a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0896920511413942">2004b</xref>): the setting of common European targets or policy guidelines, encouraging the translation of these into national targets, allowing the member states to chose the forms and means of implementation according to national systems and traditions, regular reporting of progress in national action plans, country-specific recommendations, systematic country comparisons and benchmarking exercises based on indicators, periodic monitoring and peer review, and learning from ‘best practice’. It can be described as new public management techniques applied to governing the member states: management by objectives, call for transparency, use of best practices, etc.</p>
<p>An important principle in the OMC is the partnership principle. Although national governments are the key actors, the method itself – in theory if not always in practice – is open to a broad participation of actors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0896920511413942">de la Porte and Nanz, 2004</xref>). In the OMC on social inclusion, one of objectives set is in fact to ‘mobilize all relevant actors’. In the field of employment policy, the aim is how well the national processes meet the standard of ‘good governance’. Moreover, it is a ‘voluntaristic’ form of governance. It lacks the bite of hard law and its influence rather follows from agenda-setting as well as from setting the parameters of policy and of how policies should operate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0896920511413942">Jacobsson, 2004a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0896920511413942">Szyszczak, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Although the OMC has been a useful tool for transnational collaboration in new policy areas, this type of governance can be considered post-political in several respects. As mentioned, it builds on the principles of voluntarism and partnership. Moreover, although the OMC has been characterized as ‘experimental’ and ‘reflexive’ governance’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0896920511413942">Sabel and Zeitlin, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0896920511413942">Szyszezak, 2006</xref>), given its procedural rather than substantive nature as well as its flexibility in light of diverse circumstances, it does not allow for competing visions but rather naturalizes one particular ideal. Benchmarking and learning from best practice presuppose that there is one ideal to measure up against, which is ultimately a technocratic vision. In the OMC, as in benchmarking practices generally, learning is seen as a nonpolitical exercise rather than as reflecting political choices.</p>
<p>Moreover, in the policy thinking around the OMC, harmonious relationships between macro-economic, fiscal, and social policy are postulated. The European Employment Strategy, as well as the OMC on social inclusion, seeks to formulate a social policy vision, which does not compete with economic policy aims (therefore being subordinated to competitiveness and combating inflation). It is postulated that economic dynamism and social justice, efficiency and equity, can be reconciled without detriment to one or the other (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0896920511413942">Jacobsson, 2004c</xref>).</p>
<p>Even before the invention of and later proliferation of open coordination processes, Streeck foresaw the development and criticized the ‘neo-voluntaristic’ character of EU social policy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0896920511413942">1996</xref>) for being unable to resolve conflicts of interests. Moreover, the voluntaristic nature of the OMC presumes actors of good will. The OMC has a moral element, in that it wants to foster virtuous, appropriate, and responsible conduct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0896920511413942">Haahr, 2004</xref>), and it can be said to have a disciplining effect on states mainly in terms of disciplining the policy thinking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0896920511413942">Jacobsson, 2004a</xref>). Notions such as <italic>employability, flexibility, flexicurity, activation</italic>, and <italic>entrepreneurship</italic> are categories established in the EU social policy discourse, which may readily have operational and institutional consequences (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0896920511413942">Garsten and Jacobsson, 2004</xref>). A number of notions, thus, are reified and naturalized, that is, placed beyond the realm of the contestable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0896920511413942">Haahr, 2004</xref>). Even if they are contestable and contingent in principle, in practice they limit what can be seen as reasonable, responsible, and realistic action. Moreover, the attempt to find ‘objective criteria’ for ‘best practices’ as well as comparable statistics are part of the building of a common knowledge base as a base for Community action, which also means a standardization of knowledge, which in turn also sets the parameters of knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0896920511413942">Jacobsson, 2004a</xref>). In summary, even if there is not complete consensus around the policy objectives, the OMC type of governance in various – and subtle – ways limits the options available for political choice.</p>

<title>Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)</title>
<p>A parallel development to the implementation of post-political regulatory tools in the EU is that of Corporate Social Responsibility, or CSR. As companies have grown more powerful worldwide, it has been generally recognized that they have a responsibility for the effects of their operations, and that they should be able to present a vision of social responsibility alongside their business vision. Transnational corporations constitute a challenge to established, nation-state based forms of binding regulations, in that they operate across national boundaries, often involving complex supply-chains and many sub-contractors down the line. Despite efforts to regulate the operations of transnational business through international conventions, declarations and treaties, transnational corporations are still operating in areas of incomplete legal coverage.</p>
<p>The term ‘CSR’ generally came into common usage in the late 1960s and early 1970s, at a time when corporations achieved transnational salience and a series of misdemeanors caught the attention of the media. CSR initiatives have since grown significantly, providing a flexible and soft form of regulation, which instead of working hierarchically and by imposing binding rules and exercising sanctions on the actors concerned, operates by a more decentralized and network-based form of coordination, often involving the actors directly. There is today a great number and variety of CSR regulatory frameworks, the more widely recognized being the UN Global Compact Principles, the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, and the Triple Bottom Line. Among the multitude of standards available, ISO 26000 is perhaps the most widely recognized international standard for CSR (until now a Draft International Standard).</p>
<p>CSR initiatives also cover a large spectrum of originators. They may be issued by international organizations (such as the OECD), by non-governmental organizations (such as ISO, International Organization for Standardization), or by for-profit corporations (as for example GoodCorporation). They may be unilateral (issued by one party, such as the SA8000), bilateral (drafted by two collaborating organizations, such as in the case of a joint effort by a corporation and a CSR consultancy), or multilateral in their origin (as the ISO 26000). They may be comprehensive (such as the UN Norms on the Responsibilities of Transnational Corporations and Other Business Enterprises with Regard to Human Rights), or they may be issue-focused (such as the UN Global Compact CEO Water Mandate Transparency Framework). Moreover, codes of conduct often overlap with each other and the resulting web of codes can be rather complex (for an overview of CSR, see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0896920511413942">Crane et al., 2007</xref>). Not least, codes of conduct are often pregnant with different interpretations and translate differently into practice. CSR initiatives are general and abstract in character, resembling statements of normative intentions more than statutory law. They are formulated so as to operate across large distances and to be flexibly adaptable to differing local situations. Motives for business leaders to engage in CSR also vary. For many, they offer a way to prevent binding regulation. For others, it is a means to address the regulation gap, in the absence of a transnational regulatory body.</p>
<p>Transnational in scope, voluntary in nature, and building on the partnership of business, governments, international organizations and non-governmental organizations, CSR initiatives are prime examples of contemporary forms of soft global governance. The organizing principles – voluntarism, dialogue, learning and partnership – reflect a ‘harmony ideology’ assuming the good will of all involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0896920511413942">Garsten and Jacobsson, 2012</xref>). Ideally, CSR builds on the assumption that its initiatives should function as self-regulating mechanisms whereby business actors themselves monitor and ensure active compliance with the spirit of the law, ethical standards, and international norms. CSR is positioned as having a positive impact on employees, consumers, communities, stakeholders and other members of the public sphere. Furthermore, by engaging in CSR initiatives, it is postulated that corporations can promote the public interest by encouraging community growth and development. In a nutshell, CSR is the deliberate inclusion of perceived public interest into corporate decision-making, thus reducing the available space for articulation of diverging interests. As one of the staff at the UN Global Compact stated in an interview: ‘our approach is based on the idea that we can move forward by engaging companies in learning activities. Learning by way of good examples, by sharing experiences, and by making mistakes. We don’t believe in policing, and in sanctions.’</p>
<p>CSR standards and codes of conduct mobilize corporate actors to be socially responsible beyond the requirements stipulated by law, by endorsing voluntary codes of conduct, social accountability standards, or policies. It may be seen as a response to stakeholder demands on rendering global business activities, their social and environmental impact, and the balancing of priorities more transparent and legitimate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0896920511413942">Boström and Garsten, 2008</xref>). CSR also reflects a quest among policy-makers, politicians, activists, and corporate leaders alike for a global normative interlinkage and harmonization which is lacking. In a situation of regulatory slippage, CSR involves the introduction of internal or external procedures aiming to reduce as much as possible, and eventually to eliminate, different interpretations of normative contexts and their impact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0896920511413942">Duplessis, 2008</xref>). Rather than making use of differing views of human rights and workers’ rights as a point-of-departure for dialogue and deliberation, it stipulates a universal agreement on the interpretations of basic rights. Furthermore, it aims at harmonizing the multiplicity of norms into common frameworks.</p>
<p>Corporate accountability is where finance and ethics meet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0896920511413942">Munro, 1998</xref>). The increasing reliance on CSR codes of conducts and standards in the regulation of global business is intrinsically linked to a new ethics of governance. This new ethics of governance is based on the inculcation of new norms and values positioned as voluntary and benign in nature, and by which external regulatory mechanisms are to transform and monitor the conduct of organizations through ‘action at a distance’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0896920511413942">Miller and Rose, 1990</xref>: 1). It has been noted that the CSR standards drafted by multilateral or international organizations generally build on Western conceptions of human rights. Western notions of progress, development, and sustainability are inherent in the discourse (see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0896920511413942">Boele et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0896920511413942">Thøger Christensen, 2007</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0896920511413942">4</xref></sup> Furthermore, we may ask, what kinds of ethical sensibilities are promoted by this type of governance? <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0896920511413942">Roberts (2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0896920511413942">2003)</xref> has argued that the processes of accountability and individualization that are prevalent in modern organizations function to foreclose our ethical sensibilities, rather than to nurture them. He sees CSR as essentially concerned with corporate ‘imago’ – with <italic>being seen</italic> to be good, more than actually attempting to be or do good (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0896920511413942">Roberts, 2003</xref>: 256). ‘This new regime of ethical business is not ethics at all’, he concludes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0896920511413942">Roberts, 2001</xref>: 110). Drawing on Levinas, Roberts’ conception of ethics as related to the proximity of the other, to a personal moral sensibility, and involving a corporeal perception of the vulnerability of the other, is radically different from the more technological and abstract conceptions of ethics that are to be found in CSR practice.</p>
<p>CSR is post-political in assuming that we have reached a stage where antagonisms between ‘things economic’ and ‘things social’, between bottom line reasoning and social responsibility, can be transcended without allowing for organized processes of articulation of differing interpretations, priorities, and positions. In large part, it is a form of corporate regulation integrated into a business model. The vocabulary used by actors involved in CSR promotion involves frequent references to notions of <italic>partner, partnership, commitment</italic>, and <italic>agreement</italic>. Much less frequent are the notions of <italic>party, interest</italic>, or <italic>conflict</italic>, except possibly at the grassroots level where the actual consequences of the failures to live up to the codes of conduct are experienced. Interestingly, as stated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0896920511413942">Javillier (2008</xref>: 42) ‘any legal order, shaped by a political system, is necessarily adversarial and must in all cases recognize different interests.’ In the absence of a transnational legal order for the conduct of transnational corporations, adversaries, interests, and conflicts are brushed aside. Instead, normative statements of intention, built on assumptions of consensus and ‘harmony-ideology’ emerge. We are not saying here that CSR standards do <italic>not</italic> give rise to conflicting interpretations and conflicts. On the contrary, we suggest that it is precisely at the level of abstraction and by way of governing at a distance that assumptions of consensus can operate. It is also at this level that differing normative interpretations and conflicts of interest can be brushed aside. But it is at the local level that established codified law recognizes the existence of adversaries, while at the same time failing to raise this recognition to the global level.</p>
<p>The assumption of consensus and harmony on which CSR is built also stipulates a moral directionality, another key feature of post-political regulation. CSR relies mainly on the reflexive capacities and willingness of involved actors to assume responsibility and to commit themselves voluntarily to a shared normative framework. The call for accountability is, in essence, a call for morality and represents a ‘benign’ form of power that is hard to resist. Power is regarded as benign in so far as it is exercised in discordant relationships between actors to serve either altruistic and/or collective ends and in which the social and political values of democracy, political freedom, and social justice are paramount (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0896920511413942">McCalla, 2002</xref>). It presumes actors of good will who assume responsibility, or a positive agency, and who also tend to refuse to accept force (as in legislation). In Bourdieu’s terminology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0896920511413942">1977</xref>), CSR constitutes a form of ‘symbolic power’ that legitimates key categories of both cognitive and social force and whose arbitrariness becomes difficult to see. It produces trust, belief and, arguably, a mobilizing illusion without mentioning power. CSR discourse, as evinced in the talk and social practices of market actors, posits accountability as a general point of reference, but it fails to address the unequal power relations between the actors concerned. Moreover, the notion of stakeholder presupposes that all involved share a similar stake (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0896920511413942">Jenkins, 2005</xref>). By not providing space for the articulation and negotiation of interests, potential conflicts of interests and power differentials among stakeholders are played down. In the post-political governance practices, the exertion of power, as well as the distribution of power resources, tends to be rendered both invisible and obsolete. Thus, CSR builds on soft forms of regulation that tend to justify themselves by reference to something natural, given, and uncontestable (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0896920511413942">Rose, 1999</xref>: 192). At the same time, it imposes a mobilizing and directive politics of conduct. We will now take a brief look at some of the labeling programs that form part of the moral inventory of CSR.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0896920511413942">
<title>Labeling Programs and the Removal of Conflictual Space</title>
<p>One of the key challenges within the area of CSR relates to the issue of credibility and transparency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0896920511413942">Leipziger, 2003</xref>). How can stakeholders trust what businesses say about their social record in their reports? How can we know if the claims on social responsibility represent the actual practices? What institutions and practices are there that support independent certification and verification of reports and statements?</p>
<p>Labeling programmes represent an effort to make visible the infusion of ethical concerns and notions of inclusiveness into corporate management systems. They are essentially vessels for the communication of what has been referred to above as a moral directionality. The roots of ‘ecolabeling’ can be found in a growing global concern for environmental protection on the part of governments, nongovernmental organizations, businesses, and the public (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0896920511413942">Boström and Klintman, 2008</xref>). As businesses have come to recognize that environmental concerns may be translated into a market advantage for certain products and services, various environmental labels have emerged on products (e.g. natural, recyclable, eco-friendly, low energy, recycled content, etc.). Ecolabeling is a voluntary method of environmental performance certification and labelling that is practised around the world.</p>
<p>While these labels have attracted consumers looking for ways to reduce adverse environmental impacts through their purchasing choices, they have also led to some confusion and scepticism on the part of consumers. Without guiding standards and investigations by an independent third party, consumers may not be certain that the companies’ assertions guarantee that each labelled product or service is an environmentally preferable alternative. This concern with credibility and impartiality has led to the formation of both private and public organizations providing third-party labeling. In many instances, such labeling has taken the form of ecolabels awarded to products approved by an ecolabeling program operating at a national or transnational level.</p>
<p>Labels, then, are a useful source of information, primarily to inform about the conditions under which clothes, food or other goods have been produced. Much of the work on labeling is to help make sure that stakeholders get the information they need in an understandable form. In this sense, complex processes are made legible and rendered visible through the use of labels (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0896920511413942">Scott 1998</xref> on the importance of ‘legibility’ for the execution of state power). But labels do more than just provide information. They are technologies of right and wrong, indicating which organizations have met the criteria set up for them and which organizations have failed to do so. Labels are a proxy for the degree to which organizations have aligned themselves with the normative demands placed on them.</p>
<p>To be granted a label, to have passed successfully a certification scheme, means that a complex and sometimes ambiguous process of judgement has been left behind. The result is a dichotomization of good and bad. Following Mouffe’s reasoning, to dichotomize in terms of moral–immoral means that issues tend to be placed beyond discussion (when something is deemed immoral it is difficult to have an open discussion about it), while the basic idea of politics is precisely to secure the confrontation of and dialogue around different ideas. As stated elsewhere by Garsten:<disp-quote>
<p>The ethical and social turn in business is a case of ‘moral transformation’, in which data and practices that are by nature conflictual and political are transformed and come to exist in a moral field. In this transformed moral field, the standards, codes of conduct and related tools are given a status beyond political contestation, being viewed as morally and ethically sound, and, hence, difficult to question in principle. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0896920511413942">Garsten, 2004</xref>: 85)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Thus, while often of a voluntary nature, such regulations are often impossible to critique in principle, since they are seen to advance good and ethical practice.</p>
<p>The power of regulatory codes, we suggest, works by taking what is essentially a political problem, removing it from the realm of political discourse, and recasting it in neutral language. Regulatory codes often present themselves as rational, objective, and neutral, based on the sound principles of human solidarity and market dynamics working together to form a humane capitalism. CSR and labelling programmes gain legitimacy by enabling corporations to strike a balance, at least theoretically, between profit and greed, on the one hand, and moral considerations and universal values, on the other hand. Or, by positioning CSR and labels as an entrepreneurial device for achieving competitive market advantage.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0896920511413942">Garsten and Hernes (2009)</xref> have suggested that CSR and its associated practices of voluntary regulations may function as ‘corporate lightning rods’. Lightning rods serve, as we know, to detract the lightning from the main building. For example, a common strategy in the globalized economy is to outsource activities that could prove to be harmful to the image of the corporation. Outsourcing, or decoupling, effectively moves the responsibility for questionable practices to another corporate actor and hence outside the reach of the corporation’s own monitoring responsibility. A common practice is to move production to companies operating in countries where there is less risk of public disapproval and political sanctions. Heightened attention to one particular issue or activity, as for example a label signaling righteous ethical practice, may bring about a shadowing of other activities. It is possible for a company to highlight ‘best practice’ in terms of adherence to standards of social responsibility in one location, and to create show-off cases of responsible action, whilst at the same time shadowing violation of CSR standards at a different location. Such strategies also tend to direct attention away from conflicts, in a post-political fashion.</p>
<p>Labeling programs, we argue, constitute a case of post-political regulation in that embedded in the mark, the label, are assumptions of an ethical pluralism without antagonism and beyond power struggles and conflicts. Politics is here turned into ethics, or rather, a particular form of morality. Labels thus do more than visibilize and communicate the righteousness of the production process at hand; transformed into signs, they risk closing off the ethical and political debate they were once intended to reveal.</p>

<title>Conclusion: Towards a Post-Political, Market-Driven Order?</title>
<p>We have proposed that many contemporary attempts to regulate organizations and their practices can be understood as post-political in the sense that the organization of these global governance efforts reflects a post-political vision, premised on consensual relationships, and where conflicts of interests and unequal power relations tend to be made invisible and/or irrelevant. We have <italic>not</italic> suggested, however, that these forms of regulation or governance are <italic>not</italic> political or that they are <italic>dis</italic>interested – rather, that their political nature is downplayed or concealed. Nor have we argued that conflicts disappear, but rather that they tend to be pushed aside and may pop up in other ways and in other fora. In fact, studies of the concrete processes of implementation of these types of regulation at local level – and we welcome such studies – would probably reveal a lot of micro-conflicts.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0896920511413942">5</xref></sup> However, our argument is that the overall conflictual space in these forms of regulation has been narrowed down by the regulatory design, and that the frames are set in ways that limit the options and constrain the legitimate voicing of alternatives.</p>
<p>Post-political regulation appears at a time when economic relations are being increasingly globalized. The new transnational spatialization of the economy entails considerable challenges in terms of political control and government and opens up a space for unconventional, voluntary and ‘soft’ means of governance. These new means of governance work by appeals to transparency, accountability, trust, and new alliances between parties with diverging interests. Pluralistic values, opposing interests, and differential power positions are not so much conceived as a basis for negotiation and conflict, as something that can readily be transcended.</p>
<p>We have drawn (freely) on Mouffe’s proposition that conflict (of interest), agonism, and power are essential to politics, and argued that in contemporary forms of regulation, political conflicts are increasingly being transformed into moral frameworks and/or replaced by notions of consensus. With the increasing consensual, voluntary, and moral conception of regulation of market forces, the relevance of politics is downplayed. Drawing on our own research on the open method of coordination in the EU and on voluntary forms of regulation in CSR, we have suggested that the political nature of these regulatory activities and the differential power positions of actors involved are being increasingly overshadowed and invisibilized by appeals to agreement, consensus, and morals. And in this process, some choices and trade-offs are removed from contested space while other ideals and choices are naturalized. Antagonisms are reformulated into win-win terms.</p>
<p>In our interpretation, the Market and liberal modes of thought not only linger behind these types of post-political regulation, but are constitutive of them. Post-political regulation occurs at a key junction point between the economic, the social, and the ethical. Within this nexus, the issue at hand, that is, the object of regulation, is linked into capital flows, into notions of community, and into moralizing discourses. Labor market policy in the European Union and working conditions in plants down the supply chain of production, along with other issue areas, become the sites of a new range of soft law regulatory devices at the crossroads of capital and community. In the field of post-political regulation, ethical considerations are brought into alliance with the ethos of neo-liberal politics: choice, voluntarism, personal responsibility, and self-government (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0896920511413942">Rose, 1999</xref>). Corporate ethics, we suggest, exhibits <italic>a particular combination of liberal ideology, market- oriented forms of rationality, and ethical understandings</italic>.</p>
<p>Accordingly, we see this move towards post-political regulation as intrinsically linked to the spread of market ideology and market-driven calculations into the management of the administration of public organizations and into multilateral organizations, as well as into the management of individual subjects as citizens. The Market comes to assume the role of master-narrative not only for the shaping and control of markets themselves, but more generally for policy-making. A critical perspective reveals the specific alignments of market rationality, responsibility, ethics, choice, and voluntarism that mutually constitute distinctive spaces of new forms of regulation. In the area of CSR, this is most clearly articulated. CSR builds largely on the interest and mobilization of business actors to voluntarily assume social responsibility. CSR builds on the premises of financial priorities, into which social concerns and public interests are incorporated into mainstream management models. The European OMC builds as well on market priorities, offering a policy vision that does not outflank economic policy aims, but is subordinated to the goals of enhancing economic competitiveness. It is assumed that economic efficiency and social equity can be mutually supportive. This is a vision that not only suppresses politics, but forecloses it.</p>
<p>When the political is recast into ethical language, and when social issues are reconceptualized along economic lines, is there something lost, or everything gained? Can ethics replace politics? Are all aspects of the social to be judged against the calculative gauge? Can the conflicts embedded into the fashioning of European labor market policy or of defending workers’ rights and fair trade agreements be transcended by means of non-binding, market-based regulation? Whilst we cannot lay any claims to provide an answer to these large, compelling questions, we are concerned to preserve the possibility of choice and the articulation of different positions and interests. We also wish to maintain a keen eye to the political nature of contemporary regulation. As Sennett has put it, the Market, as a form of ideology, is theatrical because it entails the willing suspension of disbelief in order for us to accept its workings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0896920511413942">Sennett, 2006</xref>). Post-political regulation, emerging out of liberal thought, is itself theatrical in nature, but no less real in its consequences.</p>

<p>We would like to point out that we do not imply a temporal dimension here, nor do we suggest that post-political forms of regulation entirely substitute for conventional forms of regulation. Rather, post-political forms of regulation may appear at regular or irregular intervals, and often co-exist, to greater or lesser extent, with more conventional forms of regulation. But they lack the recognition of the agonistic character of politics in the broad sense, as well as the clear articulation of differing interests and stakes. Moreover, that it is post-political does not mean that it is in any way a-political, but that it involves a positioning of economic and social life that denies ‘politics’.</p>

<p>Admittedly, new governance tools are mostly used in areas where the EU lacks legislative competence. In areas where supranational legislation is available as an option, new governance has also increased but is not the dominant mode of regulation.</p>

<p>It should be noted, however, that it is an open and empirical question how CSR is articulated in local practice. Studies have shown that CSR may be translated into a localized construct, teasing out different perspectives based on the socio-cultural context of its implementation. See e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0896920511413942">Rajak, 2008</xref>.</p>

<p>Anthropological studies of how CSR standards and practices translate into practice, and the kinds of conflicts they may give rise to, are appearing. See e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0896920511413942">De Neve et al., 2008</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0896920511413942">Dolan, 2007</xref>.</p>
