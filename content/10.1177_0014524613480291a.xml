<title>Time for Tears?</title>
<p>‘Don’t cry,’ says Jesus, to one who is bereaved, but why not?</p>
<p>Marie died and I still think about her funeral and my problem with it. It was my first and so far my only experience a humanist funeral. Both Marie and her partner had consciously chosen not to maintain their childhood contact with organised religion and it seemed hypocritical to bring the God they did not believe in into her funeral ceremony. That was <bold>not</bold> my problem with the funeral. Nor did I have any problem with being told that it was the end, as far as a humanist is concerned, believing that there is no continued human existence beyond death. I am content to set aside questions about Marie’s continued existence and destiny, believing she is in the hands of God, whose essential nature is revealed to us through the person of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>The funeral relied heavily, perhaps too heavily, on the bereaved being able to speak about her in public whilst simultaneously coping with all of the emotional turmoil and pain of their loss. That was not my problem with the funeral. My problem with the funeral was that mourners were requested not to wear black or sombre colours associated with grief. Coming to a funeral designed as a celebration of life, we were to be brightly, indeed flamboyantly dressed. Mourners were asked to avoid looking like mourners and asked not to act like mourners. Maybe it was just me but I felt I was being told, ‘don’t cry’. Don’t cry? She was forty years old and she was dead. She had been a valued work colleague, a central figure in an amateur dramatics society, a valued friend, a beloved sister and daughter. Don’t cry? Celebrate her life by all means, I wanted to say, but at least allow a few tears. So I went, dressed appropriately, not to look out of place either at a wedding or a funeral.</p>
<p>At another funeral Jesus tells a woman, ‘don’t cry.’ She is a widow, whose only son is now being carried to his grave. So why not cry? When Lazarus was in his grave, ‘Jesus wept’ so if he can cry in such circumstances, why deny this to a mother deprived of her only son? This is the second funeral she has had to face and presumably she cried at the first one; that of her husband. If childless, she would have been thrown on the mercy of the wider family for food and for protection. No wonder that charitable treatment of widows is a test case of compassion in the scriptures and mistreating them is the mark of the tyrant who has strayed far from God.</p>
<p>Thank God she was not childless. She had a son who would protect her and care for her. But now her son, her only son is dead. Into the grave with him go her peace, security and social standing. Few among us could hold back tears, if grief at the loss of a loved one is bound up with fears for our future. And Jesus says to this woman, ‘don’t cry.’</p>
<p>But Jesus says ‘don’t cry’ because Jesus has the authority to say it and demonstrates this authority to the woman, the crowd and his disciples; authority that has power of life over death. It is the authority of God, the creator, giving the gift of life to humankind, taking it away or restoring it. The crowd, steeped in stories of scripture, leap to a link with Elijah. Confronted with a widow, teetering on the brink of starvation and deprived of her son, Elijah revived him. As the crowd at Nain puts it, ‘a great prophet’ – like Elijah – ‘has appeared among us. God has come to help his people.’</p>
<p>Yet there are differences: Elijah pleads with God and expends great energy reviving the corpse. Jesus, wielding an authority even greater than that of the great prophet, speaks, touches the coffin and addresses the corpse directly: ‘get up!’ No need to plead when the authority Jesus wields is not merely prophetic but carries the very authority of God. ‘Don’t cry,’ says Jesus, for God is present and at work among the people.</p>
<p>‘Don’t cry,’ says Jesus, because I wield this authority with divine love. John the Baptist, another one compared with Elijah, sends followers to enquire if Jesus is the expected messiah. Jesus replies: ‘Go back and report to John what you have seen and heard: the blind receive sight, the lame walk, those who have leprosy are cured, the deaf hear, the dead [like the widow’s son], are raised and the good news is preached to the poor [such as widows].’ ‘Don’t cry,’ for the God of Creation has the power of life over death and in Jesus exercises that power for the benefit of the poor of the earth.</p>
<p>Yet that can’t be the final word. Eventually, the widow’s son dies and she dies. Many of us have experienced the pain that comes with the loss of someone that we love and admire, and in our time, we too will die. In this world too many die in sad or unjust circumstances – victims of warfare, preventable disease and human greed. Jesus’ words, ‘don’t cry’ can’t be the last word on death but they are God’s <bold>first</bold> word, announcing a process underway that brings the healing of creation, including the end of suffering and death.</p>
<p>In the meantime, though, there is work still to be done. This incident did not mark the conclusion of Jesus’ ministry. Until suffering and death are done, justifiable tears and unfinished work remain. The task is massive, beyond our powers. Yet, just as Jesus’ work does not finish with the widow and her son neither is our work finished today. We have many resources - money, influence, talent – and we can use them. In the welcome a church gives others, in the care we show to each other and neighbours in time of difficulty, in the support we give to caring and campaigning organisations, we can help others to find reasons not to cry today.</p>
<p>When our contribution proves inadequate, overwhelmed by the sheer scale of human tragedy, still we have hope: Jesus’ ‘don’t cry’ is only God’s first word, pointing in turn towards God’s last word. God, who gives life, who brings this creation into being, also brings it to a healing conclusion. We hear this divine last word in the last book of the Bible, in the twenty-first chapter of the book, Revelation: <italic>‘</italic>Then [says the prophet] I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and first earth had passed away … and I heard a loud voice from the throne saying … he will wipe away every tear from their eyes. There will be no more death or mourning or crying or pain, for the old order of things has passed away.’ Looking back to Jesus’ first words to a widow, doing our best to respond in our time, how we look forward to that time when Jesus’ first word is recognised and heard in God’s last word made complete: ‘don’t cry’.</p>
