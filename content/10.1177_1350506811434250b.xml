<p>Published in the year of the Arab revolutions dubbed the ‘Arab Spring’ that transformed citizenship in the Middle East, Nahla Abdo’s <italic>Women in Israel</italic> is a timely, elegant text that adopts a historical, comparative approach to theorizing citizenship in Israel through a focus on Palestinians and Mizrahi Jews. Abdo uses the term <italic>Mizrahis</italic> to distinguish Jews who originated predominantly from the Arab or Muslim worlds from Ashkenazis or European Jews. Her politically engaged work challenges the Israeli status quo by deconstructing dominant discourses about citizenship, inclusion and exclusion.</p>
<p>For Abdo, the driving force for writing <italic>Women in Israel</italic> was her concern for marginalized Palestinian women and the book is informed by an ‘anti-racist and anti-colonial feminist methodology situated within the larger context of Marxist political economy’ (p. 50). Abdo, who has been involved in the Palestinian women’s and civil rights movements in Israel for the last two decades, employs feminist methodology with the stated aim of creating a space ‘to give voice to the marginalized and silenced’ (p. 11). At the same time, she recognizes the importance of not viewing the marginalized as silent victims of oppression, acknowledging that they are also agents of change.</p>
<p><italic>Women in Israel</italic> is enriched by a critical engagement with literature on citizenship, Israel, women and feminism that contributes to making it a valuable resource not only for specialists in these areas but also for those with limited knowledge who are keen to learn more. The clarity with which Abdo writes allows her to develop complex arguments in an accessible way that makes her text a pleasure to read. Drawing on the work of the feminists Audre Lorde and Chandra Talpade Mohanty, Abdo critiques the concept of ‘global sisterhood’ on the grounds that it erases power, class and culture and assumes essentialist experiences of womanhood. She is equally critical of Ashkenazi feminist writers who dominate writing on women in Israel and produce literature that mostly ignores the experiences of Mizrahi and Palestinian women. She argues that Ashkenazi feminists have ‘strengthened Jewish patriarchy through their legitimization of Zionism as the Jewish national movement and the failure to challenge Israel as a Jewish state’ (p. 74), and she asserts that feminist analyses of women’s citizenship in Israel need to adopt an anti-Zionist stance.</p>
<p>Abdo aims to bridge what she describes as the significant gap between the dominance of male-produced literature on citizenship in Israel that remains gender neutral, although it is structurally and theoretically grounded, and the majority of feminist literature in Israel that is predominantly based on micro-level analysis. She stresses the need to engage critically with Israel as a settler colonial regime, arguing that ‘settler colonialism as a frame of analysis provides a more inclusive account and appropriate conceptual tool for understanding the classed, racialized, ethnicized and gendered nature of Israeli citizenship’ (p. 19).</p>
<p>Abdo argues that feminist literature on the Middle East ‘tends to overemphasize the roles of cultural institutions, such as the “family”, “nationalism” and “religion”’ (p. 3) in conferring women’s citizenship status. At the same time, it de-emphasizes the role of the state and colonialism. For this reason, Abdo suggests that it is important to challenge this literature.</p>
<p>In an illuminating critique of the literature on women in Israel, Abdo argues that much of the work in the Israeli–Palestinian nationalist context has equated Jewish nationalism and Zionism with Palestinian nationalism because it has concentrated mainly ‘on the similarities of marginalization and exploitation of nationalism towards all women citizens’ (p. 31). She also argues that Palestinian feminist studies do not outline the role of the Israeli state in (re)shaping women’s status and that feminist scholarship on Mizrahi women is sparse.</p>
<p>Abdo’s central thesis is that exclusion (or racial separation) is at the centre of the Zionist colonial-settler project and that it aims to establish an exclusionary and exclusivist Jewish state in Palestine. She argues that the Israeli structure of racialized exclusion and inclusion positions Palestinian women ‘at the edge of the most marginalized collectivities/groups’ (p. 43) and Mizrahi Jewish women as second-class citizens.</p>

<p>Approaching the state as settler-colonial and racist allows us to see the exclusion of Palestinian citizens (and also Mizrahi women), and their racially based inclusion or marginalization, not in terms of ethnic, religious or cultural polarity, difference or differentiation, but rather as fundamental components of the political economy of the settler-colonial state. (p. 19)</p>

<p>Abdo suggests that there is a hierarchy with Ashkenazi Jews at the top, Palestinians at the bottom and Mizrahi Jews in between. She challenges culturalist arguments that attribute the high unemployment of Palestinian women to their culture or education, arguing instead that the most significant contributing factor is structural and institutional racism. Similarly, she argues that discrimination in education affects Palestinian women’s participation in society.</p>
<p>One of the many contributions made by <italic>Women in Israel</italic> is to the understanding of the nuanced complexity of racialization. Abdo shows that ‘racialization occurs not only between the Jews as a majority and Arabs/Palestinians as a minority, but also among Jews – between European (white) Jews and Mizrahi Jews (the overwhelming majority of whom came from Arab countries’ (p. 2). She argues that Mizrahi Jewish women from Arab countries are ‘orientalised’ and ‘othered’ in Israel ‘through a set of institutional policies and practices which subjugated them economically, socially and educationally’ (p. 88). Consistent with her recognition that marginalized women in Israel are agents of change, Abdo highlights the ways in which the vast majority of Mizrahi feminists reject Zionist discourses that seek to homogenize Jewish Israelis, but simultaneously exclude Mizrahi Jews, masking ‘their history, reality and identity’ (p. 34). Furthermore, she argues that official Israeli statistics and reports impede a greater understanding of the experiences and positioning of Mizrahi women by presenting Jews as if they constitute one category.</p>

<p>Ashkenazi feminist literature on Israeli military and Zionist nationalism, while not only ignoring the offensive and destructive role of Israeli’s [<italic>sic</italic>] military establishment towards Palestinian Arab women (and men) also silences the Mizrahi Jews who have been turned into the other by the state itself. The Jewish Ashkenazi literature is concerned instead with one nationalism and one Jewishness, it provides an essentialist meaning of Zionism as an expression of the national movement of all Jews. (p. 34)</p>

<p><italic>Women in Israel</italic> makes important political contributions and is well written and stimulating. Abdo critically engages with the contemporary political discourses that permeate Israel, and her argument that Israel is a settler colonial state that needs to be transformed is convincingly made. It is difficult to fault <italic>Women in Israel</italic>, but one possible shortcoming concerns Abdo’s engagement with Bedouin women in Israel. She warns that various works segment Palestinians into scattered groups, treating them ‘not as an indigenous people but as segments made up of Muslims, Christians, Druze and Bedouin’ (p. 17). Nonetheless, she highlights the Israeli state’s ‘extreme oppression of and discrimination against the Bedouin population’ (p. 184) and argues that Bedouin women are at the bottom of the hierarchy of Palestinian women in Israel. Given her stated commitment to focusing on the marginalized, the situation of Bedouin women could have been given slightly more attention.</p>
<p><italic>Women in Israel</italic> is an extensively researched, well-written, engaging and thought-provoking text that calls for an anti-Zionist theorization with the ‘potential to create an alternative Israel in the Middle East, one that is secular, democratic and inclusive’ (p. 37). The debates Abdo raises are particularly relevant in the year in which this book was published when the future of Israel and Palestine was pushed high up the international political agenda by Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas’s formal application to the UN Security Council for Palestinian Statehood in September 2011.</p>
<p>Abdo’s passion and commitment to contributing to debates about reforming Israel run throughout <italic>Women in Israel</italic> and contribute to making it a compelling read that I would highly recommend.</p>
