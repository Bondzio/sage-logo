<abstract>
<p>In this study, Al–Cu-based three-layered metal matrix composites reinforced with TiC particles were produced successfully by a conventional hot pressing method under argon (Ar) atmosphere. To evaluate the effect of heat treatment, the composites were treated for 24 h at 530°C and then aged in an oil bath at 180°C for various aging periods. The multi-layered composite was characterized by SEM, EDS, XRD, and the Vickers microhardness test. It was concluded that the peak hardness for the multi-layered composite was observed, when the aging period was extended up to approximately 12 h. The hardness of the middle layer increased from approximately 140 to 291 HV within 12 h. The corrosion resistance of the composites decreased with increasing aging time and some preferential corrosion attack was detected in the composite layers. In addition, it was found that the pitting susceptibility of unaged composites was also higher than that of all the aged specimens.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0021998311418548" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Aluminum-based metal matrix composites (AMMCs) reinforced with ceramic particles are known as very promising materials due to their isotropic characteristics, excellent combination of strength-to-weight ratio and high-temperature properties compared to unreinforced composites.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021998311418548">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0021998311418548">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>In recent decades, there has been great interest in the design, fabrication and mechanical behavior of a variety of multi-layered composites or functional gradient materials (FGM).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0021998311418548">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021998311418548">9</xref></sup> FGMs are materials with a variation of composition and microstructure through their thickness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0021998311418548">10</xref></sup> It has been shown that enhanced strength and toughness in combination with improved damage resistance can be achieved for these composites. The performance of FGMs depends on the processing strategies adopted and the resulting microstructure. Mixing and blending of the elemental powders and then pressing them under high pressure has been used to produce composites with superior properties such a higher elastic modulus, good fracture toughness, high wear resistance, excellent creep properties, and higher yield strength than the unreinforced alloys.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021998311418548">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021998311418548">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0021998311418548">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>In particular, Al–TiC particle composites or their laminate systems have important potential for structural applications because of their combination of high strength, toughness and stiffness at a low density.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0021998311418548">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0021998311418548">15</xref></sup> The multi-layered structure of the composite allows for variations in the layer thickness and phase volume fractions of the Al and TiC or different components simply through the selection of initial thickness. This selection consequently allows for the optimization of mechanical and thermal management properties for practical application.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0021998311418548">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0021998311418548">15</xref></sup> However, in these studies, pressure and heating process are simultaneously applied to the mold under nitrogen atmosphere. Consequently, it is unavoidable that the main matrix and the reinforcing particles react with oxygen at elevated temperatures to form some oxides which, in turn, will weaken interfacial bonding and thus decrease related mechanical properties. Moreover, there is little information available in the literature on this processing technique.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0021998311418548">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0021998311418548">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0021998311418548">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>Hot pressing (HP) of powders with a small amount of liquid phase is used as a simple and less complicated consolidation method to fabricate porosity-free AMMCs with homogeneously dispersed particles. With hot pressing, the advantages of both powder metallurgy and liquid state production techniques are achieved. Fully dense metal powder compacts with controlled microstructures can be produced by hot consolidation in which pressure and heat are applied simultaneously rather than sequentially, as in conventional powder metallurgy processing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0021998311418548">18</xref></sup> On the other hand, in order to improve the mechanical properties of the particle reinforced composite systems, the layered configuration is adopted as an alternative layer metal/ceramic composite. The main advantages of such a material system are in-plane isotropy of both strength and modulus, relatively high specific strength and modulus, high toughness and a relatively low cost due to a simpler processing route. However, all the above properties depend on the architecture of the composite.</p>
<p>It is well known that the corrosion resistance of AMMCs is provided by a protective oxide film.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0021998311418548">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0021998311418548">20</xref></sup> Protectiveness can be affected especially by: (i) morphology of the oxide film, (ii) volume fraction of reinforcement, (iii) heat treatment type performed on the composites and (iv) alloying type added to the matrix.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021998311418548">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021998311418548">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0021998311418548">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0021998311418548">21</xref></sup> The addition of a reinforcing phase in the matrix causes discontinuities or defects in the surface oxide film, and hence increases the regions for pitting initiation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0021998311418548">22</xref></sup> Besides, when an alloy element such as Cu is added to this matrix, the intermetallic phase (Al<sub>2</sub>Cu) is formed by aging effects, which negatively affects the oxidation resistance and porosity level.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0021998311418548">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0021998311418548">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0021998311418548">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>The purpose of this article is to document the effect of TiC particle reinforcement volume fraction in the composite layers and aging kinetics on the corrosion behavior of an Al–Cu matrix laminated composite reinforced with 20 and 40 vol.% TiC particles.</p></sec>

<sec id="sec3-0021998311418548"><title>Fabrication of multi-layered composite</title>
<p>The chemical composition of the matrix alloy used in this study is Al–5wt% Cu, and consists of pure Al powder (purity 99.9%, &lt;25 μm) and pure Cu powder (purity 99.9%, &lt;63 μm). Cu powder is added to the mixture to form the liquid phase and aid densification during hot pressing. Three different composite mixtures were prepared by mixing TiC particles (purity 99%, &lt;10 μm) of 20 vol.% and 40 separately, with the matrix alloy with the addition of a small amount of isopropyl alcohol.</p>
<p>The composite powder was either filled to form a single layer or stacked as layers in a uniaxial die, made of X40CrMoV51 (AISI H13) hot work tool steel having a rectangular cross-section of 30 × 40 mm<sup>2</sup>, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0021998311418548">Figure 1</xref>. In the single layer case, the powder mixture in the die was hot consolidated by pressure and heat applied simultaneously as described in our previous studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0021998311418548">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0021998311418548">26</xref></sup> However, in the three-layered case, the first powder mixture (L1) was cold consolidated in the die, afterwards the second layer (L2) was placed on top and both layers were again cold consolidated, the last layer (L3) was placed on top of the two layers, then the compacted layers were hot consolidated. The cold pressing processes were at 40 bar pressure and hot pressing was at 600°C (rising at a rate of 20°C/min.) with 25 bar constant pressure. An argon atmosphere was maintained in the furnace to reduce oxidation. In order to avoid a porous structure in the composite the pressure on the specimen was not released for 5 min until consolidation was finished followed by cooling the specimen down to 350°C.

<sec id="sec4-0021998311418548"><title>Characterization</title>
<p>As seen from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0021998311418548">Figure 2</xref>, metallographic observations were carried out in two different directions on the upper surface of the specimen (marked as A in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0021998311418548">Figure 2</xref>) and on the cross section of the multi-layered composite (marked as B in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0021998311418548">Figure 2</xref>). A scanning electron microscope (SEM, Jeol JSM–6335F) with attached electron dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) was used for microstructural characterization of the multi-layered composite. The specimens were prepared by grinding with 400 to 1200 grit papers and polished with 6–3–1 μm diamond pastes before the corrosion tests. The specimens were cleaned ultrasonically to remove corrosion products from the composite surface after the corrosion tests. In addition, X-ray diffraction (XRD) was used to determine the phases that occur at the matrix–reinforcement interface.

<sec id="sec5-0021998311418548"><title>Age hardening behavior</title>
<p>To determine the age-hardening behavior of the composites, the specimens which were cut from the composite (as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0021998311418548">Figure 2(b)</xref>), were solution treated for 24 h at 530°C and water quenched. The specimens were transferred to an oil bath and age-hardened at 180°C for various aging periods of 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 24, 48, and 96 h. The Vickers hardness (HV) of the unaged and artificially aged (T6) multi-layered composites were measured using a PC-controlled microhardness tester (BUEHLER, Micromet 2001) at a load of 50gf with a loading time of 10 s. Hardness measurements were carried out on both the cross-sections and the upper surface of the multi-layered composite. The hardness values reported were an average of 10 measurements selected randomly in the alloy matrix of the composites.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec6-0021998311418548"><title>Corrosion tests</title>
<p>Corrosion tests were carried out to determine both the interface stability between layers and the corrosion resistance of the upper surface of the multi-layered composite. Electrochemical investigations of the multi-layered composite were performed by a potentiodynamic scanning (PDS) technique. All experiments were carried out with a computer-controlled potentiostat/galvanostat (PCI4/750, GAMRY Instruments, Inc., Warminster, PA) in aerated and deaerated 3.5% NaCl solution at room temperature. Ag/AgCl and platinum (Pt) electrodes were used as a reference and auxiliary electrode, respectively. Firstly, to obtain the PDS curves the specimens were immersed in the solution until a steady open circuit potential (OCP) was reached. After equilibration, polarization started at a rate of 1 mV/s. The PDS began at the cathodic overpotential and the scan was stopped when the specimens reached an anodic corrosion current density of 10 mA/cm<sup>2</sup>. In the second type of the tests, the solution was deaerated with nitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>) gas in order to remove the oxygen. The deaeration process was started 60 min prior to the measurements and continued until the end of the experiment. Scanning began at the cathodic overpotential as for the tests in the aerated condition and the scan was stopped when the specimens reached an anodic corrosion current density of 1 mA/cm<sup>2</sup>.</p></sec></sec>
<sec id="sec7-0021998311418548" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title>
<p>The reinforcement distribution in the cross section of the layers is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0021998311418548">Figure 3</xref>. The results showed that the distribution of TiC particles was generally uniform but some agglomerations were observed in L2 due to the high reinforcement content of the layer. In addition, metallographic observations on L1 and L3 were very similar due to the same reinforcement content of the layers. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0021998311418548">Figure 4</xref> shows a higher magnification of the TiC particles, it indicates good bonding at the interface between the matrix and TiC and no pores are presented. In addition, the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns indicate that the Al<sub>4</sub>C<sub>3</sub> reaction product does not exist (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0021998311418548">Figure 5</xref>). It is well known that Al<sub>4</sub>C<sub>3</sub> has a detrimental effect on mechanical properties and corrosion resistance of Al–TiC particle composites because it is a brittle and degradative reaction compound. It reduces the interfacial bond strength and ductility and increases the corrosion susceptibility of the multi-layered composite. The analysis also shows that increased aging time decreased the peak intensities of the aluminum and CuAl<sub>2</sub> intermetallics were completely detected peak-aged specimen for 12 h.

<fig id="fig4-0021998311418548" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>SEM image on cross section of the L3 layer of the multi-layered composite and its X-ray mapping results.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0021998311418548-fig4.tif"/></fig>

<p>X-ray mapping results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0021998311418548">Figure 4</xref>) justify the presence of Al, Cu, and TiC particles in the multi-layered composite. Also, this result indicates that Cu diffusion takes place at the matrix/TiC interfaces during the production process but based on the EDS results the amount of copper diffusion in L2 was more than in L1 and L3. The results of X-ray maps of multi-layered composite show that the Cu concentration is relatively high around TiC particles.</p>
<p>It is well known that Al-based metal matrix composites are generally prepared from pre-alloyed Al powder, in which the alloying elements are balanced to yield an optimum aging response.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0021998311418548">27</xref></sup> In this study, the age hardening response of the multi-layered composite was investigated. The aim was to see the level of hardness attained in the hot pressed laminated composite and its unaged counterpart. The variation of hardness values with aging time are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0021998311418548">Figure 6</xref>. These curves are used to determine the aging time corresponding to the maximum hardness in the T6 state. It was concluded that peak hardness for multi-layered composite was observed, when the aging period was extended up to approximately 12 h. The hardness of the composite upper surface (A) increased from approximately 112 to 175 HV in 12 h. As can be seen from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0021998311418548">Figure 6</xref>, all hardness values of the upper surface were lower than on the cross-section. A small amount of TiC reinforcement moves from top to bottom of L3 due to the effect of gravity on the liquid phase and differences in the density of the Al alloy matrix (2.80 g/cm<sup>3</sup>) and the TiC particles (4.95 g/cm<sup>3</sup>) at the uses hot pressing temperature (600°C). Thus, the upper surface of L3 contains relatively less reinforcement than the inner section, and as a result, the lower the hardness of the surface. In addition, under all aging conditions, the hardness values of L2 were higher than L1, L3 and the upper surface of the composite due to its higher TiC particle content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0021998311418548">Figure 7</xref>).
<fig id="fig6-0021998311418548" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p>Age hardening curves of the multi-layered composite layers artificially aged at 180°C.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0021998311418548-fig6.tif"/></fig>
<fig id="fig7-0021998311418548" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><p>Age-hardening response of the multi-layered composite under selected aging conditions (underaged – 2 h, peak-aged – 12 h, and overaged – 96 h) after artificially aging treatment at 180°C.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0021998311418548-fig7.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The reinforced particles in the metal matrix increase the strain energy at the periphery of the particles in the matrix. Dislocations are generated in the matrix/TiC interfaces due to the difference in the thermal expansion coefficient between the matrix and the ceramic particles during solution heat treatment and quenching.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0021998311418548">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0021998311418548">31</xref></sup> Thus, dislocations gave rise to an increase hardness of the composite because they acted as nonuniform nucleation sites at the interface following the aging treatment. It is thought that as the amount of the ceramic particles in the matrix increases, the dislocation density increases; as a result, the hardness of the multi-layered composite will increase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0021998311418548">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0021998311418548">7</xref>).</p>
<p>As observed in the aging tests, the composite seems to respond well to age-hardening. The hardness of L2 increased from approximately 140 to 291 HV within 12 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0021998311418548">Figure 7</xref>). A decrease in hardness was observed after the aging period was extended beyond 12 h. In all cases, the hardness of L2 was higher than L1 and L3 as expected. A possible reason may be the higher particle content of L2 and an uneven distribution of the Cu.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021998311418548">2</xref></sup> However, it is believed that the aging response of the hot pressed specimens can contribute to the strength level of these composites. From the literature it can be seen that age hardener SiC-based composites yielded lower hardness values with respect to TiC-based ones at equivalent reinforcement content. The hardness values of the Al–30 vol.%SiC (average 10 μm particle size) specimen are substantially lower in comparison to the Al–TiC (&lt;10 μm) composites, the reason for the lower hardness values of Al–SiC composites was not understood well. Among a number of possible reasons, the different hardness levels or the wetting properties of the reinforcing phases can be mentioned as a cause of this consequence.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021998311418548">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0021998311418548">28</xref></sup></p>
<p>To assess the effect of the T6 treatment on the electrochemical behavior, samples were selected for under (2 h), peak (12 h) and over aging (96 h) conditions.

<p>All curves exhibit a well-defined pitting potential, <italic>E</italic><sub>pit</sub>, followed by a passive region at a current density of around 1 μA cm<sup>-2</sup>. The point of pitting is seen clearly under deaerated conditions. Also, the results indicate a negative decrease in the <italic>E</italic><sub>pit</sub> and <italic>E</italic><sub>corr</sub> values with increased aging time for the multi-layered composite. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0021998311418548">Table 1</xref> also demonstrates that, the current density values in the cross-section and the upper surface of the multi-layered composite under deaerated conditions increase with increasing aging time. In other words, the results indicate a decreasing corrosion resistance as both the TiC particle content and the aging time increased for the multi-layered composite the extent of the passive region of the composites increases with increasing aging time as seen from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0021998311418548">Figures 10</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0021998311418548">11</xref>, the widest passive regions were in the unaged composites, the range being 316 and 381 mV for surfaces A and B, respectively.</p>
<p>Nowadays, aging treatments have been widely used to increase the strength of Al–Cu alloys. However, several corrosion studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0021998311418548">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0021998311418548">35</xref></sup> have indicated that aging treatment might affect greatly the corrosion behavior of AMMCs. Lucas and Clarke<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0021998311418548">36</xref></sup> summarized that the composition, volume fraction, location, and potential of the precipitates (or micro constituents) have a direct effect on the amount, form and distribution of the corrosion attack on the MMC. Hollingsworth et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0021998311418548">35</xref></sup> reported that the solution potential of CuAl<sub>2</sub> is −730mV and this value is more noble than the solution potential of aluminum (−840 mV). In other words, the CuAl<sub>2</sub> phases act as the cathode in Cu-containing Al alloys and the situation causes potential differences in Al alloys or its composites.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0021998311418548">36</xref></sup> Increasing the aging time forms larger precipitates at the Al/TiC interfaces, thus, increasing the cathodic activity at the interfaces.</p>
<p>It is well known that Al–Cu alloys are especially susceptible to pitting corrosion. This is partly due to the potential difference variations of the Cu present in the solution-solid, in other words resulting from galvanic couples forming between the Al and Cu. However, according to Lucas and Clarke,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0021998311418548">36</xref></sup> the primary reason for their poor corrosion resistance is attributable to the deposition of minute particles or films of copper on the alloy surface resulting from corrosion processes. The Cu and Al oxide films formed on the material surface are different from each other. So the protective oxide layer on the surface under unaged conditions is more complex when compared with the aged conditions. Because the aging mechanism for Al–Cu alloys develops by the controlled decomposition of the unstable supersaturated solid solution.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0021998311418548">37</xref></sup> During the aging process, Cu atoms depart from the Al lattice to form the Al<sub>2</sub>Cu phase. During aging, the amount of free-Cu in the matrix decreases due to the formation of the Al<sub>2</sub>Cu intermetallic phase. In this case the protective oxide layer is less complex or better than that formed on unaged composites (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0021998311418548">Table 1</xref>).</p>
<p>According to the literature, the fluctuations of potential and current density values given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0021998311418548">Table 1</xref> are generally influenced by phenomena at the matrix/reinforcement interfaces, for example voids at the TiC/Al interface, reactions between the Al alloy matrix and TiC particles, segregation of alloy elements to the TiC/Al interface, high dislocation densities and residual stresses formed in the vicinity of TiC particles. The corrosion resistance of AMMCs may be greatly affected by these factors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0021998311418548">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0021998311418548">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0021998311418548">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0021998311418548">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0021998311418548">40</xref></sup> Therefore, the current density value is directly related to the electrode potential, and it can provide more realistic results related to the electrochemical behavior of the composites.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0021998311418548">41</xref></sup> It can be seen from <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0021998311418548">Table 1</xref>, the corrosion current density (<italic>i</italic><sub>cor</sub>) of the multi-layered composite increases with increasing aging time. In addition, the <italic>i</italic><sub>corr</sub> values of the A and B surfaces in the unaged specimens were higher than in all aged specimens. After the aging process, strains in the Al lattice relax. Therefore, the Al lattice distortion decreases relative to the unaged state. This is one of the reason for the higher corrosion resistance of the aged composites may be the relaxation of these strains.</p>
<p>Consequently, it can be said that peak and overaged multi-layered composites are more susceptible to pitting corrosion than underaged multi-layered composites. Both CuAl<sub>2</sub> precipitates at the TiC particle/matrix alloy interfaces and high TiC particle content form interparticular paths susceptible to pitting corrosion attack. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-0021998311418548">Figure 12</xref> supports the idea. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-0021998311418548">Figure 12(a)</xref> shows the propagation of pits at early and late stages of corrosion at the matrix/TiC particle interfaces of the overaged and peak-aged L2 that contains a higher particle content than L1 and L3. The new nucleated pits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-0021998311418548">Figure 12(a)</xref>) tend to form large clusters of pits in localized regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-0021998311418548">Figure 12(b)</xref>). However, observations on L1 and L3 demonstrate that corrosion attack starts at interfaces as in L2 but corrosion progresses throughout the matrix alloy rather than at the TiC/matrix interfaces in the layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-0021998311418548">Figure 13</xref>). It can be said that TiC particles play an influential role at starting corrosion in all layers of the composite under all aging conditions but the alloying content of the matrix is dominant for the progression of the corrosion.

<p>SEM examination also revealed that a clean interface and a good wettability exists between the TiC particles and the aluminum matrix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0021998311418548">Figures 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0021998311418548">4</xref>). However, as described in the experimental section, there was a difference in consolidation between layers when a layer was placed on the other layer during the production process. The formation of porosity is inevitable due to especially the TiC particle content difference between the layers in this case. This porosity may have also formed due to the aggregation of reinforcement particles pushed which is called ‘clusters’<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0021998311418548">42</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0021998311418548">43</xref></sup> by the matrix dendrites during solidification. Another reason for the porosity is the surface energy difference between the Al and TiC.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0021998311418548">4</xref></sup> The porosity acts as fracture and corrosion starting points in the cast microstructure. However, it has been widely accepted that residual stresses have no or little effect on the corrosion behavior of the AMMCs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0021998311418548">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0021998311418548">44</xref></sup> Some preferentially corrosion paths have been detected between the composite layers after the corrosion test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14-0021998311418548">Figure 14</xref>). Therefore, it can be said that porosity might be causing the change of corrosion morphology of the composite because there are heterogeneous stress distributions around the porosity. This approach is also in agreement with the studies of Trzaskoma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0021998311418548">44</xref></sup> and Ahmed et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0021998311418548">45</xref></sup>

<p>In this study, Al–Cu-based three-layered metal matrix composites reinforced with TiC particles was produced successfully by a conventional hot pressing method under an argon (Ar) atmosphere. In addition, the effect of the TiC reinforcement volume fraction in the composite layers and the aging kinetics on the corrosion behavior of the multi-layered composite was investigated. It was found that peak hardness for multi-layered composite was observed, when the aging period was extended up to approximately 12 h. The hardness of the middle layer increased from approximately 140 to 291 HV within 12 h. In all aging conditions, the hardness values of L2 were higher than L1 and L3 due to its higher TiC particle content in cross-section. These tendencies may be due to the formation of dislocations at the boundary of the TiC particles caused by the difference in the thermal expansion coefficient between the matrix and the ceramic particles during solution heat treatment and quenching. Electrochemical tests show that the corrosion resistance of the multi-layered composite decreased with increasing aging time. In addition, it was found that the pitting susceptibility of the unaged composites was also higher than all of the aged specimens. Metallographic observations show that both CuAl<sub>2</sub> precipitation at the TiC particle/matrix alloy interfaces during the aging process and a high TiC particle content form interparticular paths susceptible to pitting corrosion attack, also, some preferentially corrosion attack took place formed in the composite layers.</p></sec>
