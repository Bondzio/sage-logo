<abstract>
<p>Using data from the Education Longitudinal Study, this study assessed the relevance of shadow education to the high academic performance of East Asian American students by examining how East Asian American students differed from other racial/ethnic students in the prevalence, purpose, and effects of using the two forms—commercial test preparation service and private one-to-one tutoring—of SAT coaching, defined as the American style of shadow education. East Asian American students were most likely to take a commercial SAT test preparation course for the enrichment purpose and benefited most from taking this particular form of SAT coaching. However, this was not the case for private SAT one-to-one tutoring. While black students were most likely to utilize private tutoring for the remedial purpose, the impact of private tutoring was trivial for all racial/ethnic groups, including East Asian American students. The authors discuss broader implications of the findings on racial/ethnic inequalities in educational achievement beyond the relevance of shadow education for the academic success of East Asian American students.</p>

<p>The academic success of Asian American youth, often labeled as a <italic>model minority</italic>, has been well documented in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0038040711417009">Kao and Thompson 2003</xref>). For example, among college-bound seniors in 2008-2009, the average SAT math score for Asian American students was 587, while the corresponding average SAT scores for white and black students were 536 and 426, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0038040711417009">Snyder and Dillow 2010</xref>). Furthermore, among a cohort of 2002 high school sophomores, about 29 percent of Asian American students were enrolled in a highly selective four-year college as of 2006, while only 17 percent, 4 percent, and 5 percent of white, black, and Hispanic students, respectively, were enrolled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0038040711417009">Bozick and Lauff 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Various factors have been suggested to explain the academic performance of Asian American children, including the relatively high socioeconomic standing of their families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0038040711417009">Kao 1995</xref>), cultural arrangements in which their families place a high value on education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0038040711417009">Schneider and Lee 1990</xref>), high educational expectations of both parents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0038040711417009">Goyette and Xie 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0038040711417009">Kao 2002</xref>) and children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0038040711417009">Kao and Tienda 1998</xref>), and specific parental styles and involvement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0038040711417009">Hao and Bonstead-Bruns 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0038040711417009">Kao 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0038040711417009">2004a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0038040711417009">Pong, Hao, and Gardner 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0038040711417009">Sun 1998</xref>). However, empirical research shows that these varying factors explain only some of the relatively high achievement of Asian American youth, but not all (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0038040711417009">Kao and Thompson 2003</xref>). In fact, some researchers (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0038040711417009">Goyette and Xie 1999</xref>) question the relevance of the socioeconomic approach because poverty rates are relatively high among some Asian immigrants (e.g., Lao or Cambodian Americans; see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0038040711417009">Table 2</xref> in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0038040711417009">Lee 1994</xref>). Other researchers (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0038040711417009">Kao 2004b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0038040711417009">Kao and Rutherford 2007</xref>) cast doubts on the validity of cultural explanations as Asian American youth are more disadvantaged in some forms of parental involvement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0038040711417009">Ho and Willms 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0038040711417009">Kao 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0038040711417009">2004a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0038040711417009">Kao and Rutherford 2007</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0038040711417009">1</xref></sup> While identifying shortcomings of the socioeconomic and cultural arguments, this line of research calls for alternative views and investigations of mechanisms responsible for the high educational achievement of children of Asian immigrants.</p>
<p>In searching for alternative factors affecting Asian American students’ education, some researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0038040711417009">Kao 2004b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0038040711417009">Kao and Thompson 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0038040711417009">Zhou 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0038040711417009">Zhou and Kim 2006</xref>) and mainstream media such as the <italic>New York Times</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0038040711417009">Dunn 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0038040711417009">Hernandez 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0038040711417009">Luo 2003</xref>) have drawn attention to the high level of participation of Asian American students in various forms of private supplementary education occurring outside of the formal schools, including private tutoring, private learning centers, private test preparation services, or cram schools. Often conceptualized as <italic>shadow education</italic>, these out-of-school activities aim to help students master academic subjects of school curriculum and improve academic performance in school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0038040711417009">Bray 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0038040711417009">Stevenson and Baker 1992</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0038040711417009">2</xref></sup> However, little is known about motivation and consequences of participation in various forms of shadow education activities among Asian American students, in comparison to other racial/ethnic groups of students.</p>
<p>In this study, we aim to reduce this research gap by investigating the extent to which shadow education contributes to the high performance of children of Asian immigrants, especially focusing on East Asian American students. As will be described in more detail in the following, our rationale of focusing on East Asian American students as a distinctive group is that various shadow education activities such as attending cram schools<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0038040711417009">3</xref></sup>—<italic>hagwon</italic> in Korea, <italic>juku</italic> in Japan, and <italic>buxiban</italic> in Taiwan—and receiving private tutoring have long been practiced in a large scale in East Asian immigrants’ home societies such as Hong Kong (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0038040711417009">Bray and Kwok 2003</xref>), Taiwan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0038040711417009">Kuan 2008</xref>), Korea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0038040711417009">Byun 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0038040711417009">Park, Byun, and Kim 2011</xref>), and Japan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0038040711417009">Cummings 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0038040711417009">Mori and Baker 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0038040711417009">Stevenson and Baker 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0038040711417009">Yamamoto and Brinton 2010</xref>). Moreover, the number of various shadow education institutions such as cram schools has dramatically increased in the communities, especially of East Asian immigrants such as Chinese and Koreans, in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0038040711417009">Shrake 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0038040711417009">Zhou 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0038040711417009">Zhou and Kim 2006</xref>). Additionally, East Asian immigrant students (e.g., Chinese, Japanese, and Koreans) as a group have drawn special attention due to their relatively high educational achievement compared to other Asian and non-Asian immigrant students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0038040711417009">Hao and Bonstead-Bruns 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0038040711417009">Schneider and Lee 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0038040711417009">Sun 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>We draw on recent research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0038040711417009">Buchmann, Condron, and Roscigno (2010)</xref> defining various forms of SAT test preparation such as receiving private tutoring or taking a course offered by a commercial test preparation service as <italic>American style of shadow education</italic>. Using data from the National Education Longitudinal Study (NELS), Buchmann and her colleagues addressed how participation in various forms of SAT test preparation mediates educational inequality associated with family socioeconomic background in the context of U.S. education. Their study highlighted the role of shadow education, which has been overlooked in the U.S. literature, and extended our understanding of specific ways in which educational inequality is reproduced through shadow education in the U.S. context. In this study, while following Buchmann et al., we are interested in the two forms of SAT test preparation—(a) taking a commercial SAT test preparation course and (b) receiving private SAT one-to-one tutoring. Among various forms of SAT test preparation, these two particular forms are closest to the two most common forms of shadow education in East Asian societies: (a) cram schooling and (b) individual private tutoring.</p>
<p>We extend Buchmann et al.’s (2010) work in several important ways. First, we analyze data from the Education Longitudinal Study (ELS) that has followed a more recent cohort of U.S. high school students. Buchmann et al. examined high school seniors in 1992 from NELS, a decade earlier than high school seniors in 2004 from ELS. As Buchmann et al. acknowledged, the importance of the SAT for college admission has increased over the past decade. Accordingly, demand for SAT preparation services has likely grown during the past decade. Drawing on the more recent data of ELS, we can better address a recent trend in the prevalence, purpose, and effect of SAT coaching among students of diverse racial/ethnic background.</p>
<p>Second, we investigate differences in the <italic>prevalence</italic> of utilizing the two particular forms of SAT coaching between East Asian American students and other racial/ethnic students (including other Asian American students). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0038040711417009">Buchmann et al. (2010)</xref> primarily focused on socioeconomic differences in SAT coaching, but did not fully examine racial/ethnic variation. Furthermore, they considered Asian Americans as a homogenous group with a single category of “Asian American.” However, as many studies have documented, Asian Americans consist of various heterogeneous groups in their learning opportunities and educational outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0038040711417009">Goyette and Xie 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0038040711417009">Hao and Bonstead-Bruns 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0038040711417009">Kao 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0038040711417009">Sun 1998</xref>). This may also be true for shadow education, given that it has been a major feature of education in East Asian societies such as Japan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0038040711417009">Cummings 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0038040711417009">Mori and Baker 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0038040711417009">Stevenson and Baker 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0038040711417009">Yamamoto and Brinton 2010</xref>), Korea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0038040711417009">Byun 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0038040711417009">Park et al. 2011</xref>), and Hong Kong (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0038040711417009">Bray and Kwok 2003</xref>), even though it is increasingly becoming a worldwide phenomenon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0038040711417009">Baker and LeTendre 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0038040711417009">Bray 2009</xref>; C. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0038040711417009">Lee, Park, and Lee 2009</xref>). By distinguishing East Asian American students from other Asian American students, we can better address variation in the prevalence of SAT coaching among students of diverse racial/ethnic background.</p>
<p>Third, we address a potential difference in the <italic>purpose</italic> of taking SAT coaching between East Asian American students and other racial/ethnic students by examining the relationship between prior achievement and SAT coaching. Some racial/ethnic groups may take SAT coaching to keep up with their peers (<italic>remedial purposes</italic>), while other racial/ethnic groups may do so to stay ahead of their peers (<italic>enrichment purposes</italic>). By examining potential variation among racial/ethnic groups in the relationships between prior achievement and SAT coaching, we can better address the nature of SAT coaching for each racial/ethnic group.</p>
<p>Finally, we examine potential racial/ethnic variation in the <italic>effect</italic> of using the two forms of SAT coaching on SAT performance. Depending on various factors that affect SAT coaching as well as characteristics of students who take it, taking a commercial SAT test preparation course or receiving private tutoring can be particularly beneficial for certain racial/ethnic groups but not so for others. In this study, we elaborate on several factors that may yield SAT coaching to be particularly effective among East Asian American students and empirically test the extent to which SAT coaching is more beneficial among East Asian American students than other racial/ethnic students. In short, our nuanced investigation of (a) prevalence, (b) purpose, and (c) effects of taking a commercial SAT test preparation course and receiving private one-to-one tutoring among East Asian American students in comparison to other racial/ethnic groups of students should highlight the relevance of shadow education activities for understanding academic success of East Asian American students. Beyond the relevance for East Asian American students, we discuss broader implications of racial/ethnic variation in shadow education activities for racial/ethnic inequalities in American education.</p>

<title>Background</title>
<sec id="section2-0038040711417009">
<title>Shadow Education in the U.S. Context</title>
<p>East Asian societies are well known for their long practice of shadow education, which “is deeply embedded in the culture” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0038040711417009">Bray 2009</xref>:24). A considerable proportion of East Asian students today participate in various forms of shadow education, including attendance at a cram school. For example, in 2008, 8 out of 10 primary and secondary Korean students received at least one or more forms of shadow education, among which attending a cram school was most common: About half of all Korean students attended a cram school, <italic>hagwon</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0038040711417009">Korea National Statistical Office 2009</xref>). In Japan, more than 65 percent of ninth-grade students attended a cram school, <italic>juku</italic>, in 2007 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0038040711417009">Bray 2009</xref>). While there is a debate on what leads to the extensive shadow education system in this region (as well as other societies) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0038040711417009">Bray 1999</xref>; C. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0038040711417009">Lee et al. 2009</xref>), one popular explanation highlights intense competition for advancing upper levels of education and prestigious colleges in these societies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0038040711417009">Baker and LeTendre 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0038040711417009">Bray 1999</xref>; C. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0038040711417009">Lee et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0038040711417009">Stevenson and Baker 1992</xref>). In East Asian societies such as Korea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0038040711417009">Park et al. 2011</xref>) and Japan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0038040711417009">Stevenson and Baker 1992</xref>), high-stakes tests play a vital role in assessing school performance and gaining access to selective colleges and prestigious jobs, and thus both pressure and competition among students are high to succeed in a series of the high-stakes tests. In contrast, in the United States, noncognitive criteria such as extracurricular activities and recommendation letters in addition to cognitive test scores (e.g., SAT) play an important role in selective college admissions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0038040711417009">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>In recent years, however, there has been growing emphasis on standardized testing in American education for various purposes of evaluating students and educators associated with educational reform for accountability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0038040711417009">Dworkin 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0038040711417009">Grodsky, Warren, and Felts 2008</xref>). In addition, as a growing number of universities use SAT or ACT scores for college admissions, the number of students taking SAT or ACT has considerably increased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0038040711417009">Alon and Tienda 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0038040711417009">Buchmann et al. 2010</xref>). The growing reliance on standardized testing for important educational decisions likely increases pressure and competition among students to do better in high-stakes tests and may in turn lead to growing demand for shadow education to enhance students’ standardized test scores in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0038040711417009">Buchmann et al. 2010</xref>). Indeed, a recent documentary, <italic>Race to Nowhere</italic>, depicts how stress, pressure, and competition to get <italic>better</italic> grades and test scores have dramatically increased among American students across the nation (for a review on this documentary, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0038040711417009">George 2010</xref>). Furthermore, commercial SAT test preparation companies such as the Princeton Review and Kaplan have been considerably expanded in recent years in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0038040711417009">Buchmann et al. 2010</xref>; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0038040711417009">Davies and Aurini 2006</xref> for a similar development in Canada).</p>
<p>These commercial SAT test preparation services offered in the United States share key features of cram schools in East Asia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0038040711417009">Buchmann et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0038040711417009">Kuan 2008</xref>). For example, students take commercial SAT preparation courses outside of formal schooling to master the test contents and improve test scores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0038040711417009">Becker 1990</xref>). Furthermore, the SAT has the high-stakes nature for American high school students as it plays an important role in determining admission to selective colleges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0038040711417009">Alon and Tienda 2007</xref>). As such, commercial SAT test preparation services and private SAT one-to-one tutoring provide an interesting parallel to shadow education in East Asian societies. It is no surprise that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0038040711417009">Buchmann et al. (2010)</xref> called a variety of SAT test preparation activities the American style of shadow education.</p>

<p>East Asian American students can take SAT coaching not only from traditional options such as Princeton Review and Kaplan but also (perhaps more) from a variety of SAT preparation institutions and cram schools in ethnic communities being run by East Asian immigrant entrepreneurs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0038040711417009">Shrake 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0038040711417009">Zhou 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0038040711417009">Zhou and Kim 2006</xref>). Although little has been documented about the extent to which East Asian American students participate in shadow education, recent research has documented the dramatic expansion of various forms of shadow education institutions, including cram schools in the communities of East Asian immigrants such as Chinese and Koreans in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0038040711417009">Shrake 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0038040711417009">Zhou 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0038040711417009">Zhou and Kim 2006</xref>). Given the long history and high prevalence of shadow education in their origin societies, East Asian immigrant parents may be inclined to rely on these shadow education institutions as a way to help their children’s academic performance.</p>
<p>However, as some scholars indicate, the possible reliance of East Asian immigrant parents on shadow education may not be simply a spillover effect of East Asian culture, but also a reflection of the context where East Asian culture and the mainstream American education system interact for East Asian American immigrants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0038040711417009">Shrake 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0038040711417009">Zhou and Kim 2006</xref>). Although many East Asian immigrant parents perceive education as the most effective or only means of achieving mobility in American society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0038040711417009">Zhou and Kim 2006</xref>), they are often frustrated by the mainstream American education system due to their limited English skills and lack of confidence in interaction with teachers and schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0038040711417009">Kao 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0038040711417009">2004a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0038040711417009">Sun 1998</xref>). In this situation, shadow education may be particularly appealing to these East Asian immigrant parents because unlike the mainstream American education system, they can easily communicate with instructors in their ethnic shadow education institutions, which should facilitate parents to work with the instructors for customized learning for their child.</p>
<p>Yet little research has empirically investigated the relevance of shadow education to the academic success of East Asian American students. As a result, little is known about the extent to which East Asian American students participate in various shadow education activities and the extent to which they benefit from their shadow education activities in terms of improved academic achievement, compared to other racial/ethnic groups. Using data from ELS, we address the need of empirical evidence on the prevalence and effect of shadow education among East Asian American students as well as other racial/ethnic students.</p>

<title>Prevalence</title>
<p>Unfortunately, as will be described in the following in more detail, the ELS data do not allow us to identify where (e.g., ethnic cram schools or traditional options such as Kaplan) and how (e.g., off-line course or online course) students took a commercial SAT test preparation course. Nonetheless, given the high prevalence of shadow education in their origin societies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0038040711417009">Baker et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0038040711417009">Baker and LeTendre 2005</xref>) and the wide availability of and accessibility to cram schools in East Asian immigrant communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0038040711417009">Shrake 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0038040711417009">Zhou 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0038040711417009">Zhou and Kim 2006</xref>), it would be reasonable to assume that taking a commercial SAT test preparation course should be much more frequent among children of East Asian immigrants than among children of other racial/ethnic groups.</p>

<sec id="section6-0038040711417009">
<title>Purpose</title>
<p>As noted, the motivation for utilizing SAT coaching may vary among racial/ethnic groups. Studies in the United States suggest that after-school tutoring programs are usually used for remedial purposes to help students meet the requirements of what is taught in school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0038040711417009">Farkas 1996</xref>; J. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0038040711417009">Lee 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0038040711417009">U.S. Department of Education 1993</xref>). In other words, tutoring programs mostly serve academically struggling or low-achieving students. With respect to SAT coaching, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0038040711417009">Buchmann et al. (2010)</xref> found that low-achieving students are more likely to utilize a variety of coaching strategies for SAT. For East Asian American students, however, SAT coaching may serve already high-achieving students to further enhance their academic achievement. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0038040711417009">Kao (2004b)</xref> notes:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Chinese American and Korean American communities sometimes offer . . . after-school “cram” classes that reinforce and add to the regular schools the children attend. <italic>These institutions are not remedial in nature—in fact, they often serve high-aspiring youths and their families and can give youths an edge over their peers.</italic> (P. 174, emphasis added)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Some research shows that shadow education usually serves high-achieving students in many East Asian societies, most notably Korea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0038040711417009">Baker et al. 2001</xref>). Thus, it is quite possible that many East Asian American students may participate in shadow education not only to keep up with their peers, but to do <italic>better</italic> than their peers in the high-stakes exams (i.e., enrichment purposes). If this were the case, we should be able to find a different pattern with respect to the relationship between prior achievement and taking a commercial SAT test preparation course for East Asian American students, compared to other racial/ethnic groups.</p>

<sec id="section7-0038040711417009">
<title>Effects</title>
<p>Some unique features of cram schools in East Asian immigrant communities lead us to expect the greater effectiveness of cram schools for East Asian immigrant students. For example, many Chinese and Korean cram schools mimic those of home countries in their structures and features by offering challenging work and homework after school, on weekends, or over the summer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0038040711417009">Han 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0038040711417009">Zhou 2008</xref>), which may differ from traditional American test preparation institutions in terms of intensity of instruction and the rigor of curriculum. In a newspaper interview, managers of Korean-run cram schools (<italic>hagwons</italic>) in the United States emphasize the systematic and rigorous curriculum and tight schedule as key features of their cram schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0038040711417009">Han 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Furthermore, cram schools in East Asian ethnic communities may offer additional advantages through social capital among East Asian American students, in addition to supplementary education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0038040711417009">Zhou and Kim 2006</xref>). While cram schools in East Asian ethnic communities generally serve highly motivated East Asian American students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0038040711417009">Kao 2004b</xref>), these students may bring in, share, and reinforce a set of values, beliefs, behaviors, and strategies that facilitate academic success and the mobility goals in the United States, which may combine to create a positive social setting conducive to academic achievement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0038040711417009">Zhou and Kim 2006</xref>). The following statement by an African American mother who sent her son to a Korean cram school in New York indicates such a positive social environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0038040711417009">Maxwell 2003</xref>):</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Up here in Harlem, they don’t have a lot of role models their own age. A lot of these kids don’t open a book after they get off the subway. My kids just don’t fit in because they love to study. That makes me feel bad. The cram school is different. Those Korean kids study very hard. My boys are the only blacks in the school, but they fit in. I mean, it’s normal to work hard. Nobody says they’re acting white. When they see all these other kids studying, my kids don’t feel weird. The peer pressure is positive. Studying has become a habit— second nature.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>As pointed out earlier, we assume that East Asian American students who reported taking a commercial SAT test preparation course in the ELS data likely did so through cram schools in their ethnic communities. Moreover, considering the unique features of those cram schools in ethnic communities of East Asian immigrants described so far, we expect that taking a commercial SAT test preparation course should be particularly beneficial among children of East Asian immigrants.</p>
<list id="list3-0038040711417009" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 3 (Effects):</italic> East Asian American students will benefit more from taking a commercial SAT test preparation course for SAT performance than any other racial/ethnic students.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>In addition to the commercial SAT test preparation course, we additionally examine another prevailing form of shadow education—private one-to-one tutoring. Despite variation across East Asian societies, much private one-to-one tutoring is provided through informal channels in the students’ or tutors’ homes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0038040711417009">Bray 2010</xref>). This outside-school private tutoring also has been increasingly available in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0038040711417009">Helfand 1999</xref>). However, compared to cram schools, less is known about the extent to which East Asian and other immigrant families in the United States utilize private tutors outside school to help their children prepare for SAT tests. In fact, similar to their reluctance to interacting with teachers in schools due to their lack of English skills and confidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0038040711417009">Kao 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0038040711417009">2004a</xref>), immigrant parents may find it uncomfortable to have a tutor of different race/ethnicity visit their home and coach their child. Moreover, compared to cram schools, East Asian immigrant families may have more difficulties in finding private tutors who are of the same ethnic group. In that regard, we expect a less clear pattern in the prevalence, purpose, and effect of utilizing this form of shadow education among East Asian American students, compared to taking a commercial SAT test preparation course through cram schools.</p>

<title>Data and Method</title>
<sec id="section9-0038040711417009">
<title>Sample</title>
<p>To test these hypotheses, we drew on data from the Educational Longitudinal Study of 2002-2006 (ELS:02-06) conducted by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES). The survey followed a nationally representative sample of U.S. high school sophomores in 2002 through their senior years (2004) and beyond (2006). All of our measures came from the 2006 restricted-use data (base year through second follow-up). From the data, we selected students who had taken or planned to take the SAT or ACT in 12th grade for the analysis of the determinants of SAT coaching (<italic>n</italic> = 9,760).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0038040711417009">5</xref></sup> The questions of whether students took or planned to take a course offered by a commercial test preparation service or received or planned to receive individual tutoring were only asked to those who indicated that they had taken or planned to take the SAT or ACT. For the analysis of the effects of SAT coaching, we further restricted the sample to those students who had a valid SAT or ACT score.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0038040711417009">6</xref></sup> Obviously, not all U.S. high school seniors would take or plan to take the SAT or ACT. Therefore, it should be kept in mind that our study deals with only a portion of U.S. high school seniors who have taken or planned to take the SAT or ACT. We excluded Native Americans from all analyses due to the small sample size. The missing data especially for the SAT tests scores resulted in the varying sample size, with 9,760 for the analysis of the determinants of SAT coaching and 7,020 for the analysis of the effects of SAT coaching on SAT scores.</p>

<sec id="section10-0038040711417009">
<title>Variables</title>
<p>This study aims to examine racial/ethnic variation in the prevalence, purpose, and effect of using the two forms of SAT coaching. Accordingly, variables of interest are (a) race/ethnicity, (b) the two forms of SAT coaching, (c) and SAT scores.</p>
<sec id="section11-0038040711417009">
<title>Race/ethnicity</title>
<p>Race/ethnicity was measured by students’ self-reported race/ethnicity (Asian, black, Hispanic, and white). ELS asked an additional question about specific ethnic origins to those who marked “Asian.” Utilizing this information, we grouped Asian American students into East Asian<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0038040711417009">7</xref></sup> (i.e., Chinese, Japanese, and Koreans) and other Asian (e.g., Filipinos, Southeast, South, and other Asian) American students. East Asian American students served as the reference group.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0038040711417009">
<title>SAT coaching</title>
<p>As noted, this study focused on the two particular forms of shadow education activities: (a) taking a commercial SAT test preparation course and (b) receiving private SAT one-to-one tutoring. When the students were high school seniors (2004), ELS asked whether they took or planned to participate in each of the two types of SAT coaching.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0038040711417009">8</xref></sup> Both taking a commercial SAT test preparation course and receiving private tutoring were measured by dichotomous variables. These two types of SAT coaching first served as outcomes of interest and then became independent variables in the model predicting SAT performance.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0038040711417009">
<title>SAT score</title>
<p>The ELS:02-06 data provide the highest composite SAT scores achieved as of 2006. If students took the ACT, the ELS data provide their converted SAT scores, ranging from 400 to 1,600.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0038040711417009">
<title>Controls</title>
<p>Building on prior studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0038040711417009">Briggs 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0038040711417009">Buchmann et al. 2010</xref>), we controlled for several variables that might be correlated with race/ethnicity and SAT coaching/SAT performance: (a) socioeconomic status (SES), (b) immigrant generation, (c) family structure, (d) the number of siblings, (e) parental educational expectations, (f) gender, (g) prior achievement, (h) region, and (i) urbanicity. All measures of the background control variables came from the base year (2002) data. SES is a standardized composite score derived from the five variables: (a) father/guardian’s education, (b) mother/guardian’s education, (c) family income, (d) father/guardian’s occupation, and (e) mother/guardian’s occupation (measured in the base year). This index was constructed and provided by ELS. Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0038040711417009">Goyette and Xie (1999)</xref>, the immigrant generation was constructed by using the students’ and parents’ birthplaces. First generation (reference category) indicates that both the child and at least one of the child’s parents were born outside the United States; second generation indicates that the child was born in the United States but at least one parent was not; and third generation indicates that the child and both parents were born in the United States. Family composition denotes whether students live in two-parent families (= 1) or in other forms of families (= 0). Parents reported the number of siblings that a student had. Parental educational expectations were based on the question of how far in school parents expected their child to go (some college or less [reference category] vs. bachelor’s degree vs. advanced degree). Gender was measured by the student’s sex (female = 1 vs. male = 0). Prior achievement was measured by the math/reading composite score from the standardized test administered by ELS during the 10th grade. Region was based on the location where the student attended high school with four categories (Northeast vs. Midwest vs. West vs. South [reference category]). Finally, urbanicity refers to the place in which the student attended high school with three categories (urban vs. suburban vs. rural [reference category]).</p>

<sec id="section15-0038040711417009">
<title>Analytic Strategies</title>
<p>We implemented three analytic strategies corresponding with three hypotheses. First, to test Hypothesis 1 about prevalence, we analyzed the likelihood of taking a commercial SAT test preparation course by using logistic regression. For this logistic regression analysis, we used the pooled sample with all racial/ethnic groups of students combined and estimated two models predicting the likelihood of taking a commercial SAT test preparation course. The first model included only a set of race/ethnicity variables to examine unadjusted racial/ethnic differences in the likelihood of taking a commercial SAT test preparation course. The second model added all control variables to Model 1 to examine whether racial/ethnic differences in the likelihood of taking a commercial SAT test preparation course (if any) existed after controlling for the background variables. We replicated these logistic regression analyses for private SAT one-to-one tutoring.</p>
<p>Second, to test Hypothesis 2 about purpose of using shadow education, we conducted logistic regression analysis predicting the likelihood of taking a commercial SAT test preparation course by prior achievement. Compared to the analysis that assessed prevalence of shadow education by race/ethnicity using the pooled sample with all racial/ethnic groups of students combined, we examined the relationships between prior achievement and taking a commercial SAT test preparation course separately for each racial/ethnic group to straightforwardly present the relationship for each group and its varying pattern by race/ethnicity. Again, we replicated these logistic regression analyses for private tutoring.</p>
<p>Finally, to test Hypothesis 3 about the effect of shadow education, we conducted ordinary least squares (OLS) regression analysis predicting students’ SAT scores by their use of a commercial SAT test preparation service and private tutoring. To clearly show how the relationships between the two forms of SAT coaching and SAT scores vary by race/ethnicity, we conducted analysis for each racial/ethnic group of students, separately.</p>
<sec id="section16-0038040711417009">
<title>Missing data</title>
<p>As noted, we restricted our sample to those students who reported whether they used SAT coaching. For the analysis of SAT coaching effect on SAT scores, we further limited our sample to those who had valid SAT (or ACT) scores. In examining the extent of missing data of those selected cases for the control variables, we found that most of the cases had few missing data except for immigrant generation and the number of siblings (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0038040711417009">Table 1</xref>). For the immigrant generation, following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0038040711417009">Goyette and Xie (1999)</xref>, we created the dichotomous variable denoting missing cases on this variable to retain those students whose parents did not report either the child’s and/or parents’ birthplaces. Likewise, for the number of siblings, while substituting the average number of siblings for the missing data, we created the dichotomous variable denoting the missing cases on this variable. Our supplementary analysis with those who had no missing information on the immigrant generation and the number of siblings being excluded (i.e., listwise) showed very similar results reported in the current study.</p>

<title>Correction for design effects</title>
<p>ELS employed a two-stage sampling approach where a representative sample of schools was first drawn, and then students were randomly selected within those sampled schools. Given the structure of ELS’s data in which students are nested within schools, it is important to adjust for clustering when calculating the standard errors for our multivariate regression coefficients. In our analyses, we used the <italic>cluster</italic> option in Stata, which generates robust standard errors by downwardly adjusting for the inflated standard errors resulting from the violation of the independent errors assumption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0038040711417009">Rogers 1993</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section18-0038040711417009">
<title>Correction for selection bias</title>
<p>Selection bias is a major concern when estimating the causal effect of SAT coaching on SAT scores, as students who receive SAT coaching are likely different from students who do not in terms of their background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0038040711417009">Briggs 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0038040711417009">Domingue and Briggs 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0038040711417009">Hansen 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0038040711417009">Powers and Rock 1999</xref>). Considering that preexisting differences between students who receive SAT coaching and students who do not may confound the effects of SAT coaching, more rigorous methods that can better deal with selection bias would be more appropriate to estimate the overall effects of SAT coaching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0038040711417009">Domingue and Briggs 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0038040711417009">Hansen 2004</xref>). Using the linear regression approach, we acknowledge the limitation of our study to address the causal effect of SAT coaching.</p>
<p>However, recent studies comparing the effects of SAT coaching using linear regression with those using more sophisticated methods (e.g., propensity score matching) show a similar result between these two different methods, as long as proper adjustments are made by including important control variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0038040711417009">Domingue and Briggs 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0038040711417009">Hansen 2004</xref>). As described earlier, we included a stringent set of controls in our regression models including prior achievement with which we hope to somewhat deal with the selection issue. Nonetheless, estimating the causal effects of SAT coaching is difficult and always involves some degree of unknown selection factors<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0038040711417009">9</xref></sup> that may confound the effect of SAT coaching; our study is no exception.</p>

<title>Descriptive Findings</title>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0038040711417009">Table 1</xref> presents weighted descriptive statistics for the variables used in the analysis by race/ethnicity. Of 9,760 analytic samples (for the determinants of SAT coaching), 5.7 percent were East Asian American students, while 6.7 percent were other Asian American students. White students accounted for 63.4 percent, while black and Hispanic students represented 11.8 percent and 12.4 percent, respectively. The first row of the table indicates the unadjusted mean of the SAT scores among those students who had valid SAT scores (<italic>n</italic> = 7,020). Results clearly showed that the East Asian American students (1,138) outperformed other racial/ethnic groups of students, including whites (1,045) and other Asian students (998). Black students showed the lowest achievement (833), followed by Hispanics (896).</p>
<p>In the second and third rows, overall 12 percent and 9 percent of students took (or planned to take) a commercial SAT test preparation course and received (or planned to receive) private tutoring, respectively. Yet there was substantial variation in the participation rates by race/ethnicity. East Asian American students showed the highest prevalence of taking a commercial SAT test preparation course (30 percent), followed by black students (16 percent). On the other hand, regarding the use of private tutoring, black students showed the highest rates (17 percent), followed by East Asian American students (11 percent).</p>
<p>With respect to background characteristics, results showed some racial/ethnic differences favoring East Asian American students. For example, East Asian American students showed the highest prior achievement score and SES index. In addition, the proportion of students who lived with two parents was relatively high among East Asian American students (84 percent), compared to African American students (52 percent). East Asian American students also tended to have had a relatively small number of siblings (1.82), compared to other racial/ethnic groups of students (e.g., the whites: 2.06, the blacks: 2.57). In sum, consistent with previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0038040711417009">Goyette and Xie 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0038040711417009">Hao and Bonstead-Bruns 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0038040711417009">Sun 1998</xref>), descriptive statistics in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0038040711417009">Table 1</xref> show somewhat favorable family environments of East Asian American students.</p>

<title>Racial/Ethnic Differentials in the Prevalence of Shadow Education</title>
<p>The first set of analyses examined racial/ethnic differences in the prevalence of using the two forms of shadow education for the SAT preparation with the pooled sample of all racial/ethnic groups of students. Recall that we expected that East Asian American students would be more likely to take a commercial SAT test preparation course than any other racial/ethnic groups (Hypothesis 1), while this pattern would be less clear for private SAT one-to-one tutoring. Because we focus on the racial/ethnic differences in SAT coaching, we present only the estimated coefficients of a set of dummy variables denoting the different racial/ethnic groups with the East Asian American group being the reference category. We show the full results including coefficients of other control variables in the supplementary tables available on the journal Web site (Tables A and B at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://soe.sagepub.com">http://soe.sagepub.com</ext-link>).</p>

<p>The first model in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0038040711417009">Table 2</xref>, with only a set of race/ethnicity dummy variables, clearly showed that East Asian American students were much more likely to take a commercial SAT test preparation course than any other racial/ethnic groups of students including other Asian American students. In Model 2, in which all background controls were taken into account, the higher likelihood of taking a commercial SAT test preparation course among East Asian American students remained mostly significant. Exceptionally, the difference between East Asian American students and black students became insignificant after the background variables were controlled.</p>

<title>Private SAT one-to-one tutoring</title>
<p>The first model in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0038040711417009">Table 3</xref>, with only a set of dummy variables representing different racial/ethnic groups, showed that black students were significantly more likely than East Asian American students to use private SAT one-to-one tutoring. However, East Asian American students were more likely than white and Hispanic students to receive private tutoring. In Model 2, which included the background controls, the observed differences in the use of private tutoring between black and East Asian American became insignificant. On the other hand, once the background controls were taken into account, differences between East Asian American students and other Asian students became significant at the 90 percent confidence level. In both Models 1 and 2, the difference between East Asian American students and Hispanic students was significant at the 90 percent confidence level.</p>

Recall that we expected that East Asian American students would benefit more from their taking a commercial SAT test preparation course than any other racial/ethnic groups (Hypothesis 3), while this pattern would be less clear for the use of private SAT one-to-one tutoring.

<p>Results of OLS regression predicting students’ SAT scores in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0038040711417009">Table 6</xref> clearly showed the positive effect of taking a commercial SAT test preparation course on SAT scores among East Asian American students, even after controlling for the background variables. On the other hand, private SAT one-to-one tutoring had no significant effects across different racial/ethnic groups including East Asian American students when course-taking in a commercial test preparation service and the other control variables were taken into account. Taking a commercial SAT test preparation course was associated with SAT scores among white students only at the .10 significance level, but not at all for other Asian, black, and Hispanic groups. The statistical tests of comparisons indicated that the coefficient (68.8) associated with course-taking in a commercial test preparation service among East Asian American students was significantly larger than the corresponding coefficient of any racial/ethnic group.</p>
<p>As pointed out earlier, we expected greater benefits of taking a commercial SAT test preparation course among East Asian American students because they were likely to take a course through cram schools in their ethnic communities, which we reasoned would provide more effective coaching. This reasoning suggests that we expect a stronger relationship between taking a commercial SAT test preparation course and SAT performance among first- and second-generation East Asian American students than their third-generation counterparts, who are presumably much less likely to have access to immigrant communities. Our supplementary analysis (not shown) indeed showed that taking a commercial SAT test preparation course was significantly associated with improved SAT scores among first- (<italic>p</italic> = .002) and second-generation (<italic>p</italic> = .000) East Asian American youth but not among third-generation (<italic>p</italic> = .931) after controlling for SES, prior achievement, and all other control variables used for analysis in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0038040711417009">Table 6</xref>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0038040711417009">10</xref></sup> The result is consistent with our assumption that availability of cram schools in ethnic communities likely contributes to the positive relationship between taking a commercial SAT test preparation course and the SAT scores among East Asian American students.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The overall goal of this study was to investigate the relevance of shadow education to the academic success of East Asian American students. Despite the extensive use of shadow education in the home countries of East Asian immigrants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0038040711417009">Baker et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0038040711417009">Baker and LeTendre 2005</xref>), little research has empirically explored its role in the academic success of their children in the United States. Drawing on literature of shadow education in the home countries of East Asian immigrants (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0038040711417009">Bray and Kwok 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0038040711417009">Park et al. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0038040711417009">Stevenson and Baker 1992</xref>) as well as research of SAT coaching in the United States (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0038040711417009">Buchmann et al. 2010</xref>), we hypothesized how East Asian students would differ from other racial/ethnic groups in the prevalence, purpose, and effect of SAT coaching, focusing on course-taking in a commercial SAT test preparation service and private SAT one-to-one tutoring. Specifically, with respect to course-taking in a commercial SAT test preparation service, we expected that East Asian American students would be more likely to take a commercial SAT test preparation course for improving their SAT scores (Hypothesis 1), that they would take a commercial SAT test preparation course for the enrichment purpose (Hypothesis 2), and that they would benefit more from taking a commercial SAT test preparation course for their SAT test scores (Hypothesis 3) compared to other racial/ethnic groups. On the other hand, we expected that the distinctive patterns among East Asian American students would be less straightforward in regard to receiving private SAT one-to-one tutoring.</p>
<p>Our empirical analyses of the ELS data support these expectations. Results showed that East Asian American students were more likely to take a commercial SAT test preparation course than any other racial/ethnic students, with black students being exceptional. East Asian American students were distinctive not only in the prevalence of taking a commercial SAT test preparation course but also in the purpose of its use. Our results showed the positive relationship between prior achievement and the likelihood of taking a commercial SAT test preparation course among East Asian American students (as well as other Asian American students), indicating that high-achieving East Asian American students are more likely to use this particular form of shadow education for the enrichment purpose. Most importantly, we found that East Asian students benefited most from their taking a commercial SAT test preparation course in terms of improved SAT test scores.</p>
<p>Our results also showed that it was not East Asian American students, but black students who were most likely to utilize private SAT one-to-one tutoring, consistent with past research findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0038040711417009">Buchmann et al. 2010</xref>). In addition, results showed the insignificant relationship between prior achievement and private SAT one-to-one tutoring among East Asian American students (and other Asian American students) but the positive relationship among non-Asian American students, suggesting that private tutoring largely serves low-achieving students among non-Asian American students. Yet private tutoring had no significant effects on SAT performance for all racial/ethnic groups, including East Asian American students.</p>
<p>Our findings of the high prevalence and the positive effect of course-taking in a commercial test preparation service among East Asian American students offer evidence on the relevance of this particular form of shadow education to the academic success of East Asian American students. Drawing on literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0038040711417009">Shrake 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0038040711417009">Zhou 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0038040711417009">Zhou and Kim 2006</xref>), we interpreted the high prevalence of this particular form of shadow education among East Asian American students in light of the interplay of East Asian culture and American education. The high expectations of children’s education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0038040711417009">Goyette and Xie 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0038040711417009">Kao 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0038040711417009">Kao and Tienda 1998</xref>) but frequent frustrations experienced by the mainstream American education among East Asian immigrant parents due to their limited English skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0038040711417009">Kao 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0038040711417009">2004a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0038040711417009">Sun 1998</xref>) may combine to lead to greater reliance on shadow education among these immigrant parents.</p>
<p>On the other hand, we attributed the positive impact and greater effectiveness of course-taking in a commercial test preparation service for East Asian American students to several unique features of cram schools widely available in East Asian ethnic communities, including intense instruction, rigorous curriculum, and social capital. Indeed, according to recent news articles, a growing number of non-Asian students attend cram schools in East Asian ethnic communities, recognizing the effectiveness and rigorous academic programs of those cram schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0038040711417009">Hernandez 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0038040711417009">Luo 2003</xref>) as well as a positive academic atmosphere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0038040711417009">Maxwell 2003</xref>). Our finding of the positive effect of using the commercial test preparation service is consistent with some studies showing the positive effect of attending a cram school in Korea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0038040711417009">Byun 2009</xref>) and Taiwan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0038040711417009">Kuan 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>However, our findings of the positive role of taking a commercial SAT test preparation course among East Asian American students should not be considered as evidence to support an argument that more shadow education opportunities such as cram schools should be available for other racial/ethnic minorities to enhance their academic achievement. Although we have offered some reasons why cram schools in East Asian ethnic communities may be effective in coaching students, we do not claim the causal effect of cram schooling. More fundamentally, as many cram schools primarily focus on helping students strategically master or memorize as much information as possible necessary for particular tests in a very short period of time, rather than fostering critical thinking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0038040711417009">Shrake 2010</xref>), it is questionable whether enhancing academic achievement through cram schooling is a desirable educational practice. Rather, we highlight that more attention should be paid to the roles of shadow education activities in explaining the academic success of East Asian American students, as scholarships on shadow education in relation to race and ethnicity have been very limited yet in the United States.</p>
<p>We believe our findings also have broader implications for racial/ethnic inequalities in American education beyond the relevance of shadow education to the academic success of East Asian students. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0038040711417009">Buchmann et al. (2010)</xref> suggest that the recent emphasis on standardized testing and school accountability in American education likely increases demand for shadow education and potentially leads to the widening socioeconomic achievement gap in the United States by showing the significant relationship of shadow education with both family background and educational achievement. Our findings additionally suggest that growing demand for shadow education may also lead to an increase in racial/ethnic inequalities in educational achievement. Our analysis showed that East Asian American students were not only most likely to utilize the commercial SAT test preparation service but also most benefited from the participation. As compared to East Asian American students, black students did not differ significantly in their course-taking in a commercial SAT test preparation service and they were even more likely to receive private tutoring; yet black students’ participation in the two forms of shadow education did not substantially enhance their SAT scores. Therefore, how growing demand for shadow education will shape racial/ethnic inequalities in educational achievement should be carefully monitored in addition to its relation to the socioeconomic-achievement gap.</p>
<p>The present study has several limitations that need to be addressed in the future. First, for the purpose, this study focused on children of immigrants from East Asian societies as a group because shadow education has traditionally played a substantial role in educating children in their origin societies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0038040711417009">Bray 1999</xref>). In addition, relatively rich information on shadow education in East Asian societies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0038040711417009">Bray and Kwok 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0038040711417009">Park et al. 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0038040711417009">Stevenson and Baker 1992</xref>) as well as in East Asian American communities in the United States (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0038040711417009">Zhou 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0038040711417009">Zhou and Kim 2006</xref>) allowed us to derive reasonable hypotheses on children of immigrants from East Asian American. However, we do acknowledge that the category of “East Asian American” can be problematic as Chinese, Koreans, and Japanese differ in background characteristics and educational outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0038040711417009">Goyette and Xie 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0038040711417009">Hao and Bonstead-Bruns 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0038040711417009">Kao 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0038040711417009">Sun 1998</xref>) and may also differ in the prevalence, purpose, and effect of SAT coaching. This may also be true for the category of “other Asian American.” We leave for future research the questions of how East, South, and Southeast Asian Americans are different from each other in prevalence, purpose, and effect of SAT coaching.</p>
<p>Second, despite numerous other forms of shadow education emerging and considerable variation in intensity, scale, and mode within and between various forms of shadow education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0038040711417009">Aurini and Davies 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0038040711417009">Bray 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0038040711417009">Ventura and Jang 2010</xref>), this study focused on the two particular forms of shadow education (i.e., the commercial test preparation service and private one-to-one tutoring) because of the limitations of the ELS data. As explicitly noted, the ELS data do not allow us to identify whether students participated in shadow education available in ethnic communities as well as the frequency, intensity, and duration of shadow education students used. The lack of information about shadow education is also the case for earlier data such as NELS. Accordingly, studies using these national data sets are limited by the proximate measures of shadow education (or SAT coaching) that are available within ELS or NELS. Future efforts to collect details of shadow education activities will provide significant opportunities of investigating how shadow education mediates racial/ethnic and socioeconomic inequalities in educational outcomes in the United States.</p>
<p>Finally, we highlighted some constructive features of cram schools in East Asian ethnic communities, which might be responsible for greater effectiveness of the commercial SAT test preparation service among East Asian American students. However, future research should more explicitly assess how cram schools in East Asian ethnic communities are effective in enhancing academic achievement and identify specific structures and conditions of those cram schools conducive to student learning. Understanding contexts in which cram schools in East Asian ethnic communities operate can offer important insights into effective coaching that may be applied to other racial/ethnic communities. In the United States, some educators have proposed a variety of supplementary educational services to help low achievers for a remedial purpose (J. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0038040711417009">Lee 2007</xref>). In addition, under the No Child Left Behind Act, low-achieving schools are required to offer supplemental educational services to low-achieving students through private organizations, including for-profit learning centers and community organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0038040711417009">U.S. Department of Education 2002</xref>). Our findings, however, suggest variation in the effectiveness of the commercial SAT test preparation service among students of diverse racial/ethnic backgrounds and even question the effectiveness of private tutoring in boosting academic achievement. Therefore, systematic investigations of racial/ethnic variation in the prevalence, purpose, and effects of various forms of shadow education should extend our understanding of sources of racial/ethnic differences in educational outcomes as well as inform educational policy for designing intervention programs that better reflect specific needs of students of diverse racial/ethnic backgrounds.</p>

<p>For example, using data from National Education Longitudinal Study:88, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0038040711417009">Kao (1995)</xref> found that Chinese and Korean parents do not interact with their children as much as white parents. Using the same data, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0038040711417009">Sun (1998)</xref> further found that parents of East Asian origins are least likely to help children’s homework, know other parents, and contact with schools, all of which negatively influence academic achievement.</p>

<label>2.</label>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0038040711417009">Bray (1999)</xref> highlighted the three dimensions of shadow education: (a) supplementation, (b) privateness, and (c) academic subjects. Shadow education should address subjects already covered in school (<italic>supplementation</italic>), while it should be provided in exchange for a fee, as opposed to unpaid tutoring provided by families or community members or extra tutoring provided by school teachers as part of their professional commitments and responsibilities (<italic>privateness</italic>). Shadow education should also cover <italic>academic subjects</italic> including languages, mathematics, and other examinable subjects, but excluding musical, artistic, or sporting skills that are learned primarily for pleasure and/or for a more rounded form of personal development.</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn3-0038040711417009">

<p>Despite variation in the scale and quality across East Asian societies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0038040711417009">Bray 2009</xref>), cram schooling is one of the most dominant forms of shadow education in addition to individual private tutoring in East Asia. A cram school is a for-profit private institution that offers supplementary instructions and practice exams in classroom-like settings and often provides its own curriculum and assessment tools as well as its own original publications and textbooks like a mainstream school.</p>

<p>For example, Harvard’s Admissions Committee uses many other criteria, including community involvement, leadership, distinction in extracurricular activities, community involvement, and work experience, in addition to academic accomplishment in high school and standardized test scores (for more information, see the Web site of Office of Admissions at Harvard College at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.admissions.college.harvard.edu/index.html">http://www.admissions.college.harvard.edu/index.html</ext-link>).</p>

<p>Following the Institute of Education Sciences’ restricted use data security procedures, we rounded the unweighted <italic>N</italic>s to nearest 10.</p>

<p>The proportion of students who had a valid SAT or ACT score among Education Longitudinal Study (ELS) students was highest among East Asian students (69 percent), followed by white (67 percent), other Asian American (58 percent), black (51 percent), and Hispanic (40 percent) students.</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn7-0038040711417009">
<label>7.</label>
<p>Of East Asian American students in the analytic sample, approximately 48 percent were Chinese, approximately 18 percent Japanese, and approximately 34 percent Koreans.</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn8-0038040711417009">

<p>Although the original questionnaire item asked whether students “took or planned to take” the two types of SAT coaching, the ELS data do not allow us to identify exactly when students took SAT coaching as well as whether those students, who had planned to take the SAT coaching, eventually took SAT coaching. This limitation should be kept in mind in interpreting the relationships between prior achievement and SAT coaching and between SAT coaching and SAT performance in our results. Meanwhile, we use the term of <italic>take</italic> instead of <italic>plan to take</italic> for simplicity.</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn9-0038040711417009">
<label>9.</label>
<p>One of the possible unobserved characteristics that may confound the effects of SAT coaching may be taking the exam multiple times. Taking the exam multiple times is one of the common strategies that students utilize to improve their SAT performance, and this likely pays off in terms of improved test scores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0038040711417009">Vigdor and Clotfelter 2003</xref>). Unfortunately, the ELS data did not allow us to identify those who had taken SAT or ACT multiple times. In that regard, we acknowledge our inability to capture the possible effect of retaking SAT tests as another limitation of our study.</p>
</fn>

<label>10.</label>
<p>We thank an anonymous reviewer for pointing out the useful test by generation among East Asian American students.</p>
