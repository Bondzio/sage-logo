<abstract>
<p>The study was conducted (a) to assess use of any smoking cessation medications, (b) to identify factors associated with smoking, and (c) to assess knowledge of the health effects of smoking and attitudes toward smoking and seeking help for quitting among Vietnamese Americans. This is a descriptive study conducted with a nonrepresentative sample of 163 Vietnamese Americans. Current and former smokers constituted 24.4% and 25.6% of men and 1.2% and 3.5% of women, respectively. Of 20 current smokers, 17 (85%) reported use of cessation medications in their past quit attempts. Acculturation was the only significant correlate of ever smoking (vs. never smoking) in multivariate logistic regression analyses. Men who were less acculturated had more than 5 times the odds of being ever smokers (odds ratio = 5.33, 95% confidence interval = 1.37-20.78) compared with more acculturated men. Most participants had correct knowledge of the health effects of smoking regardless of age, education level, and smoking status. Attitudes toward smoking differed by age and education level but not by smoking status. Nurses working with Vietnamese Americans should be aware of the high rate of smoking among male immigrants and provide smoking cessation interventions.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The latest report of the Surgeon General suggested that even low levels of exposure to tobacco smoke and secondhand smoke lead to a rapid and sharp increase in dysfunction and inflammation of the lining of the blood vessels, which are implicated in heart attacks and stroke (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1043659611434060">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2010</xref>). It is estimated that tobacco use will cause about 450 million deaths worldwide during the next 50 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1043659611434060">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2005</xref>). There has been a dramatic rise in the prevalence of tobacco use and dependence in Asian countries. For example, in the 2005 Ho Chi Minh City Survey, the rate of current smoking was 57.7% for men and 1.6% for women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1043659611434060">Trinh, Nguyen, Phongsavon, Dibley, &amp; Bauman, 2009</xref>). Vietnamese form the fourth largest ethnic subgroup of the Asian American population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1043659611434060">Reeves &amp; Bennett, 2004</xref>). Vietnamese male immigrants smoke at much higher rates than the general U.S. male population, whereas Vietnamese female immigrants smoke at substantially lower rates than the general U.S. female population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1043659611434060">An, Cochran, Mays, &amp; McCarthy, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1043659611434060">CDC, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1043659611434060">Chae, Gavin, &amp; Takeuchi, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1043659611434060">Chan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1043659611434060">Kaplan, Nguyen, &amp; Weinberg, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1043659611434060">Lai, McPhee, Jenkins, &amp; Wong, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1043659611434060">Nelson, Bui, &amp; Samet, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1043659611434060">Wiecha, Lee, &amp; Hodgkins, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>Massachusetts is one of the states wherein a large number of Vietnamese immigrants have settled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1043659611434060">Watanabe, Liu, &amp; Lo, 2004</xref>). Most Vietnamese arrived in Massachusetts following the fall of Indochina to the communists in 1975. The early immigrants were mostly refugees and recent immigrants came via traditional immigration routes such as family connection and employment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1043659611434060">Bankston, 2010</xref>). The Massachusetts Vietnamese American population was about 46,000 in 2007, increasing 33% from the 2000 Census (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1043659611434060">Lo, 2009</xref>). Vietnamese form the third largest ethnic subgroup of the Asian American population in Massachusetts and the largest one in Central Massachusetts. The survey in 1994 by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1043659611434060">Wiecha et al. (1998)</xref> was the only published study of Vietnamese Americans in Massachusetts, and the rate of smoking for Vietnamese men was 43% and for the general Massachusetts men was 24%.</p>
<p>The 2007 California Health Interview Survey revealed that Vietnamese men had the highest smoking rate (35.4%), more than double the rate (16.5%) of the general Californian male population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1043659611434060">California Health Interview Survey, 2009</xref>). In accordance with the high smoking rate, the California Cancer Registry between 1988 and 2003 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1043659611434060">Raz et al., 2008</xref>) reported that, among Asian subgroups, Vietnamese men had the highest incidence of non–small cell lung cancer, the most common type of lung cancer among smokers. It was also found that being married, being employed, having lower levels of education, and consuming alcohol were associated with being ever smokers (vs. never smokers) among men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1043659611434060">Tong et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Studies, however, have shown conflicting findings with regard to the relationship between smoking and acculturation in Vietnamese American men. Some studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1043659611434060">CDC, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1043659611434060">Jenkins, McPhee, Ha, Nam, &amp; Chen, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1043659611434060">Ma, Shive, Tan, &amp; Feeley, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1043659611434060">Rahman et al., 2005</xref>) found an inverse relationship, whereas others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1043659611434060">Moeschberger et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1043659611434060">Wiecha et al., 1998</xref>) found no relationship between the two variables. No study exists to date that has examined the relationship between smoking and acculturation among Vietnamese American women. Although it has been found that Chinese and Korean American women who are acculturated are more likely to smoke than their counterparts who are traditional culture oriented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1043659611434060">An et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1043659611434060">Hofstetter et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1043659611434060">Song et al., 2004</xref>), it is not clear whether Vietnamese American women are more likely to smoke as they acculturate. The paucity of studies on Vietnamese American women is largely related to their very low rates of smoking that delimit any significant findings related to smoking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1043659611434060">Kim, Ziedonis, &amp; Chen, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Compared with other Asian ethnic subgroups, Vietnamese Americans reportedly had more smoking cessation advices from a health care professional (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1043659611434060">Ma &amp; Fleisher, 2003</xref>). On the other hand, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1043659611434060">Chan et al. (2007)</xref> found that Vietnamese male smokers were less knowledgeable about the health hazards of smoking and held more positive attitudes toward smoking than their nonsmoking counterparts. The latter study was conducted with Vietnamese American men only. In the present study, we assessed the knowledge and attitudes of Vietnamese American women as well as men. In addition, we assessed their attitudes toward seeking help for quitting regardless of smoking status and use of any smoking cessation medications among current smokers. Taken together, the present descriptive study was conducted (a) to assess use of any smoking cessation medications, (b) to identify factors associated with smoking, and (c) to assess knowledge of the health effects of smoking and attitudes toward smoking and seeking help for quitting among Vietnamese adults in Central Massachusetts.</p>

<title>Research Method</title>
<sec id="section3-1043659611434060">
<title>Research Design and Sample</title>
<p>A descriptive study was conducted with a nonrepresentative sample. The study was approved from the Institutional Review Board of the University of Massachusetts Medical School. Participants were self-identified Vietnamese descendants who were at least 18 years old and could speak and understand Vietnamese or English. To be inclusive, those who were not able to read or write either of the languages were also invited to the study. For those with limited literacy, research staff members assisted them in administering the questionnaire.</p>
<p>Participants were recruited from the 2009 Asian Festival by being approached individually on a one-to-one basis. The festival was a collaborative activity of all Asian American communities in Central Massachusetts and has been held yearly since 2004. About one third of the attendees were Vietnamese Americans. People could easily enter and leave the place and our survey table was located near the main entrance door to the performance hall. Most completed the questionnaire at the table and a few took it with them and handed in later. Among those who were determined to be eligible, most (163/175, 93.1%) participated in the survey that took about 20 minutes. Those who completed the questionnaire were reimbursed with a gift card of $15 purchasable at a neighboring grocery store.</p>
<p>Questionnaires included demographic characteristics, acculturation, health care information, perceived health status, history of smoking and quitting, knowledge of the adverse health effects of smoking, and attitudes toward smoking and toward seeking help for quitting. English measures were translated into Vietnamese by the second author of this article. Two bilingual Vietnamese Americans then reviewed independently the translated Vietnamese questionnaire, comparing it with the original English version. The three corresponded frequently with one another until they reached an agreement for the final version of Vietnamese measures. They all suggested that back-translation may not be practical with Vietnamese language and hence, it was not implemented. The latest standards of translation in the United States and Europe do not include back-translation as part of their repertoires of quality process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1043659611434060">American Society for Testing and Materials International, 2006</xref>). Research questionnaires were prepared in both English and Vietnamese.</p>

<sec id="section5-1043659611434060">
<title>Demographic questionnaire</title>
<p>Variables included gender, age, marital status, educational attainment, annual family income, employment status, and religion.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1043659611434060">
<title>Health care information</title>
<p>Participants were asked about medical insurance coverage, primary health care provider, and time since last physical checkup. They were also asked about whether they had any of the following seven medical conditions: hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, liver disease, infectious disease, alcoholism, and depression. Selection of these diseases was based on personal interest of the three authors. Perceived health status was assessed on a single-item 5-point Likert-type scale from <italic>excellent</italic> (5) to <italic>extremely bad</italic> (1).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1043659611434060">
<title>Acculturation</title>
<p>Acculturation was assessed with a brief form of the Suinn–Lew Asian Self-Identify Acculturation Scale (SL-ASIA; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1043659611434060">Suinn, Rickard-Figueroa, Lew, &amp; Vigil, 1987</xref>). The SL-ASIA has been most widely used in health research with Asian Americans and has sound psychometric properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1043659611434060">Suinn, Ahuna, &amp; Khoo, 1992</xref>). The top five item-to-total correlations were identified to form the brief version of the SL-ASIA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1043659611434060">Leong &amp; Chou, 1998</xref>). The five items include language spoken, language preferred, language read, childhood friends, and ethnic identity. The mean of the five-item scores is the scale score and ranges from 1 (<italic>extremely Vietnamese-culture oriented</italic>) to 5 (<italic>extremely American-culture oriented</italic>). The brief form is highly correlated (.91) with the full version of the SL-ASIA. Cronbach’s alpha coefficient was .85 in the study with Vietnamese American mothers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1043659611434060">Foss, 2001</xref>) and .88 was in the present study.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1043659611434060">
<title>Smoking and quitting behaviors</title>
<p>Participants were assessed on smoking status and use of other tobacco products such as cigars and smokeless chewing tobacco. Smoking status was determined by answers to the following two questions: (a) Have you smoked at least 100 cigarettes in your lifetime and (b) Are you currently smoking daily or almost daily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1043659611434060">National Center for Health Statistics, 1994</xref>). Those who answered “Yes” to both questions were classified as current smokers and those who answered “Yes” to the first but “No” to the second as former smokers, and those who answered “No” to the first question were coded as never smokers regardless of their answers to the second question. Participants were further asked about use of any smoking cessation medications. Current smokers were also asked about any past-year quit attempts at which they were able to abstain from smoking for at least 24 hours.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1043659611434060">
<title>Smoking intensity</title>
<p>Current smokers were asked about the number of cigarettes smoked per day on average and the time (minutes) to the first cigarette after waking up. These two items constitute the Heavy Smoking Index (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1043659611434060">Heatherton, Kozlowski, Frecker, Rickert, &amp; Robinson, 1989</xref>). The total score can range from 0 to 6 and scores of 4 or higher indicate high nicotine dependence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1043659611434060">Heatherton et al., 1989</xref>). The Heavy Smoking Index is highly correlated with the six-item Fagerström Test for Nicotine Dependence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1043659611434060">Chabrol, Niezborala, Chastan, &amp; de Leon, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1043659611434060">John et al., 2004</xref>), which has been most widely used to assess nicotine dependence.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1043659611434060">
<title>Knowledge of smoking</title>
<p>Knowledge of the adverse health effects of smoking was assessed on a seven-item instrument that was developed at the University of California, San Francisco and further modified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1043659611434060">Chan et al. (2007)</xref>. Scores on this questionnaire range from 0 (<italic>no questions answered correctly</italic>) to 7 (<italic>all questions answered correctly</italic>). Cronbach’s alpha coefficient was not reported in the study by Chan et al. and it was .70 in the present study.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1043659611434060">
<title>Attitudes toward smoking</title>
<p>The measure was developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1043659611434060">Chan et al. (2007)</xref>. Following the strategy used by them, we also assessed each of the nine attitude items about smoking on a dichotomous measure “Agree” and “Disagree.” Cronbach’s alpha coefficient was not reported in the study by Chan et al. and was .68 in the present study.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1043659611434060">
<title>Attitudes toward seeking help for quitting</title>
<p>The attitudes were assessed on a two-item measure, separately for male and female smokers: “It is appropriate for Vietnamese male (female) smokers to seek professional help when they want to quit smoking.” Answers can be either “Agree” or “Disagree.” Cronbach’s alpha coefficient was .64 in the present study.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1043659611434060">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>Data analysis was conducted with SPSS version 17.0. All variables were assessed for multicollinearity, skewness, and violation of normal distribution. Descriptive statistics were performed on demographic characteristics, acculturation level, smoking and quitting behaviors including use of smoking cessation medications, knowledge of the health effects of smoking, and attitudes toward smoking and seeking help for quitting. Pearson’s or Spearman’s rank correlation coefficients were estimated to identify any associations among demographic characteristics, acculturation level, perceived health status, and smoking intensity. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors that were associated with smoking status while adjusting for other correlates. For a better comparison of study findings, we divided participants into four age-groups (18-29, 30-39, 40-49, and ≥ 50 years) and four education levels (0-8, 9-12, 13-16, and &gt;16), following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1043659611434060">Chan et al.’s (2007)</xref> analytic strategies. In addition, Chi-square tests were conducted to compare knowledge and attitude scores among participants by demographic characteristics, acculturation level, and smoking status.</p>

<sec id="section14-1043659611434060" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>The study sample consisted of 78 men and 85 women, and the majority of them (86%, 140/163) completed the survey in Vietnamese. Most self-administered the questionnaire and eight women (4.9%, 6/163) completed the survey with assistance from bilingual research staff. Demographic characteristics of the participants (<italic>N</italic> = 163) are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1043659611434060">Table 1</xref>. Ages ranged from 18 to 84 years with a mean age of 48 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 17.5). More than half of them (62.0%) were longtime residents who had been in the United States for more than 10 years. About 47% of the participants reported annual family income less than $20,000. Age had a significant, negative association with acculturation score (<italic>r</italic> = −.59, <italic>p</italic> = .00), indicating that older individuals were less likely to acculturate into American culture than the younger ones. In contrast, there was a strong positive relationship between education and acculturation (<italic>r</italic> = .64, <italic>p</italic> = .00), that is, the more educated the more acculturated.</p>

<p>Most participants (96.9%) reported having medical insurances and primary health care providers, and 83.4% reported having done physical checkups within the past year (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1043659611434060">Table 2</xref>). Slightly more than half (57.7%) perceived their health status as excellent or good. Hypertension was the most frequently reported chronic health problem.

<p>Because only four women acknowledged having ever smoked, following results were limited to male smokers. In bivariate analysis, marital status, education, and acculturation were factors associated with smoking status (ever vs. never). However, only acculturation was significant when adjusted for other correlates. Men with lower levels of acculturation had more than 5 times the odds of being ever smokers (odds ratio = 5.33, 95% confidence interval = 1.37-20.78) compared with men with higher levels of acculturation.</p>
<p>Most participants (80.4%) answered correctly to all the seven knowledge questions about the health effects of smoking and no differences were found by gender, age, education level, acculturation level, or smoking status. In contrast, attitudes toward smoking differed by age and education level but not by gender or smoking status. Because of similar findings as to differences in attitudes by age and education, only the differences by the latter are shown here (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1043659611434060">Table 4</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1043659611434060">Table 4</xref>, only a small number of people, regardless of education level, endorsed Vietnamese female smoking. People with less years of education were more likely to agree with smoking norm among men in the Vietnamese community than their more educated counterparts except for two attitude items “Smoking is widely accepted among men in the Vietnamese community” (Item 2) and “Giving gifts of tobacco product is acceptable in the Vietnamese community” (Item 7). Unlike other attitude items, more educated groups were more likely to agree with these two items than the less educated groups. In contrast, attitudes toward seeking help for quitting did not differ by gender, age, education level, or smoking status.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The percentage of male smokers was somewhat lower in this study compared with that found in other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1043659611434060">Chae et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1043659611434060">Chan et al., 2007</xref>). However, the percentage of current smokers is higher than the percentage (16.1%) among the general Massachusetts men in 2009 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1043659611434060">CDC, 2010</xref>). Our study was conducted with a convenience sample of Vietnamese Americans who attended a cultural event. Slightly more than half (55.4%) of the male participants were 50 years or older. It has been reported that Vietnamese American men in the age-group of 30 to 49 years are more likely to smoke than men in other age-groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1043659611434060">Chae et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1043659611434060">Chan et al., 2007</xref>). No comparison could be made because the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System in Massachusetts does not have disaggregated data of smoking rates for Vietnamese men and women. About four fifths of current smokers in the present study made a serious quit attempt in the past year, which is slightly higher than 71% found among Vietnamese male smokers in California (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1043659611434060">Tsoh et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Consistent with findings from previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1043659611434060">Chan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1043659611434060">Ma et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1043659611434060">Tong et al., 2010</xref>), being married and having less education were found to be significant correlates of smoking among Vietnamese American men in Central Massachusetts. However, the variables became insignificant when acculturation was held consistent in the analysis. The mean number of cigarettes smoked per day among men in the present study was very similar to what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1043659611434060">Chan et al. (2007)</xref> found. Furthermore, the percentage of light smokers (smoking in the range of 1-10 cigarettes a day) was also very similar between the two studies. It was reported that Vietnamese American men tend to smoke fewer cigarettes per day compared with other racial and ethnic groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1043659611434060">Tong, Nguyen, Vittinghoff, &amp; Perez-Stable, 2009</xref>). No single smokers in this study could be identified as a heavy smoker by the Heavy Smoking Index.</p>
<p>Similar to findings by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1043659611434060">Chan et al. (2007)</xref>, most participants demonstrated correct knowledge of smoking-related health effects and only a small proportion of people agreed to Vietnamese women smoking. In general, those who had less education were more likely to agree with the smoking norm among men in the Vietnamese community than their counterparts. However, unlike findings by Chan et al., we did not find any differences in knowledge and attitude scores by smoking status. This might be in part related to the small number of current smokers in the present study and/or differences in participant characteristics between the two studies. Most people in the present study had been in the United States for more than 10 years and 14 (8.6%) were American natives. In contrast, almost all participants in the other study were Vietnam-born recent immigrants.</p>
<p>We did not assess the duration of abstinence among former smokers. Thus, we do not know whether the Massachusetts Health Regulation Law (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1043659611434060">MASS-Health-Insurance Organization, 2009</xref>) that became effective in 2007 had any influences on the relatively low rate of current smoking and the high usage of smoking cessation medications found among Vietnamese smokers in the present study. The law mandates medical insurance and administers the Commonwealth Care Program for lower income residents. More studies are needed with a representative sample of Vietnamese Americans to have accurate estimates of smoking prevalence and cessation medication usage. It will be interesting to compare smoking and quitting behaviors among Vietnamese smokers in Massachusetts and other Vietnamese populated states that have a similar size of the population. The Massachusetts law can be a natural experiment that allows researchers to compare any changes in smoking and quitting behaviors before and after the law and between states with and without the universal health care program.</p>
<sec id="section16-1043659611434060">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>The present study has several limitations, and findings from the study should be interpreted with caution. First, we used a convenience sample that is not representative of the study population. Participants were recruited at an Asian cultural event and about 47% of them reported annual family income less than $20,000. Thus, generalization of the findings should be limited to Vietnamese Americans whose demographic characteristics are similar to the study sample. Although we had a low refusal rate (about 7%), some might have refused participation in this study because they did not want to disclose their current smoking given that smoking is generally regarded as a negative behavior in these days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1043659611434060">Chan et al., 2007</xref>). Furthermore, those who participated might have underreported their smoking and given Vietnamese cultural norm against female smoking, women might have been more likely to do so (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1043659611434060">Chen, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1043659611434060">Wewers et al., 1995</xref>). On the other hand, the incentive ($15) provided might have influenced the high rate of participation and resulted in socially desirable responses.</p>
<p>Another limitation is the two scales of knowledge of the health effects of smoking and attitudes toward smoking that yielded low alpha coefficients. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1043659611434060">Nunnally and Bernstein (1994)</xref> stated that reliabilities of .80 or higher are adequate for group comparisons. The use of a dichotomous answer item might have caused the low coefficients of the scales and might have delimited findings in the present study. Adopting a 5-point or a 7-point Likert-type scale and adding more question items may enhance psychometric properties of the scales.</p>

<title>Nursing Implications</title>
<p>The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1043659611434060">U.S. Census Bureau (2004)</xref> estimated that in 2050, the population of racial and ethnic minorities is about to be as equal to the White majority group who is not Hispanic. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1043659611434060">Brach and Fraserirector (2000)</xref> suggested that cultural competency go beyond cultural awareness or sensitivity and be a mechanism to change health outcomes of minority Americans. As seen in the present study, Vietnamese male immigrants (for whom smoking is an important medium of men’s social world) tend to be smokers and particularly Vietnamese culture oriented men are more likely to be smokers. Without timely intervention, they will suffer from tobacco-related health risks. Nurses working with Asian Americans should be aware of the high prevalence of cigarette smoking among male immigrants and implement the five As (Ask them about tobacco use, Advise them to quit, Assess their willingness to attempt quitting, Assist them in the attempt, and Arrange for follow-ups) of smoking cessation intervention explicated in the Public Health Clinical Practice Guideline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1043659611434060">Fiore et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
