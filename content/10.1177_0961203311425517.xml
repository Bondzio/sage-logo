<abstract>
<p>Cervical human papillomavirus (HPV+) infection is associated with an increased risk of cervical dysplasia. Although the frequency of HPV+ in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) has been investigated in some races its prevalence in Hispanic women is still unknown. This cross-sectional study evaluated the prevalence of cervical HPV+ in Mexican women with SLE (<italic>n</italic> = 34) or rheumatoid arthritis (RA) (<italic>n</italic> = 43) and in healthy controls (<italic>n</italic> = 146). These women were interviewed about risk factors for sexually transmitted infections and cervical cytology analysis was performed. HPV+ viral types were identified using PCR: HPV+ was observed in 14.7% of SLE, 27.9% of RA and 30.8% of controls. High-risk HPV types were observed in 11.7% of women with SLE, 27.9% of women with RA, and in 26% of the controls. High-risk viral types 58, 35 and 18 were the most frequently identified in SLE. Two women with SLE had a high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion and one had cervical cancer. An association was observed between methotrexate utilization, longer duration of therapy with prednisone, and HPV+ in RA or SLE. Thus, there is a high prevalence of cervical HPV infection in Mexican women with SLE or RA, and physicians must be vigilant in preventing the development of cervical dysplasia.</p>

<p>Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is associated with a higher-than-expected risk of uterine cervical dysplasia on Pap smears.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0961203311425517">1</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0961203311425517">3</xref></sup> Risk factors associated with cervical dysplasia in these patients included a history of sexually transmitted disease, early age of onset of sexual activity, greater number of sexual partners, and low education level.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0961203311425517">3</xref></sup> The use of cyclophosphamide in SLE has been associated with an increased risk of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0961203311425517">4</xref></sup> and one study found that there was an increased prevalence of human papillomavirus (HPV) type 16infection in women with SLE.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0961203311425517">5</xref></sup> These findings may be relevant for women with SLE, since epidemiological evidence suggests that HPV is a major etiological agent in the development of cervical cancer. In Mexico, the HPV prevalence in cervical samples has been estimated to be 9.3%,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0961203311425517">6</xref></sup> whereas cervical cancer prevalence in women in the general population (aged 35 years and older) ranges from 0.5% to 0.9%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0961203311425517">7</xref></sup> HPV, and particularly HPV types 16, 18 and 45, is found in 87% of cervical cancers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0961203311425517">8</xref></sup> Mexican patients with SLE have a high tendency to have major organ involvement, and the main causes of hospitalization in these patients are renal activity, neuropsychiatric disease, and cardiopulmonary disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0961203311425517">9</xref></sup> Patients with major organ involvement usually require immunosuppressive drugs, which could theoretically increase the risk of development of squamous intraepithelial lesions in patients with cervical HPV infection. Using Pap smear analysis, Dhar et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0961203311425517">10</xref></sup> found that 1.2% of their patients with SLE had cervical cancer and 2.8% had a diagnosis of high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HGSIL). They concluded that patients with SLE were 3.5% more likely to develop cervical cancer or high-grade cervical dysplasia than the controls.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0961203311425517">10</xref></sup> On the other hand, there is a lack of information about the prevalence of cervical neoplasia and its association with HPV in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Finally there is also currently lack of information regarding the frequency of HPV infection in Mexican patients with rheumatic disorders. Therefore, we evaluated the prevalence of cervical HPV infections in Mexican women with SLE and compared it with the prevalence in women with RA and in healthy controls.</p></sec>

<sec id="sec3-0961203311425517"><title>Clinical setting</title>
<p>Women with SLE and RA who were patients at an outpatient rheumatology clinic in a secondary care center in Guadalajara, Mexico were invited to participate in this study. Only patients aged 18–54 years with previous sexual activity were included in the study. Patients were excluded if they had a hysterectomy, cervical cancer, or a previous diagnosis of papillomavirus. None of the patients had had a Pap smear in the year prior to the study onset. Patients with SLE were compared with a group of RA and a group of healthy women of similar age who also met the inclusion criteria. Women for the control group were recruited at a department of preventive medicine located at the same hospital where the SLE and RA patients were treated.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec4-0961203311425517"><title>Collection of patient data</title>
<p>Patients with SLE or RA and healthy controls were interviewed about the following using a structured questionnaire: age at onset of sexual activity, number of pregnancies and parity, use of hormonal contraceptives, total number of sexual partners and previous genital infections, and other variables related to risk factors for papillomavirus infection. For patients with SLE or RA the disease duration, comorbid diseases, medical history and current medications were obtained from the patient’s clinical charts.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec5-0961203311425517"><title>Gynecological evaluation and cervical cytology</title>
<p>Clinical examinations of the genitalia were performed by a single gynecologist who examined the vulva, vagina, and cervix of each woman. The Pap smears were collected using conventional techniques. Briefly, the cervix was visualized after insertion of a speculum in the vagina with rotation using gentle pressure. A Cytobrush was inserted two-thirds of the way into the endocervical canal and external cervix and rotated 360°; it was then rolled over the outer third of a slide and the material on the spatula was spread in a thin layer over the middle third of the slide using a single stroke. The material was fixed by spraying with 95% ethanol and the specimens were immediately transported to the laboratory for analysis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0961203311425517">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>All Pap smears were evaluated by the same cytopathologist, who was blinded to the results of the gynecological examination. Cervical cytology results were classified according to the Papanicolaou classification system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0961203311425517">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0961203311425517">13</xref></sup> into five classes: Pap I, essentially normal cellular findings; Pap II, diverse cellular changes possibly due to inflammation; Pap III, uncertain cellular changes, some of which correspond to inflammatory alterations and regenerative changes; Pap IV, cellular changes characteristic of precancer or cancer, including carcinoma in situ; Pap V, changes characteristic of cancer. The Pap smears were also evaluated using the Bethesda System,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0961203311425517">14</xref></sup> which classifies cervical cytology into fiveclasses according to the presence or absence of HPV infection: normal (benign cellular changes); inflammatory changes; atypical squamous cells of uncertain significance (ASCUS); high- or low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HGSIL orLGSIL); and carcinoma in situ. The presence of genital infections, such as bacterial vaginosis or <italic>Gardnerella vaginalis</italic>, was also determined in each Pap smear.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec6-0961203311425517"><title>Determination of HPV in cervical smears</title>
<p>Collection of samples: the material obtained from the cervix using a Cytobrush was deposited in a 2.5 ml microtube containing 1 ml of 1X TBE buffer solution. All samples were labeled and stored at −20°C until DNA extraction. DNA extraction was performed by centrifuging the sample at 10,000 rpm for 20 s. Proteinase K (100 µl) was added and the sample was incubated at 37°C for 48 h. A phenol:chloroform:isoamyl:alcohol solution was used to extract the DNA, which was then precipitated with ethanol and sodium acetate and resuspended in 100 µl 1X TBE. The purity of the extracted DNA was determined by spectrophotometry. Primers thatamplified a 110 base pairs (bp) fragment were used to determine the presence of the constitutive gene EP3-EP13.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0961203311425517">15</xref></sup> The viral genome was amplified using two universal oligonucleotides, CPI and CPII, to identify viral types 5, 6, 8, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 56, and 58. These viral genotypes represent about 99% of the HPV types worldwide. A 188-bp fragment of the E1 region gene was used for HPV detection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0961203311425517">16</xref></sup> The fragment was amplified by PCR using the following primer set: CpI 5´-TTA TCA WAT GCC CAY TGT ACC AT-3´ and CpIIG 5´-ATG TTA ATW SAG CCW CCA AAA TT-3´. The resulting fragment was confirmed to be 188-bp by electrophoresis on a 6% (29:1) polyacrylamide gel at 80 V for 5 min, followed by electrophoresis at 140 V for 1.5 h. pBR322 digested with <italic>Hae III</italic> was used as a molecular weight marker as described previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0961203311425517">17</xref></sup></p></sec>
<sec id="sec7-0961203311425517"><title>Identification of the viral types</title>
<p>The amplified PCR products (10 µl) were also used toidentify the HPV type by digestion with <italic>RSA1</italic>according to the manufacturer’s directions (Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, CA). Specifically, the HPV type was identified based on the <italic>RSA1</italic> digestion pattern.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0961203311425517">15</xref></sup> Every HPV PCR assay included positive and negative controls: the positive controls were previously amplified samples as well as DNA extracted from SHILA cultured cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0961203311425517">15</xref></sup></p></sec>
<sec id="sec8-0961203311425517"><title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>Quantitative variables were expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD) and qualitative variables as frequencies (%). Comparisons between means of two groups were performed with unpaired Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test. Comparisons between variances ofthe three groups (SLE, RA, and controls) were performed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), and post-hoc pairwise joint comparisons between groups were performed using Scheffe’s correction. Comparisons of proportions between groups were performed using the chi-square or Fisher exact test. All the analyses were two-tailed and <italic>p</italic> values ≤ 0.05 were considered significant. All the analyses were performed using SPSS v.8.0 or EPI-INFO 6.0.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec9-0961203311425517"><title>Ethical considerations</title>
<p>The study was approved by the Hospital Research Ethics Committee (approval #2003-004-110-048). All patients provided written informed consent. Copies of their test results were given to the rheumatologists and family physicians treating these patients so that additional studies or treatment could be performed as necessary.</p></sec></sec>
<sec id="sec10-0961203311425517" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title>
<p>In the screening phase of the study we identified 40 patients with SLE who were potentially eligible; from this number six patients were excluded for the following reasons: two had a previous diagnosis of HPV infection, three had had hysterectomy, and one declined to participate. We selected for eligibility 50 consecutive women with RA that had similar age to the group with SLE. From these patients the following were exclusion causes: two patients declined to participate, three had diagnosis of HPV infection previous to the study, and two had had hysterectomy. From 150 potentially eligible controls, four were excluded because they declined to participate and none had HPV infection. Therefore, 34 patients with SLE, 43 with RA, and 146 controls were included in this study. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0961203311425517">Table 1</xref> summarizes the demographic characteristics and sexual histories of the women in the 3 groups. There were no differences between groups in variables associated with the incidence of HPV infection such as age, formal education, marital status, proportion of active workers, age at first intercourse, number of sexual partners during the lifetime, or users of hormonal contraceptives. A significant difference was observed in the years of disease duration between the SLE group compared with the RA group (9.4 <italic>vs.</italic> 6.3 years respectively, <italic>p</italic> = 0.048). Twenty-five patients with SLE (73%) had a SLEDAI score ≥ 4 at the time of the study. There were significant differences between SLE and RA in the frequency of users of immunosuppressive drugs, as well as the prednisone dosage at the time of the study.

<p>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to address the prevalence of cervical HPV infections in Mexican women with SLE. Our results show that 15% of women with SLE and 28% of women with RA have cervical HPV infections, being the most frequent HPV high-risk types. This study also found that about one out of seven women with SLE had significant changes in the cervical smear classified as Pap III.</p>
<p>Although the frequency of HPV infections was similar between SLE, RA, and controls, SLE and RA patients had characteristics that may increase their risk of developing cervical neoplasia if they are infected or become infected by HPV. Risk factors for cervical cancer include impairment of the cellular response against viral infection,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0961203311425517">18</xref></sup> defects in innate immunity,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0961203311425517">19</xref></sup> and the use of immunosuppressive drugs (such as cyclophosphamide or azathioprine) that may be associated with the development of cervical dysplasia, particularly in SLE.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0961203311425517">4</xref></sup> In this regard we observed a high frequency of abnormal cervical cytology in our patients with SLE and RA. Dhar et al. reported in a sample of cervical cytologies obtained mainly from African-American populations that around 2.8% of women with SLE had HGSIL and 1.2% cancer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0961203311425517">10</xref></sup> Using the Bethesda classification we found that 5.9% of our sample with SLE had HGSIL, indicating the relevance of the cytological changes observed in these patients.</p>
<p>The prevalence of cervical HPV is expected to have significant variations between different countries due to a multiplicity of factors. A study of 30 women with SLE in the UK reported by Nath et al. found that 54% had cervical HPV infections,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0961203311425517">5</xref></sup> this rate being 3.6-fold higher than that observed in our study. A reason for these differences between both rates is the higher proportion of risk factors associated with HPV infection in Nath’s sample (for example, greater number of sexual partners) compared with our study. However, Nath et al. assessed only HPV type 16; therefore, it is possible that the prevalence of HPV infection in their study would have increased if other HPV types had been assessed.</p>
<p>In Hong Kong a work identified a frequency of HPV infection in SLE of only 11.8% whereas the prevalence in the control group was 5.7%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0961203311425517">3</xref></sup> This low rate of HPV infection observed by Tam et al. in their study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0961203311425517">3</xref></sup> may be attributable to the low frequency of risk factors for development of the infection. For example, only 6% of patients with SLE and controls included by Tam et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0961203311425517">3</xref></sup> had their first intercourse at a younger age, whereas in our study 29% of patients with SLE and almost 22% of controls had their first intercourse at ≤ 17 years; and only 1% of Chinese women with SLE and 2% of their controls had four or more sexual partners compared with almost 15% of women with SLE and 8% of controls in our study.</p>
<p>More recently, four studies were published last year (2010) evaluating the frequency of HPV in SLE: one was a systematic review,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0961203311425517">20</xref></sup> two others were cross-sectional studies,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0961203311425517">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0961203311425517">22</xref></sup> and the fourth was a prospective cohort.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0961203311425517">23</xref></sup> Lee et al. identified a higher prevalence of HPV infection in Korean women with SLE (24.6%) compared with healthy women (7.9%, <italic>p &lt; </italic>0.001).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0961203311425517">21</xref></sup> This interesting study found also a high frequency of abnormal cytology, and carcinoma in situ confirmed by histologic evaluation in around 8% of the women with SLE.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0961203311425517">21</xref></sup> This finding highlights the importance of performing a systematic gynecologic assessment in women with SLE, in order to identify those risk factors associated with the development of cervical neoplasia including the presence of high-cancer-risk HPV infection.</p>
<p>In Latin American countries there is limited information about the frequency of HPV in women with SLE. Klumb et al. described a higher prevalence of HPV in Brazilian women with SLE in comparison with controls without SLE (20.2% <italic>vs.</italic> 7.3% respectively, <italic>p &lt; </italic>0.001).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0961203311425517">22</xref></sup> Risk factors for HPV infection in SLE identified in an adjusted analysis in this study included antecedents of four or more lifetime sexual partners, and history of a previous HPV infection, whereas the unique factor associated to SLE was an intensive use of immunosuppressive drugs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0961203311425517">22</xref></sup> Although our study has some limitations to performing sub-analysis for the sample size, we identified a significant trend to higher frequency of methotrexate utilization and higher doses of azathioprine in the subgroup of RA or SLE who had HPV(+) infection compared with HPV(−) patients, supporting the observations described in Brazilian women with SLE.</p>
<p>In rheumatic disorders consideration should be given to the fact that HPV infection may persist and produce cellular changes in infected cells. In a cohort study performed in Hong Kong, Tam et al. reported a prevalence of 12.5% of HPV infection in Chinese women with SLE at the baseline increasing this prevalence to 25% after three years of follow-up; additionally they observed that 48.5% of incident HPV infections persisted for six months or more.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0961203311425517">23</xref></sup> This finding is important in rheumatic disorders because epidemiological studies have shown that persistent HPV infections may increase the risk of cervical cancer over time.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0961203311425517">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>In a systematic review, Santana et al. assessed the frequency of HPV infection, precancerous cervical abnormalities and cervical cancer in SLE.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0961203311425517">20</xref></sup> This review identified 15 out of 18 studies that observed a higher frequency of abnormal cervical pre-malignant lesions in SLE women compared with controls, and three studies reporting higher frequency of HGSIL in SLE compared with their controls.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0961203311425517">20</xref></sup> Three studies included in this review also identified an association between use of immunosuppressive drugs and cervical abnormalities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0961203311425517">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>Our study is the first to compare the prevalence of HPV infection between SLE and RA. There is a lack of information about the frequency of HPV infection in patients with RA. We have previously published a study of 61 Mexican women with RA in whom the prevalence of HPV infection was 30%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0961203311425517">25</xref></sup> The present study shows a similar prevalence, being an important proportion of cervical cytological changes that should alert physicians to the requirement to evaluate cervical dysplasia in these patients.</p>
<p>Our study has several strengths, one of which is the matching by range of age between SLE, RA, and control groups, whereas other studies have failed to match their groups for age.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0961203311425517">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0961203311425517">10</xref></sup> As age is a well-known factor that modifies the prevalence of HPV infection, studies evaluating differences in rates for this infection should control this confounder. Additionally, other risk factors that play a role as potential confounders for HPV infection were similarly distributed between the three groups in our study. Another advantage of the present study with respect to earlier studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0961203311425517">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0961203311425517">5</xref></sup> is that we identified most HPV virus types (corresponding to around 99% of the most common HPV types).</p>
<p>One disadvantage of our study is related to the limitations of the cross-sectional designs to establish a causal relationship and to identify incidence. Although we identified a high proportion of patients having cervical cytological abnormalities, future studies should follow the patients with RA and SLE with HPV-infection compared with patients without this infection in order to determine the incidence of the development of cervical high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions. Another limitation of our study is related to the sample size, which is sufficient to identify a high prevalence of HPV infection in Mexican women with SLE orRA but insufficient to establish a clear association between immunosuppressive treatment and HGSIL.</p>
<p>In summary, this study found that Mexican women with SLE or RA frequently had cervical HPV infections and also had an elevated frequency of cervical abnormalities in the cytology. A prospective cohort of mainly patients treated with immunosuppressive drugs is needed to determine whether being infected with HPV increases the risk of neoplasia development. An increased effort should be made to prevent HPV infection in our SLE and RA patients, to establish early diagnoses of HPV, and to implement follow-up strategies for identifying cervical cellular changes that are suggestive of neoplasia in order to reduce the risk of cervical cancer. With this aim, our department encourages rheumatologists and primary care physicians to use a set protocol to evaluate Pap smears and to increase the use of diagnostic tests for detecting HPV in patients with rheumatic disorders.</p></sec>
