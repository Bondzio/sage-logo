<abstract>
<p>We propose “instructional chaining” as an analytic method for capturing and describing key instructional episodes enacted by expert writing teachers to foster the recontextualization over time of the social practices of argumentative writing through process-oriented instructional approaches. The article locates instructional chaining within a sociocultural framework and argues for conceptualizing learning to write as the recontextualization of social practices of writing in classroom settings. To illustrate the use of instructional chaining to study the effects of teaching on learning argumentative writing, we describe the processes employed to construct an instructional chain for a unit of literary argumentation in a 12th grade English language arts classroom. We conclude with a discussion of two potential uses of instructional chains as units of analysis for both quantitative and qualitative analyses to study patterns of teaching and learning across many classrooms.</p>

<p>Since the 1980s, process-oriented approaches to writing instruction have become dominant in research on written composition and in the ways teachers describe their instructional practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0741088313491713">Hillocks, 2002</xref>). Generally, the consensus among researchers and teachers alike is that effective teaching and learning of writing are conceptualized and enacted as processes that include prewriting or preparation, drafting, and revising, and, at times, publishing, with the caveat that the process is recursive rather than linear. Despite the general agreement on the teaching and learning of writing as a process, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0741088313491713">Applebee (1986)</xref> argued that the implementation of the writing process has led to a serious underconceptualization of writing instruction grounded in a general model that ignores task-specific and contextual demands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0741088313491713">Smagorinsky &amp; Smith, 1992</xref>). It is important then for researchers to study the classroom implementation of writing instruction as an unfolding process over time so that the field can learn more about what effective writing instruction looks like.</p>
<p>Accordingly, as writing researchers studying the teaching and learning of argumentative writing in classrooms, we are interested in how teachers use process-oriented instruction to teach argumentative writing and how the task-specific nature of argumentative writing is taught and learned over time (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0741088313491713">Newell, Beach, Smith, &amp; VanDerHeide, 2011</xref>). Working as part of team of field researchers, we studied the teaching and learning of argumentative writing across 31 high school English language arts (ELA) classrooms to understand how these teachers taught argumentative writing across these various contexts as well as how classroom instruction and social interaction were related to individual students’ learning about argumentative writing. As an exploratory study of teachers’ typical approaches to argumentative writing instruction, the project did not include an intervention. The teachers were locally considered as excellent writing teachers by their school, district, and academic and professional communities. We studied each classroom for one instructional unit (ranging in time from five class periods to over a month), observing participants, recording video, interviewing teachers and students, collecting student writing, surveying students’ experiences with school-based argumentative writing, and administering pretests and posttests of an argumentative writing task. We hoped to answer the following questions: How do excellent writing teachers teach argumentative writing? What instructional practices are related to student learning of argumentative writing?</p>
<p>We had a multitude of data to help us answer our questions, but we were limited in the methods available to us to look at instructional patterns across the 31 classrooms and to study the relationship between writing instruction in all its situated complexity and student learning, which is equally complex, situated, and variable. The purpose of this article is to describe an analytic method we developed to explore questions about the teaching and learning of argumentative writing, <italic>instructional chains</italic>: key instructional episodes that are linked to promote the recontextualization of the social practices of a particular kind of writing. Creating an instructional chain of a teacher’s writing instruction allows us to select, in a principled way, the moments of instruction that are linked together to maximize students’ learning to write.</p>
<sec id="section1-0741088313491713" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methodological Problems When Studying Process-Oriented Writing Instruction</title>
<p>Our method of instructional chaining contributes to the line of research on classroom-based writing instruction and the effects of instruction on writers and writing. Although other methods—experimental, survey, case study, and large-scale sampling—have been employed to study writing instruction, we found that none of these were what we needed to effectively study process-oriented writing instruction across a large number of classrooms.</p>
<p>Experimental studies, which study the effectiveness of a particular type of instruction on some aspect of learning to write (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0741088313491713">Hillocks, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0741088313491713">McKeough, Davis, Forgeron, Marini, &amp; Fung, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0741088313491713">Smagorinsky, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0741088313491713">Wilder &amp; Wolfe, 2009</xref>), do not allow for researchers to study writing instruction as it is naturally enacted by various teachers across various contexts. While these studies are helpful to the field by making claims about the types of instruction that are successful in causing or predicting certain types of learning and allowing for meta-analyses that build ideas across years and decades of writing research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0741088313491713">Graham, McKeown, Kiuhare, &amp; Harris, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0741088313491713">Graham &amp; Perin, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0741088313491713">Hillocks, 1986</xref>), experiments could not help us answer our question about how excellent writing teachers were enacting writing instruction in their actual classrooms. On the other hand, surveys of instructional practices reported both by teachers (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0741088313491713">Applebee, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0741088313491713">Applebee &amp; Langer, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0741088313491713">Freedman, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0741088313491713">Olinghouse, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0741088313491713">Sadoski, Wilson, &amp; Norton, 1997</xref>) and by students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0741088313491713">Scherff &amp; Piazza, 2005</xref>) do provide a large sampling of instructional practices across many classrooms and many geographic areas. However, even assuming the veracity of the self-reports, these surveys allow for only snapshots of typical practices, without adding to our knowledge of how these practices actually play out in the classroom and how they unfold over time.</p>
<p>Observational studies <italic>have</italic> allowed researchers to study writing instruction as it is enacted in classrooms, and we situate our own work within this body of research. However, these studies have diverged as both case studies and large-scale studies. Whereas case studies focus on one or more classrooms (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0741088313491713">Beck, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0741088313491713">Freedman, Delp, &amp; Crawford, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0741088313491713">Herrington, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0741088313491713">Langer &amp; Applebee, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0741088313491713">Lunsford, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0741088313491713">Nystrand &amp; Graff, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0741088313491713">Sperling, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0741088313491713">Sperling &amp; Freedman, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0741088313491713">Sperling &amp; Woodlief, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0741088313491713">Wilder, 2002</xref>) for rich descriptions of complex instructional ecologies and individual student experiences, large-scale studies (the studies cited here range from 11 to 64 classrooms) allow researchers to look across many classrooms at the regular instructional practices within them in order to make claims about instructional practices that are related to writing achievement and learning. The latter was our own goal in studying the teaching and learning of argumentative writing in 31 high school classrooms. However, the sampled instruction across these large-scale studies, which ranged from one lesson (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0741088313491713">McCarthey, 2008</xref>) to two lessons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0741088313491713">Puranik, Al Otaiba, Sidler, &amp; Greulich, 2013</xref>) to four lessons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0741088313491713">Applebee, Langer, Nystrand, &amp; Gamoran, 2003</xref>) to ten lessons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0741088313491713">Lipson, Mosenthal, Daniels, &amp; Woodside-Jiron, 2000</xref>), was spread out across the school year in order to sample typical instruction at different points in time. This sampling method did not fit with our theoretical and practical understanding of writing instruction as an unfolding process. Sampling various points in time would not allow us to see the process of writing instruction over time. We needed an analytical method that afforded the richness of the case study paired with the strength of a large-scale study.</p>
<p>In addition to our desire to study process-oriented approaches to writing, our need for a new method was also shaped by our theoretical orientation. We are literacy scholars, writing researchers, and teachers, and thus our work is primarily framed by sociocultural theories of reading and writing that share the assumption that to understand how people take up and make sense of literacy practices in their own lives, researchers must seek to understand how culturally and historically situated meanings are constructed, reconstructed, and transformed through social mediation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0741088313491713">Smagorinsky, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0741088313491713">Vygotsky, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0741088313491713">Wertsch, 1998</xref>). From a literacy practice perspective, we perceive argumentation as a social practice that agents (i.e., speakers, writers, readers) take up, or appropriate, in activity settings, such as classrooms, using the mediated means of semiotic tools (e.g., speech, written language, diagrams, drawings), and this appropriation takes place over time as students recontextualize social practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0741088313491713">Bernstein, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0741088313491713">Van Leeuwen, 2008</xref>), such as argument and argumentative writing, from one point in time to another.</p>
<p>Because of our theoretical understanding of learning as the recontextualization of social practices, we realized that the typical method of sampling for large-scale studies was not appropriate for our study. We did not want to sample typical instruction at various time points; instead, we wanted to sample instruction that is unfolding over time, that is, during an instructional unit planned and enacted by the teacher. Sampling instruction as an unfolding process is also a better match for the process-oriented instruction taking place in most high school ELA classrooms, our participating classrooms in particular, and we wanted to study how the task-specific nature of argumentative writing is taught within the process approach.</p>

<title>A New Method for Sampling Process Approaches to Writing Instruction</title>
<p>Because we needed a new analytic method for sampling the process of writing instruction, we developed a principled and systematic approach to select focused observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0741088313491713">Spradley, 1980</xref>). This approach, <italic>instructional chaining</italic>, reflected our beliefs about how instruction supports students’ recontextualization of the social practices of argumentative writing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0741088313491713">Van Leeuwen, 2008</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0741088313491713">Van Leeuwen (2008)</xref> defines social practices as “socially regulated ways of doing things” (p. 6). He then delineates elements that are always part of a social practice: participants, actions, performance modes, eligibility conditions, eligibility, times, locations, resources, presentation styles. As students engage in the recontextualization of social practices, they transform these elements as substitutions, deletions, rearrangements, and additions. For example, as one of the teachers from our argumentative writing project shifted from a presentation of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0741088313491713">Toulmin’s (1958)</xref> model of argumentation to asking small groups of her students to develop claims for their own arguments, the students substituted, that is, “particularized” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0741088313491713">Van Leeuwen, 2008</xref>, p. 17), the concept of “claim” based on the broad notion of claim given in the teacher’s presentation. One small group developed a claim about the problem of timing of midyear exams (before or after holiday break) by first explaining the significance of the timing (an extended delay may cause students to forget course material) and a call to action (that the school board should mandate midyear exams be given before holiday break). The students recontextualized the particular social practice of making claims across these linked episodes. Van Leeuwen describes these linked episodes within which the social practices are recontextualized as a <italic>recontextualization chain</italic>.</p>
<p>When learning to write arguments is conceptualized as the recontextualization of the social practices of argumentation, teachers’ instruction then becomes a practice of creating conditions that allow for students’ recontextualization of particular practices over time and across contexts; in other words, teaching helps to foster recontextualization chains. As a result, how instruction unfolds over time is important. We agree with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0741088313491713">Hillocks’s (1995)</xref> argument that teaching <italic>should</italic> take place in episodes that are coherently linked together. In reality, the relationship between these linked episodes might be weak, when each episode seems to stand alone in a way that does not encourage recontextualization. On the other hand, a strong relationship is one in which “one episode engages students in the development of procedural knowledge that will be used in the next and/or in later episodes” (p. 171). Hillocks’s argument for a strong relationship between linked episodes lying in the development of knowledge that will be used in later episodes brings to our minds <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0741088313491713">Van Leeuwen’s (2008)</xref> idea about the recontextualization chain. Effective teaching of argumentative writing allows students to recontextualize the knowledge and practices specific to argumentative writing over time. We believe that excellent argumentative writing instruction is made up of linked episodes that create an <italic>instructional chain</italic> that allows students to recontextualize the social practices of argumentation.</p>
<p>In order to study process-oriented writing instruction in a manner that fit our theoretical and practical beliefs about the teaching and learning of writing, we developed the analytical unit of the instructional chain. The instructional chain became a unit of analysis that allowed us to sample instruction, to set aside the classroom episodes that were not directly related to the teaching and learning of argumentative writing so that we could see each teacher’s “through line” of instruction, that is, to study how each teacher supported the recontextualization of the social practices of argumentation. This analytic framework allows us to consider how teachers create instruction that allows students to recontextualize the uses of social practices, topic knowledge, and “effective” arguments as they move from one class session to another during the instructional units. As we will describe in more detail, these chains became the samples of teachers’ instruction that we could use to look across all 31 classrooms for patterns of effective instruction.</p>

<sec id="section3-0741088313491713">
<title>Forming the Instructional Chain</title>
<p>In this section, we describe our process of forming instructional chains for the teachers’ instructional units we observed. We illustrate each stage of the process—taking an ethnographic stance to the argumentative writing unit, indexing episodes within the observed instruction, and selecting episodes to form an instructional chain—by describing the analytical choices we made while constructing one teacher’s instructional chain.</p>
<sec id="section4-0741088313491713">
<title>The Research Team</title>
<p>The research team for our Argumentative Writing Project consists of authors Jennifer VanDerHeide, a doctoral student who served as a field researcher, and Dr. George Newell, who is the principal investigator as well as field researcher for the project. Other team members who also served as field researchers for data collection in ELA classrooms include Dr. David Bloome, Amy Bradley, Dr. Alan Hirvela, Jamie Smith, and Allison Wynhoff Olsen. Brenton Goff, SangHee Ryu, and Larkin Weyand have assisted other members of the research team in developing the instructional chains. Dr. Helen Marks served as statistical consultant for the research project. Since classroom observations and data collection concluded in May 2012, the research team met on a continuous basis for training on data analysis (constructing instructional chains for each ELA classroom observed) and for reliability checks to ensure consistency in developing the chains. Members of the research team were responsible for developing chains for the instructional units they observed or for working with team members who did not participate in the classroom observations. The authors led the training sessions and met with team members to ensure quality data analysis and to conduct reliability checks.</p>

<sec id="section5-0741088313491713">
<title>Taking an Ethnographic Stance to the Argumentative Writing Unit</title>
<p>Although an instructional chain can be used for a more objective, quantifiable analysis, the forming of the chain is a qualitative and subjective, yet principled and systematic method of analysis. We began the process of forming the chain from an ethnographic stance, attempting to gain an emic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0741088313491713">Heath &amp; Street, 2008</xref>) understanding of the instructional context and the teacher’s and students’ goals within that context. Although a field researcher can never truly gain an emic perspective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0741088313491713">Agar, 1996</xref>), we aimed to understand the teaching and learning of argumentative writing from the students’ and teacher’s perspective. Each field researcher spent, on average, 8 to 12 class periods in a particular classroom, observing, taking field notes, recording each full session with video and audio, and collecting instructional documents and student writing samples. We interviewed the teacher and four students from each classroom to better understand their experience of the instructional unit.</p>
<p>To illustrate, we spent several weeks observing an instructional unit on writing arguments about short stories in Ms. Hamilton’s classroom, a 12th grade Advanced Placement (AP) literature and composition class in a suburban school. Through observation and interviews, we aimed to understand how Ms. Hamilton understood and enacted the goals of her instructional unit. Her focus was on the students constructing original arguments about literary elements within a short story, and she emphasized the importance of classroom discussions in providing space for the students to develop these ideas and arguments. These goals were influenced by Ms. Hamilton’s instructional context; constructing original arguments about literary elements is a central goal of the College Board and the AP literature test. Because most of Ms. Hamilton’s students were planning on attending college the next fall, she wanted them to be well prepared to do well on this exam and be prepared for the writing demands of their college classrooms. Although the instructional chain we created for Ms. Hamilton does not explicitly outline these goals and how they are influenced by the multiple contexts in which her instruction takes place, these contextual issues influenced our understanding of her classroom and her instruction. As a result, we made the best effort we could to create a chain that reflected these goals.</p>
<p>The students we interviewed revealed that they shared this understanding of the goal of the unit—to write original arguments about literary elements—and referenced the classroom discussions and small group sharing of writing as being essential steps in the process of writing their arguments. Certainly, every student is different and has his or her own experience of classroom instruction, and when a researcher creates one instructional chain to represent the teacher’s instruction, it is likely impossible to represent each and every student’s emic perspective as would be more possible with a case study approach. As our focus for this particular project was on the teachers’ instruction, we chose to foreground the teachers’ understandings of their units and make use of the students’ understanding to validate our own subjective interpretation of the unit. The decisions we would later make in selecting representative, typical episodes for the instructional chain were grounded in our understanding of the unit from the teacher’s perspective.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0741088313491713">
<title>Creating an Index of Episodes Within the Observed Unit</title>
<p>By relying on field notes and video from the observed unit, members of our research team constructed an index of every “episode” within the instructional units they have observed. See <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0741088313491713">Table 1</xref> for an example of the indexing of a single class session into 5 episodes. Our understanding of an episode comes from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0741088313491713">Nystrand (1997)</xref>, who defined episode as a coherent classroom activity centering on a particular objective or purpose, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0741088313491713">Hillocks (1999)</xref>, who argued that episodes change with new materials, shifts in teacher-student relationships (lecture, small group work, conferencing, etc.), and the introduction of new instructional goals. The result of this indexing is a map of every observed session divided into episodes, each labeled with the corresponding time on the video and a brief description of the content of the episode. For most teachers, although most episodes were related to the teaching of the argumentative writing unit, there were some episodes that had a different focus, such as general housekeeping issues, classroom management issues, or unrelated educational topics such as reading quizzes, ongoing projects, or test prep vocabulary practice.</p>

<title>Selecting Episodes to Form an Instructional Chain</title>
<p>From this analysis of the instructional context and the mapping of episodes within the unit, we began the work of reducing/selecting the episodes of the observed unit to create an instructional chain. For heuristic purposes, consider a chain made up of many links with each link connected to the next and each link an integral part of the entire chain. Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0741088313491713">Hillocks (1995)</xref>, we argue that effective and coherent classroom instruction should be chain-like with episodes linked together to form a coherent instructional chain, within which skills, knowledge, and ideas are recontextualized from one episode to another in order to support learning. When analyzing each teacher’s instructional chain, we chose episodes that fit coherently together for the purpose of the teaching and learning of argumentative writing. We recognize that in many classrooms we studied, the instruction was not entirely coherent and that in aiming to create a coherent sample of linked instruction we risk creating a coherence that does not match the way instruction was experienced by the teacher or the students. However, with that as a real limitation, we sought to put together the chain in a way that honored the best intentions of the teachers as they created and intended the unit.</p>
<sec id="section8-0741088313491713">
<title>Time</title>
<p>For our subsequent coding purposes, we chose to construct a chain of 150 minutes as we wanted to hold the amount of time constant across different teacher’s chains and focus our in-depth coding of instruction on key episodes of instruction rather than all observed instruction. For a different research question, we might not have put such limitations on the amount of time included in the chain, especially if our question had to do with how much time teachers spent on particular aspects of instruction. Limiting time or holding time constant across multiple chains is certainly not necessary for creating instructional chains, just the decision we made for this project. Our decision to use this particular number of minutes for each instructional unit was grounded in prior large-scale studies of classroom instruction in reading and writing such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0741088313491713">Nystrand (1997)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0741088313491713">Taylor, Pearson, Peterson, and Rodriguez (2003)</xref>, who analyzed a similar number of minutes; we were also constrained by the practical consideration that a few teachers’ instructional units that spanned just a few days.</p>
<p>We made this decision because time was becoming messy for us as we were trying to look at instruction across so many classrooms. One problem is that because we wanted teachers to teach one instructional unit in whatever form it would usually take, we found that teachers defined units in very different ways. For example, one teacher who was teaching students to write an argumentative essay at the end of a Shakespearean play did not want us to observe until after the students were finished reading the play; another teacher had us observe throughout the reading and class discussions of a Shakespearean play because she understood the discussions to be an important part of the students’ writing process. Although these two teachers taught similar units, what they had us actually observe was quite different. Some classrooms were working on multiple writing projects at once, while others would spend a month or two working on the same project. Our observations were already a sampling of the teachers’ actual instruction; choosing to limit the time of our instructional chains was an additional method of sampling, an attempt to make our data reduction and analysis feasible across 31 classrooms. Certainly, sampling does not account for all instruction, and it does not provide the same complete picture that an ethnography or case study might. However, sampling does allow us to look across a large number of classrooms.</p>

<sec id="section9-0741088313491713">
<title>The end-of-unit writing assignment</title>
<p>Choosing which episodes to include in the instructional chain is guided by principles to preserve the ecological validity of the chains. That is, we made every attempt to select episodes that represented the behaviors, materials, and instructional conversations we observed and recorded in a classroom to reflect what actually occurred in the classroom, not only from our etic perspective but from the teacher’s emic perspective. Specifically, we began by identifying the teacher-sponsored end-of-unit assignment, typically an argumentative essay the students completed at the end point of the unit. We then analyzed this assignment for the key ideas, skills, and knowledge necessary to complete the assignment. For example, Ms. Hamilton’s end-of-unit writing assignment asked the students to construct an argument analyzing the literary devices in one of the short stories that they had read and discussed. In order to complete this assignment, students needed knowledge of the short stories and literary devices, how to analyze the use of literary devices in a short story, and what counts as an appropriate argument about literary devices in a short story. Ms. Hamilton’s comments on the essays as well as her evaluation rubric focused on original claims, evidence from the text to support those claims, and explanations about how the evidence supported the literary arguments the students made. The interview with her and her students supported this understanding of the purpose of the writing assignment.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0741088313491713">
<title>Selecting representative episodes</title>
<p>The chains we constructed then were linked instructional episodes that led up to and supported students’ responses to this assignment. We assumed that cohesive instructional chains allowed for recontextualization of these ideas, skills, and knowledge across episodes, so we chose episodes that represented the best case for this recontextualization. We worked backward from the assignment, much like backward mapping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0741088313491713">Dixon &amp; Green, 2005</xref>), an analytic process that locates key preceding events that are intertextually and intercontextually connected to a particular activity, in our case the end-of-unit argumentative task. Because the length of teachers’ units varied so greatly, we had to be more or less selective in choosing these episodes. We also kept in mind episodes that were representative of particular cases for particular teachers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0741088313491713">Mitchell, 1984</xref>). For instance, while constructing Ms. Hamilton’s chain, we chose episodes that represented the primary ways she taught them about the short stories, literary devices, and arguments. Classroom discussions of short stories were her primary mode of instruction about the literature; for each story the students read, they had a full class session discussion on the story, focusing on one literary element in particular and practicing making arguments about that literary element in the short story. Because these discussions were important, we chose to make them a prominent part of the chain. However, these discussions added up to more than the 150 minutes for coding the instructional chains, so we had to select episodes from the classroom discussions that seemed to be typical discussions.</p>
</sec>

<sec id="section11-0741088313491713">
<title>Data Reduction</title>
<p>Certainly, in sampling 150 minutes, we privilege some moments of instruction while leaving others out of this particular analysis. However, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0741088313491713">Smagorinsky (2008)</xref> pointed out, “Data reduction is a critical part of the research method. . . . All researchers reduce their data: some to numbers, some to words, some to both” (p. 397). We made the decision to reduce our data in this way in order to make it more feasible for us to look across instruction in 31 classrooms. However, Smagorinsky also argued that researchers must be diligent in reporting how they made this reduction. A comparison of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0741088313491713">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0741088313491713">Appendix A</xref> illustrates how we chose representative episodes of one teacher’s entire observed unit. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0741088313491713">Figure 1</xref> illustrates Ms. Hamilton’s 150-minute instructional chain. <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0741088313491713">Appendix A</xref> illustrates the format our research team used to share instructional chains with each other; we chose to include commentary on the sessions and episodes that are not included to warrant our decisions. Our chains become data for quantitative and qualitative analyses that other members of our research team may want to conduct, and this additional information provides helpful context for those who were not the primary field researcher in a given teacher’s classroom.</p>

<title>Using the Instructional Chain as an Analytical Tool</title>
<p>In this section, we illustrate two possibilities for using instructional chains as a unit of analysis, first as samples for a quantitative coding of instructional elements related to the teaching and learning of argumentative writing, and second as cases for a cross-case analysis of instructional modes for the teaching of argumentative writing.</p>
<sec id="section13-0741088313491713">
<title>Instructional Chains as Samples for Quantitative Analyses</title>
<p>Using procedures as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0741088313491713">Taylor et al. (2003)</xref>, we coded instructional practices in 5-minute segments in order to quantify how the teachers taught argumentative writing. Taylor et al. coded reading instruction in 5-minute segments across six different levels of instruction. We modified their coding to reflect our own interests in the specifics of argumentative writing instruction. See <xref ref-type="table" rid="table9-0741088313491713">Appendix B</xref> for our coding system. Each chain was coded by one researcher who coded the instructional elements across all six levels while watching and rewatching the 150 minutes of video. Prior to individual coding, all researchers were trained in the coding process until we reached 80% reliability within each level of the coding document.</p>
<p>To illustrate our coding process, consider a 5-minute segment of instruction in which a teacher led a class discussion on the teacher’s and students’ analysis of a model of argumentative writing, projected on the Smart Board. As we watched the video of this 5 minutes within the instructional chain, we marked all salient instructional elements that occurred at least once within the 5 minutes. In this instance, at Level 1, we coded whole class. At Level 2, we coded many different teacher actions that were salient within this 5 minutes: telling/giving information, modeling, discussion, and representing visually. At Level 3, we coded discussing and writing as students were sharing ideas and writing down notes on their own copies of the model. At Level 4, we coded sample/model because they were considering a model and claim, evidence/data, warrant, and elements named because they were identifying these argumentative elements in the model and naming them explicitly. At Level 5, we coded analyzing arguments. These were not always simple decisions as teachers enact instruction differently. As we worked toward 80% reliability in our training sessions, we had many discussions about the definitions on our coding document and worked to operationalize the definitions as we watched videos of different teachers together. When we had questions as we individually coded, we relied on the definitions on the coding document to determine if an element occurred and double-checked these interpretations with another member of the team.</p>
<p>We then summed each instructional practice across each teacher’s 150 minutes. A descriptive analysis of these sums indicates how many instances the instructional practices particular to the teaching of argumentative writing were coded within each teacher’s instructional chain. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0741088313491713">Table 2</xref> provides a sample of these findings. By looking closely at the instructional practices across the sampled instruction within each teacher’s instructional chain, we can see that claim and evidence were coded as occurring the most often, and the structure of the essays was coded much of the time as well. Because these three instructional practices took place so often, it may be that these are the social practices of argumentation that students recontextualize the most often across teachers’ instructional chains. At the same time, it is also clear that there is great variability in the teaching of argumentative writing, as evidenced by the wide range and large standard deviation for all variables. It is important to keep in mind that these instructional chains are samples, so these findings do not account for all available instruction. However, as we sought to make the chains represent each teacher’s typical instruction, we feel that these findings are useful for a general understanding of the instructional practices related to the teaching of argumentative writing.</p>

<p>These analyses indicate that instruction on the elements of argumentation, counterargument in particular, and the active engagement of students in verbal argumentation in the classroom are related to students’ increased performance on a written argument. For example, for every additional 5 minutes coded to have included student debate, students’ composite scores rose almost 0.62 points (out of a possible total of 15 points); while this does not seem like a big jump, this difference was statistically significant from zero (<italic>B</italic> = 0.62, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). To put it another way, if an instructional chain was coded as having student debate occur within an additional 10 five-minute segments, that would relate, on average, to a rise of 6.2 points in students’ composite scores. Using the instructional chain as a sample for this quantitative analysis allowed us to focus on the instructional activities that were most related to the teaching and learning of argumentative writing and to begin to identify practices that relate to student learning and achievement. Certainly, as these chains are samples of instruction, we must be careful not to make too strong of claims about these relationships. However, the findings from this quantitative analysis do provide us with starting points for potentially powerful instructional practices, such as student debate. We can then use these findings to develop future intervention studies or to point us back into the instructional chains for rich examples of student debate for additional qualitative analyses.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0741088313491713">
<title>Instructional Chains as Cases for Qualitative Analyses</title>
<p>One difficulty of observational research that looks across multiple cases is narrowing the data set to a manageable but theoretically sound data sample. Selecting teachers’ instructional episodes as an instructional chain allows us to choose representative samples of each teacher’s instruction to use in a cross-case analysis. For example, a research question from our study was how excellent writing teachers teach argumentative writing. The quantitative analysis allowed us to quantify the instructional practices taking place within the sampled instruction, but we were also interested in how teachers put their instruction together over time. We were interested in whether we could see any patterns of how teachers took up a structured process approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0741088313491713">Applebee, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0741088313491713">Smagorinsky, Johannessen, Kahn, &amp; McCann, 2010</xref>) in their classrooms so that we could suggest particular models of effective argumentative writing instruction.</p>
<p>Using <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0741088313491713">Van Leeuwen’s (2008)</xref> description of recontextualization of social practices, we analyzed the social practice of argumentation in each instructional chain according to the following categories: participants, actions, performance modes, eligibility conditions, presentation styles, times, locations, and resources (tools and materials). We noticed patterns in how students were recontextualizing the social practices of argument across the instructional chains and chose to group the instructional patterns into categories in order to represent various instructional models represented by these teachers’ instructional chains. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0741088313491713">Hillocks’s (1986)</xref> categories for modes of presentation were a helpful starting point for us: presentational, natural process, environmental, and individualized. We found that the majority of the teachers were teaching in an environmental mode or a combination of presentational with individualized, but overarching categories still represented different instructional patterns. We then further broke apart these groups into three categories, each of which is described below. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0741088313491713">Figure 2</xref> provides a visual representation of one instructional chain representing each particular model in order to illustrate the contrasts among the different patterns.</p>

<title>Whole Group to Individual Instruction</title>
<p>This grouping of chains illustrates a combination of presentational mode with individualized mode. Of the 31 teachers’ chains, 12 represent this instructional model. Each unit would generally begin with the teacher providing information on the writing assignment, often accompanied with teacher-made materials to scaffold individual students’ writing processes. After the whole group instruction, students worked individually, often at individual computers in the computer lab. During this time, the teachers would conference with individual students, at times very systematically to ensure each student had equal opportunity to conference with the teacher, while other teachers conferenced more spontaneously. The first chain in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0741088313491713">Figure 2</xref> is a typical example of the chains within this instructional approach. In this chain, each day began with the teacher providing a whole group mini-lesson on a particular aspect of the argumentative writing process, such as using evidence or warranting claims, followed by a large amount of individual writing time in the computer lab while the teacher conferenced with individual students. For this particular instructional chain, the teacher ended many of the individual work sessions with a whole class debriefing to address any common issues or questions within the group.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-0741088313491713">
<title>Immersion in Topic Followed by Writing Workshop</title>
<p>This grouping of chains illustrates one variation of the environmental mode, or structured process approach. Only 5 of the 31 teachers’ chains represent this instructional model. Typically, the first several days of the unit would center around a text or set of texts, with the students reading and discussing across a variety of participation structures in order to gain a deep understanding of the content and to develop ideas for arguments for the topic. The teacher would then shift the students’ attention to an argumentative writing assignment on the topic, moving the students in and out of various participation structures to help the students draft and revise strategically. Instruction on argumentative writing was then embedded in the writing process itself, so as students would learn about claims and evidence, they would be creating them for their own writing, making use of their deep content knowledge from the first part of the unit. Ms. Hamilton’s chain (the second chain in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0741088313491713">Figure 2</xref>) is an example of this instructional pattern. The first several days of the chain were the reading and discussing of the short stories in order to help the students develop strong knowledge of the content of their essays. The actual instruction on argumentative writing came at the end of the unit while students were writing their essays, so all argumentative writing instruction was integrated into students’ argumentative writing processes.</p>

<p>This grouping of chains illustrates a second variation of the environmental mode. Of the 31 teachers’ chains, 14 represented this instructional model. Perhaps most similar to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0741088313491713">Hillocks’s (1986)</xref> description of the environmental mode, these chains allow students to gain procedural knowledge of argumentative writing by moving in and out of various participation structures and verbal and written argumentative activities. These activities center on topics that are topically unrelated to the writing that students will later do. Rather than pushing students to go deep into a particular topic, these activities allow students a deep understanding of the structures and procedures involved in argumentation, both verbal and written. The third instructional chain in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0741088313491713">Figure 2</xref> illustrates the way one teacher provided recurring practice in the elements of argumentation. After introducing students to the elements of the Toulmin model, the teacher had the students move in and out of reading example arguments, creating their own arguments in small groups, and presenting these arguments in mock debates in front of the class. Over time, she changed the topics that they were arguing, so students had multiple opportunities to recontextualize the elements of argumentation to new topics and new argumentative situations.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Working within a field that understands the teaching and learning of writing as a complex process of social construction situated within a wide range of sociocultural contexts, researchers need to develop methods to study instruction as an unfolding process over time as well as methods to examine how this process is similar and different across multiple classrooms. We believe that the construction of instructional chains for the teaching and learning of argumentative writing in high school ELA classrooms, although just one of many possible research tools, provides the field of written composition with a research tool that has been generally overlooked. We also believe that this method has important implications for understanding the complex and important knowledge needed for effective writing instruction. Although we do not offer instructional chains as a practical solution to the challenges of improving writing instruction, we hope that it might offer practitioners a new way to think about their writing instruction. We began with the assumption that our research methods should be shaped by what practitioners think is interesting and important—this is a key reason for why we are concerned with the qualitative uses of instructional chains.</p>
<p>That said, we also believe that we are just at the beginning of an important line of classroom-based research. For the most part, the field of written composition has focused on how process-oriented writing activities may lead to more effective writing instruction and higher order thinking and learning. Our research has led us to a rethinking of instructional activities not as ends in themselves but as way to ensure that individual activities will accumulate into a coherent whole, or indeed to what that whole might represent. The need for such a project seems especially important within the contexts of reforms in argumentative writing instruction that are centerpiece of the Common Core State Standards (CCSS) for ELA. Although the CCSS include wide-ranging goals for students’ writing development, they do not include suggestions for how teachers might structure activities and lessons to meet those goals. Instead, the CCSS provide for Grades 6 to 12 standards for argumentative writing that refer to the use of “substantive claims,” “clear reasons,” and “relevant and sufficient evidence” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0741088313491713">National Governors Association, 2010</xref>, p. 37). We think the use of instructional chains is an important first step in such an enterprise, whether or not the concern is with such standards. That, we think, is ultimately the most productive view, both in defining the questions researchers ask in the next generation of writing research and in helping the field of written composition to formulate a response to questions about how research can help practitioners think more deeply about their writing instruction. We believe that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0741088313491713">Van Leeuwen’s (2008)</xref> notion of recontextualization of social practices such as argumentative writing instruction provides us with a set of guiding principles to do this work.</p>

Discussion has a variety of forums for open-ended, collaborative exchange of ideas among a teacher and students or among students for the purpose of furthering students thinking, learning, problem solving, understanding, or literary appreciation. Participants present multiple points of view, respond to the ideas of others, and reflect on their own ideas in an effort to build their knowledge, understanding, or interpretation of the matter at hand.
