<body>
<p>In the first issue of Volume 63, we focused our editorial on the need to improve research in teacher education by increasing the rigor and relevance of studies in the field. We referred to individual studies as “bricks” in a structure that would serve as a knowledge base for researchers, practitioners, and policy makers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022487112469941">Knight, Lloyd, Arbaugh, Edmondson, Nolan, &amp; Whitney, 2012</xref>). As researchers, we need to attend to both the quality of individual bricks and the positioning of those bricks within the framework. In other words, by situating our findings within the theoretical frameworks and prior research that undergird the knowledge base, we can advance the field.</p>
<p>Research submitted to <italic>Journal of Teacher Education</italic> (JTE) is steadily improving. Although much of our own evidence as editors of JTE is anecdotal, coming from the hundreds of articles we encounter each year, evidence for improvement is emerging from other sources as well. Our acceptance rate has steadily increased while we have maintained the same high standards for publication. Although not the sole indicator of quality, the change in the impact of the journal may also signal a perceived increase in quality by readers of the journal. In a previous editorial (JTE 63:1), we cited our rank of 18 out of 177 education and education research journals and an impact factor of 1.891 as evidence of our standing in the field. Since that time, thanks to the efforts of previous editors and what we see as the improvement of research in teacher education leading to more citations, JTE has moved to number 10 of 203 journals and has increased the impact factor to 2.292 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022487112469941">Thompson Reuters, 2012</xref>). Nevertheless, we still have more to do.</p>
<p>As editors, we spend a great deal of time articulating what makes some manuscripts publishable and others not. Manuscripts are often subjected to editorial team review prior to being sent out for peer scrutiny and always before their final acceptance. As we discuss the characteristics of various manuscripts, the complexity of defining research quality in a field with such diverse methods and topics becomes apparent. Others have explored the topic for education research in general (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022487112469941">National Research Council, 2002</xref>). However, as we continue this discussion, we find we are slowly acquiring a set of criteria which can be applied to diverse studies specifically in teacher education. Although these criteria are still emerging, we would like to expand the discussion to the JTE readership by sharing our thoughts on some of the criteria we have formulated to date.</p>
<sec id="section1-0022487112469941">
<title>Criteria for Quality</title>
<p>In judging manuscripts, we consider a number of questions related to criteria for quality. Some questions are dictated by criteria for appropriateness for JTE, but others revolve around more generic issues of quality. As editors of a journal with such a diverse readership, we find that to make the range of studies and topics accessible to proponents of different philosophies, research paradigms, and interests, authors need to be very explicit in their rationale and report of the research and how they have incorporated the criteria for quality in their studies. The following questions may help guide authors in this process.</p>
<sec id="section2-0022487112469941">
<title>Appropriateness for JTE</title>
<p>The first question we ask of any manuscript that comes across our desk is whether the study actually focuses on teacher education, and if so, would it be of interest to readers of the journal. Is the manuscript appropriate for JTE?</p>
<p>Two types of manuscripts typically receive a negative response to this question. Studies that focus on teaching or teachers or students in elementary and secondary schools, without making an explicit connection to teacher education, constitute the first category. Merely mentioning the applicability of the findings for teacher education in the implications is not enough. The connection to teacher education should appear in the theoretical framework and the rationale for the study, as well as in the discussion and implications. Studies that use teacher education students or faculty as participants, but do not connect to the relevant theory and previous methodological and empirical work in teacher education, constitute the second category. Having a sample embedded in teacher education contexts is not sufficient. The questions asked in this context must address an important topic or issue related to research and scholarship in teacher education.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0022487112469941">
<title>Sampling</title>
<p>Once we have established the appropriateness of the study, other questions move to the forefront. Whether the study is generalizable or transferable often depends on the selection and description of the participants in the study. How was the sample for the study selected and was it appropriate for the questions asked? Was the rationale for and description of the sample adequate?</p>
<p>Many studies submitted to JTE appear to use convenience samples—a teacher or group of teachers known to the researcher, the researcher’s own classes or those of a friend, or teachers undergoing professional development provided by the researcher. This is not necessarily a problem. Many high-quality studies have been conducted in the settings in which researchers are also teachers or professional development providers (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022487112469941">Slavitt, Nelson, &amp; Duel, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022487112469941">Zuidema, 2012</xref>). However, the use of convenience samples in quantitative and qualitative studies is problematic unless the researchers (a) connect to a strong conceptual framework in posing the research questions, providing a rationale for the selection of participants (i.e., What is this a case of?), interpreting the findings, and discussing the implications of the study and (b) provide enough thick description of the context and phenomenon under investigation so that conceptual or theoretical generalization on the part of the reader is possible. Without those two conditions, studies utilizing convenience samples are either program evaluations or they introduce so many competing hypotheses related to interpretation of the findings that they add little to the knowledge base. Too many studies claim they use “purposive” sampling when they actually use what is available (convenient) and then post hoc try to make the case that they are purposive—with varying degrees of success. Convenience sampling that does not meet the two conditions above severely limits interpretation and generalizability or transferability of the findings.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0022487112469941">
<title>Depth and Breadth of Data</title>
<p>How much data are “enough?” For small qualitative samples, researchers’ decisions about depth and breadth of data are particularly challenging. Although determination of data sources depends on the question, many studies focus on only a few participants who are interviewed briefly—and then claims are made based on this thin data from a single source. There may be some mention of other types of data collected from these participants, but it is often not clear how it was collected, used, or integrated in the analysis. This is particularly problematic in studies where researchers have a stake in the success or failure of something under study—as in the convenience samples described in the previous section—which is often the case in teacher education studies (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022487112469941">Cochran-Smith &amp; Zeichner, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Although statistical methods place certain requirements on the sample sizes needed for quantitative studies, these requirements are often violated—and they do not specify whether different kinds of data are needed to address the questions. Quantitative studies based on the administration of a single survey often do not contribute much. Although these studies are very common in teacher education, they typically fall short of the multidimensionality needed to contribute to the knowledge base.</p>
<p>Problems with the depth and breadth of data needed to address particular questions can often be seen in manuscripts that present only a part of a larger study, which is published “piecemeal” in several outlets. For example, the quantitative findings may already have been published as one article, but the authors pull out the open-ended questions associated with the survey and present them as a “qualitative” study.</p>
<p>Although these “pieces” may have a large number of participants, they often lose breadth and depth and a sense of the context in which the study is situated.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0022487112469941">
<title>Case for Contribution of the Study</title>
<p>Perhaps the most important question we ask when considering whether to publish an article in JTE relates to whether the research advances the knowledge base in teacher education. What does the study contribute to our knowledge and understanding of particular phenomena in teacher education? Often, researchers leave it to the reader to determine how the study adds to the knowledge base.</p>
<p>This is one of the primary reasons reviewers cite when they reject a manuscript and probably the most common reason we send a manuscript back to authors for revision prior to a decision.</p>
<p>The case for contribution needs to appear early in the manuscript with an identification of the gap that the study addresses or an explanation of how this study will extend previous findings. Manuscripts may provide an appropriate theoretical framework and a well-developed literature review, but that is not enough. Authors need to explicitly state what gap the study proposes to address and then provide an “explicit, coherent chain of reasoning” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022487112469941">National Research Council, 2002</xref>, p. 66) that opens the loop between theory and evidence early and then closes the loop based on findings from the current study related to theory and previous research.</p>

<title>Highlights of the Current Issue</title>
<p>This issue features five articles that exemplify many of the criteria for quality outlined in the previous sections and exhibit the diversity of interests and methodologies of authors and readers of JTE. Two articles focus on teacher educators; two articles focus on preservice teachers; and one article focuses on inservice teacher education. Quantitative and qualitative methodologies are represented. Two articles feature international settings.</p>
<p>The first article, “Teaching About Teaching Science: Aims, Strategies, and Backgrounds of Science Teacher Educators” by Amanda Berry and Jan Van Driel is a small-scale, in-depth, descriptive study in an area that has not been extensively studied. Little is known about how teacher educators teach about specific subject-matter content. The study is notable as work that addresses an important area in teacher education and makes a strong case for its contribution to an emerging theory of pedagogy in science teacher education. Berry and Van Driel use interviews and storyline protocols to study what teacher educators in Australia and the Netherlands emphasize in their science methods courses and why and how their expertise has developed as a result of their backgrounds and experiences.</p>
<p>The next two articles provide examples of studies in which the professional development providers were also the researchers. “Changing the Way I Teach”: Building Teacher Knowledge, Confidence, and Autonomy,” by Rebecca Dierking and Roy Fox, investigates how participation in National Writing Project professional development affects middle school writing teachers. Although the researchers were affiliated with the professional development program under investigation, they address both conditions for use of convenience samples discussed previously by providing a strong conceptual framework for the study and adequately describing the context and phenomenon under investigation. Similarly, Hadar and Brody, in their article titled “The Interaction Between Group Processes and Personal Professional Trajectories in a Professional Development Community for Teacher Educators,” participated in professional development for teacher educators to infuse curriculum on teaching thinking in their courses. In this case, the researchers explored the interrelationship between group processes and individual progress of teachers within a professional development community using a variety of data sources, including interviews, reflective writing, field notes, and recordings of the professional development community meetings.</p>
<p>The final two articles explore areas of preservice teacher education. The article by Revathy Kumar and Lynne Hamer, “Preservice Teachers’ Attitudes and Beliefs Toward Student Diversity and Proposed Instructional Practices: A Sequential Design Study,” brings together two areas that have typically not been considered together—achievement goal theory, which is the domain of educational psychology courses, and multicultural perspectives, which are generally introduced in multicultural education courses—to investigate preservice teachers’ beliefs and biases about diversity. The authors study how the two frameworks relate to each other and to preservice teachers’ stereotypical beliefs and provide implications for coursework in educational psychology and multicultural education.</p>
<p>Aguirre, Turner, Bartell, Kalinec Craig, Foote, Roth McDuffie, and Drake contribute the final article, “Making Connections in Practice: Developing Prospective Teachers’ Capacities to Connect Children’s Mathematical Thinking and Community Funds of Knowledge in Mathematics Instruction.” The researchers investigate how preservice teachers connect to children’s mathematical thinking and community funds of knowledge in their lesson plans. The theoretical framework is clearly connected to the analysis and findings. The thick description provides readers with an understanding of three types of connections made by preservice teachers (meaningful, transitional, and emergent connections) and are illustrated with clear examples from the data and well-supported interpretations.</p>
<p>We hope that the discussion of some of the criteria for research quality that we have been considering and the articles included in this issue will assist you in contemplating and conducting future research. We encourage you to engage with us and your colleagues in extended discussion about the implications of these studies for your own research and practice. Readers are encouraged to participate in the conversations presented in the journal or to offer ideas on anything related to JTE (http://community.aacte.org). We look forward to receiving manuscripts from you in the future as well as your ideas directed toward improvement of JTE.</p>
