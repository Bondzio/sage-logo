<abstract>
<p>Public consultation has become a major part of planning in the last forty years and much has been written on the subject. This article reviews the writing generated over the past two decades and breaks it into sections respecting the theory and rationale behind consultation, the conceivable approaches to engage the public, and the means available to analyze and evaluate consultative efforts. Conclusions relevant to academics and practitioners are drawn as are suggestions from the authors concerning the principal gaps that needed to be filled in order for planners to have reliable tools to evaluate the effectiveness of consultative processes.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<sec id="section2-0885412211413133">
<title>Public Consultation Becomes Almost Universal in Planning Practice</title>
<p>Public participation has not always been part of urban planning and development. In the more distant past, Imperial Rome or Dynastic China, for example, land-use disposition was either a highly centralized government function or a series of decisions concentrated in the hands of powerful land owning elites. When medieval barons created castle gate market towns, they did not consult the people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0885412211413133">Lilley 1998</xref>). Neither did Hausmann in 1880s Paris nor Cerda in Barcelona in the 1890s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr155-0885412211413133">Ward 2001</xref>). As we know only too well, this centrally directed approach to planning continued well into the twentieth century, buttressed by the apparent successes of the great Keynesian public works projects in the 1930s and perhaps habituated by both civil and military planning that accompanied the two world wars in the last century.</p>
<p>All that changed with the well-documented revolt against the so-called urban renewal in the 1960s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0885412211413133">Filion, Shipley, and Te 2007</xref>). Sparked by the polemical writing of Jane Jacobs but also developed theoretically in the works of Davidoff, Forester, Freidmann and eventually Healey and Innes, planning practice was transformed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0885412211413133">Brooks 2002</xref>). Genuine and concerted efforts were made to include more of what is called civic engagement, public participation, or consultation (we will use all three terms interchangeably). Derived from the most basic precepts of democracy but perhaps, in North America, drawing more directly from the tradition of the New England town hall meeting and in Europe from Swiss direct democracy, public consultation entered the main stream of planning practice by the 1980s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0885412211413133">Bryan 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr112-0885412211413133">Patten 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr119-0885412211413133">Roberts 2004</xref>). Legislation mandating public consultation is now part of the planning regime in most developed countries and is a requirement for World Bank and other aid in developing countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0885412211413133">Baker, Coaffee, and Sherriff 2007</xref>). At the same time, the importance of citizen involvement is also acknowledged in the codes of ethical practice of professional planning associations such as the American Institute of Certified Planners, the Canadian Institute of Planners, and in the practice directives of the Royal Town Planning Institute (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0885412211413133">AICP 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0885412211413133">CIP 2004</xref>, RTPI 2011).</p>
<p>However, the underlying question remains as to whether we are doing it right. Good intentions alone are not enough. In the generation since it became part of the mainstream, there have been as many critics as there have been champions of consultation, inspiring a relentless pursuit of improvement within the profession. At times, this has involved a critical self-reflection, resulting occasionally in such strongly worded opinions as that of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0885412211413133">Innes and Booher (2004</xref>, 1), who wrote:<disp-quote>
<p>The traditional methods of public participation in government decision-making simply do not work. They do not achieve genuine participation in planning or decisions; they do not provide significant information to public officials that makes a difference to their actions; they do not satisfy members of the public that they are being heard; they do not improve the decisions that agencies and public officials make; and they don’t represent a broad spectrum of the public (p. 1).</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>When Innes and Booher said “traditional methods” they meant approaches that had been developed in the forty years since the 1960s, and while their assessment is perhaps the most critical and unrestrained, there is a general echoing of agreement among researchers with the sentiment of their remarks. King, Feltey, and Susel (1998, 323) boldly assert that “(p)ublic hearings do not work,” while <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0885412211413133">Adams (2004)</xref> felt that public meetings do have a role but that they do not give citizens a sense that they are affecting decisions. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr154-0885412211413133">Walters, Aydelotte, and Miller (2000)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0885412211413133">Halvorsen (2003)</xref> argued that current participation mechanisms are fundamentally flawed because of a general lack of trust between officials and citizens, an assertion that is further explored by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr159-0885412211413133">Yang (2005)</xref> who also finds that public administrators do not necessarily trust citizens. Some authors, such as Creighton as far back as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0885412211413133">1981</xref> argued that officials actually oppose citizen participation because they find it to be more time-consuming, expensive, complicated, and emotionally draining than it is worth. Correspondingly, citizens can become cynical toward government agencies because they fail to perceive an ongoing helpful attitude from city hall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0885412211413133">Berman 1997</xref>). The discord between these two entities is perhaps highlighted best by the different goals and objectives that each holds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr132-0885412211413133">Shipley, Feick, Hall, and Earley 2004</xref>). Municipal planners tend to expect broad vision statements and general directions to arise from consultation while citizens expect more specific action-orientated results. Burby’s (2003) study of participation programs in sixty US communities went somewhat against the trend, but such positive findings are few and far between.</p>
<p>Indeed, agreement between the planner and the public is tenuous at best as to what truly constitutes fairness in consultation practice. Suffice to say that in the time since consultation was demanded and subsequently institutionalized in the profession, the waters have been muddied as to the value, the processes, and the products stemming from civic engagement activities. Yet, it is into these murky waters that this research wades, attempting to shed some light on the competing viewpoints of these critics and champions and to highlight the areas where new research is required to resolve the myriad questions around this complex topic.</p>
</sec>

<sec id="section3-0885412211413133">
<title>Method and Approach</title>
<p>This review of the literature on civic engagement in planning will not pretend to answer all the questions there are nor to explain or analyze every aspect of the theory and practice of consultation. What we have set out to do is to provide an overall framework which will allow researchers and practitioners alike to place the various writings on the subject in relative context. That process in turn will allow an appraisal of where future research efforts may prove most valuable but also to serve as a caution to those conducting public participation in terms of the claims that are made about the effectiveness of any particular method in achieving its stated goals.</p>
<p>As with any attempt to study such a vast field of knowledge and active spectrum of professional activity there are challenges. One hundred and fifty-four articles and books are included this study, but this is by no means offered as an exhaustive list of what has been written. Consulting a database assembled by the International Association of Public Participation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0885412211413133">IAP2</xref>), we find 211 entries.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0885412211413133">1</xref></sup> Between the two lists, there were fewer than a dozen duplicate titles, highlighting the breadth of information available. However, there are perhaps three other reasons for the differences. Our search for literature pertaining to public participation used academic electronic library search techniques augmented by the inclusion of works found in the reference lists of our initial finds. In other words, our references are primarily from peer-reviewed scholarly works. Second, the focus has been primarily, though not exclusively, on more recent works from the last ten to fifteen years. This is justified by the fact that they usually built on previous scholarship to which they make reference. Finally, while literature from other disciplines including public administration, politics, landscape architecture, and psychology has been consulted, planning practice has remained the touchstone and the field for which insight and understanding are being sought. The works reviewed have also been primarily about participation in policy discussions as distinct from urban design exercises, such as charrettes.</p>
<p>That said there has also been an effort made to include works from different parts of the world although all the works are written in English and the bulk originate from English-speaking countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0885412211413133">Guaraldo Choguill 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0885412211413133">Enserink and Koppenjan 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr160-0885412211413133">Zhong and Mol 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0885412211413133">Hatzilacou, Kallis, and Mexa 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0885412211413133">Kallis et al. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0885412211413133">Kallis et al. 2009</xref>). It should be pointed out, however, that the discussion of these issues is also being conducted in other languages. In France, for example, Rui reports that “the institutionalization of public debate has prevailed since the 1980s, in the fields of construction and urban planning. By public debate, we mean ‘the generic description of all forms, authority or procedure of putting community choices up for public discussion’” (2004). Fourniau says that “one could as well use the term ‘participation’ which is roughly equivalent although for some it suggests the political principle more than its practical details” (2003).</p>
<p>Notwithstanding these limitations, we feel our survey is certainly a broad and representative sampling of the literature which has influenced planning. We are also confident that the outline and analytical framework provided will accommodate any other works in the field that might be added. We outline three general areas into which all of the research articles and books fall. These areas are classified as follows:<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>Theory and Rationale for Public Participation.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Approaches to Conducting Consultation and Facilitating Participation.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Analysis and Evaluation of Participation.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
Each of these three general categories in turn has a number of subcategories to which various works have been assigned. In due course, an overall picture of the scholarship in the field of public participation study emerges.</p>

<title>Theory and Rationale</title>
<sec id="section5-0885412211413133">
<title>Participatory Democracy</title>
<p>At its most basic, the concept of public participation is a foundational tenant of the modern idea of democracy. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr112-0885412211413133">Patten (2001)</xref> says:<disp-quote>
<p>A central priority of institutional reform in twenty-first century should be the democratization of state policy-making. In addressing this challenge, I begin from the premise that democratic legitimacy really depends, above all else, on the character and quality of public decision-making. Working through the crux of the democratic challenge requires that we focus on the opening up and democratizing policy formation within the executive branch of government. Moreover we must recognize that this can best be accomplished via a renewed (and transformed) commitment to democratic public consultation and, very importantly, the democratization of those aspects of public administration that facilitate societal input into policy-making. (p. 222)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>In her in-depth discussion of the background of public consultation, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr119-0885412211413133">Roberts (2004)</xref> says that “Citizenship participation is the cornerstone of democracy” (p. 315) although the ambivalence toward direct involvement in government may be more of a factor in the United States than elsewhere. Roberts work is perhaps closest to a comprehensive statement of the theory that underlies public participation. In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0885412211413133">2006</xref>, Hester added to the discussion by linking the basic theory of democracy to the notion of ecology and the need to integrate all aspects of the natural as well as built environment in decision making.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0885412211413133">
<title>Definition of Citizen Participation</title>
<p>The participation process itself has long been thought of, if not defined as, a series of meetings held at agreed times in which the nature of a problem, the development of solutions, and the plan for implementation can be debated and assented to by stakeholders (Bureau of Municipal Investigation 1974). Some of the earliest formalizing of civic engagement standards in Western democracies began in Canada and the United Kingdom and attempts have been made ever since to define what makes effective participation. Achieving a common definition is crucial, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr149-0885412211413133">Tuler and Webler (1999)</xref> argue, because the advantages of civic engagement cannot be realized in the absence of specific standards. They offer the list found in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0885412211413133">Figure 1</xref> as the crucial common elements for effective consultation. We believe that most of the authors of works cited here would be reasonably happy with that list.</p>

<title>Motivation to Participate</title>
<p>Understanding the normative theories pertaining to the process of public consultation in planning is not a straightforward affair. Any serious discussion of process must begin by looking at both the participants’ motivations for taking part in planning decisions as well as the motivation of civic officials in engaging the public. Such a discussion will undoubtedly recognize that the motivations and understanding of what the consultation process involves is not necessarily the same for these two parties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0885412211413133">Arnstein 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr148-0885412211413133">Tritter and McCallum 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0885412211413133">Clary and Snyder (2002)</xref>, a majority of citizens have favorable opinions toward attending civic engagement opportunities but do not always follow their intentions with like behavior. Further complicating matters, those that do show up often represent multiple interests, rather than a single public interest, even when living in the same geographic area (Lee <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr152-0885412211413133">Uyesugi and Shipley, 2005</xref>). The choice to attend meetings is also often made under burden from the significant time constraints that are inherent to modern society (King, Feltey, and Susel, 1998). Furthermore, there can be a surprising difference in consultation attendance rates in different countries as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr136-0885412211413133">Silverman (2006)</xref> describes in a study comparing adjacent communities in Canada and United States. He found “that Canadian municipalities adopt a broader range of public participation techniques related to: voluntarism and public engagement, neighborhood and strategic planning, and e-government. In contrast, US municipalities are more likely to promote public participation through mechanisms such as annual community meetings and referendums on public issues” (p. 139). Attendance patterns for other voluntary activities such as religious observance confirm that the choice to participate is made at the margin. It is a decision people make after they have taken care of the essentials in their lives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0885412211413133">Iannaccone and Everton 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>The question of motivation is further complicated by the fact that organizers may have very different ideas than participants. While civic leaders and their planners often view the participation process as primarily intended to inform the public of what was going to happen or at best ask them to choose among a predetermined set of options, the public often assumes that they will have a more definitive say in the outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr132-0885412211413133">Shipley et al. 2004</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0885412211413133">
<title>Participation into Policy</title>
<p>Each stage in the policy development process brings about different levels of expectation and involvement which needs to be communicated. While citizens hold dear the fact that decision makers serve and represent the people, they will infer their own purposes if these are not chosen and adequately expressed. Important policy change most frequently occurs during periods when the attention of the public has been drawn to an issue by a critical event and their input been more actively solicited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0885412211413133">Burby 2003</xref>). In essence, the current political model holds decisive action in such high regard as to potentially inflate the value of citizen participation as an influence on policy. Some researchers such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0885412211413133">Brownill and Carpenter (2007)</xref> have explored the challenges and barriers to putting stated policy into practice and the need for innovative approaches to accomplish those goals of civic engagement. In the end, however, most of the writers cited seem to agree with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0885412211413133">King et al. (1998)</xref> that true public participation puts citizens in the middle and not at the periphery, as indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0885412211413133">Figure 2</xref>.</p>

<sec id="section9-0885412211413133">
<title>Fairness</title>
<p>Fairness is a relatively vague concept for which evidence about what citizens perceive to be fair is not always immediately apparent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0885412211413133">Lauber and Knuth 1999</xref>). While fairness has consistently been found to influence how citizens evaluate consultation procedures, it means different things to different people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr138-0885412211413133">Smith and McDonough 2001</xref>). “Fairness judgments are made either about the appropriateness of allocation decisions or those of decision processes” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0885412211413133">Lauber and Knuth 1999</xref>, 20). Those made about the fairness of decisions are described as <italic>distributive fairness</italic>, while <italic>procedural fairness</italic> is the term used to describe the fairness of the methods used to make those decisions. Citizens relate fairness for consultation to both meanings of the term. While Thibaut and Walker (1978 as cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0885412211413133">Lauber and Knuth 1999</xref>) suggest that perceptions of fairness were related to the degree of influence that a participant had on the arrived outcome, Lind and Tyler (1988 as cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0885412211413133">Lauber and Knuth, 1999</xref>) found procedural fairness to be of importance to people as a means for signaling their acceptance within society.</p>
<p>Fair procedures have an additional benefit in that they can ameliorate the negative reactions that would normally result from an unfair outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0885412211413133">Lauber and Knuth 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr138-0885412211413133">Smith and McDonough 2001</xref>). Though citizens hold correspondingly broad definitions for what is fair and successful, perceptions of fairness uniformly impact their trust for authorities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr138-0885412211413133">Smith and McDonough 2001</xref>) and their outlook for success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-0885412211413133">McCool and Guthrie 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>In the end, the data suggest that the public holds a unique viewpoint with respect to what they perceive is fair. If citizens “perceive decision-making procedures to be fair, then they are more likely to perceive decisions as fair” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0885412211413133">Lauber and Knuth 1999</xref>, 20). However, the public just as often reaches the conclusion that “the process must have been fair because it produced a decision that they believed to be fair” (p. 34). In other words, as critical players in consultation activities, the public seems to hold the value of the process and the outcome in equal esteem. This, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0885412211413133">Lauber and Knuth (1999</xref>, 35) ultimately suggest, leaves room for “[a] more concrete conception of fairness that can contribute to the way that decisions are designed and communicated such that citizens will perceive them more fairly.” The onus should therefore be on the planner/administrator to provide a mechanism to assess the fairness of both the consultation processes and the outcomes.</p>

<sec id="section10-0885412211413133">
<title>Advocacy</title>
<p>In 1965, Davidoff coined the term “advocacy planning” and described it as similar to the legal concept, whereby at least two contending viewpoints can be argued. The planner takes on a disposition akin to that of a lawyer and in Davidoff’s version supports the cause for the marginalized or underrepresented group. Often the concept of advocacy planning is referred to as “pluralistic planning” and includes an agenda for policy making. While not many researchers working specifically in the realm of public participation refer directly to the tenets of classic advocacy planning, one often finds Davidoff in the reference list and his influence is strong.</p>

<title>Summary of Theory and Rationale</title>
<p>All told, the theories of participation and the factors that directly influence participation in the consultation processes are numerous and complex. Elected civic officials and municipal staffs both, have a different range of motivations for organizing consultation.

<list-item>
<p>understanding people’s needs, preferences, and values by talking with them is a way to enhance the effectiveness of decision making and service provision;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>involving people in the decisions that affect them can increase the legitimacy of those decisions among participants and more widely;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>some public services may need active participation to be effective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0885412211413133">Baker, Coaffee, and Sherriff 2007</xref>, 80).</p>
</list-item>
</list>It is felt that a failure to include the public or validate their opinions can render them “vexatious and cynical” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0885412211413133">Berman 1997</xref>, 110) “while depriving decision makers of input and compromising legitimacy” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr154-0885412211413133">Walters, Aydelotte, and Miller 2000</xref>, 357). As noble and commendable as such statements are, the devil as always is in the details. Questions have arisen from the start about how much understanding of people’s needs and values is enough, about how much people can really be involved in decisions that are often highly technical, and about how much participation is needed to be effective? Having reviewed the literature that addresses the theoretical aspects of public participation, we will now turn to discussion of what techniques have been developed and evolved since public consultation first appeared before turning to the means researchers have used to evaluate what is actually being done.</p>

<title>Approaches to Conducting Consultation and Facilitating Participation</title>

<title>Participation of Special Groups</title>
<p>Many organizations attempt public consultation as part of their efforts to resolve conflicts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr138-0885412211413133">Smith and McDonough 2001</xref>) but fail to take stock of the relative power of each of the groups in the community to make sure that no one party in the process is being exploited or ignored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr115a-0885412211413133">Piliavin et al. 2002</xref> as cited in Stukas and Dunlap 2002; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0885412211413133">Gregory, McDaniels, and Fields 2001</xref>). Conflict resolution under the collaborative model, for example, relies on equal stature and representation of those stakeholders who are involved in defining and implementing the solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0885412211413133">Gray 1989</xref>). However, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr123-0885412211413133">Sager (1994)</xref>, planners gain authority through their mastery of the subject and their appearance of neutrality over the potential political conflicts. This can place them as the strong actors with a weaker public in an open information exchange system. In such a case, information from the public can be more easily synthesized by the planner to extend his or her influence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr123-0885412211413133">Sager 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>It is especially troubling to think that citizen engagement, which is often motivated by the goal of community betterment, may in fact represent a subtle method to exert further dominance over the lay position of the public (Stukas and Dunlap 2002). Worse, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr138-0885412211413133">Smith and McDonough (2001)</xref> and also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr159-0885412211413133">Yang (2005)</xref>, conclude it is entirely possible for all rules and regulations of public consultation to be followed in a mechanical fashion and still leave citizens feeling as though they were treated unfairly.</p>
<p>This is especially true when there are particular groups of citizens who need to express their interests and yet are disenfranchised, marginalized, or disadvantaged in some way. Various methods of citizen participation are designed for specific subgroups of the population such as youth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr137-0885412211413133">Sirianni 2009</xref>; Santo1, Ferguson, and Trippel 2010), seniors, or minorities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr152-0885412211413133">Uyesugi and Shipley 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0885412211413133">Frank 2006</xref>) or for particular issues such as an approach to consulting on waste management sites or tenant’s rights (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0885412211413133">Anderson 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0885412211413133">Goodlad 1988</xref>). There are also people working in places where citizen involvement is so actively suppressed that it calls for special approaches for even marginal engagement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0885412211413133">Connelly 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0885412211413133">Bonafede and Piccolo 2010</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section14-0885412211413133">
<title>Participant Profiling</title>
<p>The objective of profiling which types of citizens will attend a civic engagement process represents an inexact science at best. It is neither reasonable to assume that people who do not come to meetings do not care about the decision nor is it enough to suggest that those who come must have a vested interest in the outcome (McMillan and Murgatroyd 1994). Participation may be related to socioeconomic factors as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr136-0885412211413133">Silverman (2006)</xref> found with the residents of central cities in the areas of Canada and the United States he studied. It is also conceivable that some citizens will participate who do not have a level of education for the issue at stake commensurate with their passion for a particular outcome. In these cases, the education gap must be made up by the administrators as part of the process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0885412211413133">Chipeniuk 1999</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0885412211413133">
<title>Multiple Consultation Techniques</title>
<p>There is a common observation in consultation literature that the manner of public involvement affects the degree of public satisfaction apart from the outcome of the decision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0885412211413133">Burroughs, 1999</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr154-0885412211413133">Walters, Aydelotte, and Miller (2000)</xref> state that “to be fully effective, decision-makers must appropriately tie the selected strategy to both the purpose for participation and the nature of the issue considered” (p. 351).</p>
<p>Accordingly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr145-0885412211413133">Thomas (1995)</xref> recommends more participation when the acceptance of a decision is important and less public participation when the quality of a decision is the determining factor. Though no mention is made of the effort required, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0885412211413133">Berman (1997</xref>, 108) finds that “using a range of strategies is significantly associated with lower rates of cynicism.”</p>
<p>The notion that there are many different ways in which one can design a public participation program is also inherent in Arnstien’s analysis and is the very basis for the IAP2’s Participation Spectrum, both of which will be discussed in the following section on Analysis and Evaluation of civic engagement. In fact, it was largely in response to Arnstein’s insights that many practitioners developed varying methods for community involvement in planning, as witnessed by the fact that it is rare to find articles written after Arnstein that do not make reference to her. In some cases, these approaches were touted as one size fits all techniques that were supposed to revolutionize planning practice. Of visioning, one of the techniques offered, a writer said that it was “a new—and proven—tool for broadening citizen participation and thus winning new constituents for planning” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0885412211413133">Klein, Benson, Andersen, and Herr 1993</xref>, 10). Other approaches were not intended for use in every situation but were specifically tailored for the needs of one or other of the levels on Arnstein’s “ladder.” For example, the citizen jury approach is a way of managing situations where genuine decision-making power is delegated to citizens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0885412211413133">Kenyon 2005</xref>). Yet other methods are designed for specific subgroups of the population such as youth and children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0885412211413133">Knowles-Yánez 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0885412211413133">Frank 2006</xref>) or particular issues such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5a-0885412211413133">Anderson’s (1986)</xref> approach to consulting on waste management sites (see above).</p>

<title>Public Meetings</title>
<p>The simplest and perhaps oldest form of public consultation is the public meeting. In some regulations, such as Ontario’s <italic>Planning Act</italic>, a single meeting is all that is required before the adoption of an Official Plan, although a much more involved procedure is typically followed (<italic>Ontario Planning Act</italic>, 2004). Not surprisingly, the European Union (EU) is at the other end of the scale with quite explicit directives concerning public consultation. An EU implementation document pertaining to Planning Policy Guidance 12 in the United Kingdom sets out the following principles:
<list list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>Consult widely throughout the process, allowing a minimum of twelve weeks for written consultation at least once during the development of the policy.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Be clear about what your proposals are, who may be affected, what questions are being asked, and the timescale for responses.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Ensure that your consultation is clear, concise, and widely accessible.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Give feedback regarding the responses received and how the consultation process influenced the policy.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Monitor your department’s effectiveness at consultation, including through the use of a designated consultation coordinator.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Ensure your consultation follows better regulation best practice, including carrying out a regulatory impact assessment if appropriate. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26a-0885412211413133">Cabinet Office, 2005</xref>)</p>
</list-item>
</list>In between these extremes, the legal requirements of other jurisdictions and the actual practices regarding consulting through public meetings present a range of options. Although widely criticized as ineffective and ritualistic, some commentators feel there is a place for the humble public meeting. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0885412211413133">Adams (2004)</xref> contends that while public meetings may not be very good at actually allowing citizens to influence decisions, they are a good way to convey information, to help set agendas, and to give citizens a way of achieving their political objectives such as having their issues reported in the press.</p>

<title>Citizen Juries</title>
<p>Concern over the failures of consultation methods, and the subsequent international responses by researchers, practitioners, and scholars to address those failures, is exemplified in the so-called citizen jury approach. Already in the 1970s, people working independently in the United States and in Germany developed a similar system. They were responding to observations that
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>lack of representativeness of the participants is a real shortcoming of those programs which appear to be more successful,</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>the most successful citizen inputs are found in programs which seem to require the least expertise, overall, the impact of citizens groups has been limited, and most participatory programs are geared to intervention at the local administrative or delivery level, leaving the vast reaches of agenda setting and policy prescription relatively untouched (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0885412211413133">Crosby, Kelly, and Schaefer 1986</xref>, 6).</p>
</list-item>
</list>The idea is based on the jury system in law. Decision making, or at least a strong voice in recommending decisions, is placed in the hands of representative group drawn from the community and randomly selected. An emphasis is placed on a fair and transparent selection process which attempts to remove lobbying and the expression of special interests. Jurors are paid to participate. The chair of a jury, or panel as they are sometimes called, is chosen by the members. Witnesses including public sector planners, industry representatives, citizens groups, and other experts appear before the jury and give evidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0885412211413133">Crosby, Kelly, and Schaefer, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr118-0885412211413133">Renn, Webler, and Wiedemann 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr128-0885412211413133">Sexton 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>By the 1990s, the use of this system had spread to the United Kingdom and other countries as far apart as Brazil and Australia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0885412211413133">Kenyon 2005</xref>). There remains an emphasis on soliciting jurors’ involvement through recruitment rather than selecting from among volunteers. Research into the effectiveness of citizen juries showed some notable successes, some limitations, and in the end, some who looked closely at the approach recommended caution in its use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0885412211413133">Kenyon 2005</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section18-0885412211413133">
<title>Focus Groups</title>
<p>Focus groups are a consultation method designed to illuminate citizen perceptions that may have eluded other survey techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr153-0885412211413133">Vogt, King, and King 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr156-0885412211413133">Waterton and Wynne 1999</xref>). At their most effective, focus groups generate qualitative data that complements the current knowledge base on most subjects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr153-0885412211413133">Vogt, King, and King 2004</xref>). Typically, a focus group engages four to twelve participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0885412211413133">Greenbaum 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-0885412211413133">Morgan 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr135-0885412211413133">Simon 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr140-0885412211413133">Stewart and Shamdasani 1990</xref>) in a discussion of relevant planning topics at a neutral location. The participants are sometimes recruited on the basis of social and geographic homogeneity to avoid the creation of an informal hierarchy within the group that would exclude participation from certain members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-0885412211413133">Morgan 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr135-0885412211413133">Simon 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr140-0885412211413133">Stewart and Shamdasani 1990</xref>). Topics and questions in a focus group are generally sequenced from the general to the more specific and with a certain degree of flexibility provided to the facilitator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0885412211413133">Greenbaum 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr135-0885412211413133">Simon 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr140-0885412211413133">Stewart and Shamdasani 1990</xref>). Sessions normally run over a two-hour period and the format is designed to encourage the flow and debate of ideas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr135-0885412211413133">Simon 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>Researchers provide contrasting evaluations of focus groups as a consultative device. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0885412211413133">Innes and Booher (2004)</xref> are encouraged by the manner in which these sessions engage partakers directly in conversation with each other and with decision makers. While <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr153-0885412211413133">Vogt, King, and King (2004)</xref> concede that focus groups may not always be appropriate for personal topics; they do suggest that the group pressures inherent to this format generally inhibit members from providing misleading information. By contrast, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0885412211413133">Hollander (2004)</xref> suggests that the pressures of conformity, groupthink, and social desirability can combine to alter the viewpoints and statements of many participants.</p>

<sec id="section19-0885412211413133">
<title>Scenario Workshops</title>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr141-0885412211413133">Street (1997)</xref>, “scenario workshops are basically meetings that involve discussions among a range of local actors, with the aim of developing visions and proposals for technological needs and possibilities in the future” (p. 145). Scenario workshops do seem to have some features that differ from visioning, which will be discussed below, even though the word “vision” appears in this definition. For one thing, a set of scenarios is developed and although social and organizational matters are admitted, the emphasis seems to be on addressing technical problems. The technique seems to be popular in Europe but has little or no currency in North America.</p>
<p>Another distinctive aspect concerns the selection of participants, which in the scenario workshop model involves a screening process by which appropriate government and nongovernment agencies suggest and then cross verify a group of stakeholders (Hartzilacou et al. 2007). Practical considerations pertaining to time and funding tend to limit the exercises to a few groups of eight to ten participants who deliberate on the current conditions and the potential solutions. The implications of this concept at a practical level are substantial. Methods that combine public participation with decision-making capacities are increasingly in demand, especially as related to regional and other planning scenarios that involve multiple and conflicting users (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0885412211413133">Kallis et al. 2006</xref>). This may explain the use of scenario workshops to deal with such issues as water resource management.</p>

<title>Visioning</title>
<p>While there was virtually no mention of visioning prior to 1990, several manuals explaining how to conduct vision exercises appeared after that time (Oregon 1993; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr108-0885412211413133">Okubo 1997</xref>). Over the last twenty years, community visions became a common method to engage citizens in the creation of collective plans and policies for the future of a particular geographic area. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr131-0885412211413133">Shipley and Newkirk (1999)</xref> found numerous definitions for the term. The most commonly accepted characteristic of visioning is that it employs directed imagery to create pictures of the desired future and then develops a set of values for use as decision criteria in subsequent planning decisions intended to bring about those desired outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr130-0885412211413133">Shipley 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Visioning often attempts to involve the entire population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr152-0885412211413133">Uyesugi and Shipley 2005</xref>; Oregon 1993; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr108-0885412211413133">Okubo 1997</xref>), but it is not necessarily limited to the community level and has been used in a national and international context in Europe since the late 1990s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr105-0885412211413133">Nadin 2002</xref>). Parallels can be found between visioning and collaborative planning and consensus-building formats in the fact that “the vision usually becomes a treaty negotiated among rival coalitions” (Bryson 1995, 155 as cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0885412211413133">Helling 1998</xref>). Planners and politicians throughout the 1990s perceived visioning as an opportunity to create a stronger civic will and viewed it as a break from a tradition of decision making by the elite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0885412211413133">Helling 1998</xref>), even though its novelty may in fact be questionable and its theoretical basis dubious (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr130-0885412211413133">Shipley 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>In the end, there is some evidence that this technique involves a greater cross section and quantity of participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr130-0885412211413133">Shipley 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr152-0885412211413133">Uyesugi and Shipley 2005</xref>).</p>

<title>Collaboration</title>
<p>“Collaboration is a process through which parties who see different aspects of a problem can constructively explore their differences and search for solutions that go beyond their own limited vision of what is possible” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0885412211413133">Gray 1989</xref>, 5). Collaboration is designed to resolve multiparty conflicts by transforming adversarial behavior into a mutual search for information and solutions. Increasing awareness of these interdependent positions paradoxically renews the willingness to search for mutual benefits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0885412211413133">Gray 1989</xref>) and sharing information positively affects the motivation to participate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0885412211413133">Austin 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0885412211413133">Burroughs 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0885412211413133">Healey 1998</xref>). This trait is crucial, argues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0885412211413133">Burroughs (1999</xref>, 801), because “each stakeholder enters the fray with different assumptions held with varying degrees of importance and uncertainty.”</p>
<p>There is an implicit assumption in collaboration that only those parties, or representatives of those parties, who have a vested interest in the problem will attend and thereby be termed as stakeholders. This runs contrary to the conclusion reached by McMillan and Murgatroyd (1994), and yet collaboration is rooted in the same town hall meeting concept that is the cornerstone of participatory democracy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0885412211413133">Gray 1989</xref>).</p>
<p>Some research has pointed to the successes of particular collaboration exercises including <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0885412211413133">Gunton, Peter, and Day (2007)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0885412211413133">Elbanna (2008)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-0885412211413133">Mitchell (2005)</xref>. However, as successful as collaboration may prove, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-0885412211413133">London (1995)</xref> warns that there are a number of limitations to its potential, including the fact that:

As with focus groups, it is a means of group deliberation that brings people together for interactive discussion.

In the early 1990s, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr110-0885412211413133">Padgett (1993)</xref> began to explore using the outputs of geographic information system as an inexpensive way of soliciting “a balanced, objective input from citizen laypersons, municipal officials and technical experts,” in the fast growing cities of the American South (p. 513). Interest in the use of the Internet and computers increased through the 1990s, with growing sophistication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-0885412211413133">Macpherson 1999</xref>). Two distinct paths evolved. One used computer technology for simulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0885412211413133">Ben-Joseph et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0885412211413133">Hollander and Thomas 2009</xref>) or visualization of spaces being planned (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0885412211413133">Al-Kodmany 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr106-0885412211413133">Noveck 2006</xref>; Gordon 2008). The latter author explained the immersive, interactive technology, where participants could visualize and change elements, in this way:<disp-quote>
<p>Civic engagement, as we understand it, is more than just voting in elections and offering input on whether or not a new park should be located in a community. Instead of being asked a yes-or-no question about the location of a park, communities should be able to discuss the benefits of open space and the variable functions of fields, playgrounds, art spaces, and so on. Public deliberation should happen at all levels of decision making, from conception to approval. (Gordon 2008, 217–8)</p>
</disp-quote>The other trend employed the communication potential of computers to involve more people in decision making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr114-0885412211413133">Pereira et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0885412211413133">Conroy and Gordon 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr133-0885412211413133">Shipley and Feick 2009</xref>). In some of these approaches, residents of an area can go on line at their own convenience and answer questions, draw on maps, and in various ways express their preferences regarding planning issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0885412211413133">Conroy and Evans-Cowley 2005</xref>). Some of this type of interaction uses what is now known as the Wiki approach which aims to completely democratize planning by allowing everyone and anyone to contribute (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr107-0885412211413133">Noveck 2008</xref>). The newest kids-on-the-block are Facebook, blogs, and twitter, all of which have the potential to completely turn civic engagement on its head (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0885412211413133">Evans-Cowley and Hollander 2010</xref>). These so-called social media techniques put a potentially enormous amount of power in the hands of ordinary people and allow them to mobilize themselves into an effective lobby. This could be a game changer, and further research could and should be conducted to determine whether these methods can gain ground in reducing public cynicism and distrust through their ease of use and multipronged approach, as per the general conclusions reached by Berman in 1997.</p>

<title>Summary of Approaches to Conducting Consultation and Facilitating Participation</title>
<p>The emphasis of academics on scenario workshops, consensus building, focus groups, visioning, citizen juries, and collaboration as consultation methods of choice is interesting, not only for its inherent postulation that changes to process can improve overall effectiveness but also for the common characteristics they present. Each of these methods anticipates that participants will come from different positions and with different expectations and work together toward a common solution or goal. Each represents a much more interactive exercise than the traditional model presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0885412211413133">Figure 2</xref> and espouses objectives further along the continuum shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0885412211413133">Figure 3</xref> than many of the other available methods.</p>

<p>While there is ample recognition in the academic literature that there are multiple potential methods for conducting public participation, two facts remain. The first is that a good deal of the theoretical writing does not make a distinction among methods, inferring in some ways that consultation is a single entity rather than a broad range of techniques. The second point is that much of what is written about consultation methods is descriptive, even promotional and not analytical or evaluative.</p>

<title>Origins of the Practice</title>
<p>The chronology of ideas marking the evolving definition of standards for effective consultation is interesting to follow. In response to a sense that neighborhoods were entering into the political arena with noisy consequences, a conference on public participation was organized in Toronto in the early 1970s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0885412211413133">Frisken and Homenuck 1972</xref>). The meeting was open to planners, politicians, and the public and, if not the first of its kind, it was certainly one of the earliest. There <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0885412211413133">Frisken and Homenuck (1972</xref>, 1) presented the notion that “much of the current citizen participation thrust revolves around community planning—the process by which the residents develop a sense of community and a measure of control over their local environment.” Several conference speakers noted concern over the impact that direct civic input would have on the expression of majority will. In spite of the great reform victory in Toronto’s municipal elections of 1972 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr127-0885412211413133">Sewell 1993</xref>), the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0885412211413133">Bureau of Municipal Research (1974)</xref> took the same position that citizen participation was “a component of the democratic system which permits non-elected members of the community to exercise some control over decision-making which goes beyond elections” (p. 10).</p>
<p>However, it was not until after the formalization of consultation in planning legislation in 1983 in Ontario, the province where Toronto is located, that a discernable change can be seen in the approach to define consultation. Planners “took to the streets,” engaging the public through a number of techniques, slowly shifting their reliance on standard public meetings and open houses to more interactive methods such as focus groups and workshops during the period from 1991 to 2006 (Utz 2007). Yet, it was not until a 1997 Supreme Court of Canada decision in British Columbia, another Canadian province, that it was established in law that any applicable definition of consultation must indicate a minimum threshold for engagement that is universally consistent, flexible, and workable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-0885412211413133">Lindsay and Smith 2001</xref>). What is different about that decision was the effect of law on provincial policy. In essence, it gave consultation teeth by making it a factor for the courts to determine whether the government has accorded sufficient priority to the interests at hand. At a minimum, it requires governments to conduct consultation in good faith and to substantially address relevant concerns (Sharvit et al. 1999 as cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-0885412211413133">Lindsay and Smith 2001</xref>). The transition from informal to legislated public consultation was experienced in other jurisdiction as well and there is a growing discussion of what participation means in law (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0885412211413133">Ellis 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>This was the experience in Canada but similar progressions of events, conferences, court decisions, and legislation unfolded in other countries, and these are described by researchers in those places: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0885412211413133">Booth (1996)</xref> in the United Kingdom and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr119-0885412211413133">Roberts (2004)</xref> in the United States.</p>

<sec id="section27-0885412211413133">
<title>Power Distribution</title>
<p>Arnstein’s (1969) seminal contribution to the study of participation recognized the potential mismatch that was almost bound to occur between the needs of the professional planners in initiating consultation processes and the aspirations of those members of the public who participate. Implicit in the range of possibilities from merely informing the public to legitimate partnership or even control of decision making are the escalating degrees of power sharing found in ladder of citizen participation found in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0885412211413133">Figure 4</xref>. It is Arnstein’s ladder that inspired the IAP2’s Public Participation spectrum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0885412211413133">Figure 3</xref>), and a version adapted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0885412211413133">Guaraldo Choguill (1996)</xref> to better describe the situation in developing countries as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0885412211413133">Figure 5</xref>.</p>

</fig>
<p>Arnstein’s model not only recognized the progression from token or manipulated participation to partnership or even delegation of power but advocated the redistribution of decision making to underprivileged citizens. It is this latter element that appears central to the public’s motivation to participate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0885412211413133">Halvorsen 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0885412211413133">Helling 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0885412211413133">Kathlene and Martin 1991</xref>). Virtually all research reviewed has suggested that citizens are more likely to contribute if they perceive that their input will have an influence on the outcome.</p>
<p>Yet even here there are opposing viewpoints. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr148-0885412211413133">Tritter and McCallum (2006)</xref> in their work offered a critique of the classic Arnstein model suggesting that because it focused solely on power relationships in the civic engagement process, it left out other equally important aspects. They point to the intrinsic value of participation; the simple fact that there is value just in the act of contributing. They also point out that many citizens recognize that they possess different levels of knowledge and expertise and are more satisfied with the process than the impression left by the vocal minority.</p>

<sec id="section28-0885412211413133">
<title>Connecting Theory to Practice</title>
<p>A number of writers have grappled with the connection between the reasonably well-developed theories about public participation and the actual practice. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr159-0885412211413133">Yang (2005)</xref>, for example, suggests that trust is the missing link in the process. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr119-0885412211413133">Roberts (2004)</xref> feels that practitioners do not possess the complex knowledge of the theory of participation necessary to properly conduct such work. This connecting of theory to practice is perhaps one of the areas which require much more research although others have attempted to deal with the challenge through work on process evaluation. In the practical world, political bodies are often content to learn that consultation has taken place and both the planner and the politician lack a tool to assess the value of the consultation processes employed; something identified by the research presented in this section.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section29-0885412211413133">
<title>Opportunity Costs</title>
<p>As discussed under the earlier section “Motivation to Participate,” consultation can be viewed, in one dimension at least, as a basic commodity whose trends have been shaped by market economics and for which time is the principal cost. As alternatives become more numerous and more attractive, the opportunity cost of attending a public participation session increases, thus decreasing attendance itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0885412211413133">Iannaccone and Everton 2004</xref>). On the other hand, as product enhancements and the associated benefits of attendance are augmented, an increase can similarly be seen in attendance rates. This is why focus group participants and citizen jury members are often paid or offered some material rewards such as gift certificates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr153-0885412211413133">Vogt, King, and King 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr156-0885412211413133">Waterton and Wynne 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0885412211413133">Crosby, Kelly, and Schaefer 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr118-0885412211413133">Renn, Webler, and Wiedemann 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr128-0885412211413133">Sexton 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>But participation in decision making is more than just a simple commodity. In many ways, it is seen by both participants and practitioners as a rational investment of time aimed at producing positive and visible outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0885412211413133">King et al. 1998</xref>; McMillan and Murgatroyd 1994). In spite of such consultation benefits, the inclination against increasing participation opportunities or providing further enhancements has been a factor since the early appearance of the practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0885412211413133">Irvin and Stansbury 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>In part, this is because consultation can be a relatively expensive proposition. Analyses of civic engagement expenditures from the late 1990s identify a cost of $175 per hour of tangible consultation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0885412211413133">Helling 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0885412211413133">Kathlene and Martin 1991</xref>). Approximately one-third of that figure came from the opportunity costs of participating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0885412211413133">Helling 1998</xref>); implying that cost and value are inexorably linked to both the decision to participate and the process by which the public input is solicited. The effects of these escalating costs for both parties have not escaped the notice of researchers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0885412211413133">Irvin and Stansbury 2004</xref>). As early as 1994, McMillan and Murgatroyd noted that though desirable, consultation is not always convenient, as it can be difficult and expensive to contact all people affected by a decision and obtain their committed participation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0885412211413133">Clary and Snyder (2002)</xref> confirm that a commitment to participate is unlikely to be realized if the experience seems trivial, insignificant, and/or fails to impact the community.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section30-0885412211413133">
<title>Evaluating Participation</title>
<p>Since 1968, when some of the earliest formalizing of civic engagement standards in Western democracies began in the United Kingdom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0885412211413133">Booth 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr116-0885412211413133">Pilliard 1986</xref>), attempts have been made to evaluate the effectiveness of public consultation. There is fairly wide agreement among researchers that effective participation is that which is real or authentic. In the words of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0885412211413133">King et al. (1998</xref>, 320) “participation that is deep and offers continuous involvement with the potential for all involved to have an effect on the situation and have a degree of comfort with the arrived decision.” In their model presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0885412211413133">Figure 2</xref>, citizens are placed next to the issue, while the administrators remain as the bridge between them and the political processes, “authentic participation [thus] requires that administrators focus on both process and outcome” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0885412211413133">King et al. 1998</xref>, 320).</p>
<p>The previous sentence is a neat summary of the thirty-year trend in consultation. In particular, it demonstrates that knowledge building and legislative frameworks can produce sufficient familiarity with consultation among the applicable players so as to actually change the scope of the debate from the merits of consultation in general to the aim of reaching milestones for both process and outcome. Many other researchers have joined in the effort to assist in the improvement of consultation practice by carefully examining effectiveness of various approaches and this trend has strengthened in recent years.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section31-0885412211413133">
<title>Outcomes</title>
<p>Some people might look at the various approaches to public participation that have been proposed and suggest that they are not in fact separate and distinct methods but simply variations on the same theme. Indeed it appears as if some theorists regard public consultation as in some ways a single entity. Some might even see some of the variations as “old wine in new bottles” as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0885412211413133">Kaufman and Jacobs (1987)</xref> called it, or just the marketing ploys of facilitators for hire. Here, the position of IAP2 becomes germane to the discussion.</p>
<p>Though clearly not an entirely unbiased opinion, the fact that they should advocate different methods for various purposes and circumstances carries great weight for the conclusion that there are relevant distinctions between the entries on their list of consultation techniques. Furthermore, the fact that these techniques can be placed against Arnstein’s power-sharing ladder jives with the common understanding that different outcomes come about from different methods.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section32-0885412211413133">
<title>Administrative Skills</title>
<p>Researchers agree that certain skills are required of planners and public administrators to produce effective consultation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-0885412211413133">Michaels, Mason, and Solecki 2001</xref>). Interpersonal skills, including communication, listening, team building, meeting facilitation, and self-knowledge are among the requirements, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0885412211413133">King et al. (1998)</xref>. Innes ([1996] 2006) finds that planners who exhibit the skills to conduct various kinds of civic engagement processes have substantial legitimacy among consultation participants and are respected for their contributions, even when the participants have criticisms.</p>
<p>The IAP2, among others, has picked up on the concept that there are many ways to conduct public participation and recommend a series of devices based on the desired objective as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0885412211413133">Figure 3</xref>. The levels of public involvement identified by the IAP2 are based on Arnstein’s ladder of participation which was discussed above.</p>
<p>Eventually, a decision must be made as to which consultation technique or combination will be used. As we have seen there is no shortage of techniques from which to choose. Of these, much has been written on meetings, focus groups, scenario workshops, consensus building, visioning, collaboration, citizen juries, and collaborative problem solving. Each of these particular approaches has been outlined above and the research relating to their functioning and effectiveness briefly reviewed. It should be pointed out here that we have limited ourselves to the techniques that involve actual face-to-face interaction between planners and citizens as distinct from information gathering methods such as surveys, polls, and other less personal approaches that are legitimate aspects of consultation but are not, strictly speaking, participative.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section33-0885412211413133">
<title>Interrelationship of Government Agencies</title>
<p>Some public officials have long opposed citizen participation because it was thought to be time-consuming, expensive, complicated, and emotionally draining. Similarly, citizens become cynical toward government agencies because they fail to perceive an ongoing helpful attitude from city hall. The discord between these two bodies is highlighted by the different goals and objectives that each hold.</p>
<p>Research shows that public participation is of greater use to administrators and participants who actively seek more interactive forums, and that such action eventually increases the legitimacy of the plans in the minds of stakeholders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0885412211413133">Duram and Brown 1999</xref>). Unfortunately, policy decisions imply a distribution of limited resources, creating winners and losers (OECD 1997). Thus, any true evaluation of a consultation method or exercise must be conducted based on its ability to position governments to arrive at fair and appropriate decisions while effectively communicating the rationale for their judgments.</p>

<sec id="section34-0885412211413133">
<title>Planning Education</title>
<p>For consultation regarding land-use planning issues such as the development of official or structural plans, transportation policy issues, or the locating of facilities, it is usually a public sector planner who ends up with the important role in assembling and facilitating information flow as part of education and outreach programs and for exchanging ideas between organizations. This conventional model for participation places the planner as the administrative and technical expert charged also with selecting the appropriate consultative process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0885412211413133">Kathlene and Martin 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0885412211413133">King et al. 1998</xref>). In other models, the selection onus is switched and/or more equitably distributed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0885412211413133">Arnstein 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0885412211413133">King et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr154-0885412211413133">Walters, Aydelotte, and Miller 2000</xref>), but most often it falls to planners to decide on what kind of a public consultation will happen. However, in terms of their education most planners tend to be dramatically underprepared for this task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-0885412211413133">Michaels, Mason, and Solecki 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>A quick survey of five of the top-rated planning programs in the United States revealed that only two, University of California (Berkeley) and Rutgers, offered courses in how to conduct public consultation (Planetizen 2010). Only one such course is known to be offered in Canada at the University of Waterloo. It is no doubt in the case that many good university programs introduce students to participation techniques through studio and other courses but the lack of dedicated course on public engagement indicates that it is considered peripheral in nature. In the absence of formal training in consultation, a professional association, the International Association for Participation in Planning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0885412211413133">IAP2</xref>) was formed a number of years ago and provides a wide variety of courses and training sessions to assist practitioners to improve their consultation practice. This training, however, tends to be delivered by other practitioners while, with few exceptions, there have not been efforts made in the academic community to develop teaching approaches or strategies or to study the effectiveness of academic training.</p>

<title>Process Cynicism</title>
<p>Paradoxically, simple encouragement to participate more or assume a greater share of power distribution may increase involvement in the short term but seems to reduce the longer-term motivation to be involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0885412211413133">Clary and Snyder 2002</xref>). Citizens often become fatigued by repeated public input opportunities or demands (McMillan and Murgatroyd 1994; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0885412211413133">Beebeejaun and Vanderhoven 2010</xref>), and frustrated when, under the guise of having already been consulted, they find themselves denied the privilege of more extreme forms of outcry, such as protests and boycotts, methods made more socially acceptable by the presence of a greater power imbalance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr123-0885412211413133">Sager 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0885412211413133">Bickerstaff and Walker 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Methods are required by which participation formats can be evaluated for their ability to achieve effective consultation. Despite the importance of evaluating outcomes, most studies have only sought to appraise the processes. Failing to monitor the longer term appears to be part of the reason why <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0885412211413133">Bickerstaff and Walker (2005)</xref> found that participation is not having a substantive affect on policy process and decision outcomes throughout Europe. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr132-0885412211413133">Shipley et al. (2004)</xref> came to a similar conclusion in a Canadian study where almost 40 percent of those questioned after participating believe that their contribution would have little or very little impact on the final decision. Further, they warn that the point may have already been reached where the negative aspects of consultation so augment the opportunity costs of attending as to dissuade community members from engaging in the process.</p>

<sec id="section37-0885412211413133">
<title>Increase in Trust</title>
<p>Some argue that current participation mechanisms are fundamentally flawed because of a general lack of trust between officials and citizens, an assertion that is further explored in the readings also finds that public administrators do not necessarily trust citizens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0885412211413133">Berman 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0885412211413133">Bloomfield et al. 2001</xref>).

<p>Our review of the subcategories of research that attempt to analyze civic engagement shows that consultation outcomes can be evaluated by a selection of criteria that relate back to the theories and in the search for efficiency improvements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0885412211413133">Bickerstaff and Walker 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0885412211413133">Connick and Innes 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0885412211413133">Helling 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0885412211413133">Kathlene and Martin 1991</xref>). The questions that appear to be most often asked are:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>Are people better informed about projects and their impacts as a result of the public participation activity?</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Were all major interest groups adequately represented and did their ideas and opinions make any difference on project outcomes?</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Were traditionally underrepresented groups brought into the process and did their opinions matter?</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Did the elected and appointed leadership respond to the input received from the public and did it make a difference in their decision making?</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Was an acceptable compromise reached among competing interest groups leading to broad support for the final decisions?</p>
</list-item>
</list>The parallels between the means to judge consultation outcomes and efficiency improvements are immediately apparent. Similarly, it can be anticipated that decisions which are altered as a result of the consultation exercise have provided both the planners and the public with the opportunity to maximize mutual consultation benefits. Whereas the cost-effectiveness of consultation is often determined by the length of time, number of participants, format, and opportunity costs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0885412211413133">Helling 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0885412211413133">Iannaccone and Everton 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0885412211413133">Kathlene and Martin 1991</xref>), it is obviously the case that where less money is spent to achieve the same result, that greater efficiency has been achieved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr111-0885412211413133">Parkin and Bade 2000</xref>).</p>

<title>Mapping the Literature on Public Participation or Consultation</title>
<p>A number of key points can be observed from the breakdown of the literature provided in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0885412211413133">Figure 6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0885412211413133">B</xref>. The map highlights the split between those authors who primarily consider civic engagement in theoretical terms, those who have looked at specific participation techniques, and those who have attempted some form of evaluation of the effectiveness of consultation. There are, however, works with research findings that are applicable across these divides as well as some key points where they overlap.</p>

<p>While we have configured our literature map to divide the research into three main themes and have placed the subcategories vertically, there may be quite different ways to view the literature, even if we maintain the categorization. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0885412211413133">Figure 7</xref> suggests a configuration of the literature map that reflects more of the flow of ideas as they developed than an analytical organization of the categories. Others may usefully organize the work in still different ways. We would contend, however, that the themes and subcategories presented here will accommodate the vast majority of the scholarship on the subject of civic engagement.</p>

<title>Gaps and Future Research Directions</title>
<p>The investigation of writing in the field of planning consultation has uncovered much in terms of the breadth of knowledge, as well as specific, subtopic emphases. However, though not specifically stated, collectively, the cited authors have made certain assumptions that are worth noting here.</p>
<p>For instance, the authors have assumed that, all other things being equal, all citizens are willing to participate in consultation and that implies that the decision-making format should be made more conducive to participation. Second, an assumption is made that a high degree of participation, or at least representation, is possible. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr130-0885412211413133">Shipley (2002)</xref> suggests that such an assumption might be seriously questioned. Alarmingly, some models such as collaboration and consensus building depend on this trait. Finally, most of the literature investigated fails to delineate a geographic boundary for the concepts that they describe. It is generally left undefined as to whether these approaches will work best at the neighborhood, city, or regional scale, let along at a national level. Such assumptions, as made by many authors, are crucially important because, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0885412211413133">Brownill and Parker (2010</xref>, 281) point out, “participation is not always desirable in practice <italic>unless</italic> certain key considerations have been recognized.”</p>
<p>Beyond these key assumptions, not all literature is based on research gathered and analyzed in the same fashion. Significant emphasis has been placed on qualitative research methods and means of analysis, especially in the past fifteen years. Very few studies have tried to quantify factors influencing consultation, the relationship between outcomes and consultation formats or even evaluative scores from current efforts. This lack of quantitative analysis represents one of several key knowledge gaps.</p>
<p>Stemming from the assumptions implicit to the literary works investigated, five items remain unknown and warrant researching:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>the extent to which residents want to be involved in a municipal consultation process,</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>the priorities that the public holds with respect to planning issues,</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>the format and length of time for consultation that residents find comfortable and appropriate,</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>the extent to which the planner can accept input from the public and still remain credible to the profession and his or her municipal council,</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>the extent to which modern social media will have a positive or negative impact on our efforts for civic engagement and the creation of trust generally but also the field of urban planning specifically.</p>
</list-item>

<title>Final Analysis</title>
<p>From the beginning, this article has set out to uncover, through systematic research of relevant planning materials from the last twenty years, the theory and rationale for public consultation, the approaches to conducting public consultation, and the means for analyzing and evaluating consultation techniques.</p>
<p>Overall, the analysis of the literature leads these authors to believe that while there may be some divergent viewpoints on some subjects, it can be generally held that:
<list list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>The institutionalization of public participation in planning over the last forty years is a logical extension of the principles of participatory democracy and therefore worthy of the relentless pursuit of perfection that has been sought by academics and practitioners alike.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Public consultation appears poised to comprise an even greater influence on planning policies in the near future and for this reason, it is both logical and desirable that planning practitioners should develop and test perfect mechanisms to assess the fairness of both consultation processes and outcomes.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Formal academic training for planners and administrators is either slight or nonexistent, and yet the impact on reaching good planning decisions and facilitating political approval at applicable levels is huge.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>The use and reliance on certain techniques to engage the public has evolved as consultation and has become entrenched in planning practice and gained teeth in public laws.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>The unique and divergent nature of these consultation techniques is confirmed not just by their advocates but also by international governing associations and the common understanding that different approaches garner different results along the continuum of power sharing.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Perhaps because of a lack of formal training in many cases, it remains the expectation that planners will possess and employ a variety of skills to conduct good consultation and to which should be added the ability to conduct appropriate self-evaluation and process evaluation as a postconsultation activity.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>The most apparent way to evaluate consultation methods and outcomes is to determine the influence on decisions, the interpretations of public officials, and the general cost-effectiveness of the process.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>It is evidentially clear that many different means of engaging the public on consultation issues exist and there is some evidence to suggest that employing a combination of techniques as a cohesive strategy can be more effective and may reduce public cynicism.</p>
</list-item>
</list>As for a conclusion at this stage in the evolution of public consultation in planning, the most fundamental tool lacking for planners is not a specific type of consultation technique, literary resource, or even academic/practical training, but rather, a proven tool to evaluate the consultation methods employed for procedural and distributional fairness. We still cannot determine, definitively, that we are doing it right. Given the events in different parts of the world that have recently seen governments swept away, partly through the use of social media (blogs, twitters, etc.), these revolutionary means of civic engagement may totally surpass all other forms and make an understanding of the essentials of participation, especially what makes it effective and successful, even more vital information than we could have imagined ten to fifteen years ago.</p>
