<abstract>
<p>California nearly legalized commercial marijuana production in 2010; in coming years, other states and California are expected to entertain similar proposals. This raises the question of whether marijuana diverted from legal production could displace current sources of marijuana in other states. Combining prior estimates of legal production cost with new estimates of the cost of smuggling within the United States suggests that in most states, diverted legal production would substantially undercut current prices. So, if one state legalized, then (illegal) interstate “exports” could depress marijuana prices throughout the United States, even if taxes are collected before diversion and export. The authors proxy smuggling costs by the current gradient in prices observed for Mexican or commercial-grade marijuana; based on seven different data sets, it appears to be roughly US$325 to US$475 per pound per 1,000 miles as one moves north from the Mexican border.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>California entertained two serious proposals to legalize marijuana in 2010: a legislative bill (the “Ammiano Bill”) that died before receiving a floor vote and a voter proposition (“Proposition 19”) that was narrowly defeated on November 2nd. Either could have made large-scale commercial production for recreational use legal with respect to state and local laws, something no jurisdiction in the world has done. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022042612436650">Kilmer, Caulkins, Pacula, MacCoun, and Reuter (2010)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022042612436650">Kilmer, Caulkins, Bond, and Reuter (2010)</xref> addressed implications for California budgets, marijuana consumption in California, and Mexican Drug Trafficking Organizations’ (DTO) revenues and violence, and also provide a foundation for analysis of additional postlegalization implications.</p>
<p>Here we investigate another, generally neglected implication: the possibility that marijuana diverted from legal production might be exported (illegally) to other jurisdictions. Such exports could place downward pressure on prices elsewhere and, if the diversion occurs after taxes were collected, potentially create export-based tax revenue for the state that legalized.</p>
<p>There is a tradition of economic analysis of legalization (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022042612436650">Caputo &amp; Ostrom, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022042612436650">Gieringer, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022042612436650">Miron, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0022042612436650">Warner, 1991</xref>) to which this article contributes in three respects: (a) Most analyses focus on a single jurisdiction, rather than addressing spillovers; (b) this analysis is grounded in a detailed understanding of a specific, plausible legalization scenario; and (c) it is descriptive and not embedded within a welfare analysis seeking to demonstrate that legalization is a good or a bad idea.</p>
<p>It might seem implausible that taxes could be collected on exports, given that those exports would remain illegal. However, some growers could produce for both the (quasi legitimate) California market and the interstate black market, as happens with regulated opium production in India today (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022042612436650">Paoli, Greenfield, Charles, &amp; Reuter, 2008</xref>). If taxes were imposed on producers, rather than at retail, then taxes could be collected before the marijuana is diverted. Note, even purely criminal exporters might value purchasing above board and, hence, paying taxes, if that reduced their risk of arrest when acquiring the marijuana.</p>
<p>The plausibility of this scenario would depend on how legalization was implemented and how federal and other states’ law enforcement responded afterward. We defer discussion of such qualifications to the end of the article but acknowledge that we are discussing only one possible scenario.</p>
<p>For three reasons, this issue remains topical even though both California measures failed. First, the analysis sheds light on the cost of transporting illegal drugs within the United States. Second, there will likely be future efforts to legalize marijuana in California. Third, legalization in some but not all states or some but not all nations in a region could happen elsewhere, and the analytic approach might carryover, even though the parameters here are specific to the United States.</p>
<p>The heart of the analysis is comparing for each U.S. state or city (a) the current price of marijuana with (b) the projected postlegalization bulk price in California plus the estimated cost of smuggling marijuana illegally to that state or city from California. If the latter is smaller, then legalization in California could exert downward pressure on prices and, depending on current illicit suppliers’ ability to cut prices, California exports might end up supplying those consumers.</p>
<p>Price declines matter. The econometric literature shows that use goes up when prices go down for drugs generally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022042612436650">Grossman, 2005</xref>), and for marijuana in particular (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022042612436650">Jacobson, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0022042612436650">Williams, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0022042612436650">Williams, Pacula, Chaloupka, &amp; Wechsler, 2004</xref>). Indeed, one of the earliest drug elasticity studies pertained to marijuana (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022042612436650">Nisbet &amp; Vakil, 1972</xref>). For marijuana, initiation and use by youth is particularly price sensitive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022042612436650">Pacula et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0022042612436650">van Ours &amp;Williams, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Depressing prices and driving out existing suppliers would not be all bad. Marijuana accounts for roughly 20% of Mexican DTOs’ drug export revenue. Shrinking those revenues may help shrink trafficking-related violence in Mexico (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022042612436650">Kilmer, Caulkins, Bond, et al., 2010</xref>). Illegal domestic production in states other than California could also be displaced. We do not attempt a comprehensive welfare analysis or take a position on whether legalization is a good or a bad idea; we seek only to analyze one important consequence that should factor into people’s thinking about legalization.</p>
<p>Current prices are available from a number of data sources, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022042612436650">Kilmer, Caulkins, Pacula, et al. (2010)</xref> have estimated what bulk prices would be in California after legalization. That leaves two chunks of analysis for this article: (a) estimating the costs of transporting marijuana illegally within the United States and (b) comparing current prices to the resulting projection of prices after legalization on a state-by-state or city-by-city basis, and doing so in a way that allows for sensitivity analysis with respect to uncertain parameters. The body of this article is divided into two main sections corresponding to those two distinct analyses. Before turning to the first, we sketch how they fit together to help the reader understand the overall thread.</p>
<p>As we explain below, after legalization of commercial production, smugglers might be able to acquire high-quality marijuana (sinsemilla) in California at prices ranging from US$300 per pound (low-end production cost, untaxed) to US$1,350 per pound (high-end production cost, with sales tax and a US$50 per ounce excise tax). Although US$300 to US$1,350 per pound is well below current sinsemilla prices, even US$300 per pound is very high compared with most conventional goods. At those value-to-weight ratios, conventional distribution costs (fuel, labor, etc.) are minor considerations. Marijuana would also continue to be a controlled substance through most of the smuggling path and, indeed, within California with respect to federal law. So information on price gradients and distribution patterns of legal goods lose relevance. Instead, postlegalization transport costs must be grounded in observed spatial variation of prices for illegal goods.</p>
<p>A literature on spatial variation in drug prices exists, but most is not directly relevant.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0022042612436650">1</xref></sup> We are interested in cost differentials for wholesale quantities of finished goods over long distances within a single country, not between countries as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022042612436650">Farrell, Mansur, and Tullis (1996)</xref>; European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022042612436650">EMCDDA; 2010</xref>); or United Nations Office of Drugs and Crime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022042612436650">UNODC; 2010</xref>). Likewise, the familiar story of prices increasing from source to transshipment and final market countries (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022042612436650">Kleiman, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022042612436650">Reuter, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022042612436650">Reuter &amp; Kleiman, 1986</xref>) does not pertain; nor do studies of how prices increase as one moves down the domestic distribution chain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022042612436650">Caulkins, Gurga, &amp; Little, 2009</xref>), or between different retail markets within one country (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022042612436650">Caulkins, 1995</xref>). Studies from other countries (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022042612436650">Chandra, Barkell, &amp; Steffan, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022042612436650">Clements, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022042612436650">Leggett, 2006</xref>) are useful as foils but not for parameter estimates. Transporting drugs is costly primarily because of the need to compensate for enforcement and other risks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022042612436650">Reuter &amp; Kleiman, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022042612436650">Caulkins &amp; Reuter, 2010</xref>), and the United States is an outlier with respect to enforcement intensity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022042612436650">Kuhn, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>So we develop an original estimate here. The key insight is that legalizing marijuana in California might not greatly alter the cost of smuggling from California to other states, as most of the smuggling risk comes from enforcement by the federal government and other states. Hence, we infer future smuggling costs from currently observed spatial variation in marijuana prices. Essentially, we plot current price versus distance from presumed source and observe the slope. This linear model is a simplification, but it fits the data reasonably well.</p>
<p>The price gradient can only be observed if it is large relative to error in measurement of prices. The coefficient of variation of measured prices is roughly the same across a range of drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022042612436650">Reuter &amp; Caulkins, 2004</xref>). Thus, the price gradient is easiest to measure for a cheaper drug. Ditch weed is very cheap, but it has no single source and prices are reported only sporadically. So we estimate future smuggling costs using current data for commercial-grade marijuana, even though we expect most domestic production after legalization to be sinsemilla. This may not be unreasonable as marijuana sentences are based on weight, not type or potency (see for example, Controlled Substance Act, Section D).</p>

<title>Sources of Price Data</title>
<p>The ideal data for examining the relationship between price and distance from source would be official reports on current wholesale prices for Mexican marijuana in every one of the lower 48 states. There is no such ideal data set. Instead we use every available data set that is relevant. Inasmuch as all seven show the same general pattern, we can be reasonably confident in the basic finding.</p>

<p>The sources are not entirely independent; one would presume that NDIC draws on information from DEA. However, none is simply a copy of another. For example, the NN website and NDIC Market Analysis prices are the most highly correlated (correlation = .647), but for only one state do they quote exactly the same price (Utah, US$600-US$1,000 per pound).</p>

<sec id="section4-0022042612436650">
<title>Distance Data</title>
<p>Distances were proxied by distance to the nearest city in Mexico, computed using the website MapCrow’s Travel Distance Calculator. Marijuana is also imported from Canada (mostly sinsemilla) and Jamaica, and there is illegal domestic production. Nevertheless, Mexican marijuana accounts for 40% to 67% of U.S. marijuana consumption, and an even larger proportion of the roughly 80% of marijuana purchases which are not sinsemilla (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022042612436650">Kilmer, Caulkins, Bond, et al., 2010</xref>, Appendix C).</p>
<p>We considered Canada as a potential source. In particular, we computed distances to the nearest source, in Mexico or Canada (specifically Vancouver or Quebec), allowing an additional “fixed charge” to represent how much harder it is to smuggle across the United States–Canadian border than across the United States–Mexican border. This did not improve explanatory power, so we report here only the price versus distance from Mexico. Likewise, adding other independent variables (e.g., city population for prices quoted at the city level) did not statistically improve the fit, although searching for better multivariate models may be an avenue for further research.</p>

<p>These descriptive statistics serve two purposes: (a) They establish general reliability and agreement between prices provided by the different data sets and (b) they give a sense of the magnitude of the price gradient per pound per 1,000 miles.</p>
<p>We refined that estimate by replicating the analysis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022042612436650">Figure 1</xref> for all seven data sets, keeping the analysis at the city level when possible, and doing sensitivity analysis with respect to date range limits and exclusion of potential outliers. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0022042612436650">Table 3</xref> summarizes the results. The gradients are between US$325 and US$475 per pound per 1,000 miles. We use that range below, with US$400 as the base case value.</p>

<p>The agreement across so many data sets is an important source of confidence in the results. Each data set has potential weaknesses. For example, it is not clear how self-report data sets would stop dealers from submitting counterfeit price claims. But that concern is not relevant for STRIDE or other series based on official reports and, more generally, it is much harder to think of reasons why all seven data sets would be biased, and by the same amount, than it is to criticize any one of the seven in isolation.</p>
<p>Some data sets were explicitly about Mexican marijuana, but most were not so specific. That is problematic as price varies by type and quality of marijuana. As noted below and in the <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0022042612436650">appendix</xref>, we dropped observations whose prices were clearly inconsistent with other prices of Mexican marijuana. This by necessity is somewhat of a subjective process, but we verified that inclusion or exclusion does not dramatically affect the estimated price gradients.</p>
<p>This issue was most pronounced for ADAM and STRIDE, the two data sets that do not even distinguish sinsemilla from commercial grade. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022042612436650">Kilmer, Caulkins, Bond, et al. (2010)</xref> found that 80% of ADAM’s price observations were well below those associated with sinsemilla, but 4 of the 40 cities stand out for having pound-level (200-1,500 gram) prices that are high in absolute terms (US$1,950-US$2,575 per pound) and far above the regression line. Not coincidentally, all 4 (San Jose; Portland, Oregon; Spokane; and Seattle), were in or near Northern California, a region associated with sinsemilla production. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0022042612436650">Table 3</xref> shows that dropping those cities greatly improved the fit but only modestly affected the price gradient. The only other city whose price exceeded US$1,205 was Detroit (US$1,705 per pound). We retained that data point because it is not a gross outlier considering distance from Mexico; dropping it would reduce the gradient (to US$276 per pound per 1,000 miles) without materially improving the fit.</p>
<p>There is one data set that is not entirely consistent with price gradients of US$325 to US$475 per pound. DEA IDPPR data are available for a range of years. Combining data across years produces gradients of about US$440 per pound per 1,000 miles, but in some individual years, the gradient was lower or higher. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0022042612436650">Table 3</xref> shows results of regressions with dummy variables for each year and for 3-year blocks, as well as the average gradient when running separate regressions for each year. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0022042612436650">Figure 2</xref> shows how the price gradients from the single-year regressions changed over time. That variation does not appear random; the gradient generally increased from 1986 to 1996 and fell thereafter. This suggests that the gradient can vary over time with circumstances and need not always be approximately US$400 per pound per 1,000 miles. There is a loose correlation with changes over time in marijuana enforcement intensity but not one clear enough to draw conclusions.</p>

<p>It is interesting to compare the magnitude of these gradients with rough estimates of the tangible, monetary costs of smuggling. Suppose two people took 3 days to drive to California from 1,000 miles away, purchase a wholesale quantity of marijuana, and return. The direct cost of such a trip might be roughly US$2,000 to US$2,500.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0022042612436650">2</xref></sup> If the trip involved purchasing and reselling only 5 pounds, those tangible costs would explain the entire price gradient. That sets a rough floor on the minimum viable shipment size when arbitraging price variation between locations in this way. If the trip involved transporting 50 pounds, then these tangible costs would amount to only US$40 to US$50 per pound per 1,000 miles. That does not contradict the observed gradient; the difference could represent compensation for the risks of arrest, being robbed, and/or violent confrontation with other transaction parties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022042612436650">Reuter &amp; Kleiman, 1986</xref>).</p>

<title>Other Price Gradient Results</title>
<p>We looked for other evidence of marijuana price gradients. We expected sinsemilla prices to increase with distance from Northern California, but there was no such pattern in High Times data for the United States as a whole. (Within California prices near Humboldt County tended to be lower, but there are obvious omitted variables that could be driving that result.) This nonfinding could be caused by production elsewhere in the United States and/or data limitations; a two standard deviation range around an average sinsemilla price of US$4,000 per pound is large relative to the price gradients we have estimated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022042612436650">Reuter &amp; Caulkins, 2004</xref>), yielding a poor “signal to noise” ratio for sinsemilla. Similar consideration would make it difficult to estimate price gradients for cocaine and heroin.</p>
<p>We replicated the analysis for <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022042612436650">Leggett’s (2006)</xref> herb and resin prices for 11 European countries as a function of distance from Gibraltar—reflecting a belief that Morocco is an important source of cannabis in Europe. Univariate regressions of price on distance had fairly high <italic>R<sup>2</sup></italic> for resin and herb (.51 and .47, respectively) and even higher for the average of the two (.62), with price gradients that were larger but still sensible (US$1,621; US$1,198; and US$1,410 per pound per 1,000 miles, respectively). However, distance and number of additional international boundaries crossed are very highly correlated (correlation coefficient = .9), and the fit is just as good if the explanatory variable is international borders crossed, not distance. Most of these countries are within the Schengen Area, which ought to reduce the salience of border crossing, but there are still differences, for example, in languages spoken. So, (a) there is a systematic tendency for European cannabis prices to increase with distance from Morocco, (b) the data are not inconsistent with what we estimated for the United States, but (c) there is no way to estimate a price gradient reliably; some or all of the relationship could be explained by border crossing, not distance.</p>
<p>In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022042612436650">Clements (2004)</xref> data, Australian marijuana prices are highest in New South Wales, intermediate in Victoria and the Australian Capital Territory, and lowest everywhere else. South Australia is sometimes thought of as Australia’s analog to California’s Emerald Triangle, and Clements’ “Head” (sinsemilla) prices do increase steadily with distance as one moves from Adelaide to Melbourne, Canberra, and Sydney. However, that is only four data points, and the other states’ prices only fit a price versus distance story if they have their own local supplies, rather than importing from South Australia. An equally plausible story is that Australian marijuana prices are the same everywhere, except for being more expensive in big cities (Sydney and Melbourne) and in the Australian Capital Territory, which is an idiosyncratic place in many respects. So again, the international data are not inconsistent with our United States–based analysis, but stronger statements are not possible.</p>

<title>Implications for California’s Potential Share of the Market</title>
<p>This section (a) describes plausible prices for diverted sinsemilla in California after legalization, (b) comments on how legalization might affect intranational smuggling costs, (c) estimates how much of the sinsemilla market outside of California might be supplied by marijuana diverted from legal production in California, and (d) does the same for commercial-grade marijuana. The estimates are based on commercial-scale smuggling. To the extent that there is also retail or consumer-driven border crossing (“drug tourism,” see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0022042612436650">Spapens, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0022042612436650">Valdez &amp; Sifaneck, 1997</xref>), California’s market share could be that much greater.</p>
<sec id="section8-0022042612436650">
<title>Prices in California</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022042612436650">Kilmer, Caulkins, Pacula, et al. (2010)</xref> estimated production costs in grow houses after legalization to be US$200 to US$400 per pound of unbranded sinsemilla, with additional processing costs of US$20 to US$35 per pound. (After legalization, there might also be boutique or branded varieties that command a price premium, but the unbranded price is what is more relevant for comparing with current black market prices.) Allowing a 25% supplier markup, this suggests wholesale prices before taxes of US$300 to US$500 per pound. That is an 80% to 90% decline relative to current prices, which are about US$2,000 per pound at farm gate in Northern California and US$3,000 to US$4,500 per pound in wholesale markets around the country. This decline in production cost may sound large, but it is considerably smaller than what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022042612436650">Gieringer (1994)</xref> projected from a full legalization—meaning elimination of federal as well as state prohibition.</p>
<p>Sales taxes in California vary by jurisdiction, but 9% is typical. Proposition 19 mentioned no specific marijuana tax rate; rather, it empowered local jurisdictions to set whatever rates they wished. The policy debate in California has anchored on US$50 per ounce, or US$800 per pound, perhaps because that figure was mentioned in the Ammiano Bill.</p>
<p>A US$50 per ounce excise tax is extraordinarily high on a per unit weight basis, equivalent to a US$35 tax on a 20-gram pack of cigarettes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022042612436650">Caulkins, Morris, &amp; Ratnatunga, 2010</xref>). That is roughly 10 times higher than the tobacco tax in high-end states, and even those rates generate considerable tax evasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022042612436650">Lafaive, Fleenor, &amp; Nesbit, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022042612436650">Merriman, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022042612436650">Merriman, Yureleki, &amp; Chaloupka, 2000</xref>). So, we judge it unlikely that taxes higher than US$50 per ounce would successfully be collected, and lower taxes are possible. For example, as Proposition 19 devolved rate setting to local jurisdictions, it could have triggered a “race to the bottom” with jurisdictions vying to be the most industry-friendly to get the benefits of hosting the industry. (For operational and technical reasons, a grow-house-based industry would be footloose; there are no physical constraints on where it operates, so it would presumably gravitate to whatever jurisdiction was most hospitable.)</p>
<p>Hence, we examine implications of smugglers being able to acquire pounds of marijuana at prices ranging from US$300 per pound (low-end production cost, untaxed) to US$1,350 per pound (high-end production cost, with sales and US$50 per ounce excise taxes). US$1,200 per pound might be a fair point estimate with a US$50 per ounce excise tax collected, versus US$400 with no tax.</p>
<p>We readily concede there is great uncertainty about how a single state legalizing in the face of ongoing federal prohibition would play out. Some readers will be interested in scenarios that fall outside this range, for example, if they thought much higher taxes could be created. For them, the methods remain relevant even if the specific numbers below are not.</p>

<sec id="section9-0022042612436650">
<title>Smuggling Costs After Legalization</title>
<p>We are reasonably confident in the empirical finding above that the current price gradient for commercial-grade marijuana today is roughly US$325 to US$475 per pound per 1,000 miles, but it is worth reflecting on how legalization might affect that gradient. The point of departure is “not at all” as most of the distance traveled would be within states whose laws have not changed. However, there are arguments why reducing the value per pound of the object being smuggled might also reduce the cost per pound smuggled.</p>
<p>For example, lower prices might allow smugglers to carry bigger loads if the quantity carried on a single trip is limited more by dollar value than by vehicle capacity. If so, then halving the cost in California might double the load size, thereby halving the cost per pound per 1,000 miles for tangibles such as gasoline, hotels, and so on. Compensation for law enforcement risk would likely fall too; the risk of making one trip with 100 pounds is smaller than the risk of making two trips with 50 pounds each.</p>
<p>Lower replacement costs might mean less secure but cheaper smuggling modalities become relatively more efficient. Product losses due to seizure and theft on common-carriers (UPS, US Mail, etc.) might be prohibitive when it costs US$2,000 per pound to replace lost material, but acceptable when replacement costs are lower.</p>
<p>More generally, “additive” versus “multiplicative” price transmission models become relevant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022042612436650">Caulkins &amp; Reuter, 2010</xref>). Assuming that smuggling costs would remain as high as they are today, even after producer prices fell, implies faith in a strong version of the additive model. To the extent that a multiplicative model pertained, postlegalization smuggling prices might be lower.</p>
<p>An offsetting consideration is that although legalization would greatly reduce the cost of producing sinsemilla, it would reduce it to roughly the current wholesale price of commercial-grade marijuana. In other words, the price gradient we estimated above was for a product whose wholesale price per unit weight is comparable with that of sinsemilla after legalization. Furthermore, to the extent that future smuggling costs could be lower than our base case assumption of US$400 per pound per 1,000 miles, that would reinforce, not undermine, our conclusion that legalization in one state could depress prices elsewhere.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0022042612436650">
<title>Analysis for Sinsemilla Market</title>
<p>If smugglers could obtain sinsemilla in California for US$1,200 per pound and smuggling costs were US$400 per pound per 1,000 miles, then sinsemilla purchased legally in California and smuggled 2,500 miles to New York would cost US$2,200. That is less than the wholesale price NN currently reports for New York (US$2,500-US$6,000 in New York City and US$3,250-US$5,000 in Albany). Furthermore, comparing prices dollar for dollar may be conservative if legally produced but diverted marijuana is perceived as better than purely illegal sinsemilla, for example, because its quality is less variable.</p>
<p>Parallel logic applies throughout the country, and the results are not subtle. Even with our highest price in California (US$1,350) or our highest price gradient (US$475), California-produced marijuana would undercut existing sinsemilla prices in every state. Indeed, even with both the highest price <italic>and</italic> the highest gradient, that would still be true for every state except Wisconsin.</p>
<p>It would appear that the only way sinsemilla producers outside California could stay in business would be by cutting prices. It is not known by how much they could cut prices; the answer depends importantly on whether the current market is mostly competitive or currently produces oligopoly or quasi rents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022042612436650">Kleiman, 1989</xref>). Hence, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0022042612436650">Figure 3</xref> plots potential exports as a function of the amount by which diverted California sinsemilla would have to undercut current prices to win market share.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0022042612436650-fig3.tif"/></fig>
<p>It is also not clear how much (in grams) the average marijuana user consumes even today, let alone after legalization. So the vertical axis measures the number of current past-month users for whom exports would be cheaper than current sources, relative to the number of such users in California. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022042612436650">Hughes, Sathe, and Spagnola’s (2009)</xref> state-specific prevalence estimates imply there are 2.4 million past-month marijuana users in California, and another 15.4 million elsewhere in the lower 48 states; that is, 6.4 times as many outside California as inside. Hence, the line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0022042612436650">Figure 3</xref> starts at a height of 640%.</p>
<p>To clarify how to read <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0022042612436650">Figure 3</xref>, suppose one believed that sinsemilla from California had to be US$1,000 per pound cheaper than the current price to out-compete the current suppliers. Then one would look at US$1,000 on the horizontal axis and note that the line above that point is at the level of 600%, meaning that California exports would be the preferred source of sinsemilla for 6 times as many marijuana users in the lower 48 states outside California as there are marijuana users in California.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0022042612436650">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>The curve is “chunky” because analysis is done at the state rather than the city level. It slopes downward because the larger the margin by which taxed sinsemilla from California would have to beat current prices to win market share, the fewer states there are where Californian sinsemilla would actually be consumed, as opposed to merely exerting pressure to drive down prices without actually taking market share from current sources. Increasing the production cost in California, the tax in California, and/or smuggling cost tends to pull the curve down and to the left. But within the parameter ranges we consider, essentially the entire curve is always to the right of the vertical axis, indicating great potential for California exports, even if they were taxed at US$800 per pound.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0022042612436650">
<title>Analysis for Commercial-Grade/Mexican Marijuana Market</title>
<p>The analysis for the current commercial-grade market is similar but with one twist, which we illustrate by thinking first of one specific state. Currently Mexican marijuana sells in Wisconsin for about US$1,075 per pound. It is roughly 1,750 miles from Humboldt County California to Wisconsin, so at a transport cost of US$400 per pound per 1,000 miles, diverted California sinsemilla would cost US$1,200 + US$400 × 1.75 or roughly US$1,900 per pound in Wisconsin.</p>
<p>So, in Wisconsin, sinsemilla diverted from legal California production might cost 1.75 times as much per pound as Mexican commercial-grade marijuana does now. Presumably if the price per pound were the same, buyers would prefer the California-produced sinsemilla. It is not immediately obvious whether they would still prefer sinsemilla if it costs 1.75 times as much per pound, but for two reasons we think that is likely.</p>
<p>First, the typical THC content of Mexican imports is 4% to 6%, whereas the THC content of sinsemilla is now typically 10% to 18% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022042612436650">Kilmer, Caulkins, Bond, et al., 2010</xref>, Appendix B), or 2 to 3.6 times higher. Hence, the cost per unit of THC or per hour of intoxication would be lower.</p>
<p>Second, commercial grade and sinsemilla are sold today in the same geographic markets, and the price per unit weight of sinsemilla is always substantially higher. Pound prices are the most relevant for our purposes. Across the 24 states for which NN provides estimates for both grades, sinsemilla pound prices were always more than 1.75 times greater than commercial-grade pound prices, with an average ratio of a little over 4 to 1.</p>
<p>The ratio decreases somewhat at lower market levels. For example, across 48 locations in the lower 48 states (including Washington, D.C., but no data for Nebraska), the average ratio of high- and low-quality ounce prices reported by the price of weed website was 3.5 to 1. Our data are least useful for gram-level purchases, but <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0022042612436650">Sifaneck et al. (2007)</xref> report that in New York City US$10 and US$20 bags of commercial grade contain slightly more than twice the weight as do US$10 and US$20 bags of designer marijuana.</p>
<p>So it seems clear that pounds of sinsemilla are valued considerably more highly than are pounds of commercial grade. We do not know the exact equivalence ratio, and the ratio could be different in the future, so we pick an initial ratio and then do sensitivity analysis around it. We chose as the baseline that a pound of sinsemilla would be as valuable as 2.8 pounds of commercial grade (i.e., roughly the same value per unit of THC). The basic finding at that ratio is that California-grown marijuana would undercut current potency-adjusted prices for most of the country. For example, even if smugglers had to pay US$1,200 per pound for sinsemilla in California and incurred a US$400 per pound per 1,000 miles transport cost, the diverted California sinsemilla would still undercut commercial-grade prices for 80% of marijuana users outside of California, missing only those in Arizona, Florida, Georgia, New Mexico, or Texas. If the price of sinsemilla in California fell to even US$800 per pound (e.g., a US$25 per ounce tax), then it would be cheaper per unit of THC in every state except Texas.</p>
<p>If buyers were willing to pay more per unit of THC contained in high-quality sinsemilla, that would only reinforce the result, so we do not include those sensitivity analyses here.</p>
<p>However, for lower equivalency ratios (meaning, buyers pay more per unit of THC when buying lower quality marijuana), the results are not always so lopsided. For example, if a gram of diverted California sinsemilla were only as desirable as 2 not 2.8 grams of Mexican marijuana, then the all-but-Texas result would require prices in California to drop to US$450 per pound, that is, no significant excise tax is collected.</p>
<p>So, one can identify conditions under which current suppliers would remain competitive in some states, for example, if a substantial excise tax were collected before diversion and users prefer to obtain THC from lower rather than higher potency types of marijuana. In particular, with a US$1,200 price per pound in California and a 2:1 equivalency ratio, commercial-grade marijuana at current prices would be preferred by 40% of past-month users outside of California. However, one can also see that glass as 60% full; even if both those conditions held, diverted California sinsemilla would still undercut current prices for the majority of commercial-grade marijuana users in the United States. And if no tax were collected before diversion (US$400 per pound purchase price), legalizing marijuana in California would cut THC prices by one third or more for everyone outside Texas, and most of the country would see the price per hour of intoxication fall by 45% to 60%.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Based on seven different data sets, commercial-grade marijuana prices in the United States appear to increase by about US$325 to US$475 per pound per 1,000 miles of additional distance from Mexico. Assuming arbitrage works well enough to make price gradients reflect actual transport costs, including the risks of enforcement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022042612436650">Caulkins &amp; Reuter, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022042612436650">Reuter &amp; Kleiman, 1986</xref>), is a fair estimate of the cost of smuggling marijuana within the lower 48 states.</p>
<p>Combining that figure with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022042612436650">Kilmer, Caulkins, Pacula, et al.’s (2010)</xref> estimate of marijuana production costs after legalization, data on current marijuana prices, and plausible tax rates points to our principal finding: Marijuana that is diverted from legal production—even after taxes are collected—would undercut current marijuana prices throughout most of the United States. In particular, they would undercut current sinsemilla prices essentially everywhere, and would undercut commercial-grade prices on a per unit THC basis in the great majority of the United States. Hence, legalizing marijuana production in California would make it economical to supply most cannabis consumption throughout the United States via marijuana diverted from legal California production. This would create downward pressure on prices throughout the United States and so presumably push up marijuana use, dependence, and other sequelae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022042612436650">Hall &amp; Pacula, 2003</xref>). Thus, one state’s decision to legalize would create consequences for the country as a whole.</p>
<p>The extent to which this happened would depend on details of the legalization regime. For example, if producers were required to physically secure their production facilities and marijuana could only exit the premises in small packages bearing a stamp verifying payment of a sizable excise tax, diversion would be more difficult. And if suppliers were held accountable for documenting that all the marijuana leaving their premises was sold by legitimate retailers within California, with forfeiture of land and capital assets as a penalty for failure to do so, diversion might be riskier and more difficult than straight up illegal production. However, if such issues are not attended to with some care, then producers may be able to sell to brokers who claim to be supplying legitimate retail operations inside California when in reality they are diverting some to smugglers who (illegally) take the marijuana out of state.</p>
<p>This article was motivated by California’s near passage of Proposition 19 in November 2010, and the analysis was done from the perspective of California being the state that legalized production. However, the same result would hold for any state legalizing marijuana because production cost estimates were based on indoor growing which can be done anywhere. Indeed, California is a relatively uneconomical place for indoor growing inasmuch as it has unusually high prices for two of the larger factors of production: residential housing and electricity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022042612436650">Caulkins, 2010</xref>). It is also far from the large east coast population centers. However, indoor growing involves some craft skill, so economies of agglomeration might tend to preserve an industry cluster where it is now centered.</p>
<p>Marijuana exports could benefit a state that legalizes if other states do not follow suit. That one state would get the job creation and possibly production tax revenues from supplying users elsewhere in the country, while most of the adverse consequences of greater use would accrue outside its borders; even for the largest state (California), there are 6 times as many marijuana users elsewhere in the lower 48 as there are instate. This has at least three policy implications. First, a state desirous of exploiting this source of revenue ought to impose taxes on marijuana producers, not retailers. Second, the other states would not be disinterested bystanders; their marijuana markets would be affected, perhaps dramatically, by any one state’s legalizing production. Third, depending on one’s beliefs concerning the social benefit or cost of greater marijuana use, state-level legalization could be viewed as a Prisoner’s Dilemma; everyone would be better off if no one legalized, but it is in any individual state’s interest to legalize. So some might view a tough federal response that deters states from legalizing (e.g., withholding federal highway dollars from any state that legalizes marijuana) as a welfare-enhancing tool for keeping the states in their preferred cooperate–cooperate strategy, a position which otherwise would not be a stable equilibrium.</p>
<p>It is important to close by stressing that any projection related to legalization is subject to great uncertainty. Much could depend on technical details of the regulatory regime governing legal production. Also, we do not believe the federal government will stand idly by if one state were to capture the entire national marijuana market, although we cannot predict what or how effective the federal government’s reaction would be. So we think of Section 3’s analysis as projections that raise provocative questions, rather than as forecasts or predictions. But at a minimum they underscore that the nation as a whole, not just individual states, will likely be grappling with marijuana legalization in coming years.</p>

<title>Appendix</title>
<sec id="section13-0022042612436650">
<title>Description of Data Sources</title>
<p>The Narcotic News (NN) website appears to be a private undertaking that, in its own words “is designed to appeal to Law Enforcement personnel and all others who have a desire to read about the latest news in cocaine, marijuana, heroin, methamphetamine, and so on. In addition we will post news articles relating to large cash seizures and hidden compartments that are used to conceal dangerous drugs. The goal of this site is to bring awareness to the worldwide drug problem.” NN does not describe its methods of data collection or authentication. They appear to be intended to reflect voluntary self-report by law enforcement agencies. The site invites “If you are involved in law enforcement and would like to submit the going prices for your area, please email us at <email>info@narcoticnews.com</email>.”</p>
<p>The site lists wholesale price ranges for a pound of marijuana, organized by state and city. Prices are usually given as ranges, of which we took the midpoint. Some are supplemented by parenthetical descriptions (such as “High Grade”); no date information is given. We separated those reported to be sinsemilla or high grade (<italic>n</italic> = 22) from the others, assumed to be commercial grade (<italic>n</italic> = 126). The 22 sinsemilla or high-grade entries were not enough to support analysis of price as a function of distance from source, but were used for the current price when estimating the potential export market.</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Justice’s (DOJ) National Drug Intelligence Center (NDIC) publishes Drug Market Analysis reports (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.justice.gov/ndic/">http://www.justice.gov/ndic/</ext-link>) for approximately 32 regions (depending on the year). The most recent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022042612436650">NDIC, 2009</xref>) collection of reports included wholesale (pound) prices for Mexican marijuana in only four states, so we combined data from past reports, taking midpoints of ranges, averaging across cities within a state, and averaging across years. Average prices vary with distance from Mexico, from US$375 per pound in New Mexico to US$1,725 per pound in Minnesota. The last is influenced by a 2001 report of US$2,500 to US$3,000 per pound which probably actually pertains to sinsemilla, but as no formal retraction has appeared, we retain it in the analysis but check its influence on the results.</p>
<p>We obtained all 311 System To Retrieve Information from Drug Evidence (STRIDE) purchase observations that were denominated in grams (FORM = GMS) and involved purchases of 950 grams or more between 2005 and April 2009. There were 82 marijuana purchases of roughly 1 to 9 kilograms. We dropped 1 observation labeled “THC” (rather than “Cannabis”), the observation from Alaska, 10 with prices below US$250 per pound, and 15 with prices more than US$2,000 per pound (presumably sinsemilla), leaving 55 observations spread over 25 states.</p>
<p>The Drug Enforcement Administration’s (DEA) Illegal Drug Price/Purity Reports (IDPPR) data were originally published in hard copy reports (Domestic Cities Reports, 1982-1985; Illicit Drug Wholesale/Retail Price Reports, 1985-1990; and IDPPR, 1991-1998). They were assembled for another project and are described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022042612436650">Pacula et al. (2001)</xref>. The data include 1,369 quarterly observations (fourth quarter of 1982 through 2001) of pound- and ounce-level prices for sinsemilla and commercial-grade marijuana, usually expressed as a range, for one of 20 cities (and the nation as a whole, but national data are not useful here). Annual prices were computed by averaging midpoints of the quarterly ranges for any location–year with two or more quarters of data, yielding 282 observations covering 1986 to 2000. Note: the STRIDE data come from 2005 to early 2009, so they do not overlap with the time period covered by the DEA IDPPR reports.</p>
<p>The ADAM Program is a federally funded monitoring system that interviews and collects urine samples from arrestees quarterly in a number of cities around the United States. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0022042612436650">Yacoubian, 2000</xref>). The ADAM data contained 25,308 observations from 2000 to 2003 and 43 locations. Each observation included the city, year, quarter, amount paid, number of units, and type of units (e.g., gram, ounce, etc.). We focused on the 15,709 observations whose units were pound, ounce, gram, or joint, and excluded those whose units were ambiguous (bag, “other,” “don’t know,” etc.).</p>
<p>The ADAM data appeared to be contaminated by outliers, so we regressed log of amount paid on log of weight and dummy variables for time and city. We removed the 431 observations whose value was more than 2.5 standard deviations away from the regression line.</p>
<p>The “fanzine” High Times allows contributors to submit descriptions and prices of marijuana to the “Trans High Market Quotations” (THMQ) section in their part of the country. These data are described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022042612436650">Jacobson (2004)</xref>, who provided us with the data. Briefly, the data consist of 2,157 prices submitted to High Times from 1996 to 2005 for an ounce of schwag (<italic>n</italic> = 490), mids (<italic>n</italic> = 244), or sinsemilla (<italic>n</italic> = 1,422). Prices tended to be lowest for schwag (average US$111 per ounce), highest for sinsemilla (average US$360) and intermediate for mids (US$182). We focused on schwag as the grade most likely to reflect Mexican marijuana prices—although after having made that choice we also investigated mids prices and found that they are even (slightly) more strongly correlated with distance from Mexico.</p>
<p>Plots of price versus distance suggested there were outliers on the low side that might be obscuring the relationship between price and distance, so we conducted the analysis with all observations and after deleting (“trimming”) observations with prices equal to or below US$50 for schwag (and US$100 for mids). We also retained only states for which there was more than one data point, and used the average across those data points. This left 44 states for schwag (and 35 for mids).</p>
<p>The new website <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.priceofweed.com">www.priceofweed.com</ext-link> posts submissions from anonymous users by location, and price paid per ounce of high-, medium-, or low-grade marijuana. They also survey users on “social metrics,” registering how users view the social acceptance of marijuana use and the emphasis on law enforcement in their area. Their first price submissions were posted on September 2, 2010 and by September 15, 2010, more than 3,000 submissions had been posted. Priceofweed posts running averages for the price of high-, medium-, and low-quality marijuana for all 50 U.S. states as well as 13 Canadian provinces, as well as what seems to be every individual submission, although their companion blog (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://priceofweed.tumblr.com/">http://priceofweed.tumblr.com/</ext-link>) says that outliers are removed before averaging. The number of submissions changes in real time. As of December 7, 2010, the date we downloaded the prices used here, there were 869 observations for low-quality marijuana. They covered all of the lower 48 states, except Montana, although 3 other states had suspiciously high averages based on only a few submissions (North Dakota-3, South Dakota-3, and Wyoming-6).</p>

<p>Since this paper’s acceptance, geographers affiliated with the blog <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.floatingsheep.org">www.floatingsheep.org</ext-link> have posted an online draft of a paper, which also uses data from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://priceofweed.com">priceofweed.com</ext-link> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0022042612436650">Zook, Graham, &amp; Stephens, 2011</xref>). Publically available as a google doc, this unpublished paper titled “Data Shadows of an Underground Economy: Volunteered Geographic Information and the Economic Geographies of Marijuana” uses a data set of 22,365 prices, from September 2010 to March 2011, provided to floatingsheep.org by the operators of the priceofweed.com website. Interpolating price of weed prices to create a smoothed national map of marijuana price variance, the authors find a price gradient of US$40 per ounce of high-quality marijuana per 1,000 miles from Humboldt County, California.</p>

<p>In all, 2,000 miles driven times US$0.50 per mile = US$1,000 for gas, oil, depreciation, and so on. Six person days times US$125 per day wage plus US$50 “per diem” for meals equals roughly another US$1,000. Hotel bills could be roughly US$200 to US$500 depending on the hotel and whether the two conspirators share a room.</p>

<p>Narcotic News only provided sinsemilla price data for 22 states; other states were assigned the price observed in their nearest neighbor. When such states are roughly equidistant from California, the curve jumps down by the combined population of all those states for roughly the same price difference on the horizontal axis. Finer grained data on current sinsemilla prices would create a smoother curve but not change its location.</p>
