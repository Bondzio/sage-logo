<abstract>
<p>Nomilin is a triterpenoid present in common edible citrus fruits with putative anticancer properties. In this study, the authors investigated the antimetastatic potential of nomilin and its possible mechanism of action. Metastasis was induced in C57BL/6 mice through the lateral tail vein using highly metastatic B16F-10 melanoma cells. Administration of nomilin inhibited tumor nodule formation in the lungs (68%) and markedly increased the survival rate of the metastatic tumor–bearing animals. These results correlated with the biochemical parameters and histopathological analysis. Nomilin showed an inhibition of tumor cell invasion and activation of matrix metalloproteinases. Treatment with nomilin induced apoptotic response, characterized by an increase in the sub-G1 fraction of cells with chromatin condensation and membrane blebbing, a typical ladder of DNA fragmentation, and detection of apoptotic cells by TUNEL assay. Nomilin treatment also exhibited a downregulated Bcl-2 and cyclin-D1 expression and upregulated <italic>p53, Bax, caspase-9, caspase-3, p21</italic>, and <italic>p27</italic> gene expression in B16F-10 cells. Proinflammatory cytokine production and gene expression were found to be downregulated in nomilin-treated cells. The study also reveals that nomilin could inhibit the activation and nuclear translocation of antiapoptotic transcription factors such as nuclear factor (NF)-κB, CREB, and ATF-2 in B16F-10 cells.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Cancer is a hyperproliferative disorder that involves transformation, dysregulation of apoptosis, proliferation, invasion, angiogenesis, and metastasis. Metastasis is the most lethal attribute of a cancer. It is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality and is the single most important obstacle to curative cancer therapy. During this process, tumor cells disseminate from the primary tumor, migrate through the basement membrane, survive in the circulatory system, invade into a secondary site, and start to proliferate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1534735411403307">1</xref></sup> The metastatic process is highly inefficient; very few of the cells that migrate from the primary tumor successfully colonize at distant sites. Recent in vitro and in vivo observations indicate that apoptosis is an important process in regulating metastasis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1534735411403307">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, is an essential event that plays an important role in an organism’s developmental process, maintenance of homeostasis, and elimination of damaged cells. Its morphological characteristics include plasma membrane blebbing, cell shrinkage, nuclear condensation, chromosomal DNA fragmentation, and formation of apoptotic bodies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1534735411403307">3</xref></sup> Tumors are characterized by uncontrolled proliferation and reduced apoptosis. Inducing apoptosis is an efficient method of treating cancers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1534735411403307">4</xref></sup> Cell cycle control has been proven to be a major event in ensuring accurate cell division. Abnormalities of cell cycle regulators have been associated with many carcinogenic processes. Thus, cell cycle regulators of cancer cells could be targeted and altered as a chemoprevention treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1534735411403307">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Natural products represent a rich source of compounds that have found many applications in various fields of medicines and therapy, including cancer therapy. Effective ingredients in several plant-derived medicinal extracts are terpenoid compounds, and many terpenes have biological activities that are used for the treatment of human diseases. Nomilin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1534735411403307">supplementary Figure 1</xref>) is a triterpenoid present in common edible citrus fruits with putative anticancer properties. Immunomodulatory activity of this triterpenoid was already reported in our lab. Treatment with nomilin was found to enhance the total white blood cell count, bone marrow cellularity, α-esterase-positive cells, antibody titer, and the number of plaque forming cells in the spleen and also remarkably inhibited delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction in Balb/c mice.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1534735411403307">6</xref></sup> It also possesses antiproliferative activity against a number of human cancer cell lines, including that for leukemia (HL-60) and cancers of the ovary (SKOV-3), cervix (HeLa), stomach (NCI-SNU-1), liver (Hep G2), and breast (MCF-7).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1534735411403307">7</xref></sup> In the present study, the effect of nomilin on the inhibition of pulmonary metastasis induced by B16F-10 melanoma cells in C57BL/6 mice was evaluated with special emphasis on the mechanism of action, using in vitro models.</p>

<p>B16F-10 melanoma cells (5000 cells/well) suspended in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS, 100 µg/mL streptomycin and penicillin, and 2 mmol/L glutamine were plated in a 96-well flat-bottomed titer plate and incubated for 24 hours at 37°C in 5% CO<sub>2</sub> atmosphere. Nomilin at a concentration of 25 µg/mL was added to the cells, and this was incubated further for 48 hours under the same conditions. The supernatant was used for the estimation of cytokines such as IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, and GM-CSF using specific ELISA kits per manufacturer’s protocol (Pierce Biotechnology, USA).</p>

<title>Transcription factor profiling</title>
<p>Transcription factor profiling was done using a BD Mercury Transfactor Kit obtained from BD Biosciences (Palo Alto, CA). This kit provided rapid, high-throughput detection of specific transcription factors—namely, NF-κBp65, NF-κBp50, NF-κBc-Rel, c-Fos, ATF-2, and CREB-1—in the nuclear extract. Using an ELISA-based format, the transfactor kit detected the DNA-bound transcription factors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1534735411403307">16</xref></sup> by specific primary antibody toward NF-κB p65, NF-κB p50, NF-κB, c-Rel, c-Fos, ATF-2, and CREB-1. A horseradish peroxidase–conjugated secondary antibody was then used to detect the bound primary antibody. The enzymatic product was measured with a standard microtiter plate reader at 655 nm. Percentage inhibition was calculated by the formula 100 − ([Optical Density of treated/Optical Density of control] × 100).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Uncontrolled cell growth and resistance to apoptosis are major defects in cancer. The development of approaches that induce apoptotic machinery within cancer cells could be effective against their proliferation and invasive potential.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1534735411403307">18</xref></sup> In the present study, we analyzed the effect and mechanism of action of nomilin on the inhibition of lung metastasis induced by B16F-10 melanoma cells. Invasion and metastasis are the most insidious and life-threatening aspects of cancer. Metastasis of cancer cells is a threat to available cancer therapy and is a major reason for treatment failure. Medicines available presently are cytoreductive drugs, which are nonspecific.</p>
<p>B16F-10 melanoma cells are highly metastatic and form colonies of tumor nodules in the lungs when administered through the tail vein, which in turn promote lung fibrosis and collagen deposition. The characteristic of this defect is an increased accumulation of extracellular matrix proteins in the alveolar walls, specifically collagen, resulting in reduction in pulmonary function. The index of lung fibrosis was evaluated by estimating the lung collagen hydroxyproline content. Nomilin treatment was effective in reducing lung fibrosis, which was confirmed by the lowered levels of lung collagen hydroxyproline content.</p>
<p>Sialic acid, a family of acetylated derivatives of neuraminic acid, occurs as the terminal component of carbohydrate chains of glycolipids and glycoproteins. Increased levels of β(1-6) branched <italic>N</italic>-linked oligosaccharides have been observed in many metastatic tumor cells,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1534735411403307">19</xref></sup> and progression from a tumorigenic to metastatic phenotype in both rodent and human cancers has been associated with corresponding upregulation of sialic acid content.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1534735411403307">20</xref></sup> Because uronic acid and hexosamines are the basic structures of sialic acids,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1534735411403307">21</xref></sup> the index of tumor cell proliferation was also evaluated by estimating hexosamine and uronic acid contents. The lungs of the metastatic tumor–bearing animals showed higher levels of uronic acid and hexosamine. Administration of nomilin significantly (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05) reduced the elevated levels of uronic acid and hexosamine. Total sialic acid level in serum has been recognized as a valuable nonspecific monitor of tumor burden in melanomas.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1534735411403307">22</xref></sup> The increased sialic acid levels in the control metastatic tumor–bearing animals were significantly (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05) reduced by the treatment with nomilin. Serum γGT is also a marker for neoplastic proliferation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1534735411403307">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1534735411403307">24</xref></sup> Highly elevated levels of γGT are observed in patients with either primary or secondary neoplasms. The increased serum γGT level was reduced by treatment with nomilin. All these results correlated with the histopathological analysis and increase in life span of treated animals. The above experimental evidence shows that nomilin can inhibit the metastatic growth of B16F-10 melanoma cells in a mouse model.</p>
<p>Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a family of zinc-dependent endoproteinases that are capable of degrading almost all the components of the extracellular matrix and thereby upregulating invasion and metastasis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1534735411403307">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1534735411403307">26</xref></sup> Among the MMPs reported earlier, MMP-2 and MMP-9 are key enzymes for degrading type IV collagen, which is a major component of the basement membrane.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1534735411403307">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1534735411403307">28</xref></sup> The result of zymographic analysis indicates that administration of nomilin inhibited the activation of MMPs. It also inhibited the invasion of B16F-10 melanoma cells through the collagen matrix. There is also strong evidence for the direct inhibition of activation of MMPs by nomilin.</p>
<p>To study the mechanism of action of antimetastatic activity, we have analyzed the ability of nomilin to suppress cell cycle progression and induce apoptosis in B16F-10 melanoma cells. Defective apoptosis is a major causative factor in the development and progression of cancer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1534735411403307">29</xref></sup> Cancer cells acquire resistance to apoptosis by overexpression of antiapoptotic proteins or downregulation or mutation of proapoptotic proteins. In the present study, morphological analysis of B16F-10 cells treated with nontoxic concentrations of nomilin showed the presence of membrane blebbing, cytoplasmic shrinkage, and nuclear condensation. A DNA ladder pattern in nomilin-treated cells also supports the above result.</p>
<p>Apoptosis is regulated by antiapoptotic and proapoptotic effectors, which involve a large number of biomolecules. The tumor suppressor gene <italic>p53</italic> has come to be known as a master guardian of the genome and a member of the DNA damage-response pathway. <italic>p53</italic> is able to induce growth arrest or apoptosis in DNA-damaged cells. Induction of G1 arrest depends on sequence-specific DNA binding and transcriptional activation of <italic>p53</italic> target genes such as <italic>p21. p21</italic> and <italic>p27</italic> are CDK (cyclin-dependent kinases) inhibitors, shown to arrest the cell cycle and inhibit the growth of cancer cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1534735411403307">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1534735411403307">31</xref></sup> The members of the Bcl-2 family play an important role in the induction of apoptosis and are considered a target for anticancer therapy. Bcl-2 is an upstream effector molecule in the apoptotic pathway and is identified as a potent suppressor of apoptosis; its downregulation causes tumor regression. On the other hand, predominance of Bax, a proapoptotic protein, over Bcl-2 promotes apoptosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1534735411403307">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1534735411403307">33</xref></sup> Caspase-3, an essential member of the caspase family, can eventually induce cell apoptosis and be activated by upstream caspases, including caspase-9 and caspase-8. In this study, administration of nomilin could induce apoptosis by upregulating <italic>p53, Bax, caspase-9, caspase-3, p21</italic>, and <italic>p27</italic> and also downregulating <italic>Bcl-2</italic> gene expression.</p>
<p>Inhibition of deregulated cell cycle progression in cancer cells is an effective strategy to halt tumor growth.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1534735411403307">34</xref></sup> Our results further demonstrate that treatment of B16F-10 cells with nomilin increases the peak of the sub-G1 phase (cells with fragmented DNA) of cell cycle progression, indicating that one of the mechanisms by which nomilin inhibits the proliferation and invasion of B16F-10 cells is the induction of apoptosis. Cyclin D1 serves as a key sensor and integrator of extracellular signals of cells in G0 and early G1 phases, mediating its function through binding with Cdk4/6. Aberrant cyclin D1 expression is a critical event in cancer development.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1534735411403307">35</xref></sup> Treatment of nomilin downregulated the overexpression of cyclin D1 in B16F-10 cells.</p>
<p>The NF-κB family of transcription factors (Rel [c-Rel], Rel A [p65], Rel B, NF-κB-1 [p105/p50], NF-κB-2 [p100/p52]) is involved mainly in stress-induced immune and inflammatory responses. Chronic inflammation by constitutively active NF-κB has been shown to contribute to the development of many cancers. NF-κB can be activated by a variety of stimuli, including IL-1 (IL-1) and TNF-α, and among its multiple effects, it also induces antiapoptotic proteins and blocks caspase activation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1534735411403307">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1534735411403307">37</xref></sup> Therefore, NF-κB was generally considered to act predominantly as a mediator of cell survival. In the present study, treatment with nomilin was found to inhibit the activation and nuclear translocation of transcription factors such as NF-κB p50, NF-κB p65, NF-κBc-Rel, c-Fos, ATF-2, and CREB in B16F-10 melanoma cells.</p>
<p>Cytokines and growth factors are critical regulators of immune responses, inflammatory reactions, cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and apoptosis; they play an important role in chronic diseases such as cancer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1534735411403307">38</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1534735411403307">40</xref></sup> TNF, a proinflammatory cytokine that plays a major role in modulating cytokine cascades, upregulates the expression of several other cytokines such as GM-CSF, IL-1 (IL-1β), and IL-6.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1534735411403307">41</xref></sup> Nomilin also inhibited the production and expression of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6, and GM-CSF in B16-F10 cells.</p>
<p>In summary, our study demonstrates that nomilin inhibits metastasis via induction of apoptosis in B16F-10 melanoma cells. Nomilin downregulated <italic>Bcl-2</italic> and <italic>cyclin-D1</italic> expression and upregulated <italic>p53, Bax, caspase-9, caspase-3, p21</italic>, and <italic>p27</italic> gene expression in B16F-10 cells. Proinflammatory cytokine production and gene expression were found to be downregulated in nomilin-treated cells. The study also shows that nomilin could inhibit the activation and nuclear translocation of antiapoptotic transcription factors such as NF-κB, CREB, and ATF-2 in B16F-10 cells.</p>
