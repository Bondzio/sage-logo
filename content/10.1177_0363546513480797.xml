<title>Background:</title>
<p>The optimal treatment of medial epicondyle fractures in pediatric athletes remains unclear.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0363546513480797">
<title>Purpose:</title>
<p>To evaluate the outcomes of operative and nonoperative management of medial epicondyle fractures in young athletes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0363546513480797">
<title>Study Design:</title>
<p>Case series; Level of evidence, 4.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0363546513480797">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>The records of all children with fractures of the medial epicondyle over a 5-year period, with a minimum 2 years of follow-up at a pediatric tertiary referral center, were reviewed. Patients with intra-articular entrapment of the fracture fragment or ulnar nerve entrapment were excluded. Treatment decisions were made primarily based on injury mechanism and elbow laxity or instability. Patients were contacted and asked to complete a modified Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) questionnaire.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0363546513480797">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>Complete data with 2-year follow-up were available for 20 athletes: 6 treated nonoperatively and 14 treated operatively. At the latest follow-up, both groups achieved excellent DASH scores. Half of each cohort required physical therapy, and 6 of 14 patients who received operative treatment reported numbness. All patients were either very or completely satisfied with their treatment. Fourteen patients were overhead athletes (8 treated operatively, 6 nonoperatively). Excellent DASH scores were achieved in both groups, and all overhead athletes were able to return to their sport at the next appropriate level. Seven patients were baseball pitchers and sustained a fracture while throwing (4 treated operatively, 3 nonoperatively). None felt their performance was limited after treatment, and excellent DASH scores were achieved in both groups.</p>

<sec id="section6-0363546513480797">
<title>Conclusion:</title>
<p>These data demonstrate that nonoperative treatment can be successful in young athletes with low-energy medial epicondyle avulsions, a stable elbow, and minimal fracture displacement. Surgical management can be successful in athletes who sustain more significant trauma, who have elbow laxity or instability, or who have significant fracture fragment displacement after a fracture of the medial epicondyle.</p>

<p>The medial epicondyle is the attachment site of the common flexor/pronator tendon and the medial ulnar collateral ligament of the elbow. Fractures of this apophysis may account for 12% of all elbow fractures in adolescents.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0363546513480797">36</xref></sup> However, the optimal treatment for this injury remains controversial. Historically, fractures with less than 2 mm of displacement were treated with cast immobilization, although more recent studies have cited highly variable thresholds for surgical intervention.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546513480797">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0363546513480797">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0363546513480797">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0363546513480797">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0363546513480797">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0363546513480797">36</xref></sup> Many authors agree that injuries with intra-articular incarceration of the fracture fragment, gross elbow instability, open fractures, or entrapment of the ulnar nerve require operative treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546513480797">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546513480797"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546513480797">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546513480797">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0363546513480797">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0363546513480797">39</xref></sup> However, no consensus exists for moderately displaced fractures that do not fall under the generally accepted operative or nonoperative indications, especially in athletes.</p>
<p>Injuries to the medial epicondyle are especially significant in overhead athletes. The medial ulnar collateral ligament is the primary restraint to the tremendous valgus torque that is placed on the elbow in sports that involve overhead throwing, hitting, or weightbearing. The flexor/pronator mass also originates from the medial epicondyle and provides dynamic muscular support to the joint. In adult baseball pitchers, it has been estimated that the medial ulnar collateral ligament can be loaded to near failure during throwing, despite the dynamic muscular forces around the joint, particularly the flexor/pronator mass, helping to stabilize the joint during these activities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546513480797">10</xref></sup> The fact that uninjured professional pitchers demonstrate an increased amount of valgus laxity in their throwing arm compared with their nonthrowing arm helps demonstrate this point.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546513480797">8</xref></sup> In skeletally immature overhead athletes, both the static and dynamic medial stabilizers attach to the medial epicondyle, thus conferring all of the static and dynamic stress to the medial epicondylar physis. Previous studies have found that radiographic changes related to medial-sided traction stresses are common in Little League Baseball pitchers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546513480797">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546513480797">23</xref></sup> One study found that 52% of Little League players in Taiwan reported medial elbow pain or soreness at some point during the course of a season.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546513480797">15</xref></sup> It is this great dependence on the medial epicondyle for valgus stability that leads many authors to advocate for operative treatment, despite encouraging results of nonoperative management.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546513480797">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546513480797">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0363546513480797">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0363546513480797">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0363546513480797">39</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>The literature regarding the treatment of this injury in pediatric athletes remains unclear. In this study, we sought to evaluate the outcomes of treatment of this injury pattern at our institution by analyzing 2-year outcomes of both operative and nonoperative treatment in young athletes. We also sought to determine the effect of treatment on return to athletic performance in a population with a large proportion of overhead athletes.</p>
<sec id="section7-0363546513480797" sec-type="materials|methods">
<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<p>Institutional review board approval was obtained. We reviewed the electronic billing records of our institution, a busy pediatric tertiary referral center, for patients with fractures of the medial epicondyle between 2000 and 2005. Patients were included in the study (1) if they were athletes who sustained a closed medial humeral epicondylar apophyseal fracture consisting of a single fragment with &gt;2 mm and ≤20 mm of displacement, (2) if they had undergone treatment according to prescribed management guidelines (described below), (3) if they had presented for treatment within 72 hours of injury, and (4) if they were accessible for survey administration with at least 2 years of follow-up. Patients were excluded if they did not meet the above criteria or if there was another upper extremity fracture, a history of elbow surgery or deformity, intra-articular entrapment of the fracture fragment, or ulnar nerve symptoms at initial presentation. Children were not automatically excluded if they presented with an associated elbow dislocation. However, they were ineligible for the study if the elbow could not be easily relocated at initial presentation and subsequently remain stable or if there was continued gross instability noted on clinical examination or stress radiographs. Standard anteroposterior (AP) and lateral plain films of the injured elbow were obtained for all patients. Additional stress views were obtained at the discretion of the examining physician to assess any potential medial joint opening if valgus stability was unclear on examination.</p>
<p>Treatment was administered by a group of 6 fellowship-trained pediatric orthopaedic surgeons. There was general agreement on treatment principles, and patients were included in this study if they were treated according to the following guidelines, which were applied to both athletes and nonathletes. Nonoperative treatment was considered only for fractures arising from a low-energy injury mechanism (for instance, a fall from standing or a pop experienced during throwing or other overhead activity), with no elbow instability or laxity, and minimal displacement of the fracture fragment. Displacement was considered to be “minimal” if less than 5 to 8 mm, although this was not a strict cutoff, and greater importance was placed on the other previously mentioned factors. Nonoperative management consisted of immobilization of the elbow, with or without manipulation, in a long arm cast at 70° to 90° of elbow flexion and neutral forearm rotation for 3 to 4 weeks. Patients were then placed in a posterior splint and encouraged to remove the splint, under controlled conditions, to perform gentle passive range of motion exercises 3 to 5 times per day. Patients were followed at 2- to 4-week intervals, and active range of motion was encouraged after palpation of the medial epicondyle was pain free. Physical therapy was initiated at 6 to 8 weeks if full range of motion had not yet been achieved.</p>
<p>Operative treatment consisted of open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) and was generally recommended for patients who suffered a traumatic or high-energy injury (including fall from a height, trampoline injuries, high-speed sports collision, or motor vehicle accident) or those with elbow instability or laxity. Laxity was assessed clinically at initial presentation by side-to-side valgus stability testing. These factors were typically considered to be more important than displacement of the fracture fragment alone because higher energy mechanisms often imply an increased likelihood of more significant associated soft tissue damage. Surgery was undertaken via a direct approach, through which the ulnar nerve was routinely identified and protected but not transposed. Fixation was achieved with a single screw (typically a 4.5-mm cannulated screw) with or without a washer. Postoperatively, patients were immobilized at 70° to 90° of flexion and neutral forearm rotation for anywhere from 10 days to just over 3 weeks. Subsequently, the arm was placed in a posterior splint and patients were encouraged to remove the splint, under controlled conditions, to perform gentle passive range of motion 3 to 5 times per day. Active range of motion was initiated when palpation of the medial epicondyle was pain free. Physical therapy was initiated at 6 to 8 weeks if full range of motion had not been achieved.</p>
<p>We initially identified 80 children with medial epicondyle fractures. Forty-four had reliable contact information and were available for follow-up. Four were excluded for evidence of ulnar nerve entrapment at the time of initial presentation. Two were excluded for incarceration of the fracture fragment within the joint, and an additional 2 were excluded for a fracture displacement less than 2 mm. Three were excluded for prior surgery/deformity of the affected elbow, and 3 more were excluded for subsequent injury to the affected elbow that was thought to be unrelated to the original injury to the medial epicondyle. One patient was deceased from causes unrelated to his medial epicondyle fracture. Of the remaining 29 patients, there were incomplete radiographic or study-related data on 9 patients, leaving 20 patients who fit our treatment guidelines.</p>
<p>All patients and/or families were contacted by telephone. After giving consent using a standardized verbal consent form, the legal guardian or patient (if older than 18 years at the time of follow-up) completed a standardized questionnaire. The questionnaire addressed the nature of the injury and treatment received, subsequent treatment and injuries, preinjury and current level of activities and sports participation, current symptoms, and patient satisfaction. A modified Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) survey was also administered. The item regarding current sexual activity was excluded because of the young age of many patients. The DASH questionnaire is valid as long as no more than 3 questions are skipped, and all questionnaires were valid despite omission of this question.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546513480797">5</xref></sup> To gain further insight into patient perception and satisfaction, subjective range of motion was also obtained by asking the patient to compare motion to the other arm.</p>
<p>All radiographs were interpreted retrospectively for this study by fellowship-trained pediatric orthopaedic surgeons. Measurements were made using digital radiography measurement tools for digital radiographs or a calibrated ruler based on the degree of magnification noted for printed films. Observers were blinded to all study-related data including patient-identifying data, previous measurements, treatment received, and clinical outcomes. Two blinded observers each made 2 separate measurements 2 weeks apart. The maximum amount of displacement noted on any view was recorded and averaged to assess the amount of fracture displacement.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Complete data with at least 2 years of follow-up were available for 20 patients: 6 treated nonoperatively and 14 treated with ORIF. All patients participated in at least 1 competitive sport on a regular basis before their injury. Patient demographics and baseline data are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0363546513480797">Table 1</xref>. There were 6 identified elbow dislocations in the group treated operatively but none in the nonoperative group. The mean initial fracture displacement in the nonoperative group was 5.3 ± 2.0 mm (range, 3.3-7.8 mm) versus 7.6 ± 2.7 mm (range, 3.8-10.7 mm) for the patients treated with ORIF. The average follow-up duration was 3.6 years for both groups (range, 2-6.9 years).</p>

<title>Clinical Outcome</title>
<p>All patients healed with a bony union without any significant hardware complications, sensory nerve injuries, or growth disturbances of the distal humerus in either group. Exactly half of each cohort required physical therapy. Despite this, 5 of 14 patients (36%) treated with ORIF and 2 of 6 patients (33%) treated nonoperatively had a perceived residual loss of range of motion. Given the study limitations, this loss was not quantifiable, but 1 patient treated surgically required subsequent capsular release for postoperative stiffness. Hardware removal was performed at the same time. One patient treated nonoperatively noted slight pain in the medial elbow that did not stop him from performing any activities. Numbness was noted in 6 of the 14 patients who were treated operatively but was reported in only 1 of our 6 patients treated nonoperatively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0363546513480797">Table 2</xref>). Of note, this numbness was always occasional and episodic with prolonged elbow flexion or compression. It was not late-onset numbness as described by Anakwe et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546513480797">1</xref></sup> and there was no perceived motor weakness. Except for 1 patient who was mostly satisfied, all of the patients treated operatively were completely satisfied with their treatment. Similarly, all of the patients treated nonoperatively were completely satisfied. At latest follow-up, both groups achieved excellent DASH scores (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0363546513480797">Table 2</xref>).</p>

<title>Sports Performance</title>
<p>Most patients were involved in multiple sports (9 baseball, 7 basketball, 6 football, 4 soccer, 3 gymnastics, 2 ice hockey, and 1 each in swimming, wrestling, martial arts, running, motocross, and cheerleading). All 20 patients were able to return to playing their sport(s) at the next appropriate higher level given their age, irrespective of the treatment received. Fourteen patients, 6 treated nonoperatively and 8 treated with ORIF, participated in high-level athletic activities requiring vigorous overhead throwing, hitting, or weightbearing that imparted significant valgus torque to the elbow (baseball, football quarterback, and gymnastics). All of these patients injured either their dominant arm or participated in a sport that requires 2 arms for overhead weightbearing, such as gymnastics. The mean fracture displacement in overhead athletes treated operatively was 7.1 ± 2.9 mm (range, 3.8-11.3 mm) and in those treated nonoperatively was 5.3 ± 2.0 mm (range, 3.3-7.8 mm). One of the patients treated with ORIF felt that even though he was able to continue with football and basketball, his performance was slightly limited by his elbow. Two of the 8 overhead athletes treated with ORIF and 2 of the 6 treated nonoperatively felt that they were performing at a higher level than their peers who had not been injured. One of these was a patient who was treated with ORIF and subsequently played as quarterback at the collegiate level. As with the overall study population, excellent DASH scores were collected for overhead athletes treated nonoperatively as well as those managed surgically (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0363546513480797">Table 3</xref>).</p>

<p>Seven of the overhead athletes were competitive baseball pitchers, all of whom sustained their injuries while pitching. Three were treated nonoperatively, and 4 were treated surgically. The 2 groups had similar amounts of fracture displacement at initial presentation (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0363546513480797">Table 3</xref>). After treatment, all were able to return to baseball at the next appropriate level. One patient in each group did not continue to pitch competitively but instead played a different position at the time of latest follow-up. However, neither of these athletes thought that their injury was the reason they were not still pitching. The other 2 patients treated nonoperatively and 3 patients treated with ORIF were able to return to pitching competitively. Both of the patients treated nonoperatively who continued pitching felt as if they were performing at a higher level than their peers who had not been injured. Again, excellent DASH scores were seen in both cohorts (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0363546513480797">Table 3</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Fractures of the medial humeral epicondyle in children have been a topic of considerable debate, with evolving trends in evaluation and management. While there is much discussion regarding the importance of the medial epicondyle in overhead sports participation, there is little literature regarding treatment of this injury in children with respect to subsequent sports participation. After an analysis of DASH scores, need for physical therapy, elbow stiffness, need for subsequent surgeries, pain, numbness, and patient satisfaction, we found that good clinical outcomes can be obtained in young athletes at 2 years of follow-up.</p>
<p>Nonoperative treatment was reserved for fractures arising from a low-energy injury, with minimal displacement of the fracture fragment and a stable elbow, while ORIF was preferred in patients who suffered a traumatic or high-energy injury or those with elbow instability. Ultimately, treatment decisions were made as a shared decision, with some patients with low-energy stable injuries electing to undergo ORIF. All patients were very or completely satisfied with the outcome of their treatment, and all patients were able to return to their sport of choice.</p>
<p>The medial epicondyle serves as the insertion point for the ulnar collateral ligament, which is the primary restraint to valgus torque at the elbow during overhead activities. This is one reason that many authors have been reluctant to endorse nonoperative treatment of isolated medial epicondyle fractures despite the lack of superior operative outcomes in the literature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546513480797">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546513480797">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546513480797">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0363546513480797">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0363546513480797">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0363546513480797">38</xref></sup> One concern is that the development of a fibrous nonunion will result in valgus instability and that this will lead to an inability to participate in activities that place a large valgus torque on the elbow.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546513480797">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0363546513480797">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0363546513480797">39</xref></sup> Although elbow instability has been reported after nonoperative treatment, the incidence of clinically significant valgus instability after nonoperative treatment remains unclear.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546513480797">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546513480797">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0363546513480797">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0363546513480797">39</xref></sup>

<p>Several authors have reported good clinical outcomes with ORIF in the general pediatric population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546513480797">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546513480797">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0363546513480797">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0363546513480797">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0363546513480797">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0363546513480797">39</xref></sup> However, nonoperative treatment with a brief period of cast immobilization has been shown to yield results that are similar to ORIF.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546513480797">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546513480797">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546513480797">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546513480797">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0363546513480797">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0363546513480797">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0363546513480797">38</xref></sup> Woods and Tullos,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0363546513480797">39</xref></sup> Schwab et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0363546513480797">33</xref></sup> and Case and Hennrikus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546513480797">4</xref></sup> specifically caution against nonoperative treatment in overhead athletes, and cases of elbow instability requiring ulnar collateral ligament reconstruction after initial nonoperative treatment have been reported. On the other hand, Nyska et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0363546513480797">26</xref></sup> described 8 teenage arm wrestlers who were able to fully recover and return to competition after nonoperative management of their injuries. Similarly, despite reporting a high rate of fibrous nonunion, Farsetti et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546513480797">9</xref></sup> could not demonstrate any valgus instability at long-term follow-up in patients with a displacement of up to 15 mm who were treated nonoperatively.</p>
<p>It is possible that the growth potential remaining in the skeletally immature elbow is able to accommodate for the short-term laxity of the medial epicondyle–ulnar collateral ligament complex that results from healing of the fracture fragment in a slightly displaced position. As a fibrous nonunion, or even a slightly displaced bony union, of the medial epicondyle forms, the ulnar collateral ligament may cease to elongate with the growing elbow until such time as the growth again places tension on the ligament. Alternatively, as in cases of prolonged immobilization, relaxation of tension may also lead to shortening of the medial ulnar collateral ligament.</p>
<p>Similar to the treatment philosophy described by Louahem et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0363546513480797">25</xref></sup> which prioritizes damage to the medial stabilizing structures over fracture displacement, we performed closed reduction and cast immobilization only in children who sustained low-energy or isolated avulsion injuries and who had a stable elbow with minimal fracture displacement (mean, 5.3 mm). All of these patients were seen to have excellent clinical results with a return to their sport(s). Our surgical patients generally sustained more significant elbow injuries associated with higher energy trauma. These fractures were displaced an average of 7.6 mm and included 6 concomitant elbow dislocations. Operative management also yielded excellent clinical results, as all patients returned to their respective sports and were either completely or very satisfied with their outcomes. Some patients even reported a subjective feeling of enhanced performance after treatment, although there exists the possibility that these athletes were simply more talented than their peers before injury or matured substantially afterward.</p>
<p>This study is the latest to address the long-standing debate on the indications for and results of operative versus nonoperative management of medial epicondyle fractures in children. We specifically analyzed these issues as they pertain to young athletes. Our practice follows the generally accepted indications for surgery, including a grossly unstable elbow, ulnar nerve symptoms, intra-articular incarceration of the fracture fragment, or an open fracture.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546513480797">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546513480797">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546513480797">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546513480797">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0363546513480797">31</xref></sup> For patients who do not fall under these indications, we rely primarily on injury mechanism as well as elbow laxity and stability.</p>
<p>Some authors have suggested that the magnitude of fracture displacement should be considered as well, but the specific threshold varies greatly in the literature.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0363546513480797">‡</xref></sup> Furthermore, a number of studies have found that standard radiographs do not accurately assess the true amount of fracture displacement, nor do they provide much clinical information regarding elbow stability. Pappas et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0363546513480797">30</xref></sup> found low interobserver and intraobserver agreement on measurements of AP, lateral, and oblique radiographs of these fractures. When using 3-dimensional computed tomography (3D-CT) as a gold standard, Edmonds<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546513480797">7</xref></sup> found that 6 of 11 standard radiographs that were initially read as “minimally displaced” actually had greater than 1 cm of displacement.</p>
<p>Along these lines, fracture displacement on standard radiographs is not likely sufficient information on which to base treatment decisions. Consequently, we have not emphasized displacement on plain radiographs as a key component of our guidelines, especially when compared with mechanism of injury and elbow stability. We believe that a functional assessment of elbow instability and dynamic displacement of the fracture fragment, as can be assessed with stress radiographs, may yield a better understanding of the character of the injury and help direct treatment. As suggested by previous authors, specialized radiographic views, particularly the flexed elbow AP view, taken with the elbow in 40° of flexion with the beam perpendicular to the forearm, and comparison external oblique radiographs can be a valuable part of the radiographic assessment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0363546513480797">21</xref></sup> However, these views are often difficult to obtain and require repositioning of the injured arm. We occasionally obtain 3D-CT scans to better assess displacement in cases where there are significant questions regarding surgical indications. This modality, of course, confers the risks of increased radiation exposure. However, when the information garnered from 3D-CT imaging is balanced against the imperfect specialized plain radiographic views, we feel that CT is a viable option and may be considered when all other factors have been considered and there is still uncertainty regarding optimal treatment. In a young athlete with no dynamic elbow instability and minimal true displacement, our data suggest that there is a good chance of a successful outcome with nonoperative treatment. If the patient has sustained a higher energy trauma or if any elbow laxity or instability is noted, that child has a good chance of successful treatment with operative treatment.</p>
<p>This study is not without limitations. Because of unreliable contact information and missing clinical documentation, our study population was 20 patients, which placed constraints on our ability to detect differences between cohorts and was underpowered to assess equivalence. Additionally, telephone and written surveys were used to evaluate patients remotely. Therefore, clinical data such as objective range of motion measurement, physician assessment of deformity, and up-to-date radiographs were not available, prohibiting us from commenting in detail on these outcomes. However, a key focus of our study was to obtain the patient’s perspective regarding his or her follow-up and return to sports. Although the DASH has not been technically validated in children, it has been validated in patient populations down to 18 years of age,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0363546513480797">35</xref></sup> and the average age in our cohort was 15 to 16 years old. In addition, while there are certainly other patient-based outcome measures, and some that are more sports specific, as noted in a recent review of outcome measures for elbow disorders, only the DASH does not require a physician component, thereby making it the most appropriate questionnaire for this study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0363546513480797">35</xref></sup> Similarly, the “satisfaction” scale utilized in this study is not validated for this population but does reflect the opinion of the child. Finally, the retrospective nonrandomized method of treatment allocation prevents a definitive statement as to whether one treatment is superior to another, as different indications were used for each.</p>
<p>Nonoperative management of pediatric medial epicondyle fractures may be appropriate in young athletes with a stable elbow, a low-energy or isolated avulsion injury, and minimal fracture displacement. We found this to be true even in overhead athletes. Surgical intervention yielded excellent results in patients with an associated dislocation or those who had sustained trauma of greater energy than a simple avulsion. Accordingly, we believe that acknowledgment of the injury mechanism and careful assessment of elbow laxity and stability, as well as patient counseling and family discussion, are paramount for the decision-making process for young athletes. While a prospective trial would better elucidate the benefits and disadvantages of operative versus nonoperative management, our data suggest that both treatments can be successful in the appropriately selected young athlete.</p>
