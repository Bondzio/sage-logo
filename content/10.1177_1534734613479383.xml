<abstract>
<p>Over the past several years, there has been a rise in incidence of tuberculosis in both developing and developed countries. Tuberculosis complicating a fracture is uncommon. In this article, we report the case of a 10-year-old patient with a proximal tibia fracture who developed discharging wound over the fracture site after 2 weeks of initial trauma. The fracture was showing no signs of healing. A diagnosis of tuberculosis of proximal tibia was made on the basis of polymerase chain reaction and histology. After antituberculous treatment was started, the sinus healed and the fracture united. To the best of our knowledge, such a presentation has not been documented.</p>

<p>The incidence of tuberculosis (TB) has been rising over the past several years. However, infection due to <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> following fracture in an otherwise healthy immunocompetent patient is extremely rare. We report the case of a patient in whom proximal tibia fracture was complicated by TB. This is the first ever report of tuberculosis complicating a closed fracture on a search of the English language medical literature(<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed</ext-link>, accessed on 4th august 2012). Treatment with cast and adequate medical therapy led to full recovery. We highlight this uncommon presentation of TB.</p>

<title>Case Report</title>
<p>A 10-year-old boy was referred to us with inability to bear weight on his right leg and wound over proximal tibia. He had sustained a closed proximal tibia fracture of left leg following a road traffic accident 1 month ago. At that time he was treated conservatively with cast and analgesics. After a duration of 15 days, the patient noted soakage of cast over the fracture site along with progressive worsening of pain. He was then taken to the treating physician, who opened the cast and noticed a 1-cm wound over lateral aspect of proximal tibia with purulent discharge. Above knee cast was reapplied and window was made through the cast over the wound for dressing. The patient was prescribed antibiotics and daily dressing was done through the window. No bacteriological culture of the discharge was taken. He continued to suffer from pain over the fracture site, and the wound showed no sign of healing. The patient then presented to us approximately 1 month after the initial trauma. A radiograph taken at this stage revealed that the fracture had not united and local osteopenia around the fracture site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1534734613479383">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>Physical examination revealed wound over the lateral aspect of proximal tibia measuring 2 cm × 0.5 cm with seropurulent discharge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1534734613479383">Figure 2</xref>). Blood investigations revealed a hemoglobin level of 10.2 g/dL, total leukocyte count of 7500/uL, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 36 mm in the first hour (Westergen). Bacteriological cultures, AFB (acid fact bacilli) stain, and marginal biopsy were taken. The cultures demonstrated growth of <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>. Polymerase chain reaction testing of the discharge was positive for <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>. AFB stain was positive, and biopsy revealed tuberculoid and histiocytic granulomas. Based on this, a diagnosis of TB complicating proximal tibia fracture was made. The patient was started on anti-TB drugs and the cast was continued. Chest radiograph done showed calcified nodules. Discharge from the sinus resolved, and the sinus healed within 4 weeks of starting ATT (antituberculous treatment). Radiological union was seen after 4 months. He was last reviewed at 12 months postinjury; examination revealed complete resolution of the infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1534734613479383">Figure 3</xref>). A careful review of his past medical history revealed that he had pulmonary Kochs at the age of 6 years for which a complete course of ATT was taken.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Increasing incidence of osteoarticular TB has recently been reported in developing and developed countries. Tubercle bacilli have a tendency to remain dormant in remote parts of the body following initial dissemination from the primary complex. In fact, in 90% of immunocompetent people there are no clinical manifestations, but the infection remains for many years, probably for life.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1534734613479383">1</xref></sup> The individual who has such an infection may have development of clinical disease at any time later, depending on his or her immune status.</p>
<p>Weight-bearing joints and bones are frequently involved in osteoarticular TB due to the effect of trauma.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1534734613479383">2</xref></sup> Tubercular bacteria can involve any joints/bones by hematogenous spread from activation of a latent distant focus or local reactivation of dormant bacteria in a previously exposed individual. Major trauma can cause lowering of both humoral and cellular immunity in its initial stages.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1534734613479383">3</xref></sup> Under such circumstances, reactivation of a mycobacterium can occur at a latent site, such as the lung, kidney, or mesenteric lymph nodes, resulting in subsequent of the injury site. Local reactivation can be precipitated by trauma or surgery and has been described as occurring as long as 42 years after the initial surgery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1534734613479383">4</xref></sup> As TB developed at the site of injury, it seems reasonable to assume that trauma led to the reactivation of latent bacteria at a distant focus, with subsequent seeding at the fracture site. The primary tubercular focus in our case is pulmonary Kochs as the chest radiograph showed calcified pulmonary foci. Metaphyseal TB is uncommon. In this respect, the site is similar to that seen in acute hematogenous (pyogenic) osteomyelitis in which trauma is acknowledged to play a part in the localization of the osteitis. The patient sustained major fracture as opposed to the usual relatively minor injury associated with acute hematogenous osteomyelitis.</p>
<p>In our patient, isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide were given for the initial 2 months, followed by isoniazid and rifampicin for 4 months. The apparent rarity of TB complicating closed fractures, even in countries where pulmonary TB is common, leads one to suppose that the occurrence, reported here, was coincidental. However, the localization of the infection at the site of fracture is significant. It may be that trauma plays a much more important role than has previously been accepted in establishing the site of a skeletal tuberculous lesion. With the increasing prevalence of TB in our region, it is important to increase clinical awareness to ensure early detection and avoid diagnostic delay.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1534734613479383">5</xref></sup> As illustrated in this case, had it not been for the clinical suspicion of TB, this patient’s diagnosis would have been further delayed. TB should be kept in mind as a possible cause of deep infection, especially in immunocompetent patients, in zones endemic for TB, and particularly in tuberculin test-positive individuals.</p>
