<p>Why does a question about what might be a kitchen fixture appear in this journal on solid waste management and research? Well, there is a great deal in common between sinks in relation to managing both unwanted materials such as vegetable peels and hazardous industrial wastes. In the kitchen sink, we discharge water and organic materials to the sewer and in most cases successfully avoid being confronted with it again. In solid waste management, sinks are necessary for the permanent or at least long-term deposit of unwanted and hazardous non-recyclables hoping never to see the waste again and happily avoiding adverse effects on the environment.</p>
<p>But that is where the analogy between the two sinks falls apart. In the kitchen the worst overload case may result in poor drainage and bad smells which do not present a disaster. The solid waste sink case may turn out to be much worse if the sink for disposal is overloaded or not properly designed, operated, and maintained, enabling the deposited unwanted and/or hazardous compounds to escape at a rate or to a degree that causes adverse environmental impacts.</p>
<p>A proper sink for waste materials may be defined as a facility or process that ensures that an input is stored or sequestered safely and that any outputs to the environment are released at a slow enough rate that they do not harm any facet of the receiving environment such as a lake, the sea, groundwater, soils and sediments, or the atmosphere. This implies that an improper sink is a facility which leaks the stored hazardous material and elements at higher concentrations or quantities than can be safely accepted in the environment. It also demonstrates that many sinks are in fact suitable only for intermediate holding and are not ‘final sinks’ which are able to hold substances for geological time frames.</p>
<p>There are few perfect final sinks in the world. The best researched sinks are probably those selected and designed for safe disposal of nuclear waste. The better ones seem to be salt mines, caverns in very old geologic formations, old and deep mine shafts, and sometimes even the deep seabed.</p>
<p>Most other sinks such as sanitary landfills for municipal solid waste and impoundments for ash and slag can only be regarded as temporary sinks. However, if they are well constructed, not overloaded, and if proper emission controls are in place, these temporary sinks can be effective until the leaching and gas emissions naturally subside over many years while never exceeding acceptable emission limits. Geological processes such as erosion and sedimentation ensure that within 10 000 to 100 000 years, the ‘landfill’ sinks are either removed or covered by sedimentary material, just like any natural phenomenon. Nevertheless, the aftercare required for many of these landfills over the next few hundred years constitutes an unresolved issue in terms of inter-generational equity and liabilities. Thus, the development of appropriate long-term management strategies represents one of the great challenges for sanitary landfilling.</p>
<p>Improper sinks are plentiful: open dumps, haphazardly buried hazardous wastes discharged to waterways, unlined and/or overloaded landfills, superficially abandoned mines, and discharges to the seas, rivers, lakes, and many more. History is far too full of examples of harmful disposal of wastes in less than adequate sinks. Indeed, more than a century of improper disposal starting from the industrial revolution ultimately led to the establishment in the twentieth century of modern environmental protection regulations and substantially improved engineering solutions … and those of us in this field are still developing improved (even if not perfect) sinks.</p>
<p>There are more subtle sinks, for example, where hazardous compounds and waste are incorporated into unobtrusive building materials. Construction materials such as cement, concrete and ceramics are well known to be able to take up and hide considerable amounts of waste. Up to 30% dry weight of waste is reported as being successfully mixed in, without unduly hampering the short-term properties of the construction material. In recent years <italic>Waste Management &amp; Research</italic> has received an increasing number of manuscripts advocating various integrations of hazardous materials with materials meant to be a ‘permanent’ part of the built environment. Proponents of mixing wastes with construction materials generally argue that any moderate decrease in mechanical properties is tolerable given the benefits to be attained, and that the measured leaching of hazardous substances from such construction materials is less than that allowed by national standards. Of course, there are weak points in the use of the subtle sinks as there is little evidence that short-term tests for mechanical strength and leaching will hold true over the long term. If the sometimes unfounded claims by some waste managers and manufacturers of the building materials admixed with wastes prove untrue, the risks are high that structures may lose their mechanical strength over time causing damage or collapses. Furthermore, long-term exposure to atmosphere, rain and changing chemical conditions may cause extensive weathering of less resistant materials, perhaps releasing some of the entrained hazardous substances in higher than acceptable quantities and/or concentrations.</p>
<p>Eventually there is the more philosophical question: is it acceptable to ‘hide’ unwanted (waste) and hazardous substances in materials meant for long-term use such as in buildings, roads, and other so-called permanent structures? Cement and concrete are good examples of sinks used for a multitude of hazardous, toxic or difficult-to-treat wastes. The objective might be achieved via incineration of nearly all sorts of waste in cement kilns and firing of ceramic materials mixed with waste, and industries preparing concrete that contains waste materials. Some of these processes are well suited as sinks for organic materials because they mineralize carbon-containing substances completely. Unfortunately, inorganic materials cannot be ‘removed’ in the same way as organics, and they may accumulate.</p>
<p>Inevitably constructions will end their useful life after decades of service and become demolition waste. (Virtually all types of structures have economic and/or useful lives of 40 to 100 years. In the big picture of waste management, this cannot be considered ‘permanent’.) The recycling of building materials and road surfaces is bound to increase in all societies due to the growth in end-of-life stock, increasing shortages of virgin raw materials, and lack of space for suitable waste disposal facilities. This means that the embedded (hidden) hazardous materials will be re-introduced into new building materials within two to three generations, probably with insufficient information as to the content of that material. In the theoretical scenario where all building materials are recycled and ‘suitable’ hazardous waste is hidden in concrete, asphalt and ceramics, the buildings and roads themselves might, in the not-so-distant future, be regarded as hazardous waste to be handled with care.</p>
<p>It should be noted that the global cement industry cooperates well with coal-fired power plants by mixing large quantities of coal ash, itself a cementitious material, with virgin materials in cement kilns. Coal ash usually contains no more potentially hazardous chemicals than does cement made from virgin raw materials. Thus this sink for coal ash works well and the system is converting waste (coal ash) into a useful raw material.</p>
<p>How can responsible waste managers counteract the long-term risk of contaminating our environment, especially the built environment? The motives for selecting the improper or subtle sinks as a disposal route may be numerous, but often the reasons are the lower expenses incurred in comparison with the use of safer disposal routes and sinks.</p>
<p>A good illustration is the manager of an industrial plant which produces hazardous waste, who knows the volumes of waste materials generated and the concentration of toxic components in that waste. The manufacturer who receives the hazardous waste as a raw material may spot a potential income from ridding the producer of the waste. Both parties may not be aware of the potential harmful consequence of their decisions. If sustainability (long-term environmental protection!) is a waste management goal, it is necessary to assess the impact of such practices by objective and reproducible methods which address a long-term horizon of several consumption cycles. A mere analysis based on standard leaching tests is not enough.</p>
<p>Thus, the editors of <italic>Waste Management &amp; Research</italic> look forward to receiving papers that focus on the sink issue. There are plenty of basic questions to be addressed: What are the basic definitions of sinks and final sinks, and when is the use of sinks environmentally acceptable? What are effective methods to evaluate the long-term fate of hazardous substances in sinks? What are the volumetric capacities of various sinks – in particular those associated with construction materials – to safely accommodate hazardous materials? How can this capacity be increased by technical means focusing on the sinks as well as on the transformation of waste and the hazardous substances? Finally, the ultimate question: are new sink restrictions visible on the horizon, constraints similar to the limits of greenhouse gas emissions which make it necessary to decrease the use of certain resources?</p>
