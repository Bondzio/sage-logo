<abstract>
<p>This paper is an experimental investigation on the tonal structure and phonetic signaling of declarative questions by speakers of Manchego Peninsular Spanish, a dialect of Spanish for which little experimental research on intonation is currently available. Analysis 1 examines the scaling and timing properties of final rises produced by 16 speakers under various pressures of tonal crowding. The quantitative results provide evidence for two contrasting nuclear pitch accent specifications: L* vs. H*. These data are consistent with the findings and analyses of final rises in Dutch, although certain time pressure effects had not been reported in this previous body of research. Analysis 2 provides a phonetic comparison of the two question contours uncovered in Analysis 1 with those of lexically and syntactically identical declarative statements. The findings indicate that speakers differentiate the two question contours from corresponding statement contours in dissimilar fashion and that for the L*H% contour, the terminal rise may be the only F0 signal of its question intent. Some speculation on the possible causes of this variation is offered in conclusion.</p>

<title>1 Introduction</title>
<p>This paper has two goals. The first goal is to demonstrate via experimental means that the apparent continuum of utterance-final F0 turning points in Manchego Peninsular Spanish declarative questions corresponds to two distinct tonal target specifications, and that this difference is motivated by contrasting nuclear pitch accent configurations: L* vs. H*.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0023830911434126">1</xref></sup>,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0023830911434126">2</xref></sup> The proposed nuclear pitch accent contrast is shown to hold under pressures of internal tonal clash and final tonal clash, but in seemingly disparate ways. The ability for tonal contrasts to hold in such tonal pressure conditions helps to support the notion of sparse tonal specification (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0023830911434126">Arvaniti &amp; Ladd, 2009</xref>) as fundamental for understanding the linguistic expression of underlying tonal melodies. The analysis also adds to the growing body of cross-linguistic literature on variability in utterance-final rise alignment (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0023830911434126">Warren, 2005b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0023830911434126">Warren &amp; Daly, 2000</xref>), although most noteworthy is that final rise variability in Manchego Peninsular Spanish is motivated by differences in specification at the phonological level of analysis.</p>
<p>The second goal of this paper is somewhat broader in scope: to expand on recent experimental research documenting the phonetic correlates of the question vs. statement functional contrast. In doing so, it seeks to determine whether the question–statement contrast is signaled in different ways for the two declarative question contours reported here. Given that declarative questions are constrained to prosodic means to communicate their question intent, it is expected that these prosodic (i.e., intonational) means will be exploited to the maximum in the contrastive analysis conducted here. Although it is traditionally assumed that questions are differentiated from statements by a higher pitch level in the former (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0023830911434126">Bolinger, 1964</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0023830911434126">1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0023830911434126">Herman, 1942</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0023830911434126">Ohala, 1984</xref>), the exact surface manifestation of this higher pitch varies across languages and from one question type to the next (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0023830911434126">Haan, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0023830911434126">van Heuven &amp; Haan, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0023830911434126">2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0023830911434126">van Heuven &amp; van Zanten, 2005</xref>). In Analysis 2, we further investigate the question–statement contrast by comparing the phonetic details of two declarative question contours to those of lexically and syntactically identical statements. The results show that, in terms of F0 scaling, early rise contours (H*¡H%) are differentiated from statement contours on two parameters and that late rise contours (L*H%) are differentiated from statement contours on one phonetic parameter. Given these incongruent results, it is argued that communicative and situational factors must be taken into account when determining how questions are signaled in opposition to statements.</p>

<title>2 Analysis 1 – Early and late rises in Manchego Peninsular Spanish declarative question intonation</title>
<sec id="section3-0023830911434126">
<title>2.1 Background</title>
<p>Research on question signaling indicates that declarative questions are typically marked by a higher pitch level than lexically identical statements, although the exact surface manifestation of the pitch difference varies cross-linguistically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0023830911434126">Haan, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0023830911434126">van Heuven &amp; Haan, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0023830911434126">van Heuven &amp; van Zanten, 2005</xref>). It is also well known that the final boundary rise is the most recurrent prosodic characteristic used to communicate question intent for declarative questions. Importantly, the alignment of the boundary rise has been shown to exhibit a great deal of cross-linguistic variation and also within the same language, motivated by discourse-level, structural, and even sociolinguistic or pragmatic factors. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0023830911434126">Britain and Newman (1992)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0023830911434126">Warren and Daly (2000)</xref> report that final rises in intonation-only questions in New Zealand English may begin as early as the onset of the nuclear (i.e., utterance-final stressed) syllable or as late as the onset of posttonic material. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0023830911434126">Britain (1992)</xref> also noted that pragmatic and/or group membership factors may contribute to variability in alignment of the utterance-final rise. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0023830911434126">Warren (2005b)</xref> and Warren and Daly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0023830911434126">2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0023830911434126">2005</xref>) show that speaker age and sex in addition to structural factors such as stress position also contribute to variable final rise alignment in questions. Warren in particular noted that it may be too restrictive to characterize the utterance-final rise as a steadily rising movement from the nuclear syllable. Psycholinguistic research has demonstrated further the effect of social variables such as speaker age on the perception of final rises in questions and statements in New Zealand English (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0023830911434126">Zwartz &amp; Warren, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>In Analysis 1 we examine the structure of final rises in declarative questions produced by speakers of Manchego Peninsular Spanish. Declarative questions are a unique type of question in that they are lexically and syntactically identical to their declarative statement counterpart. Whereas wh-questions, for example, are marked by lexical (and sometimes syntactic) means in addition to prosody to communicate question intent, the only way to communicate a declarative question is through intonation. In Spanish, the most common tonal configuration for declarative questions consists of a prenuclear rise followed by nuclear valley and an utterance-final rising gesture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0023830911434126">Face, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0023830911434126">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0023830911434126">Navarro Tomás, 1944</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0023830911434126">Prieto, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0023830911434126">Quilis, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0023830911434126">Sosa, 1999</xref>) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0023830911434126">Figure 1a</xref>). The general consensus from this line of research is that the final rise typically occurs at the onset of posttonic material. Recent work by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0023830911434126">Willis (2004)</xref> on Dominican Spanish, however, shows that the start of the boundary rise may occur within the bounds of the nuclear stressed syllable and that this earlier rise may be accompanied by higher F0 scaling (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0023830911434126">Figure 1b</xref>). The boundary rise is generally assumed to reflect a H% specification, due in great part to its late (i.e., posttonic) alignment, but the data reported in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0023830911434126">Willis (2004)</xref> would call this claim into question. What remains to be seen is whether final rise alignments in Spanish may be different because they are phonetic implementations of different tonal targets or because phonetic implementation rules operate on the same phonological representation in different conditions.</p>

<p>Other melodic patterns have been reported in the literature. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0023830911434126">Alvord (2006)</xref>, for example, reported on two declarative question F0 contours produced by speakers of Miami Cuban Spanish. The most common pattern contained an utterance-final rise, similar to the contour reported in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0023830911434126">Face (2004)</xref>; the second pattern contained an utterance-final fall, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0023830911434126">Figure 1c</xref>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0023830911434126">Simonet (2008)</xref> also reported on two declarative question contours for bilingual speakers of Majorcan Spanish: a postnuclear final rising contour; and a contour comprised of a falling nuclear gesture, as in Catalan (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0023830911434126">Figure 1d</xref>). Utterance-final falling contours have been documented for speakers of Canary Island Spanish as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0023830911434126">Dorta Luis, Hernández Díaz, &amp; Díaz Cabrera, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0023830911434126">2009</xref>). Given this cross- dialectal variability, a series of pilot studies was conducted on speakers of Manchego Peninsular Spanish. The preliminary results indicated much variability in terms of the F0 contours used to ask questions and also that many of the contours used by speakers did not seem to conform to standard accounts of Peninsular Spanish intonation (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0023830911434126">Estebas-Vilaplana &amp; Prieto, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0023830911434126">Face, 2002a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0023830911434126">2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0023830911434126">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0023830911434126">Prieto, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0023830911434126">Quilis, 1993</xref>). The pilot data on Manchego Spanish, then, in addition to the research on intonational variation throughout the Spanish-speaking world (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0023830911434126">Prieto &amp; Roseano, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0023830911434126">Sosa, 1999</xref>), provide sufficient motivation for a more detailed investigation of the intonational system of this little known language variety.</p>
<p>In Analysis 1 of this paper we examine a corpus of 795 declarative question contours, which on initial inspection do not demonstrate consistent final rise alignment. Given such variable alignment, a question that immediately arises is whether the phonetic continuum of rises reflects variation of one utterance-final rise target or if it corresponds to multiple tonal configurations. In order to determine the nature of these rises from the perspective of the autosegmental-metrical (AM) approach to intonational phonology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0023830911434126">Beckman &amp; Pierrehumbert, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0023830911434126">Goldsmith, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0023830911434126">Ladd, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0023830911434126">Pierrehumbert, 1980</xref>), we adhere to the notion of <italic>sparse tonal specification</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0023830911434126">Arvaniti &amp; Ladd, 2009</xref>) as fundamental for understanding the linguistic expression of underlying tonal melodies. A common assumption in intonational research, the notion of sparse tonal specification stipulates that the factors that determine F0 may involve nothing more than interpolation from an earlier pitch target to a later one (see especially <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0023830911434126">Bruce, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0023830911434126">Pierrehumbert &amp; Beckman, 1988</xref>). Given that AM treats utterance melodies as strings of tonal events, not all syllables are required to bear tonal specifications. An advantage is that this makes possible the description of contours on long and short utterances as phonologically identical while still allowing us to model the phonetic details that result from the difference in utterance length. As will be seen in the next sections, these theoretical underpinnings were crucial for determining the phonological makeup of utterance-final rises in the Manchego corpus.</p>

<title>2.2 Procedure</title>
<sec id="section5-0023830911434126">
<title>2.2.1 Speech materials</title>
<p>The acoustic analysis was based on speech data produced in a sentence reading task designed to elicit a total of 162 test sentences via computer-based prompts. The design of the test sentences was based on 24 unique lexical combinations that contained two content words each. These lexical combinations were manipulated according to two parameters: the number of unstressed syllables between the first and second stressed syllables (i.e., interstress interval), which was 0, 1, 2, or 3; and the distance of the last stressed syllable from the end of the utterance, which was 0, 1, or 2. To exemplify, the lexical combination <italic>No</italic><bold><italic>mi</italic></bold><italic>na mi mo</italic><bold><italic>nó</italic></bold><italic>logo</italic> ‘S/he nominates my monologue’ has an interstress interval of 3 and a distance to end of utterance of 2. The full set of lexical combinations is given in <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0023830911434126">Appendix A</xref>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0023830911434126">3</xref></sup> Example sentences are provided below according to three important prosodic groupings: internal clash; final clash; and non-clash.</p>
<list id="list1-0023830911434126" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p><bold>Internal clash:</bold> No unstressed syllable intervenes between the prenuclear and nuclear stressed syllables, for example, <italic>Do</italic><bold><italic>nó mi</italic></bold><italic>na</italic> ‘S/he donated lead.’</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><bold>Final clash:</bold> No unstressed syllable follows the nuclear stressed syllable, for example, <italic>Do</italic><bold><italic>nó</italic></bold> <italic>ma</italic><bold><italic>ná</italic></bold> ‘S/he donated manna.’</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><bold>Non-clash:</bold> At least one unstressed syllable follows the prenuclear stressed syllable and also the nuclear stressed syllable, for example, <italic>Do</italic><bold><italic>nó</italic></bold> <italic>mi</italic> <bold><italic>nó</italic></bold><italic>mina</italic> ‘S/he donated my wages.’</p></list-item></list>
<p>Each lexical combination was used to create two target sentence types (declarative question and declarative statement), and each target sentence was uttered twice, resulting in 96 test sentences per speaker (i.e., 24 lexical combinations × 2 sentence types × 2 repetitions). Additionally, sentences created for the (2;1) context were included two extra times per sentence type to meet protocol demands of a parallel research study.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0023830911434126">4</xref></sup> This resulted in 8 additional sentences, for a total of 104 test sentences read by each speaker. Distracter sentences were also included (<italic>n</italic> = 58), and these were imperatives or wh-questions, for a total of 162 sentences in the reading task. All target utterances adhered to verb-object word order, target syllables contained CV syllable structure, and target consonants were primarily sonorants or approximants.</p>
<p>A discourse context was created for each test sentence, and these were embedded into a Microsoft PowerPoint presentation, one discourse context and test sentence per slide. Speakers read the discourse context after the first click per slide. After the second click, speakers saw the test sentence embedded in quotation marks. For the current study, test sentences were one of two pragmatic intents: declarative statement or declarative question (see (1)). Speakers were instructed to read the discourse context in silence, but to read aloud the sentence embedded in quotes. In all cases, the discourse context was neutral (i.e., non-focal).</p>

<p>Participants were recorded in a quiet room by the researcher in the native dialect area. The total recording time per speaker was between 16 and 20 minutes. In Analysis 1 we focus on the data analysis protocol for declarative questions only. The protocol implemented for statements is given in Analysis 2.</p>

<title>2.2.2 Speakers and recording procedures</title>
<p>Eight male and eight female speakers of Manchego Peninsular Spanish were recruited for participation in this study. Their ages were between 18 and 35, and the average age was 26. All were born and raised in the town of Socuéllamos, located in the Ciudad Real province of Castile-La Mancha, Spain (hence the <italic>gentilicium</italic> ‘Manchego’). All subjects reported that their mother and father were natives of Socuéllamos, and that the native language for both in all cases was the variety of Spanish spoken in Socuéllamos. All participants had also enrolled in (or were concurrently enrolled in) post-secondary education in Spain. Some foreign language proficiency is required for post-secondary enrollment in Spain, so no participant was truly ‘monolingual’. Subjects having lived more than 6 months abroad were not asked to participate in this study. The speech data were recorded using a SONY HI-MD MZ-RH1 minidisc recorder and a Shure WH20 head-mounted microphone.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0023830911434126">
<title>2.2.3 Analysis procedures</title>
<p>Duration and F0 measurements were obtained for the target productions using the computer software Praat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0023830911434126">Boersma &amp; Weenink, 2009</xref>). Speaker productions were manually segmented and labeled by simultaneous inspection of waveforms and wide-band spectrograms following standard segmentation criteria (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0023830911434126">Peterson &amp; Lehiste, 1960</xref>). F0 points presumed to represent tonal targets were also located manually. A L(ow) point was defined as an ‘elbow’ where a low level stretch turned into a clear rise. A H(igh) point was the highest F0 value of a peak from rise-fall gesture. Frequency values were extracted in Hertz and then converted to the Equivalent Rectangular Bandwidth (ERB) scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0023830911434126">Glasberg &amp; Moore, 1990</xref>) before being used for statistical analysis. The conversion formula was ERB = 21.4 * log10(X * 0.00437 + 1). As has been argued elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0023830911434126">Arvaniti &amp; Ladd, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0023830911434126">Arvaniti, Ladd, &amp; Mennen, 2006b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0023830911434126">Simonet, 2008</xref>), the ERB scale gives a better approximation of the perceptual distance between F0 levels (i.e., measures of F0 magnitude) and allows more easily for the comparison of male and female data.</p>
<p>Tokens were discarded if they contained disfluencies, hesitation pauses, or for reasons to be detailed in the following section. The researcher also discarded utterances with long stretches of creaky voice which, as the F0 display showed, made it impossible to extract reliable measurements of turning points that were critical for the acoustic analysis. F0 and timing data were calculated using a series of Praat scripts. These data were transferred into Microsoft Excel, where F0 data were hand-checked.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0023830911434126">5</xref></sup> In total, 37 productions were discarded from the original corpus of 832 declarative questions, leaving 795 question utterances submitted to acoustic analysis.</p>

<p>In general, L and H turning points were defined as the F0 minimum and maximum in the relevant section of the contour, ignoring (as far as possible) any nasal-induced perturbations and obviously spurious values due to irregular voicing. L1 was taken to be the point at which the low level stretch turned into a clear rise; it was typically realized at or near the onset of the prenuclear syllable. H1 was the first High point, defined as the peak of the prenuclear rise. L2 was the second low point, or the turning point of the utterance-final rise, which is the principal focus in Analysis 1 of this paper. It should be borne in mind that ‘L2’ was a descriptive label to identify the last turning point of the utterance and did not necessarily imply that this turning point represented a tonal Low target.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0023830911434126">6</xref></sup> F0 data were extracted for all points, and alignment data were extracted for presumed pitch accent points (i.e., L1, H1, and L2). Finally, IT (initial tonal value) and FT (final tonal value) were defined as the lowest and highest non-spurious F0 points at the onset and the offset of the utterance, respectively. F0 data were extracted for these two points.</p>
<p>In order to provide an objective measure of the timing differences for the two rise types, a relative rise start score was obtained for each final rise token by dividing the temporal distance of the L2 rise start from the beginning of the nuclear stressed syllable (i.e., L2 – C1) by the total syllable duration (i.e., C2 <italic>–</italic> C1) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0023830911434126">Figures 4a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0023830911434126">4b</xref>). A rise start aligned exactly at the stressed syllable onset would receive a score of ‘0’, and a rise start aligned exactly at the stressed syllable offset would receive a score of ‘100’. For the distributional analysis, final rise tokens were organized according to prosodic manipulation context: internal clash; final clash; and non-clash.</p>

<p>As a check on the reliability of the measurement procedures, three turning points were remeasured four months after the initial tagging procedure had been conducted. The relative alignments for the L1, H1, and L2 points of the late rise contour were remeasured for 75 productions, or 20% of the late rise corpus.

<title>2.3.1 Distributional analysis</title>
<p>A number of acoustic measurements were taken to provide an objective measure of the timing and scaling differences for the two rise types. The data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0023830911434126">Figure 5</xref> present a distributional analysis of the relative rise start scores for all speakers in non-clash contexts. Final clash contexts are excluded there, since the lack of posttonic syllabic material creates a potential for neutralization of the early vs. late rise difference. Internal clash contexts are excluded as well, for reasons to be seen later. Recall that rise type scores were relative to the nuclear stressed syllable. As can be seen, six speakers (6F, 7F, 8F, 6M, 7M, 8M) produced final rises that typically began before the 40% point of the nuclear syllable. Their rises typically began within the first third of that syllable and in some cases began before the syllable onset. The remaining ten speakers, however, produced rises that typically began within the second half of the nuclear stressed syllable. For most speakers, the median rise start was between 90% and 100%, although the median score for two speakers (3M and 5M) was approximately 50% and their score ranges overlapped somewhat with those of the early rise speakers. We will address the productions of speakers 3M and 5M in greater detail later upon providing additional evidence on labeling them as ‘late rise’ speakers.</p>

<p>The second acoustic measurement was the magnitude of tonal descent in ERB from the H1 prenuclear peak to the start of the L2 utterance-final rise (i.e., L2 – H1). The boxplot data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0023830911434126">Figure 6</xref> present a distributional analysis of these results for all speakers in non-clash contexts. The same two speaker groups can be inferred on the basis of these data as for the L2 alignment data. Speakers 6F, 7F, 8F, 6M, 7M, and 8M typically began the final rise at the same level of the previous peak, as indicated by ranges that were typically between -0.5 and 0 ERB. The remaining ten speakers, however, had considerably larger fall magnitudes, between -2.5 and -0.5 ERB.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0023830911434126">9</xref></sup></p>

Each set of data was then submitted to further statistical analysis in which early rise productions were compared to late rise productions. In order to ensure direct comparability of L2 alignment scores, extreme outliers in the positive direction for early rise speakers and extreme outliers in the negative direction for late rise speakers were discarded.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0023830911434126">10</xref></sup> Based on these criteria, a total of nine productions were discarded.</p>

<title>2.3.2 Temporal alignment and F0 in non-clash and final clash contexts</title>
<p>Given the informal analysis provided above, this section provides a contrastive analysis of all boundary and pitch points for the two speaker groups to determine what other phonetic and/or phonological contrasts exist, if any, between the ‘early rise’ and ‘late rise’ declarative question contours. The boundary and tonal points were: IT (initial tonal value); L1 (first Low point); H1 (first High point); L2 (second low point, or utterance-final rise turning point); and FT (final tonal value). F0 data were extracted in ERB for all points, and alignment data were extracted for pitch accent points (i.e., L1, H1, and L2).</p>
<p>In terms of statistical analysis, a three-way (2 × 3 × 3) fully factorial Multivariate Analysis of Variance (MANOVA) was conducted with <sc>speakergroup</sc> as a between-subjects factor and <sc>interstressinterval (isi)</sc> and <sc>distancetoutteranceend (dte)</sc> as within-subjects factors in addition to <sc>speakergroup-by-isi</sc> and <sc>speakergroup-by-dte</sc> as interaction contrasts. There were two levels of <sc>speakergroup</sc> (early risers vs. late risers), three levels of <sc>isi</sc> (1, 2, or 3 unstressed syllables), and three levels of <sc>dte</sc> (0, 1, or 2 unstressed syllables).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0023830911434126">11</xref></sup> The dependent variables were IT, L1, H1, L2, and FT scaling, and L1, H1, and L2 alignment. In the MANOVA, omnibus tests found overall effects for <sc>speakergroup</sc> (Wilks’ Lambda = .186, <italic>F</italic> = 315.08, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), <sc>isi</sc> (Wilks’ Lambda = .548, <italic>F</italic> = 25.23, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), <sc>dte</sc> (Wilks’ Lambda = .674, <italic>F</italic> = 15.72, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), and the <sc>speakergroup-by-dte</sc> interaction contrast (Wilks’ Lambda = .838, <italic>F</italic> = 6.65, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). No effect was found for the <sc>speakergroup-by-isi</sc> interaction contrast (Wilks’ Lambda = .968, <italic>F</italic> = 1.18, <italic>p</italic> = .27), so results for this factor will not be reported in the following sections.

<p>We begin by examining the scaling of IT and the L1 turning point in addition to the alignment of L1. If the early rise vs. late rise contrast is localized on the nuclear stressed syllable, it is reasonable to think that both speaker groups will behave identically on these three variables, since they reference utterance-level units not typically affected by nuclear F0 gestures.

<p>Early rise contours began slightly higher than late rise contours and realized the L1 slightly higher as well. Alignment of L1 for the early rise was also somewhat earlier. An ANOVA showed no significant effect for <sc>speakergroup</sc> on any of these variables: scaling of IT, <italic>F</italic>(1, 607) = .125, <italic>p</italic> = .460; scaling of L1, <italic>F</italic>(1, 607) = 1.282, <italic>p</italic> = .243; or alignment of L1, <italic>F</italic>(1, 607) = 1.509, <italic>p</italic> = .141.

<title>2.3.2.2 Statistical analysis of alignment and F0 scaling of H1</title>
<p>Next, we investigate the scaling and alignment of H1 (i.e., prenuclear peak) relative to the offset of the prenuclear stressed syllable. It will be recalled that the number of unstressed syllables between the prenuclear stressed syllable and the nuclear stressed syllable was manipulated to create four conditions, although cases of internal clash will be reported separately at a later point in this paper. If the duration and height of the prenuclear rise are conceived as invariant, it is reasonable to hypothesize that they will not be affected by <sc>isi</sc>. However, an alternative hypothesis is that <sc>isi</sc>, allowing for more time during which to realize the full potential of the prenuclear peak (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0023830911434126">Elordieta, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0023830911434126">Elordieta &amp; Calleja, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0023830911434126">Face, 2002a</xref>), will affect its duration and scaling as the number of unstressed syllables increases (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0023830911434126">Arvaniti et al., 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0023830911434126">2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0023830911434126">2006a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0023830911434126">2006b</xref>).

<p>Results of the ANOVA indicate an overall effect for <sc>isi</sc> on alignment, <italic>F</italic>(2, 607) = 144.81, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, but not on scaling, <italic>F</italic>(2, 607) = 2.855, <italic>p</italic> = .075. H1 mean alignment was at the midpoint of the first posttonic syllable when one unstressed syllable intervened, within the second half of the same syllable when two unstressed syllables intervened, and within the bounds of the second posttonic syllable when three syllables intervened. Follow-up post hoc tests were performed for the <sc>isi</sc> main effect, and it was shown that all levels of <sc>isi</sc> were different from one another (1 vs. 2: <italic>t</italic> = 7.65, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001; 1 vs. 3: <italic>t</italic> = 19.40, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001; and 2 vs. 3: <italic>t</italic> = 12.48, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), suggesting that maximum potential of H1 alignment is not realized until three unstressed syllables intervene between the prenuclear and nuclear syllables.

<p>H1 for early rises had higher scaling and aligned later into the first posttonic syllable. The ANOVA showed no significant effect for <sc>speakergroup</sc> on these measures: scaling of H1, <italic>F</italic>(1, 607) = 1.383, <italic>p</italic> = .252; alignment of H1, <italic>F</italic>(1, 607) = .105, <italic>p</italic> = .901. These findings indicate that the phonetic properties of the early vs. late rise contrast do not assimilate regressively to the previous peak. The somewhat later alignment for the early rise speakers may be due to the fact that H1 was more difficult to label in this contour, since there was no clear peak before the nuclear rise.</p>

<p>The difference between speaker groups yielded significant results in all three conditions: 0 (<italic>t</italic> = 2.29, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001); 1 (<italic>t</italic> = 3.54, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001); and 2 unstressed syllables (<italic>t</italic> = 3.99, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). The results for the <sc>dte</sc> = 0 condition are particularly revealing, since they indicate that the early vs. late rise contrast is preserved even in cases of extreme final tonal crowding (i.e., where no posttonic segmental material is available to execute the final rise). Further proof that early rise speakers align L2 earlier than late rise speakers is that even in <sc>dte</sc> = 2 contexts early rise speakers align L2 much earlier (17.66%) than late rise speakers in <sc>dte</sc> = 0 (31.83%).</p>
<p>Follow-up post hoc tests performed for the <sc>speakergroup-by-dte</sc> main effect revealed that for early rises, alignment scores were significantly different in two conditions: zero vs. one (<italic>t</italic> = 1.45, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001); and zero vs. two (<italic>t</italic> = 1.65, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). For one vs. two, however, there was no significant difference (<italic>t</italic> = .76, <italic>p</italic> = .467). Post hoc tests performed for the late rises showed that rise start alignment scores were significantly different in all conditions: zero vs. one (<italic>t</italic> = 1.45, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001); zero vs. two (<italic>t</italic> = 1.65, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001); and one vs. two (<italic>t</italic> = 3.29, <italic>p</italic> = .003).

<p>The contour produced by the early rise speaker contains a continuous F0 uptrend throughout the utterance; it is impossible to label the expected peak of the prenuclear rise or the onset of the final ascent, thus H1 and L2 are not marked. The contour produced by the late rise speaker, however, consists of a rise-fall movement over the course of the two adjacent stressed syllables. H1 is realized at the nuclear onset, and L2 is realized at the nuclear offset.</p>
<p>In order to provide an objective measure of the differences in F0 production between the two speaker groups, F0 measurements were taken at the beginning of the nuclear syllable (i.e., C1) and also at the end of the nuclear syllable (i.e., C2). The pitch trajectory throughout this syllable was calculated by subtracting the F0 at the syllable onset from the F0 at the syllable offset (i.e., C2 – C1). This difference is presented graphically based on speaker group in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0023830911434126">Figure 8</xref>.

<p>As can be seen, early rise speakers exhibited a mean rising pitch trajectory throughout the nuclear syllable (0.77 ERB on average), whereas late rise speakers, including speakers 3M and 5M, exhibited a mean falling trajectory (-0.82 ERB on average).

<p>A final point worth consideration, given the late rise production in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0023830911434126">Figure 7b</xref>, is whether the scaling of L2 is undershot (i.e., higher scaling) due to tonal crowding in cases of extreme tonal pressure (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0023830911434126">Arvaniti &amp; Ladd, 2009</xref>, p. 63; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0023830911434126">Ladd, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0023830911434126">Prieto, 2005</xref>).

<title>2.4 Summary and discussion</title>
<p>Significant differences were not found between speaker groups on utterance-initial and prenuclear alignment and scaling measures; these results provide strong evidence that group differences observed upon initial inspection of the final rise corpus (i.e., early vs. late rise) were localized after the onset of the nuclear syllable. Regarding L1 alignment, the number of utterance-initial unstressed syllables was fixed before the prenuclear syllable, limiting our ability to provide direct AM implications. In terms of H1 alignment, this peak aligned later as the number of intervening unstressed syllables increased. Specifically, when one or two unstressed syllables intervened, H1 aligned within the first posttonic syllable. When three unstressed syllables intervened, H1 aligned within the second posttonic syllable (on average). Given the general assumption in the AM model that a tone is understood to be <italic>not</italic> starred if it is the more loosely aligned of two tonal targets with respect to a stressed syllable edge (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0023830911434126">Arvaniti et al., 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0023830911434126">2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0023830911434126">Face, 2002a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0023830911434126">Grice, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0023830911434126">Ladd, 2000</xref>), we can infer that the loose posttonic alignment of H1 under varying levels of tonal pressure warrants a trailing tone specification, thus, a L*+H rising accent, similar to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0023830911434126">Face (2002a)</xref> for Madrid Spanish. The L+H* alternative may be dismissed since L1 was coincident with the stressed syllable in most cases, whereas for H1 this was clearly not the case.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0023830911434126">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>As for L2 scaling and alignment, the early rise and late rise were shown to differ on the two phonetic dimensions known to characterize tonal targets within the AM framework: F0 scaling and temporal coordination with the segmental string. As for scaling, early rises began at approximately the same level of the previous peak, whereas late rises began at approximately the same level of the initial tonal value; early rises were also shown to have a higher final tonal value. As for alignment, early rise L2 never surpassed the 40% point in non-clash contexts, whereas late rise L2 was typically obtained within the second half of the nuclear stressed syllable, and in many cases was coincident with the onset of postnuclear material. The timing contrast was shown to hold even in cases of final tonal clash where the lack of posttonic segmental material might be expected to obscure the early vs. late rise start time difference. Another indication that contrasting tonal specifications triggered the different rise starts was found in speaker responses to internal clash. Response differences in tonal clash contexts are typically assumed to indicate differences in tonal specifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0023830911434126">Face, 2002a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0023830911434126">Prieto, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0023830911434126">Silverman &amp; Pierrehumbert, 1990</xref>), and the divergent F0 gestures that were observed here are further motivation to assume that a phonological contrast exists.</p>
<p>Given these findings, we posit the following nuclear pitch accent specifications: H* for early rises and L* for late rises. Following the notion of sparse tonal specification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0023830911434126">Arvaniti &amp; Ladd, 2009</xref>), we assume that the tonal plateau or the minor F0 descent from the prenuclear peak to the L2 point in the early rise was a consequence of phonetic interpolation, or F0 sag between flanking H tone specifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0023830911434126">Elordieta, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0023830911434126">Elordieta &amp; Calleja, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0023830911434126">Ladd &amp; Schepman, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0023830911434126">Pierrehumbert, 1980</xref>). Crucially, this sagging transition could not be observed in internal clash contexts.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0023830911434126">16</xref></sup> The tonal descent after H1 in late rise contours, however, and most notably in internal clash contexts, provides evidence for a nuclear L* specification between the prenuclear H and the final H%. Cross-linguistic evidence on the L* vs. H* contrast has been found elsewhere in the AM literature. Specifically, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0023830911434126">Gussenhoven and Rietveld (2000)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0023830911434126">Haan (2001)</xref> investigated such a contrast in Dutch, referring to L* vs. H* as ‘low rise’ vs. ‘high rise’, respectively. Similar to the findings of the proposed H* accent discussed here, Haan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0023830911434126">2001</xref>, p. 112) referred to the H*H% melody as: “following the high F0 target on the [preceding] accent, pitch remained level for a brief stretch; from this high target, the final rise took off”. As for L*H%, Haan noted an F0 valley after the preceding peak, and then a posttonic rise. Such an analysis would also seem to be in line with the current data.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0023830911434126">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>The significantly higher FT level in the early rise contour is analyzed as upstepped ¡H%, or left-to-right phonetic raising of the final tonal level due to the preceding nuclear H* accent. Whereas ‘upstep’ has been understood elsewhere to form part of the specification of an affected tone (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0023830911434126">Truckenbrodt, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0023830911434126">Willis, 2006/7</xref>), this view would seem to differ from that of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0023830911434126">Nibert (2000)</xref>, for example, who claims that some ‘trigger’ raises the level of an upstepped tone.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0023830911434126">18</xref></sup> The current analysis adopts the view of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0023830911434126">Nibert (2000)</xref> who interprets upstep as contextual phonetic raising due to a previous H specification, that is, the higher final F0 in the early rise is purely phonetic and does not communicate a contrast with H% of the late rise.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0023830911434126">19</xref></sup> The schematic in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0023830911434126">Figure 9</xref> is a visual representation of the proposed tonal specifications for the early and late rise contours.</p>

<p>A number of comments are in line on how the results speak to broader issues of autosegmental prosodic structure. The experimental data provide strong evidence that adjustments for tonal crowding can systematically and significantly affect the realization of intonation contours. In both question contours, H1, for example, aligned significantly later into posttonic segmental material as <sc>isi</sc> increased. Although research on tonal crowding effects typically shows that tonal targets remain stable once tones are more than two syllables apart (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0023830911434126">Arvaniti et al., 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0023830911434126">2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0023830911434126">2006a</xref>), the current findings demonstrate that alignment of the prenuclear peak is variable when up to three unstressed syllables intervene. As for the L2 point, its alignment was affected by tonal crowding as well, but from preceding and following prosodic contexts, corroborating the general finding that F0 timing may be affected by pressure from two adjacent tones. In terms of scaling, the data replicate previous findings that the F0 of H targets is not significantly affected by tonal crowding pressures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0023830911434126">Arvaniti &amp; Ladd, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0023830911434126">Arvaniti et al., 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0023830911434126">2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0023830911434126">2006a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0023830911434126">Face, 2002b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0023830911434126">Prieto, 2005</xref>). Somewhat unexpectedly, L2 for late rise speakers was not undershot in the internal clash context. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0023830911434126">Arvaniti and Ladd (2009)</xref> are clear on the evidence for L undershooting when in contact with flanking H tones, but the current study could not replicate this finding. The ability for the L2 point to remain constant in the Manchego late rise corpus makes for a stronger case that the tone that associates with the stressed syllable is Low. As a final consideration, it remains to be seen whether frameworks of intonational phonology that mark all syllables (stressed and unstressed) with unique specifications may provide better insight into this cross-linguistic inconsistency. One model that comes to mind is the Parallel Encoding and Target Approximation Model (PENTA) developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0023830911434126">Xu (2005)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0023830911434126">Xu and Xu (2005)</xref>. Future work should investigate the compatibility of PENTA and AM given the present data.</p>
<p>A next question that arises is how the early and late rise contours compare to and are signaled differently from contours produced for lexically identical declarative statements. Given the scaling difference that was observed on the nuclear syllable (i.e., higher F0 in early rises), it is of interest to examine how these different tonal levels compare to those of declarative statements. In Analysis 2 we follow up on this point.</p>

<title>3 Analysis 2 – The acoustic correlates of statement vs. question intonation in Manchego Peninsular Spanish</title>
<sec id="section18-0023830911434126">
<title>3.1 Background</title>
<p>As mentioned previously, the most recurrent prosodic characteristic used to communicate question intent is high pitch, either locally or globally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0023830911434126">Haan, 2001</xref>, p. 214; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0023830911434126">van Heuven &amp; van Zanten, 2005</xref>). Examples of local marking include an utterance-initial higher pitch level or an utterance-final rising gesture. Examples of global marking include an overall raised register level or the suspension of downtrends normally exhibited in statements. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0023830911434126">Van Heuven and van Zanten (2005)</xref> note that although the boundary rise may be the most widespread prosodic marker of question intent across languages, it is not typically the only F0 correlate of question intent. Other phonetic signals of interrogativity include the size of utterance-initial vs. utterance-final accents and the slope of the baseline connecting Low turning points of accents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0023830911434126">van Heuven &amp; Haan, 2002</xref>). Later alignment of peaks in questions (50–75 ms) is another indicator of interrogativity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0023830911434126">D’Imperio &amp; House, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0023830911434126">House, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0023830911434126">2003</xref>).</p>
<p>As for Spanish, one recurrent claim is that questions are signaled by a higher tonal level from the onset of the utterance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0023830911434126">Cunningham, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0023830911434126">Navarro Tomás, 1944</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0023830911434126">Quilis, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0023830911434126">Sosa, 1999</xref>). Navarro Tomás describes the intonation of questions as having a high tone at the beginning of the utterance which then descends gradually until it reaches the penultimate syllable. Experimental work has shown that it is actually the scaling of the prenuclear peak, with a higher value in questions, that signals this difference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0023830911434126">Alvord, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0023830911434126">Face, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0023830911434126">2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0023830911434126">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0023830911434126">Prieto, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0023830911434126">Sosa, 1999</xref>). Results from perception experiments have also corroborated this general finding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0023830911434126">Face, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0023830911434126">2007</xref>), although <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0023830911434126">Face (2007)</xref> shows that the prenuclear peak difference is not the only non-final cue that listeners use to perceive the question–statement contrast. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0023830911434126">Willis (2006/7)</xref>, in an analysis of Dominican Spanish intonation, noted that the most robust F0 difference between questions and statements was at the nuclear syllable, with higher F0 in questions.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0023830911434126">Face (2007)</xref> highlights four ways in which the intonation of declarative statements differs from that of lexically identical declarative questions for speakers of Peninsular Spanish. First, the initial accentual peak is higher in questions. Second, in medial position, statements exhibit an F0 rise, whereas questions contain no such accentual peak. Third, on the nuclear syllable, questions have flat F0 whereas statements have an F0 rise (or sustained pitch). Finally, there is a posttonic rise to the end of the utterance in questions, but an utterance-final fall in statements. These differences are depicted in schematic form in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0023830911434126">Figure 10</xref>.</p>

<p>For Analysis 2, we will not be able to determine the potential for differences in utterance-medial position as all target utterances contained two content words only. We will consider, however, whether F0 differences are observed at various non-final and final pitch points, and this will help to provide a detailed account of how the question–statement contrast is signaled in Manchego Spanish.</p>

<title>3.2 Procedure</title>
<sec id="section20-0023830911434126">
<title>3.2.1 Speech materials and speakers</title>
<p>Two separate but identical analyses were conducted for Analysis 2. For each declarative question corpus (i.e., early rise and late rise), the alignment and scaling properties of five pre-determined F0 points were compared to those of declarative statements produced by the respective speaker groups. In total 784 statement productions were submitted to acoustic analysis: early rise speakers produced 294 declarative statements; late rise speakers produced 490 declarative statements. A total of 48 statement productions were discarded. These contained disfluencies, hesitation pauses, or long stretches of creaky voice.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section21-0023830911434126">
<title>3.2.2 Analysis procedures</title>
<p>Duration and F0 measurements were obtained for the target statement productions using the computer software Praat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0023830911434126">Boersma &amp; Weenink, 2009</xref>). F0 points thought to represent tonal targets were located manually. Frequency values were extracted in Hertz and then converted to the ERB scale. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0023830911434126">Figures 11</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-0023830911434126">12</xref> show the displays of two typical utterances: a statement produced by an early rise speaker; and a statement produced by a late rise speaker, respectively. Although two speaker groups could be identified based on declarative question intonation (i.e., early rise vs. late rise, see Analysis 1), all speakers produced the same sequence of melodic gestures for declarative statements: an initial rise with fixed valley at the prenuclear onset and trailing peak past the stressed syllable offset; a descent to a sustained level F0 (or reduced rise) on the nuclear syllable; and utterance-finally, a lower F0 value. As for labeling, L1 was defined as the first Low point; it was typically realized near the onset of the prenuclear stressed syllable. H1 was the first High point, corresponding to the peak of the same rise. L2 was the second low point which typically began a plateau or a reduced rise on the nuclear stressed syllable.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0023830911434126">20</xref></sup> F0 data were extracted for all points, and alignment data were calculated for prenuclear pitch accent points (i.e., L1 and H1). Finally, IT (initial tonal value) and FT (final tonal value) were defined as the lowest non-spurious F0 points at the onset and the offset of the utterance, respectively. F0 data were extracted for these two points as well.</p>

<title>3.3.1 Early rise speakers: Declarative statements vs. declarative questions</title>
<p>We begin with a phonetic comparison of declarative statements and declarative questions produced by early rise speakers, recalling from Analysis 1 that six speakers comprised this group: 6F, 7F, 8F, 6M, 7M, and 8M. Internal clash data were not examined for either sentence type, as the contours produced by early rise speakers in this context could not be labeled for H1 and L2 (see Analysis 1). As for the statistical analysis, a one-way fully factorial Multivariate Analysis of Variance (MANOVA) was conducted with <sc>sentencetype (</sc>statement vs. question) as a within-subjects factor. The dependent variables were IT, L1, H1, L2, and FT scaling, and L1 and H1 alignment. In the MANOVA, the omnibus test found an overall effect for <sc>sentencetype</sc> (Wilks’ Lambda = .097, <italic>F</italic> = 361.33, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001).</p>
<p>The boxplots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-0023830911434126">Figure 13</xref> represent the full distribution of L1 and H1 alignment scores, respectively. As can be seen, both points aligned later in questions. Mean alignment for L1 was 17.72% (<italic>SD</italic> = 13.68) for statements and 24.70% (<italic>SD</italic> = 19.22) for questions. For H1 it was 56.40% (<italic>SD</italic> = 36.48) for statements and 99.88% (<italic>SD</italic> = 57.88) for questions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0023830911434126">21</xref></sup> The difference was significant for H1, <italic>F</italic>(1, 432) = 60.20, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, but not for L1, <italic>F</italic>(1, 432) = .548, <italic>p</italic> = .460.

<title>3.3.2 Late rise speakers: Declarative statements vs. declarative questions</title>
<p>The same phonetic comparisons were carried out for the late rise speaker group. We recall from Analysis 1 that ten speakers comprised this group: 1F, 2F, 3F, 4F, 5F, 1M, 2M, 3M, 4M, and 5M. A one-way fully factorial Multivariate Analysis of Variance (MANOVA) was conducted with <sc>sentencetype (</sc>statement vs. question<sc>)</sc> as a within-subjects factor. In the MANOVA, the omnibus test found an overall effect for <sc>sentencetype</sc> (Wilks’ Lambda = .162, <italic>F</italic> = 463.38, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001).</p>
<p>The boxplots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15-0023830911434126">Figure 15</xref> represent the full distribution of L1 and H1 alignment scores, respectively. Similar to what was reported earlier, L1 and H1 aligned later in questions than in statements. Mean alignment for L1 was 24.56% (<italic>SD</italic> = 24.45) for statements and 29.62% (<italic>SD</italic> = 29.19) for questions; for H1 it was 62.87% (<italic>SD</italic> = 37.97) for statements and 77.44% (<italic>SD</italic> = 47.21) for questions. The difference was significant for H1, <italic>F</italic>(1, 744) = 26.670, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, but not for L1, <italic>F</italic>(1, 744) = 3.282, <italic>p</italic> = .212. Although a significant effect was found for <sc>sentencetype</sc> on H1 alignment, the boxplot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15-0023830911434126">Figure 15b</xref> indicates that there was considerable overlap in the two distributions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0023830911434126">22</xref></sup></p>

<title>3.4 Summary and discussion</title>
<p>In Analysis 2, two comparisons were carried out: early rise declarative questions vs. declarative statements; and late rise declarative questions vs. declarative statements. H1 aligned later in questions than statements for both groups, and the differences were significant. Distributional analysis of these data, however, showed much overlap between the respective distributions. The peak alignment difference attested in House (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0023830911434126">2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0023830911434126">2003</xref>) for Swedish, for example, was more robust (50–75 ms) than was attested here. Whether or not the smaller alignment differences uncovered in the present data prove to be relevant in a perception-based framework, as was confirmed by House, is left for future investigation.</p>
<p>More revealing were the findings on F0 scaling. No significant differences were found for either comparison on IT, L1, or H1, indicating that questions and statements were signaled at comparable F0 levels at the utterance-initial and prenuclear pitch points for both speaker groups. At the L2 point, early rise speakers exhibited higher F0 in questions, whereas late rise speakers did not. The scaling of FT was significantly higher in questions for both groups. The schematics in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig17-0023830911434126">Figure 17</xref> are a visual representation of these scaling differences.</p>

<p>Higher nuclear scaling in addition to higher FT scaling in declarative questions, as shown here for the early rise group, has been reported elsewhere in the experimental literature on Spanish. Specifically, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0023830911434126">Willis (2006/7)</xref> made the claim for a scaling contrast on the nuclear accent in Dominican Spanish, showing that the F0 level for this accent was between 77% and 200% higher for questions than statements. The results reported for Dominican Spanish and the results reported here for Manchego Peninsular Spanish are combined evidence that the non-final indicator of question intent in Spanish may be signaled as late as the nuclear syllable. What could not be corroborated in the current results was higher H1 peak in questions, as in Face (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0023830911434126">2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0023830911434126">2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0023830911434126">2007</xref>) for Madrid Spanish and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0023830911434126">Alvord (2006)</xref> for Miami Cuban Spanish. One possible explanation for this discrepancy is that declarative questions in Spanish may exhibit higher F0 at either of two non-final points in Spanish (i.e., the prenuclear peak or the nuclear accent), and that the factor governing this variability is the language variety that one speaks.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0023830911434126">23</xref></sup> Dialect variation in intonation has been widely attested elsewhere in the cross-linguistic literature (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0023830911434126">Arvaniti &amp; Gårding, 2007</xref> for American English; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0023830911434126">Atterer &amp; Ladd, 2004</xref> for German; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0023830911434126">Dalton &amp; Ní Chasaide, 2005</xref> for Irish; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0023830911434126">Elordieta &amp; Calleja, 2005</xref> for Basque Spanish; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0023830911434126">Fletcher, Grabe, &amp; Warren, 2005</xref> for English; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0023830911434126">Warren, 2005a</xref> for review) and in the literature on Spanish as well (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0023830911434126">Prieto &amp; Roseano, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0023830911434126">Sosa, 1999</xref>). The present Manchego data add to this body of work by showing that different dialects of a language may vary not only in how they align peaks or valleys, but also in how they realize the question–statement contrast.</p>
<p>Another issue is how to deal with results obtained for the late rise speaker group, and an important question is why final scaling differences were observed at the utterance-final position only. One possible explanation may have to do with the meanings associated with the two question contours, and for this, we turn to the results of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0023830911434126">Henriksen (2010)</xref>. Specifically, Henriksen compared the frequency with which speakers produced early and late rise contours in a sentence reading task (as reported in Analysis 1, above) with the frequency that the same speakers produced questions in an interactive dialogue game performed in pairs. The 16 speakers analyzed in the current paper produced data under both speaking conditions. The findings were the following: the late rise predominated in the reading data; the early rise predominated in the dialogue data; and whenever a speaker style-shifted between tasks, the shift was from the late rise in the reading task to the early rise in the dialogue task.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0023830911434126">24</xref></sup> Henriksen’s claim was that variable use of the boundary rise was a stylistically-motivated feature of Manchego intonation; based on these findings, we would like to suggest that the lower communicative demands of read speech (i.e., there is no listener when one reads text from a computer screen) motivate the neutralization of phonetic cues that signal certain pragmatic contrasts, such as ‘question’ vs. ‘statement’. In the case of the late rise contour, utterance-final signals of interrogativity were present, but early signals were lost, and the neutralization of these earlier signals may result from the fact that the late rise contour is used primarily when speakers are reading aloud a prepared text. The early rise, inferred as a ‘semi-spontaneous’ or ‘conversational’ pattern, was shown here to differ from its statement counterpart at two phonetic points, and this may be so because the need to signal question intent is greater when an interlocutor is present.</p>
<p>Indeed, such a claim relies on the assumption that speakers are highly aware of the listening and situational conditions in which they speak. As noted in Baker and Bradlow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0023830911434126">2009</xref>, p. 394), “when speakers believe their listeners might have difficulty perceiving their speech, they usually try to speak more clearly by ‘globally’ hyper-articulating”. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0023830911434126">Uchanski (2005)</xref> notes as well that ‘clear speech’ is adopted when one speaks in difficult communication situations. When speakers utter declarative questions, they know that their listeners must rely on intonational cues only to understand the pragmatic meaning of their intended message. It would not be unexpected, then, to observe hyper-articulation of F0 signals of interrogativity in speaking situations in which a listener is physically present, and this may explain why the early rise contains more F0 cues of question intent than the late rise. As a caveat, there is Uchanski’s observation that higher F0 levels and larger F0 range in clear speech situations may be an extraneous by-product of vocal effort due to increased hyper-articulation. In Analysis 2 we have not provided quantitative data for other phonetic measurements (e.g., speaking rate) that are typically examined in research on speech style (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0023830911434126">Smiljanic &amp; Bradlow, 2009</xref> for review). These issues are clearly relevant to how questions are hyper- or hypo-articulated, but must be left for future research.</p>

<title>4 Conclusion</title>
<p>This paper was guided by two research goals. The first goal was to provide empirical evidence on the continuum of utterance-final rises in Manchego Peninsular Spanish declarative questions and to determine if this variability was motivated by one or two tonal target specifications. As the results showed, the apparent continuum of utterance-final F0 turning points corresponds to two distinct tonal target specifications, and this difference is indicated by contrasting nuclear pitch accent configurations: L* vs. H*. The timing contrast held even in cases of final tonal clash where the lack of posttonic segmental material might be expected to neutralize the rise start time difference. Time pressure effects led to gestural re-organization in the internal clash context for the early rise group, providing further evidence that contrastive tonal specifications triggered the different rise starts. The clearest implication of these findings is that researchers on Spanish intonation cannot assume that utterance-final rises may be triggered by H*¡H% or L*H% only for speakers of a particular language variety. While both patterns have been reported elsewhere in Spanish, they have not been reported to coexist in the same variety, so the findings of this paper present a previously unreported type of variation. The results also speak to broader cross-linguistic issues on the phonetics and phonology of the boundary rise (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0023830911434126">Britain, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0023830911434126">Gussenhoven &amp; Rietveld, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0023830911434126">Haan, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0023830911434126">Warren, 2005a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0023830911434126">Warren &amp; Daly, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0023830911434126">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0023830911434126">Zwartz &amp; Warren, 2003</xref>). Specifically, the issue of F0 re-organization in time pressure contexts had not been reported in this previous body of research.</p>
<p>The second research goal was broader in scope, investigating whether the question–statement functional contrast was signaled in the same way for speakers who produce the H*¡H% early rise contour vs. those who produce the L*H% late rise contour. Results showed two scaling differences in the early rise vs. statement comparison, but one scaling difference in the late rise vs. statement comparison. The findings for early rise speakers were in line with cross-linguistic research on the question–statement contrast, as the early rise contour differed from the statement contour on non-final as well as on final F0 points. The anomalous finding that fewer phonetic markers differentiated questions from statements for late rise speakers was attributed to the stylistic meaning of the late rise contour and the lesser communicative demand that read speech patterns may have. The multiple F0 signals of question intent in the early rise were understood as hyper-articulation of interrogativity signals in speaking situations in which a listener is present. Unfortunately, this effect could not be addressed in full and must be left for more thorough examination in future research.</p>

<p>Speakers of Manchego Peninsular Spanish reside in the Castile-La Mancha autonomous community located in south-central Spain. The Castile-La Mancha region borders Madrid to the north, Andalusia to the south, Extremadura to the west, and Valencia to the east. The variety of Spanish spoken in Castile-La Mancha is generally considered Castilian or Peninsular Spanish, spoken in the central and northern regions of mainland Spain.</p></fn>

<p>‘Declarative question’ in this paper refers to information-seeking questions for which two responses are possible (i.e., positive (yes) or negative (no)) and for which there are no formal markers of interrogativity. Note that the term ‘yes/no question’ may be appropriate as well from a pragmatic standpoint, although yes/no questions in many Germanic languages are marked by inversion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0023830911434126">Haan, 2001</xref>, p. 12; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0023830911434126">van Heuven &amp; Haan, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0023830911434126">2002</xref>) and there is debate as to whether declarative questions are truly information-seeking or confirmation-seeking in these languages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0023830911434126">Haan, 2001</xref>, p. 16). Since many of the hypotheses in this paper were motivated by the identical lexico-syntactic structure of the statements and questions in the test sentences, the term ‘declarative question’ was chosen. It is important to bear in mind that the information-seeking intent of the questions analyzed in this study would seem to be the pragmatic equivalent of yes/no questions in Germanic languages.</p></fn>

<label>3</label>
<p>The primary motivation for the two prosodic manipulation conditions was to help determine which putative tonal targets were undershot and/or temporally displaced under varying degrees of tonal crowding. Tonal crowding effects follow from the fact that the phonetic alignment realization of a particular target tone adjusts in the presence of adjacent tones but remains stable once tones are more than two syllables apart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0023830911434126">Arvaniti &amp; Ladd, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0023830911434126">Arvaniti et al., 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0023830911434126">2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0023830911434126">2006a</xref>). As will be seen later, the particular phonetic effects that were produced in different contexts of tonal crowding were especially helpful for determining the phonological nature of certain F0 elbows under analysis.</p></fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn4-0023830911434126">
<label>4</label>
<p>For this paper, the (X;Y) convention will be used to refer to particular prosodic manipulation contexts. ‘X’ refers to interstress interval, and ‘Y’ refers to the number of unstressed syllables after the nuclear syllable.</p></fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn5-0023830911434126">
<label>5</label>
<p>F0 data that were ‘pitch-halved’ (i.e., where the actual F0 value was divided in half upon output from Praat) were hand-checked and corrected by examining the original F0 productions in Praat.</p></fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn6-0023830911434126">
<label>6</label>
<p>In fact, as will be demonstrated later, L2 corresponded to a High target in early rise productions, but a Low target in late rise productions.</p></fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn7-0023830911434126">
<label>7</label>
<p>Amalia Arvaniti (personal communication) notes that such reliability checks have thus far been implemented to test the labeling of L valleys and not H peaks. Given the current findings, it may be that more variability is found in the hand labeling of H maxima than L minima, and this may have to do with H peaks that were not always clear inflections. For further discussion on pitch span in intonational peaks, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0023830911434126">Knight and Nolan (2006)</xref>.</p></fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn8-0023830911434126">

<p>It should also be noted that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0023830911434126">Arvaniti and Ladd (2009)</xref> employed algorithmic determination in addition to eye estimation of F0 elbows and found that the two methods did not lead to substantially different conclusions.</p></fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn9-0023830911434126">

<p>Note that the smaller L2 descent for early rises is due to a higher L2 value and not a lower H1 value (when compared to late rises). For more specific details, see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0023830911434126">Tables 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0023830911434126">5</xref>.</p></fn>

<p>An extreme outlier was defined as a case with a value more than three times the height of its box (or its interquartile range). Extreme outliers are marked with asterisks (*) in the boxplots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0023830911434126">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0023830911434126">6</xref>. It was decided that a metric needed to be devised to account for the fact that speakers may have produced multiple declarative question contours (i.e., late rise tokens for some, but early rise tokens for others) in the same task.</p></fn>

<p>Recall that there were four levels of <sc>isi</sc> (0, 1, 2, and 3 unstressed syllables) in the original design. However, productions of <sc>isi</sc> = 0 were analyzed separately.</p></fn>

<p>It is worth noting that the ERB differences in FT scaling (0.80 ERB) and final rise magnitude (0.54 ERB) between the two speaker groups were very close to the minimum difference in ERB considered to be perceptible (0.50 ERB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0023830911434126">Colantoni &amp; Gurlekian, 2004</xref>, p. 113; see also discussion in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0023830911434126">Moore, 2010</xref>, pp. 474–475). In future research it would be necessary to carry out a perception experiment to determine whether these differences are perceived or not.</p></fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn15-0023830911434126">
<label>15</label>
<p>It is worth mentioning that given the claims of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0023830911434126">Face and Prieto (2006/7)</xref>, the L*+H accent posited here would be analyzed as L+H* (or L+&gt;H* in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0023830911434126">Estebas Vilaplana and Prieto, 2008</xref>). An issue that remains, assuming this alternative analysis, is that Face and Prieto claim a categorical difference between an early rising accent with a delayed peak (observed here) and a late rising accent with a prenuclear valley until the end of the tonic syllable. As observed in this paper, there was considerable variation in L1 alignment: the late rise mean L1 alignment score was 29.27 with a standard deviation of 29.19, implying that the L1 point in some cases was beyond the midpoint of the tonic syllable. A more thorough investigation of L1 alignment under varying degrees of tonal crowding must be left for future research.</p></fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn16-0023830911434126">
<label>16</label>
<p>Sagging transitions are posited as F0 sags (i.e., minimal F0 descent) between two H accents. They are understood as phonetic interpolation between two H tones and do not warrant L tone specifications; the sagging transition model was first posited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0023830911434126">Pierrehumbert (1980)</xref>. For further discussion, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0023830911434126">Ladd and Schepman (2003)</xref> or <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0023830911434126">Pierrehumbert and Beckman (1988)</xref>.</p></fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn17-0023830911434126">
<label>17</label>
<p>It is worth noting that some accounts of H* note that the phonetic implementation of this accent is a clear peak during the metrically strong syllable (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0023830911434126">Beckman, Díaz-Campos, McGory, &amp; Morgan, 2002</xref>). As noted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0023830911434126">Pierrehumbert (1980)</xref>, the main difference between H* and L*+H or L+H* is that the latter show a rise from a low point, which is lacking in H*. See also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0023830911434126">Arvaniti and Gårding (2007)</xref>. Also, this is not the first AM analysis of the early vs. late rise contrast in Spanish declarative question intonation. In fact, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0023830911434126">Sosa (1999)</xref> distinguishes two declarative question final rise types in Peninsular Spanish (i.e., early vs. late) as L+H*H% and L*H%, respectively. An advantage to Sosa’s L+H* analysis for the early rise is that it captures the upward turning point near the onset of the nuclear syllable, which is consistent with a L tone in that location. Note that under the current analysis of H* we might expect a longer high plateau throughout the nuclear syllable, given that the preceding tone is also H. A drawback to Sosa’s alternative – taking into account especially the alignment data presented here – is that the leading L tone of the putative L+H* accent was not shown to surface as such in the early rise data. In fact, if the rise start were reflective of a leading L, one would expect its alignment to be variable under different contexts of tonal pressure. As has been documented here, the alignment of early rise L2 was fixed at the onset of the nuclear syllable, and this is not expected for an unstarred L. Whichever analysis is ultimately adopted (i.e., L+H* or H*), the important point is that the early rise contour contrasts phonologically with the late rise contour.</p></fn>

<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0023830911434126">Truckenbrodt (2002)</xref> refers to upstep as a return to the initial F0 height due to association to the intonation phrase, assuming the existence of F0 register levels which act as phonological anchoring points for subsequent tonal events. This phenomenon would seem to be different from the overall higher F0 of the FT in the early rise contour observed here. The reader should keep in mind that although ‘upstep’ generally refers to higher F0 level, there are multiple interpretations in the AM literature (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0023830911434126">Estebas Vilaplana &amp; Prieto, 2008</xref>).

<p>In order to understand better the H1 alignment difference in milliseconds, percentage scores were converted to milliseconds. H1 aligned at the 67 ms point in statements and the 115 ms point in questions (average). This difference was 48 ms. The later alignment in questions may be due to the fact that H1 was more difficult to label in the early rise contour, since there was no clear peak before the nuclear rise.</p></fn>

<p>It is important to bear in mind that not all speakers conformed to the general trend that statement peaks were at the same level of question peaks.

<p>The specific finding was that of the 16 speakers recorded, 10 speakers produced the late rise more frequently in the reading task, whereas 11 speakers produced the early rise more frequently in the dialogue task. Also, ‘speech style’ was understood within a sociolinguistic framework, with the choice of speaking very formally or informally being governed by the speaking circumstances or the situation of use.
