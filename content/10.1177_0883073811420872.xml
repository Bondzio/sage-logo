<abstract>
<p>This investigation correlated incidence and degree of autonomic dysfunction with the degree of motor impairment in children hospitalized with Guillain-Barré syndrome. Motor weakness varies, as does the effect on autonomic function including heart rate, vasomotor stability, sweating, continence, and blood pressure. After Institutional Review Board approval, hospitalized patients with Guillain-Barré syndrome &lt;19 years were included for retrospective chart review. There were 26 patients (12 boys), with a mean age of 11.3 years (range, 6-17 years). The average hospital stay was 10.6 days. Twenty-four (92%) recovered by 2 to 6 months without functional disability. Bradycardia and sweating disturbances were not observed. Hypertension occurred in 18 of 26 (69%) and tachycardia in 20 of 26 (77%) patients. The proportion of children with hypertension and/or tachycardia increased, as did the motor disability grade (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .043 and <italic>P</italic> &lt; .018, respectively). Hypertension occurred 9 to 15 days from symptom onset and within 24 to 48 hours of maximum motor disability in 89%. Multiple autonomic disturbances compound the course of childhood Guillain-Barré syndrome.</p>

<p>Guillain-Barré syndrome is the most common cause of acute childhood paralysis worldwide, affecting approximately 0.3 to 2 per 100 000 children per year.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0883073811420872">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0883073811420872"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0883073811420872">3</xref></sup> Guillain-Barré syndrome is an acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy, which can affect all myelinated peripheral nerves and all age groups.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0883073811420872">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0883073811420872"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0883073811420872"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0883073811420872"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0883073811420872"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0883073811420872">6</xref></sup> The classic clinical syndrome encompasses distal paresthesias, symmetric progressive ascending paralysis, and diminished tendon stretch reflexes without sensory loss secondary to a postulated immune-mediated mechanism involving the patchy destruction of peripheral nerve myelin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0883073811420872">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0883073811420872"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0883073811420872"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0883073811420872"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0883073811420872"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0883073811420872">6</xref></sup> Facial weakness with limb and back pain often accompanies the initial symptom evolution. In addition to the demyelinating process, there exist axonal variants with injury extending into the peripheral nerve axons and nerve terminals affecting primarily motor nerves; acute motor axonal neuropathy; variants with sensory involvement, acute motor, and sensory axonal neuropathy; and an ataxia-ophthalmoplegic syndrome with no weakness (Miller-Fisher syndrome).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0883073811420872">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0883073811420872">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0883073811420872">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0883073811420872"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0883073811420872">9</xref></sup> These later variants suggest that there may be more than one pathogenic mechanism involved in the development of the clinical syndromes. Furthermore, the acute demyelinative polyneuropathy is the predominant subtype among children both in the United States and Europe, whereas the axonal subtypes are predominant in children in China, Mexico, Japan, and Pakistan.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0883073811420872">10</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Both cellular and humoral immune-mediated mechanisms are postulated to be implicated in the destruction of the myelin sheath during the course of Guillain-Barré syndrome.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0883073811420872">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0883073811420872">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0883073811420872"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0883073811420872"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0883073811420872">9</xref></sup> These are most often triggered by a preceding infection or vaccination. Commonly identified etiologies precipitating Guillain-Barré syndrome include Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, hepatitis, varicella, <italic>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</italic>, nonspecific gastrointestinal and upper respiratory illnesses, human immunodeficiency virus infection (HIV), <italic>Campylobacter jejuni</italic>, and certain vaccines.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0883073811420872">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0883073811420872"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0883073811420872"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0883073811420872"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0883073811420872">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0883073811420872">10</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Rapid nerve electrical transmission along myelinated nerves is dependent upon the integrity of the myelin sheath encircling nerve fibers, and thus, transmission is rendered slow or ineffectual due to “conduction block” from myelin loss by cellular infiltration and multifocal areas of inflammation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0883073811420872">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0883073811420872"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0883073811420872"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0883073811420872">5</xref></sup> Concurrent with myelin destruction is the gradual development of elevated protein levels in the cerebrospinal fluid due to the breakdown of the myelin sheaths at the intersection of the dorsal and ventral roots within the subarachnoid space.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0883073811420872">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0883073811420872"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0883073811420872"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0883073811420872">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0883073811420872">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0883073811420872">8</xref></sup> The course of Guillain-Barré syndrome is characterized by the onset of symmetric weakness with an initial rapid progressive phase, a second plateau phase at the maximum disability level, and a third phase of rehabilitation and recovery. Disability level in Guillain-Barré syndrome is often measured using the Hughes clinical grading scale (Motor Disability Grading Scale) scored from 1 to 6, with 1 being normal, 5 being the point where patients require mechanical ventilation, and 6 equating with death.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0883073811420872">11</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Beyond motor weakness, autonomic nervous system dysfunction may be prominent during the course of Guillain-Barré syndrome. Symptoms include instability and lability of systemic blood pressure (hypertension/hypotension), heart rate (tachycardia/bradycardia), and sweating (hyperhidrosis/anhidrosis); bowel and bladder incontinence or retention; and vasomotor instability, among the most prominent.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0883073811420872">12</xref></sup> While many authors report these findings in adult Guillain-Barré syndrome patient series, there has been only one previous study in children focused on autonomic disturbances.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0883073811420872">13</xref></sup> That report described hypertension during the course of illness and deviations in blood pressure that were greatest in those children who experienced the most severe Guillain-Barré syndrome.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0883073811420872">13</xref></sup> Thus, we undertook the present retrospective study to examine whether there was a correlation between blood pressure elevation or any other autonomic disturbances and the severity of illness in childhood Guillain-Barré syndrome.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>After Institutional Review Board approval, the hospital discharge database was searched for ICD-9 code #357.0 during the years 1996 to 2005, based on criteria set forth by Asbury and Cornblath.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0883073811420872">1</xref></sup> All patients conforming to a diagnosis of Guillain-Barré syndrome aged between 0 to 18 years, with a minimum of 3 documented daily blood pressure recordings over at least 4 sequential days, were included. Patients were excluded if there was electromyographic evidence excluding a diagnosis of acute polyradiculoneuropathy, the cerebrospinal fluid analysis demonstrated &gt;50 mononuclear leukocytes/μL, and/or the patients had prior identified hypertension.</p>
<p>Charts were reviewed, and data collected included demographics, precipitating illnesses, neurological symptom onset, admission and discharge dates, number of hospital days, examination findings, underlying illness etiology, results of neurophysiological testing, and results of cerebrospinal fluid analyses. All blood pressure measurements and heart rate measures for each patient were recorded and a daily average calculated. Each dysautonomic sign noted in daily progress and nursing notes was identified, and any interventions or complications stemming from those dysautonomic signs were noted. Coded Motor Disability Grading Scale scores (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0883073811420872">Table 1</xref>
) were identified at maximum disability, at discharge from hospital, and at follow-up within 2 months and again at 6 months after discharge.</p>

The study cohort was comprised of 26 children, 14 boys and 12 girls, with a mean age of 11.27 years (standard deviation, 4.85 years). There were no significant differences in hospital stay for patients with hypertension or tachycardia compared to those without (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0883073811420872">Table 2</xref>

<p>Electromyograms and nerve conduction studies were obtained in 24 of 26 patients. Twenty-one patients had findings consistent with acute demyelinating polyneuropathy; 2 had neurophysiological features consistent with motor axonal polyneuropathy; and one study result was normal. Cerebrospinal fluid protein measures are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0883073811420872">Table 2</xref>, with significant differences noted between those patients with hypertension but not tachycardia. All patients had less than 50 white blood cells per microliter in the cerebrospinal fluid. Twenty-four of the 26 patients underwent 3 to 5 days of intravenous gamma globulin (400 mg/kg/d, divided every 6 hours), one underwent plasmapheresis, and one received only supportive treatment alone due to religious dissent against transfusion.</p>
<p>The etiologies for Guillain-Barré syndrome were examined in a nonstandardized manner. The predominant precipitating causes for Guillain-Barré syndrome were unknown, with nonspecific respiratory and gastrointestinal illnesses accounting for 69% (18/26). An additional 15.5% (4/26) had acute infections with Epstein-Barr virus, and the remaining 15.5% (4/26) were divided among single patients with parvovirus, influenza A, serous otitis media, and clinical sinusitis.</p>
<p>Eighteen (69%) of the patients in this cohort were hypertensive, and 20 patients (77%) had tachycardia over the course of illness (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0883073811420872">Table 2</xref>). Seventeen of the hypertensive patients were also tachycardic, and all patients experiencing either hypertension and/or tachycardia during the course of their illness had greater Guillain-Barré syndrome disability grades compared to the patients without these signs. The distribution of maximal blood pressure measures (systolic and diastolic) and heart rates were greater as Guillain-Barré syndrome stage increased, such that when comparing grades 1 to 3 to grades 4 and 5, there were significant differences between these groups (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .043 for systolic hypertension, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .018 for tachycardia; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0883073811420872">Table 3</xref>). Maximum disability grades for hypertensive patients disclosed 1 patient (4%) at grade 1, 4 patients (16%) at grade 2, 11 patients (40%) at grade 4, and 2 patients (8%) at grade 5 (mechanical ventilation). No patient died. Those patients with the highest disability grades also had the greatest deviations from normal blood pressure into the hypertensive range for age; grades 1 to 3 had a 5.06% deviation or a mean of 10.75 points greater deviation above normal systolic pressure, and grades 4 and 5 had at least a 12.78% deviation or a mean of 16.75 points above normal systolic pressure (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .043). These achieved a positive correlation (<italic>r</italic> = .98). The deviations above normal heart rate for age for those patients with tachycardia also achieved statistical significance: grades 1 to 3: 16.95% or a mean of 10.21 beats above maximum heart rate for age, and grades 4 and 5: 50.52% or a mean of 17.33 beats above maximum heart rate for age (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .018). Four patients had 4 signs of autonomic dysfunction, 4 patients had 3 signs, 14 patients had 2 signs, 2 patients had a single sign, and only 2 patients did not display dysautonomic signs from the 26-patient cohort. Only single patients had hypotension, urinary retention, or vasomotor instability noted, and no patients had bradycardia.

<p>Hypertension was managed conservatively in most cases, but antihypertensive therapy was provided to 6 patients with labetalol and hydralazine acutely. Pain was a prominent complaint in these children. It was triggered by movement and most often localized to the paraspinal lumbosacral area and in the posterior legs. Although not quantified, the pain was severe enough to reduce active movement and tolerance to passive range of motion. All but 2 patients in this cohort required analgesics during the course of their illness; usually, acetaminophen or a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent was administered. Narcotics were given intermittently to 5 patients and short-course steroids in one other patient. Gabapentin was additionally provided for subacute pain management in 8 children and carbamazepine in one other. Nasogastric tube feedings were required in 2 patients. No child required a gastrostomy tube. One of the 2 patients who needed mechanical ventilation underwent tracheostomy. Four children received antibiotic treatment for secondary urinary tract infections. No patient had thrombophlebitis, secondary pneumonia, or pulmonary embolism.</p>
<p>There was a significant correlation between a longer length of hospital stay and both maximum disability grade (2.7 vs 3.8, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05) and a higher percentage deviation above normal systolic blood pressure (4.90% vs 12.76%, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05) when comparing those patients whose hospital stay was less than 10 days versus 10 days or more. The day of maximum deviation above normal blood pressure was plotted against day of maximum disability grade. This was adjusted for the self-reported onset of symptoms, which resulted in a cluster between days 9 to 15 of illness or on days 2 to 6 of hospitalization and within 24 hours of the patients’ maximum disability grade. For patients with hypertension, 39% (7/18) maximized on the day prior to their worst motor disability stage, 33% (6/18) maximized on the day of their worst motor disability stage, and 28% (5/18) maximized the day after reaching their worst motor disability stage.</p>
<p>Our cohort had excellent early outcomes, such that 20 of 26 (77%) patients had functionally normal motor outcome by 4 to 8 weeks after hospital discharge and 24 of 26 (92%) by 6 months after hospitalization. The remaining 2 patients sustained mild neurological residua at 1 year, each requiring ankle orthoses to aid bilateral foot drop, and each required antihypertensive agents for less than 6 months. All but these 2 patients had resolution of hypertension and other autonomic disturbances by hospital discharge.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The annual incidence of Guillain-Barré syndrome in the United States based upon recent prospective surveillance data during the winter of 2009 to 2010 was an estimated age-adjusted rate ratio of 1.77 (incidence of 1.92 per 100 000 person-years among influenza H1N1 vaccinated persons and 1.21 per 100 000 person-years among H1N1 unvaccinated persons).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0883073811420872">15</xref></sup> These figures are well within the estimated worldwide population rates found in the literature review summarized by Cheng et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0883073811420872">16</xref></sup> The number of pediatric cases (&lt;18 years old) were not specified in this data; however, the majority of recognized and severe cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome in the metropolitan Hartford, Connecticut, area (population estimate, 1.2 million) would have been referred to our facility. Thus, this study encompasses a representative and expected spectrum of severity in a referred cohort of pediatric patients with Guillain-Barré syndrome. The majority of our patients (87.5%) suffered from the acute demyelinative form of the disease, consistent with the population data reported previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0883073811420872">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0883073811420872">16</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>The present study found that there was a correlation between dysautonomic signs and severity of illness. This was particularly true for the presence of hypertension and tachycardia but severity also correlated with the number of dysautonomic signs experienced by individual children. In this cohort, 69% of patients were hypertensive and 77% had tachycardia, with significant correlations between the highest grade of illness severity (<italic>r</italic> = .98) and degree of hypertension (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .03) and/or tachycardia (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .04). Cooper et al identified a similar proportion of their pediatric cohort (66.7%, 20/30) and also recognized a strong correlation (<italic>r</italic> = .93, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05) with the highest grade of illness severity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0883073811420872">13</xref></sup> However, these investigators reported neither on any other signs of dysautonomia nor the approximation of hypertension to the day of maximum motor disability grade. The incidence of hypertension in adults with Guillain-Barré syndrome has been found to be more variable between 22% to 61%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0883073811420872">17</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Our identification of a critical window of illness severity occurring within a 24-hour period of reaching maximum hypertension may allow astute clinicians to anticipate the needs for maximal supportive measures and the potential transition from decline to nadir into the plateau phase. We could not, however, differentiate a patient’s severity of illness by the mere number of dysautonomic signs because most patients experienced multiple signs.</p>
<p>Respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation occurs in approximately 15% to 24% of pediatric patients stricken with Guillain-Barré syndrome (8% of the current series).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0883073811420872">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0883073811420872"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0883073811420872"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0883073811420872">21</xref></sup> Risk factors correlating with respiratory failure in pediatric patients have been examined in a study comprised of 120 children.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0883073811420872">20</xref></sup> There was the greatest risk for the need of mechanical ventilation when patients had concurrent cranial nerve involvement, elevated cerebrospinal fluid protein levels above 800 mg/L during the first week of illness, and when the initial symptom onset was within the first 8 days after a preceding infection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0883073811420872">20</xref></sup> The presence of dysautonomic signs was not a predictive factor, even though 22.5% (27/120) of the cohort experienced them.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0883073811420872">20</xref></sup> Hypertension associated with acute hypertensive encephalopathy and status epilepticus have been the presenting manifestations of Guillain-Barré syndrome in childhood.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0883073811420872">22</xref></sup> In previously reported series of adult patients, dysautonomia, particularly alterations in blood pressure, either hypertension or more significantly hypotension, has been associated with adynamic ileus, acute renal failure, and death.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0883073811420872">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0883073811420872">24</xref></sup> As distinct from children, identified risk factors for mechanical ventilation from a large multicenter French cohort of 722 consecutive adult patients with Guillain-Barré syndrome included time from symptom onset to admission of less than 7 days, inability to cough, inability to stand, inability to lift the elbows or head against gravity, and increased liver enzymes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0883073811420872">25</xref></sup> Although 15% to 20% of the intubated patients had dysautonomia, tachycardia &gt;120 beats per minute, and/or a rise or drop of &gt;40 mm Hg in systolic blood pressure, each complication was significant (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .0012 and <italic>P</italic> &lt; .0004, respectively) in comparison to those patients who did not require intubation. However, the presence of these signs did not reach predictive significance for respiratory failure in the multivariate analysis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0883073811420872">25</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Subclinical alterations in both parasympathetic and sympathetic function can be identified at disease nadir using a battery of autonomic function tests.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0883073811420872">26</xref></sup> These abnormalities, studied in adults, have documented gradual improvement by 3 months after onset of clinical recovery from the motor deficits.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0883073811420872">26</xref></sup> Disturbances of heart rate variability using 24-hour heart rate power spectrum analysis in an adult series of 35 patients found that one third had serious bradyarrhythmias even with preserved ability to ambulate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0883073811420872">27</xref></sup> This could not be predicted by the degree of disability, need for mechanical ventilation, or the presence of tachycardia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0883073811420872">27</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>In our study, the majority of children with Guillain-Barré syndrome experienced hypertension and tachycardia during the course of their illness, and a greater degree of abnormality correlated with more severe motor disability during their course. While in adults the long-term outcome is usually correlated with illness severity, most children (approaching 80%-90%) fully recover within 6 months of hospital discharge despite the degree of illness experienced; this was the course in our cohort as well.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0883073811420872">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0883073811420872">4</xref></sup> This is likely explained by a predominantly demyelinating disease in children, rather than axonal subtypes, along with clinically less detrimental dysautonomia and good response to plasmapheresis and intravenous gamma globulin therapy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0883073811420872">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0883073811420872"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0883073811420872">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0883073811420872">9</xref></sup> Prognosis for long-term motor sequelae has been suggested to be associated with a younger age at onset and more rapid rates of progression.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0883073811420872">28</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Pain as a concurrent symptom requiring intervention was commonly encountered in this cohort (24/26, 92%). This aspect of care provided to children with Guillain-Barré syndrome has not been emphasized previously. Authors of a recent prospective study of 156 adult patients with Guillain-Barré syndrome followed for 1 year reported that in 36% of patients, the pain was present during the 2 weeks preceding weakness, 66% reported pain within the first 3 weeks, and 38% reported pain as long as 1 year after presentation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0883073811420872">29</xref></sup> Often, the pain intensity was characterized as moderate to severe.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0883073811420872">29</xref></sup> In our series of children, almost all needed some pain treatment during the acute stages of illness. Intermittent narcotic administration was additionally required for moderation of symptoms in 5 children (19%), and more prolonged subacute daily treatment extending over a period of several weeks to months was needed in 36% (8/26), similar to that noted in adults.</p>

<sec id="section4-0883073811420872">
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>This study confirmed the finding that the severity of illness in childhood Guillain-Barré syndrome correlates directly with the degree of hypertension and further found that tachycardia also correlates with severity. Despite the variability of presenting symptoms, the onset of clinically significant and sustained hypertension and/or tachycardia in children occurs within 24 to 48 hours of the maximum motor disability and appeared within the first 2 to 6 days of hospital admission and 9 to 15 days from the onset of initial symptoms. Additional attention should be paid to the need for pain treatment in these children with the potential for a prolonged requirement.</p>
