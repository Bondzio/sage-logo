<p>Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) plays a critical role in initiating type I IFN-mediated innate immunity against viral infections. TLR3 recognizes various forms of double stranded (ds) RNA, including viral dsRNA and a synthetic mimic of dsRNA, poly I:C, which has been used extensively as a TLR3 ligand to induce antiviral immunity. The activation efficiency of TLR3 by poly I:C is influenced by various factors, including size of the ligands, delivery methods and cell types. In this study, we examined the stimulatory effect of two commercially-available poly I:Cs [high molecular mass (HMM) and low molecular mass (LMM)] on TLR3 activation in various human cell types by determining the induction of type I and type III IFNs, as well as the antiviral effect. We demonstrated that the direct addition of both HMM- and LMM-poly I:C to the cultures of primary macrophages or a neuroplastoma cell line could activate TLR3. However, the transfection of poly I:C was necessary to induce TLR3 activation in other cell types studied. In all the cell lines tested, the efficiency of TLR3 activation by HMM-poly I:C was significantly higher than that by LMM-poly I:C. These observations indicate the importance and necessity of developing effective TLR3 ligands for antiviral therapy.</p>

<p>Human hepatic cell line (Huh7) was kindly provided by Dr Charles M. Rice (Laboratory of Virology and Infectious Diseases, the Rockefeller University, New York). Cells were maintained in conditioned DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS, 10 mM Hepes, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin and 2 mM <sc>L</sc>-glutamine at 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p>The brain microvascular endothelial cell line hCMEC/D3 was generously provided by Dr Yuri Perdsisky (Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Temple University, PA, USA). hCMEC/D3 cells were maintained in complete EGM-2 medium (Lonza, Walkersville, MD, USA). Purified human monocytes obtained from Human Immunology Core at the University of Pennsylvania were plated in 96-well plates in complete DMEM with 10% FCS and differentiated into macrophages (MDM) after 5–7 d of culture. Human neuroblastoma cell line CHP212 was obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA, USA). Cells were cultured in ATCC-formulated Eagle’s minimum essential medium with 10% FBS.</p>

<sec id="sec5-1753425912459975"><title>Poly I:C treatment</title>
<p>Macrophages, CHP212, hCMEC/D3 and Huh7 cells were seeded in 48-well plates with a density of 5 × 10<sup>5</sup> or 1 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells/well depending on cell type. Cells were then treated with poly-I:C (LMM, HMM) at different concentrations (1 µg/ml, 10 µg/ml) for 16 h. Untreated cells were included as a negative control (N.C.). In some experiments, poly I:C was transfected by a cationic lipid-based transfection reagent, LyoVec<sup>TM</sup> from InvivoGen (San Diego, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s manual. Briefly, poly I:C was mixed gently with 20 μl LyoVec and then incubated at 18–22°C (room temperature) for 15 min to allow the formation of lipid–RNA complex. The complex was added into cell cultures at a 1:20 volume ratio for further incubation. For the antiviral experiments, Huh7 cells or macrophages were activated by poly I:C for 6 h prior to hepatitis C virus (HCV) or HIV infection as described below. HMM-Poly I:C-rhodamine treated or transfected cells were visualized for rhodamine-positive cells under microscopy.</p>

<p>hCMEC/D3, Huh7, CHP212 and macrophages were cultured on glass cover slips at a density of 2 × 10<sup>5</sup> or 5 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells/well in 24-well plates. For measuring TLR3 protein expression, cells were fixed with PBS containing 4% paraformaldehyde and 4% sucrose for 20 min at 48°C, and then permeabilized in pre-cold 100% methanol for an additional 10 min, followed by 0.2% Triton X-100 for another 10 min. Cells were blocked by blocking solution for 1 h at room temperature. The coverslips were then incubated with goat anti-TLR3 (1:50) Ab in blocking solution at room temperature for 60 min and were subsequently incubated with the secondary Abs (FITC-conjugated donkey anti-goat IgG1) (1:100) for 1 h. For monitoring delivery of poly I:C, the cells were treated or transfected with rhodamine-conjugated poly I:C (10 µg/ml) for 24 h and then fixed.

<p>To determine the quality and size of LMM- and HMM-poly I:C used in this study, we first performed the electrophoresis of both LMM- and HMM-poly I:C. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1753425912459975">Figure 1</xref>, the size of HMM-poly I:C is substantially larger than that of LMM-poly I:C. We then investigated the delivery efficiency of poly I:C in several types of human cells (hCMEC/D3, Huh7, CHP212 and macrophages) either by treatment (direct addition to cell cultures) or by LyoVec transfection using rhodamine-labeled HMM-poly I:C.

<p>Among the family members of TLRs, TLR3 plays a uniquely important role in the generation of innate responses to viral infections, which is because of its ability to sense dsRNA, a common intermediate of viral replication, initiating potent antiviral pathways.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1753425912459975">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1753425912459975">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1753425912459975">18</xref></sup> Various forms of dsRNA, including viral dsRNA, as well as a synthetic mimic of dsRNA, poly I:C, can be recognized by TLR3.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1753425912459975">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1753425912459975">12</xref></sup> Studies from our group and others showed that the activation of TLR3 by poly I:C potently inhibits several viruses, including HSV<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1753425912459975">10</xref></sup> and HIV.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1753425912459975">9</xref></sup> In addition to type I IFNs, TLR3 activation also induces type III IFN expression.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1753425912459975">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1753425912459975">6</xref></sup> Because of the importance of TLR3 in host innate immune responses to viral infections, great attention is now given to the use of effective TLR3 ligands for the treatment of viral diseases, including HCV and HIV.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1753425912459975">28</xref></sup> In this study, we compared the effectiveness of two different sizes of poly I:C in activating TLR3 in several cell systems, showing that HMM-poly I:C is more efficient in activating TLR3 than LMM-poly I:C in terms of IFN induction and antiviral activities.</p>
<p>There are two major ways to introduce foreign dsRNA into cells: viral infection and therapeutic dsRNA, such as RNA interfering (RNAi). RNAi studies have shown that while short interfering RNA (siRNA) duplexes, ranging in size between 17 and 31 nt, are usually well tolerated in cells where no significant innate responses were detected, the introduction of long dsRNA induced much stronger type I IFN and other defense responses in target cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1753425912459975">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1753425912459975">19</xref></sup> These findings suggest that compared with short dsRNA, long dsRNA is more immunogenic, inducing stronger activation of RNA sensors. In line with these important observations, we showed that HMM-poly I:C with sizes of 1.5–8 kb induced stronger TLR3 activation than LMM-poly I:C with sizes of 0.2–1 kb, which was evidenced by higher levels of IFN expression and the inhibition of HIV or HCV. Although the mechanisms for the effectiveness of poly I:C on TLR3 remains to be determined, it is likely that the activation efficiency of poly I:C could be influenced by the size of its molecule and duplex structure that contributes to the binding affinity of poly I:C to TLR3. However, one recent study by Jiang et al. showed that compared with longer dsRNA (with sizes ranging between 308 and 1808 bp), the short dsRNA (58–108 bp) induced stronger type I/III IFN and pro-inflammatory responses (TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1β) in human dendritic cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1753425912459975">20</xref></sup> These discrepancies could be owing to the cell types used in the study by Jiang et al. Monocyte-derived dendritic cells may have a different profile of innate receptors and RNA sensors. In addition, the synthetic bacteriophage and viral dsRNA used in the study by Jiang et al. may have different characteristics to the poly I:C used in this study in terms of the RNA duplex and secondary structure. This assumption is supported by reports that TLR3 activation is highly dependent on the RNA duplex rather than 5’-triphosphate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1753425912459975">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1753425912459975">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1753425912459975">29</xref></sup> Finally, there is no information about whether dsRNA larger than 3 kb could induce type I/III IFNs in the study by Jiang et al.</p>
<p>In addition to TLR3, cytoplasmic RNA sensors (RIG-I and MDA5) also play a coordinating role in the innate immune response to viral infections.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1753425912459975">27</xref></sup> We observed that poly I:C not only induced TLR3 expressions, but also up-regulated the expression of RIG-I and MDA5 in Huh7 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1753425912459975">Figure 6</xref>). These data suggested the possible involvement of RIG-I or MDA5 in poly I:C-induced IFN activation. To explore the potential role of RIG-I in poly I:C-mediated IFN induction, we performed the experiments with Huh7.5.1 cells that had a mutationally-inactivated RIG-I.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1753425912459975">30</xref></sup> We found that poly I:C could activate TLR3 and induce IFNs expression in Huh7.5.1 cells, indicating that RIG-I is not involved in the poly I:C-induced IFN activation in Huh7.5.1 cells. To determine the contribution of MDA5 to the poly I:C action on IFN-<italic>β</italic> we used specific siRNA to knock down MDA5 expression (data not shown) and found that the knock down of MDA5 had little effect on poly I:C-mediated induction of IFN-<italic>β</italic> in Huh7.5.1 cells (data not shown). These findings indicate that TLR3 is a major receptor for poly I:C in Huh7.5.1 cells. The role of TLR3 as the major sensor of poly I:C has also been confirmed by Wang et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1753425912459975">31</xref></sup> showing that the expression of TLR3 in Huh7 cells was necessary for poly I:C-mediated activation of IFN-<italic>β</italic> promoter.
