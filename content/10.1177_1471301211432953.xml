<body>
<p>Welcome to 2012 and our first edition of this New Year. In itself, it is quite a year for the <italic>Dementia</italic> journal as we are now entering our second decade of existence, and for the first time, Sage publications will start to publish the <italic>Dementia</italic> journal six times a year. As founding co-editors of the <italic>Dementia</italic> journal, this is an important milestone as Penny and I have seen the <italic>Dementia</italic> journal go from its initial availability of three times a year in 2002, to four issues a year, which started in 2005, and now to six issues a year in 2012.</p>
<p>This milestone is important for a number of reasons. First and foremost, it will make available additional opportunities for [predominantly] the social domain of dementia to be promoted and celebrated as an integral and validated component of dementia and dementia care practice. That promotion and celebration of the social domain was always an underlying aim of the <italic>Dementia</italic> journal when it was first established 11 years ago, and it remains just as important now. The human and lived experience is the primary epistemological lens through which the <italic>Dementia</italic> journal views the landscape of dementia, with all of its contours: twists, turns, valleys and hills.</p>
<p>Second, the increase in the number of issues per volume will help us to process and publish received articles more quickly in the future than we have been able to manage in the past. In some ways, the <italic>Dementia</italic> journal has been a victim of its own success and it has taken time, faith and financial investment from the publisher to make the <italic>Dementia</italic> journal more responsive to academic and consumer demands in meeting timely publication cycles of accepted articles. To augment this speedier publication cycle, in the last year the <italic>Dementia</italic> journal has also been able to access Sage Publications’ ‘on-line first’ service, which now sees all our accepted articles available on-line and ahead of availability of the paper copy.</p>
<p>The <italic>Dementia</italic> journal will change in other ways too. After a brief lapse to catch up on our publication cycle, Volume 11 will contain a special guest edition on friendships and dementia. This has been produced by Kate de Medeiros (University of Maryland), Pam Saunders (Georgetown University) and Steve Sabat (Georgetown University) and will be published later this year. We are delighted to host and facilitate this important contribution to the dementia field. Indeed, to continue this momentum, special edition for 2013 has already been commissioned and will be guest edited by Dr Richard Ward and Sarah Campbell, both at the University of Manchester, UK, and will be centred on the body and dementia. We are also revising the number of Editorials the <italic>Dementia</italic> journal publishes; it will be reduced from every issue to three times a year. So, if you receive a future edition of the <italic>Dementia</italic> journal that does not start with an editorial that is by design rather than by oversight. Another important change to the <italic>Dementia</italic> journal in 2012 will be the commencement of electronic submissions through <italic>‘SAGE track’</italic>. Whilst we have had direct submissions through contributing author–editor contact since the time of our first submissions back in 2001, 2012 will see us moving with the times and handling the submission and review process electronically.</p>
<p>Talking of change, Penny, Jo, Heather and I would like to say thank you to Will Rushton, the <italic>Dementia</italic> journal’s Publishing Editor at Sage, who is moving on to a new position within the organization. Over the years, Will has been a strong supporter and has been instrumental in championing the <italic>Dementia</italic> journal and its move to six issues a year. Will’s replacement is Rosie Sheridan and we look forward to working with Rosie as the <italic>Dementia</italic> journal moves forward.</p>
<p>Finally, we would like to take this opportunity to thank our Editorial Boards and reviewers for their tireless work in helping to keep the <italic>Dementia</italic> journal going and in fulfilling its aims. Peer reviewing is largely invisible work but it is the lifeblood of the <italic>Dementia</italic> journal. Put simply, we would not exist without the skill, dedication and selfless contribution of the academic, practice and user communities who take time to review submissions for the <italic>Dementia</italic> journal. We extend our sincerest thanks and gratitude to you all.</p>
