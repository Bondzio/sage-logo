<p>The aim of this study was to evaluate the sensation of each tooth type at the cortical level. The tactical sensation from teeth plays an important role in controlling the masticatory system. However, the role of each tooth type has not been determined. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) was used to detect changes in cerebral blood flow in the somatosensory cortex of 12 healthy volunteers. Painless vibrotactile stimuli were applied to 8 teeth (left maxillary and mandibular incisors, canines, 1<sup>st</sup> premolars, or 1<sup>st</sup> molars). The somatosensory cortex was activated during stimulation of all teeth. A comparison of cortical activation revealed significantly greater activation during stimulation of the maxillary and mandibular first molars. However, no significant differences were seen between any other teeth. These results indicate that the first molar is the most sensitive tooth type at the cortical level, and provide basic data on the relationship between input from individual tooth type and brain activation. These data could be useful for understanding the neural mechanisms of individual tooth types.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Tactile sensory information from teeth plays an important role in controlling the masticatory system. For example, dental mechanoreceptors provide perception of the form, texture, and hardness of a food as input to the motor control of masticatory movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022034512450880">Trulsson and Johansson, 1996</xref>). Not including the wisdom teeth (3<sup>rd</sup> molars), humans have 7 types of teeth (central incisor, lateral incisor, canine, 1<sup>st</sup> premolar, 2<sup>nd</sup> premolar, 1<sup>st</sup> molar, and 2<sup>nd</sup> molar). These teeth differ in both form and size, suggesting that the function of each tooth type is different. The bite force of molar teeth is greater than that of anterior teeth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022034512450880">Hidaka <italic>et al</italic>., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022034512450880">Kumagai <italic>et al</italic>., 1999</xref>), while the tactile sensory threshold of anterior teeth is lower than that of posterior teeth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022034512450880">Manly <italic>et al</italic>., 1952</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022034512450880">Loewenstein and Rathkamp, 1955</xref>). Every tooth has a specific function in the mouth. However, there is little physiologic evidence on the neural mechanism of each tooth type.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022034512450880">Penfield and Rasmussen (1950)</xref> investigated human sensory somatotopy and showed the representation of the lip, tongue, and intra-oral cavity. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), investigators have conducted studies of tactile tooth sensation at the cortical level in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022034512450880">Ettlin <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022034512450880">Miyamoto <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022034512450880">Trulsson <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>). These studies revealed that somatosensory cortex activation is observed with tooth stimulation, but possible differences for each tooth type at the cortical level were not revealed. Several human studies have compared peripheral tooth sensation among different tooth types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022034512450880">Manly <italic>et al</italic>., 1952</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022034512450880">Loewenstein and Rathkamp, 1955</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022034512450880">Trulsson and Johansson, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022034512450880">Robertson <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>), but few have investigated the comparison of sensation for each tooth type at the cortical level.</p>
<p>NIRS assesses relative changes in regional hemoglobin concentrations and can be used to quantify cortical activation because of the tight coupling between neural activity and regional cerebral blood flow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022034512450880">Villringer and Dirnagl, 1995</xref>). The purpose of this study was to investigate the sensation from each tooth type at the cortical level using functional NIRS. In this study, we investigated the changes in oxygenated hemoglobin (oxy-Hb) levels in regional cerebral blood flow as an indicator of brain activity in primary sensory cortex by applying vibrotactile tooth stimulation to incisor, canine, premolar, and molar teeth.</p>

<title>Study Population</title>
<p>Twelve healthy volunteers (seven men, five women; mean age = 28.2 yrs; range, 24-34 yrs) participated in the study. All were self-reportedly right-handed. None had a history of neurological or psychiatric illness. All participants had a full dentition with vital teeth and healthy periodontal tissue. Written informed consent was obtained from each person. The study protocol was approved by the local ethics committee and conforms to the STROBE guidelines for reporting observational studies (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.strobe-statement.org">http://www.strobe-statement.org</ext-link>).</p>

<title>Functional Near-infrared Spectroscopy</title>
<p>In the present study, functional NIRS (ETG7100, Hitachi Medical Co., Kashiwa, Japan) was used to detect changes in cerebral blood flow. The device consisted of 2 probes. Each probe has 8 illuminators and 8 detectors in a lattice pattern, resulting in 24 channels. The system uses 2 different wavelengths (695 Â± 20 nm and 830 Â± 20 nm) and measures the time-courses of the levels of oxyhemoglobin (oxy-Hb) and deoxyhemoglobin (deoxy-Hb) as well as their sum (total hemoglobin; total-Hb) at a time resolution of 0.1 sec. Inter-optode distance is 30 mm, and the device is able to detect signals at a depth of approximately 20 mm from the scalp. In this study, we used changes in oxy-Hb concentrations as indicators of changes in the regional cerebral blood volume. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022034512450880">Hoshi <italic>et al</italic>. (2001)</xref> showed that oxy-Hb is more sensitive than deoxy-Hb as a parameter for brain activation in a study in a rat brain model.</p>
<p>To measure changes in cerebral blood flow in the sensory cortex, we applied the probes using the international 10/20 system commonly used in electroencephalography. The NIRS probes were standardized to the bilateral temporal region that covered the right and left somatosensory cortex. The secondary lines of the probes corresponded to the coronal reference curve (A1-T3-Cz; A2-T4-Cz), and the second probe from the top was located at C3/C4. The probe positions were identified by means of a 3D magnetic space digitizer (Patriot, Polhemus, Colchester, VT, USA).</p>
<p>To estimate correspondence between channels and cortical topography, we used a probabilistic estimation method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022034512450880">Singh <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>) that allowed us to register functional NIRS data to MNI standard brain space. Functional NIRS optode positions together with several scalp landmarks were digitized by means of a 3D magnetic space digitizer. From an anatomical database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022034512450880">Okamoto <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>), channel positions were estimated in a standardized stereotaxic MNI 3D brain atlas (freeware available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jichi.ac.jp/brainlab/indexE.html">http://www.jichi.ac.jp/brainlab/indexE.html</ext-link>). Based on the anatomical estimation, we selected channels located over bilateral somatosensory cortexes. Additionally, the NIRS-SPM software (Bio Imaging Signal Processing Lab, Daejeon, Korea; freeware available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bisp.kaist.ac.kr/NIRS-SPM.html">http://bisp.kaist.ac.kr/NIRS-SPM.html</ext-link>) was used. NIRS data of oxy-Hb were statistically analyzed based on the general linear model (GLM), and the p values were calculated. Areas activated in response to each individual tooth stimulation were identified at the uncorrected level of p &lt; 0.005 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022034512450880">Ye <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>).</p>

<title>Tooth Stimulation Task</title>
<p>Participants received tactile tooth stimulation on 8 teeth on the left side: upper and lower central incisor, canine, 1<sup>st</sup> premolar, and 1<sup>st</sup> molar. For stimulation, a motor (VarioSurg, NSK, Kanuma, Japan) that facilitated precise frequency control and a dental handpiece (PMTC100, NSK) that operated with a vertical reciprocating motion were used. Functional NIRS is not affected by body motion or electronic equipment. This dental handpiece was a contra-angle type, to allow the stimulation to be applied to the axis direction in the incisor, canine, 1<sup>st</sup> premolar, and 1<sup>st</sup> molar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022034512450880">Fig. 1A</xref>). The frequency of the stimulation was 40 Hz, and force value was 4.0 N. Frequency and intensity of the vibratory stimulus were measured by means of a piezoresistive force transducer (mod. Briforce 806, Bricon AG, CH-8954, Geroldswil, Switzerland). Before the experiment, each stimulus was tested to ensure that the dental handpiece was touching only the target tooth and to confirm the volunteer did not feel any pain. Each tooth was stimulated 3 times. Each procedure consisted of 3 stimulations and 4 rest periods, each of which was 20 sec in duration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022034512450880">Fig. 1B</xref>). The sequence of tooth stimulation was assigned randomly. To avoid increasing perception thresholds, we maintained the resting durations between stimulations of each tooth at 1 min. During the experiment, the participants were told to remain motionless, and we confirmed that the arms and body were kept still and were not touched. To avoid artifacts from temporal muscle movement, the participant held a trimmed silicon bite block in the right side molars to keep the mouth open in a stable position during the entire experiment.</p>

<title>Data Analysis (hemoglobin data)</title>
<p>Cortical activation was assessed as task-related increases in oxy-Hb levels. The obtained oxy-Hb data were averaged across the 3 cycles of tooth stimulation. To identify the task-related channels, we used the NIRS-SPM software (Bio Imaging Signal Processing Lab; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022034512450880">Ye <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>). By this method, we identified bilateral channel 9 as task-related. Furthermore, a probabilistic estimation method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022034512450880">Singh <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>) was performed to confirm the relevant brain area. The means of oxy-Hb data of bilateral channel 9 during each tooth stimulation task were calculated. Statistical analysis was performed by one-way ANOVA and followed by <italic>post hoc t</italic> tests with Bonferroni correction.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Using painless vibrotactile stimulation to the tooth, we showed that maxillary and mandibular first molar stimulation elicits greatest activation in the somatosensory cortex compared with other teeth. No significant differences were seen between maxillary or mandibular incisors, canines, and premolars. In this study, a task-related increase in oxy-Hb and a decrease in deoxy-Hb were observed. Taken together with results of previous NIRS studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022034512450880">Hoshi <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>), the hemoglobin changes observed by NIRS in the present study reflect brain activation.</p>
<p>The positioning of the functional NIRS probe was evaluated by a probabilistic estimation method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022034512450880">Singh <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>). The group analysis with NIRS-SPM indicated that the primary somatosensory cortex was activated during stimulation of each tooth. This result is in agreement with results of previous fMRI studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022034512450880">Ettlin <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022034512450880">Miyamoto <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022034512450880">Trulsson <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>). In previous research, the discharge frequency differed in direction for each tooth in cats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022034512450880">Tabata and Karita, 1986</xref>) and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022034512450880">Trulsson and Johansson, 1994</xref>). Based on these studies, in this investigation, we stimulated the tooth axis in a downward direction in all teeth. To stimulate teeth, we used a contra-angle handpiece that allowed the direction of the stimulation to be applied to the axis direction in the incisor, canine, 1<sup>st</sup> premolar, and 1<sup>st</sup> molar. We applied 40-Hz non-noxious vibratory stimuli to individual teeth, because we aimed to stimulate periodontal mechanoreceptors. Periodontal mechanoreceptors activate the somatosensory cortex with 20-Hz and 50-Hz vibration stimuli but do not activate with 100-Hz stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022034512450880">Trulsson <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022034512450880">Ettlin <italic>et al</italic>. (2004)</xref> used a stimulation frequency of 80 Hz with maximum force of 4.0 N, and the somatosensory cortex was not activated. Based on these previous results, we believe that the stimulation task used in the present study was appropriate.</p>
<p>The distribution of periodontal mechanoreceptors for anterior teeth is higher than for posterior teeth in cats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022034512450880">Byers and Dong, 1989</xref>). In humans, many previous studies have showed that anterior teeth are more sensitive than posterior teeth. The tactile sensory threshold of an anterior tooth is lower than that for a posterior tooth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022034512450880">Manly <italic>et al</italic>., 1952</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022034512450880">Loewenstein and Rathkamp, 1955</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022034512450880">Johnsen and Trulsson (2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022034512450880">2005)</xref> investigated the differences in peripheral tooth sensitivity between anterior and posterior teeth. These studies showed that, at low tooth loads, the periodontal afferents of posterior teeth were less sensitive compared with the afferents of anterior teeth. However, these results were under low force stimulation. Teeth endure forces much heavier than threshold during biting, chewing, and clenching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022034512450880">Hidaka <italic>et al</italic>., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022034512450880">Kumagai <italic>et al</italic>., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022034512450880">Shimada <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022034512450880">Johnsen and Trulsson (2005)</xref> showed that, under light force stimulation, the discharge rate increased as the tooth load increased. With the heavy force, the discharge rate did not increase and was stable for both anterior and posterior teeth. In this study, all teeth were stimulated with heavy force (the force value was 4.0 N). We therefore assume that the peripheral discharge rate was not greatly different among all tooth stimulation tasks. However, further studies are needed with multiple intensities of mechanical stimulation to reveal the relationship between the tactile threshold and brain activation.</p>
<p>Our results showed that first molar stimulation elicits the greatest activation in the somatosensory cortex compared with that elicited by other teeth. It is probably appropriate, since the first molar receives the strongest force during biting, chewing, and clenching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022034512450880">Hidaka <italic>et al</italic>., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022034512450880">Kumagai <italic>et al</italic>., 1999</xref>). The strong forces experienced may explain the greater cortical activation. There is evidence that the representations in the somatosensory cortex are reconstructed, depending on environmental experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022034512450880">Jenkins <italic>et al</italic>., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022034512450880">Xerri <italic>et al</italic>., 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>There were no significant differences in somatosensory activation between upper and lower teeth. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022034512450880">Robertson <italic>et al</italic>. (2003)</xref> demonstrated that vibration perception thresholds were the same for maxillary and mandibular central incisors. Our results were in agreement with those of that study.</p>
<p>In comparisons of brain activation in the ipsi- and contralateral somatosensory cortex, there were no significant differences. In contrast, previous research has shown that periodontal afferents from one side tooth project to both contra- and ipsilateral somatosensory cortexes <italic>via</italic> the trigeminothalamic tract, but the projection from the contralateral ascending pathway is dominant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022034512450880">Iyengar <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022034512450880">Trulsson <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>). Meanwhile, chewing-side preference (CSP) has been reported to affect cortical activation differently in each hemisphere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022034512450880">Shinagawa <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>). In this study, we did not determine CSP, and therefore cannot address its effects on the cortical activation in our study.</p>
<p>In conclusion, under heavy force, the first molar is the most sensitive tooth type at the cortical level. The results of the present study provide basic data on the relationships between input from individual tooth types and brain activation. These data could be useful for an understanding of the neural mechanisms of individual tooth types.</p>
