<p>The first two chapters of Jeffrey Sluyter-Beltrão’s <italic>Rise and Decline of Brazil’s New Unionism</italic> are absolutely superlative. They ought to be required reading for any sociologist interested in progressive social change in Latin America, or social movements anywhere.</p>
<p>The book addresses an important subject, the rise of Brazil’s progressive and participatory union movement during the years of the military government, and how that movement became passive, co-opted, bureaucratized, and undemocratic. It is a dismaying tale. It is highly consistent with the demoralized tales I have heard from the Brazilian left. It is highly inconsistent with the hagiographic accounts of the Brazilian social movements preferred by American sociologists, who idealize the participatory budgeting and progressive social agenda of Porto Alegre. Sluyter-Beltrão overstates his case somewhat by ignoring the militancy that still occurs in Brazil. However, his critique of the defanging of the Brazilian labor movement is more accurate than not.</p>
<p>Sluyter-Beltrão pays due homage to the standard accounts of this which have come from Brazilian writers. The Iron Law of Oligarchy applies as much to Brazil as anywhere else. The rise of “Lula” to political power required moving from the militant stances needed to take care of workers to the more accommodating moderate positions preferred by the broad electorate. Leaders were co-opted with lucrative government positions. The Partido Trabalhista was corrupted with the bribes and political pay-offs that are required to fund campaigns and win elections in Brazil.</p>
<p>Sluyter-Beltrão adds his own contribution—and it is a fat one. The Brazilian Left was fundamentally structured for maximum fragmentation and internal political warfare. This was papered over during the years of struggle against the dictatorship to obtain popular democratic rights. But the structurally-induced centrifugal tendencies of Brazilian unionism ultimately led to increasingly exhausting and all-consuming factional battles. Ultimately, this would lead to a highly-centralized authoritarian labor movement. Either one side would win and impose its will, or the progressive elite would clamp down on mini-factions in order to prevent internal disputes from paralyzing national action. In Brazil, both occurred.</p>
<p>Sluyter-Beltrão is particularly insightful, original, and useful in identifying the enduring structures that led to endless schism, and continuous, complex, acrimonious factional disputes. The problem was Brazilian labor law. Unfortunately, the devil is in the details of workplace legislation—and the exact mechanics of worker representation were poorly designed. Brazilian union leaders were given large financial budgets—and were given these regardless of performance. They were given few rights to organize on the workplace or incentives to do so. The larger union federations had significant roles in politics, no role in bargaining, and no ability to discipline leaders of constituent unions. The large budgets of individual legally-mandated unions and the political clout of national federations made irresistible prizes for ambitious union leaders to fight over. The lack of control of the union central over individual unions meant that there was no way to discipline or neutralize political opportunists engaging in inappropriate infighting. The lack of ability or incentive for union leaders to actually organize workers over shopfloor issues meant that in times of union opportunity, workplace organization would be led by grassroots militants who would have to make a point of opposing pre-existing union leadership. The attractiveness of the financial opportunities available to sitting leadership increased the likelihood of displacement campaigns and the acrimony associated with union officials’ struggles to survive.</p>
<p>Would that the rest of the book had been this good. Sluyter-Beltrão is of the persuasion that complex stories have to be told in the most complicated way possible in order to develop a “nuanced” narrative. He is also of the persuasion that a book has to have a new “brilliant” idea every page to show intellectual richness. These seemingly attractive ideals lead him down a slippery slope. Things get worse, because the narrative is necessarily very complicated.</p>
<p>First, his account is overdetermined. He only has one labor movement that went moderate, that of Brazil. Creating 3,000 explanations for one event is no more convincing than one explanation. Secondly, complex storytelling masks internal inconsistencies. As the author piles on more “grand ideas,” he undercuts his previous claims. We are given long lists of effects that are caused by fundamental union weakness, and a few pages later given long lists of effects caused by the irrepressible militancy of workers. The strength of particular workers vacillates as the theory of the page requires.</p>
<p>Some of this is just bad storytelling. He insists on strict chronology, while rarely tracing the same actor or the same idea from period to period. The camera jumps from faction to faction in a dizzying manner. There was no reason for the author to eschew tools of effective narration such as timelines, or simple tables listing actors, with their motivations and constraints. Contrast with Ann Mische’s <italic>Partisan Publics</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0094306113477381">2008</xref>) which covers equally complex Brazil’s student movements while maintaining a consistently clear story line, by relying on thematic chapters to make key points.</p>
<p>On the plus side, his coverage of events and people is encyclopaedic and probably accurate. However, even with all of his coverage, he still may have missed some relevant considerations. Factions tend to exist divorced from any particular unions or regions. We get, at most, incidental commentary on bank workers in Rio de Janeiro or workers in Santa Catarina who were more militant than average. However, mapping which unions or regions belonged to what factions could have identified critical determinants of militancy or moderation that would have been crucial to his tale.</p>
<p>However, most books do not have a superlative 75-page beginning. This book does. Factionalism is a problem for Leftist social movements everywhere. Sluyter-Beltrão’s analysis of the causes of that factionalism, and his dire warnings about the effects of that factionalism on the overall effectiveness of the labor movement, are points that need to be taken to heart. A systematic test of Sluyter-Beltrão’s theories would seem to be in order.</p>
