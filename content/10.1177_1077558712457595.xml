<abstract>
<p>The authors validate reported Part D coverage in the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) and assess the impact of misreporting on descriptive and behavioral analyses. MEPS participants with Medicare coverage during 2006 to 2007 were matched to Medicare administrative data. A summary measure of Part D coverage based on several questions has substantial validity (κ = .70) and an agreement rate of 85.1%. Some beneficiaries confused Part D and private drug coverage, leading to both under- and overreported Part D coverage. Accuracy varies little by sociodemographic group. Standard regression models of the determinants of Part D enrollment were estimated with both MEPS-based and administrative data–based measures of Part D enrollment. In this analysis, the signs of the marginal effects were the same, the magnitudes were similar, and mostly the same variables had statistically significant effects in both regressions. Thus, behavioral analyses are largely unaffected by misreporting.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The Medicare Part D program began in 2006 and provided prescription drug coverage to 29.3 million beneficiaries in May 2011. The Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) was used in several published studies of the Part D program (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1077558712457595">Donohue, Huskamp, &amp; Zuvekas, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1077558712457595">Domino &amp; Farley, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1077558712457595">Domino, Stearns, Norton, &amp; Yeh, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1077558712457595">Engelhardt &amp; Gruber, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1077558712457595">Liu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1077558712457595">Millett, Everett, Matheson, Bindman, &amp; Mainous, 2010</xref>). Poor reporting or differential reporting accuracy on drug coverage in the MEPS could affect the validity of studies of Part D enrollment and the impact of drug coverage. We assessed the validity of reported Part D coverage for a sample of MEPS Medicare beneficiaries using their Medicare administrative records. We used multiple measures to assess validity overall and for subgroups. Then we assessed the potential effects of misreporting on a standard regression analysis of the factors associated with enrollment in the Part D program.</p>
<p>Misreported enrollment could be caused by numerous factors, including complexities in the Part D program, salience, and other cognitive factors commonly studied in the literature on survey methods (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1077558712457595">Hill, 2007-2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1077558712457595">Tourangeau, Rips, and Rasinski, 2000</xref>). Some Medicare beneficiaries have difficulty understanding Part D, and many report it is too complicated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1077558712457595">Cummings, Rice, &amp; Hannoch, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1077558712457595">Polinski, Bhandari, Saya, Schneeweiss, &amp; Shrank, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1077558712457595">Rudolph &amp; Montgomery, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Respondents may report Part D coverage as private insurance rather than Medicare. Part D coverage is provided through private plans, either prescription drug plans (PDPs) or Medicare Advantage (MA) plans. The relationship between Part D and employment-related retiree insurance is confusing, because employers and unions may contract with a PDP, contract directly with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to provide a PDP or MA plan, or subsidize retirees who enroll in a PDP. Nonetheless, in January 2008, less than 10% of Part D enrollees were in employer- or union-sponsored plans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1077558712457595">CMS, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Respondents might report Part D coverage when they do not have it. Beneficiaries with retiree coverage received letters reporting their employment-related coverage was substantially equivalent to Part D coverage, which might lead some to report that they have Part D coverage. Some MA plans do not have Part D coverage, although 87% of MA plan enrollees had drug coverage in August 2006 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1077558712457595">CMS, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Medicare beneficiaries who also have Medicaid coverage (“dual eligibles”) are automatically enrolled in Part D, but enrollment is voluntary for other Medicare beneficiaries. Reporting might be more accurate for voluntary enrollees, who must enroll and choose a plan, compared with those automatically enrolled, for whom enrollment is less salient.</p>
<p>Considerable publicity and outreach efforts may have increased accuracy when Part D began. Salience and hence accuracy may have diminished after this burst of publicity.</p>
<p>In the survey methods literature, factors such as longer recall periods and proxy responses typically reduce accuracy. Non-English speaking respondents may also report with less accuracy.</p>
<sec id="section2-1077558712457595">
<title>New Contribution</title>
<p>There have been no studies of the accuracy of reporting Part D coverage in surveys. Related studies have found that, among Medicare beneficiaries, HMO enrollment is accurately reported in the MEPS, but some people with traditional Medicare reported HMO coverage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1077558712457595">Zuvekas &amp; Olin, 2008</xref>). Similarly, the privately insured have difficulty reporting about managed care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1077558712457595">Cunningham, Denk, &amp; Sinclair, 2001</xref>). One older study, using data from before prescription drugs became such a prominent part of health care, found the privately insured poorly reported whether they had prescription drug coverage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1077558712457595">Walden, Horgan, &amp; Cafferata, 1984</xref>).</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section4-1077558712457595">
<title>Data</title>
<p>The MEPS combines two overlapping panels of the noninstitutionalized civilian population to produce annual estimates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1077558712457595">J. Cohen, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1077558712457595">S. Cohen, 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1077558712457595">2003</xref>). A new panel of households is initiated each year and interviewed five times to collect two calendar years of data. The average recall period is 5 months. A single informant typically reports for each household during each interview, and the MEPS asks that the respondent be the family member most knowledgeable about health and health care use in the household.</p>
<p>We examined MEPS questions related to Part D coverage: Medicare prescription drug coverage, Medicare managed care enrollment, and Medicaid coverage. MEPS respondents could report any combination of Part D, managed care, and Medicaid enrollment. For 2006 through 2010, for each person who reportedly had Medicare, each interview asked whether the person was “covered by the new Medicare prescribed drug coverage (also called Part D)” any time during the reference period (round). For each beneficiary in each interview, the MEPS asks two questions to elicit enrollment “in a Medicare managed care plan such as an HMO (health maintenance organization) or PPO (preferred provider organization).” Each interview asks whether anyone in the family was covered by Medicaid any time in the round, and who had coverage. Families that reported Medicaid coverage in the prior interview are first asked whether they had Medicaid coverage any time since the prior interview.</p>
<p>We used these questions to create a summary measure that better accounts for the multiple ways beneficiaries obtain Part D coverage. The summary measure indicates the person had Part D coverage if she reportedly was enrolled in Part D, Medicare managed care, or Medicaid in the reference period. Otherwise, sample members were coded as lacking it. With this measure, dual eligibles are still counted as having Part D coverage even if they neglect to report it, as long as they report their Medicaid coverage. Similarly, beneficiaries enrolled in Medicare managed care are counted as having Part D coverage, because about 90% of enrollees in managed care plans had Part D coverage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1077558712457595">CMS, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>We matched MEPS Medicare beneficiaries to Medicare administrative data. We selected MEPS Medicare beneficiaries who were in the MEPS after Part D began (2006 and 2007) and for whom identification numbers were obtained to permit matching (Panels 10 and 11). In these panels, MEPS respondents reported 4,955 household members had Medicare or were elderly and had other evidence of Medicare coverage in 2006 and/or 2007, yielding 7,293 person-years eligible for matching to CMS data.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1077558712457595">1</xref></sup> Medicare beneficiaries were asked to provide their Medicare number so that their Medicare records could be located and used for statistical research purposes. Under a Data Use Agreement with CMS, beneficiaries in our MEPS sample were matched to their Medicare enrollment data using survey-reported Medicare health insurance claim numbers (HICNs) or social security numbers (SSNs). Complete HICNs or SSNs were reported for 3,383 person-years, and 2,814 (83% of those with complete HCINs or SSNs, and 39% of those eligible for matching) matched to the administrative data on three criteria: identification number, sex, and date of birth.</p>
<p>A logistic regression compared MEPS Medicare beneficiaries that matched to CMS data with the Medicare beneficiaries who did not match exactly or provide their HICN or SSN. Beneficiaries who matched were much more likely to be the household informant, because those present at the interview were more likely to provide identifiers, and they were more likely to be White, have completed high school, and have at least one chronic condition (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1077558712457595">Table 1</xref>). We used a propensity-score reweighting procedure based on this regression to adjust the standard MEPS weights for our matched sample to represent the entire MEPS Medicare population.</p>

<p>The Medicare Part D Denominator files have monthly indicators for Part D coverage through PDPs and MA plans, and enrollment in Medicaid. We used each sample member’s reference period dates to construct indicators for enrollment any time during the round. A minor comparability issue between the MEPS and administrative data was that about 2% of Part D beneficiaries had drug coverage through fee-for-service MA plans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1077558712457595">CMS, 2006</xref>), and they are included in the administrative data for MA plans but not in the MEPS managed care measure.</p>
<p>The number of observations is 7,067 person-rounds, where each sample member has an observation for each interview (maximum of 5) that collected information about her. Because we used all of Panel 11 but only the second year of Panel 10 (2006), only 23.9% of the observations were for the fourth and fifth interviews after the program began.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1077558712457595">
<title>Analyses</title>
<p>We used agreement rates, 2 × 2 contingency tables, and κ statistics to assess the accuracy of reported Part D, Medicaid, and managed care enrollment separately and then combined in the summary measure. We tested for differences in the validity of the summary measure across policy-relevant subpopulations, as well as characteristics related to confusion with private insurance, salience, and interview factors. We studied socioeconomic groups based on age, sex, race, ethnicity, education, marital status, region, and income. The indicators of health and functioning were perceived health, number of chronic conditions (active asthma, diabetes, emphysema, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, ischemic heart disease, stroke, and arthritis or joint pain), cognitive limitations (confusion or memory loss, had problems making decisions, or required supervision for their own safety), and receipt of help or supervision with any activities of daily living or instrumental activities of daily living “because of impairment or physical or mental health problem.” Private drug coverage any time during the year was divided into coverage through an employer or union or other private coverage. Interview language was classified as entirely in English or at least one MEPS interview was in a language other than English. We classified reporting into one of three categories: self-reported indicates that the sample beneficiary was the household informant in his or her last interview (68% of the final matched sample), household proxy (30%) indicates that use data were reported by a proxy living residing in the household (usually a spouse), and nonresident proxy indicates that a person outside of the household reported use data for the sampled person (2%). We classified the time from the beginning of the reference period to the interview date into three categories: ≤3 months, 4 to 6 months, and more than 6 months. To capture announcement effects, interviews were classified by the time since Part D was implemented in January 2006 (first, second, etc., interview). Because the analytic sample uses both years of Panel 11 but only the second year of Panel 10 (2006), only 23.9% of the sample is for the fourth and fifth interviews after the program began.</p>
<p>We investigated whether reporting errors in MEPS lead to systematic biases in behavioral analyses by estimating pairs of Part D coverage regressions using the MEPS and administrative data measures, respectively, as the dependent variable and comparing the results. The independent variables in each regression were an identical set of sociodemographic covariates often used in models of health insurance.</p>
<p>All the analyses accounted for the complex sample design of the MEPS. Accounting for stratification and geographic clustering also corrects for clustering at the household and individual level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1077558712457595">Williams, 2000</xref>), clustering that occurs for rounds within persons, and because household-reported and administrative data–based measures of enrollment were estimated using the same matched sample of beneficiaries. We used Taylor linearization for the standard errors of the marginal effects from regressions and balanced repeated replication to test differences in κ statistics across subpopulations.</p>

<p>Our MEPS summary measure of Part D coverage combines questions on all three topics to reduce the impact of underreported Part D and Medicaid coverage. An affirmative response to any of these questions was coded as Part D coverage. Otherwise, sample members were coded as lacking it. We included all sample members reportedly enrolled in Medicare managed care plans, because false negatives for Part D were 26.9% of this group, outweighing the 17.2% of beneficiaries in managed care plans incorrectly flagged as having Part D coverage in the summary measure. The last part of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1077558712457595">Table 2</xref> shows good agreement for this summary measure, 85.1%, and a κ statistic of .70 indicating substantial agreement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1077558712457595">Landis &amp; Koch, 1977</xref>).</p>
<p>Validity varied somewhat between the MEPS summary measure and administrative data with some personal and interview characteristics (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1077558712457595">Table 3</xref>). For most characteristics, similar percentages of beneficiaries had Part D coverage, and the agreement rate was consistently between 79% and 88% across characteristics. Overreporting was greatest in the West and for beneficiaries who reported employment-related drug coverage. Coverage was overreported by 11% when the recall period was 1 to 3 months. Underreporting was greatest for beneficiaries who reportedly had private drug coverage that was not employment related. In terms of the κ statistic, accuracy was worst for beneficiaries who reported private drug coverage (κ = .50-.52). Older beneficiaries were less likely to accurately report, and beneficiaries with chronic conditions were more likely to report accurately, perhaps because their greater need for medications makes their coverage more salient.</p>

The signs of the marginal effects were the same, the magnitudes were similar, and mostly the same variables had statistically significant effects in both regressions. For example, in the MEPS regression, women were more likely by 7.1percentage points to enroll in Part D, and they were more likely by 10.5 percentage points in the administrative data regression. The marginal effects of residing in urban areas, number of conditions, and the age categories did not differ significantly between the two regressions, even though tests of whether the marginal effects differed from zero varied between the regressions. The effects of being Hispanic and English proficiency, measured by whether the interview was conducted in English, differed between the regressions.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The Medicare Part D program is a public program providing prescription drug benefits through private plans. In our analysis of the MEPS linked to administrative data, most beneficiaries accurately reported their Part D coverage through specific sources, but sometimes they had coverage they did not report. Beneficiaries with Part D coverage, especially those in Medicare managed care, often failed to report their Part D coverage. They somewhat more accurately reported their enrollment in Medicare managed care, which very often includes Part D coverage. They even more accurately reported their enrollment in Medicaid, which automatically provides Part D coverage. By combining the answers to questions on three topics (Part D, Medicaid, and Medicare managed care), we obtained a summary measure of Part D coverage in the MEPS that substantially agrees with Medicare administrative data. For the summary measure, we assumed that those who reported being in Medicare managed care had Part D coverage, which results in higher agreement both in this group and for all beneficiaries, but analyses of Part D coverage among managed care plans are not feasible.</p>
<p>The agreement rate for the summary measure was consistently between 79% and 88% across health and socioeconomic subgroups, and analyses of the covariates of Part D enrollment are mainly robust to misreporting, but there are differences between the MEPS and administrative data. Some beneficiaries confused Part D and private drug coverage, leading to both under- and overreported Part D coverage. Older beneficiaries and those with no chronic conditions had lower agreement rates, so analyses of these smaller subgroups should be undertaken with some caution. Multivariate estimates of the effects of ethnicity and language on enrollment appear to be sensitive to whether enrollment was measured using the MEPS or administrative data. In the univariate statistics, however, Hispanics and non-English speakers did not have lower agreement rates than non-Hispanics and English speakers, but we did not have sufficient sample sizes to directly assess interactions between these two factors.</p>
<p>The accuracy of the summary Part D measure (85% agreement) compares favorably with reporting insurance characteristics in other surveys. The privately insured less accurately report whether their plan is an HMO (76%) or has a provider network (80%; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1077558712457595">Cunningham et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1077558712457595">Reschovsky, Hargraves, &amp; Smith 2002</xref>). Privately insured persons are similarly accurate in reporting whether their plan covers hospital inpatient care (86%) and less accurate in reporting whether other services are covered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1077558712457595">Walden et al., 1984</xref>).</p>
<p>We note four potential methodological limitations. First, our matched sample is not nationally representative of Medicare beneficiaries, because only 39% of sample members matched mostly because identification numbers were not provided. For example, beneficiaries with chronic conditions were more likely to match to the administrative data, and beneficiaries with chronic conditions were more likely to report accurately. However, the characteristics of beneficiaries in our matched sample mirror those of the full sample of MEPS Medicare beneficiaries when using weights adjusted for differential matching. Second, when respondents reported private drug coverage, we could not verify whether the sample member had that in addition to Part D coverage, or whether the plan was obtained through an employer. Third, the MEPS does not ask about private fee-for-service plans contracting with Medicare, another minor source of Part D coverage. Finally, we analyzed data from the beginning of the Part D program, and reporting may have changed.</p>
<p>Although administrative data contain a gold standard measure of program enrollment, they cannot be used for some types of research, so it is important to have accurate measures of enrollment in survey data. The validity of the MEPS summary measure facilitates studies of characteristics not typically found in administrative data, such as studies of the effects of income, functioning, and attitudes on enrollment. Surveys with samples drawn from administrative data, such as the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey, can also be used to study those topics. Administrative data from one program cannot be used to compare populations with different sources of drug coverage. The validity of the MEPS measure facilitates studies comparing drug coverage among Medicare beneficiaries with other insured populations and studies using the near elderly as a comparison group, as well as studies pooling people with drug coverage from different sources.</p>
<p>This study confirms the utility of the MEPS for studies related to Medicare Part D enrollment. Our study also suggests other surveys may be able to ascertain Part D enrollment with questions that account for the multiple paths to Part D coverage.</p>

<p>Among Medicare beneficiaries, 97.7% reported Medicare and 2.3% were elders with other evidence of Medicare coverage, such as reporting a medigap plan. The MEPS did not attempt to collect identifiers for matching from those who did not report Medicare. The propensity score reweighting accounts for any observed differences between analytic sample and other Medicare beneficiaries, including the 2.3% who did not report Medicare coverage.</p>
