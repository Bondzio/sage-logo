<title>FlowSight Imaging Flow Cytometer</title>
<p>The FlowSight is a compact and affordable 12-channel flow cytometer with fluorescence sensitivity and the ability to produce imagery of every cell. The modular FlowSight can be upgraded in the factory or the field with up to four lasers, a 96-well AutoSampler, and a quantitative imaging package. The FlowSight complements the Amnis ImageStream<sup>X</sup> imaging flow cytometer, a high-resolution microscope for cells in fluid suspension that enables numerous image-based assays in rare subpopulations.</p>

<title>W130i Dynamic Light-Scattering System</title>
<p>According to Avid Nano, this new high-sensitivity dynamic light-scattering system for size and molecular weight measurement of proteins, biomolecules, and nanoparticles delivers outstanding performance from only 5 µL of sample in seconds.</p>
<p>Critical to the W130i’s performance is the integration of Avid Nano’s SABRe (stabilized anti–back reflection) optical design. The result is an optimized measurement performance that is immune to reflections and permanently mechanically stable. The BladeCell cuvette combines a disposable sample holder with the measurement quality of a quartz cuvette. Built-in compatibility with standard fluorescence cuvettes and flow cells makes the W130i versatile.</p>

<title>CESI 8000 High-Performance Separation-ESI Module with OptiMS Technology</title>
<p>This CESI sprayer combined with new capillary electrophoresis (CE) instrumentation is specifically designed for mass spectrometry (MS), enabling a robust, high-sensitivity interface of CE with MS while providing a broad range of analyte coverage complementary to liquid chromatography–MS (LC-MS) and gas chromatography–MS. OptiMS Technology integrates an intrinsically low-flow CE separation (as low as 10 nL/min) with electrospray ionization (ESI) in a single, dynamic process that takes place within a capillary. The new process is referred to as CESI. To achieve CESI, the distal end of the capillary is porous to ion flow, allowing the electrophoresis circuit to be bridged and ESI to be initiated within the same device.</p>
<p>CESI-MS is capable of generating separations of peptides with a high peak capacity (&gt;320), allowing the analysis of very complex samples at the proteome level. The ultra-low-flow rates used by CE effectively reduce ion suppression and make it possible to detect posttranslational modifications such as phosphorylation and sialylation, which typically hamper efficient ionization. High-separation efficiency and sensitivity permit the detection of peptides present in low abundance at concentrations in the picomolar range. The selectivity of CE in front-end separation further enables the characterization of intact proteins, their isoforms, cleaved fragments, and complexes.</p>
<p>CESI 8000 with OptiMS Technology from Beckman Coulter also provides fast and efficient separations of drugs, drug metabolites, organic acids, amino acids, low molecular weight amines, peptides, nucleic acids, and nucleosides. Molecules often missed or altogether undetectable by technologies such as reversed-phase LC-MS now become visible with CESI 8000.</p>
<p>Easy switching between LC-ESI-MS and CESI-MS allows the addition of CESI to existing workflows. The CESI 8000 is installed on a height-adjustable, gear-driven portable laboratory bench so it can be rapidly set to the proper height of a mass spectrometer. Plug-and-spray adapters are available for top brand nanosources.</p>

<p>According to Fluidigm, its new BioMark HD System is designed to deliver the sensitivity and throughput needed to study gene expression down to the single-cell level—especially with limited amounts of sample or rare populations of cells. By incorporating a new fast thermal cycling protocol, the BioMark HD System reduces time-to-result by increasing the throughput of the original system twofold. Users now have the ability to generate more than 50 000 data points in one day with only one user. The fast thermal cycling protocol is compatible with commercially available assays and yields data that are equal in quality to standard cycling protocol data. The BioMark HD platform continues to use Fluidigm’s nanofluidic technology and supports all the applications of the original BioMark System, including gene expression, single-cell gene expression, and genotyping. Using Digital Array chips, the BioMark HD System performs common digital PCR applications, such as mutation detection, copy number variation, and absolute quantitation of nucleic acid sequences.</p>

<title>IN Cell Analyzer 6000</title>
<p>The IN Cell Analyzer 6000 is a high-performance, laser-based, confocal imaging platform designed for demanding high-content cellular assays and screens, including live-cell assays, 3D imaging, co-localization studies, and imaging of assays with low signal. In contrast to conventional fixed-aperture confocal systems, the IN Cell Analyzer 6000 has an optical system that features a variable, iris-like aperture that mimics the action of the eye. The fully adjustable aperture is intuitively controlled via the user interface and can be adjusted to be used in open mode to maximize speed, full confocal mode to maximize image quality and background rejection, or any setting in between to optimize the imaging performance of a specific biology for each channel of an assay. Incorporating the latest generation scientific CMOS camera, which delivers a 4× larger field of view with 5× less noise than traditional CCD cameras, the IN Cell Analyzer 6000 delivers significantly increased sensitivity and reduced exposure times.</p>

<title>samX Acoustic Biosensor</title>
<p>samX is a high end addition to the sam range of acoustic biosensors that uses SAW’s surface acoustic wave technology to detect mass binding and protein conformational changes on whole cells. SAW’s range of sam acoustic biosensors do not require complex labeling methods, are real time rather than equilibrium, and can be used to investigate living cells rather than fixed cells or purified proteins. The new samX has two sensor chips for higher end users, rather than the single chip of existing sam5 models, increasing the number of channels to eight, further facilitating the parallel processing of samples. Using sophisticated fluidics, each channel can by used independently or via sequential combinations of 4 × 2, 2 × 4, or 1 × 8 channels. This optimizes user workflow, regardless of whether discrete or common reagents need to be delivered to particular sensor chip positions. In addition, different ligands can now be immobilized online at each chip position automatically, without the need for offline protein loading.</p>

<title>Cell Metric</title>
<p>Engineered to provide a high-throughput workflow solution to screen for colonies from single-cell cloning experiments, Cell Metric uses its non-image-based focusing to identify every healthy, viable cell clone from large multiwell screening projects and to track the visual history of the colonies back to single cells by imaging the whole well, right up to the edge. The Cell Metric system’s imaging technology overcomes the problems of shadowing and edge effects associated with current imagers. The platform provides complete and accurate cell measurements, without removing the cells from the culture plate and without the addition of stains and dyes to ensure cells are suitable for use in downstream experiments.</p>
<p>Cell Metric is programmed to provide real-time, user-defined metrics on the cell number, confluence or density, colony count, and variations in cell morphology, including viability and mitotic index, and can rapidly process samples in lidded 6-, 12-, 24-, 96-, or 384-well microplates. Linking the Cell Metric system with a robotic arm and plate stacker provides a complete walk-away solution, with environmental control for large plate numbers and multiuser projects or where longer term growth and kinetic studies are required.</p>

<title>HistoChill</title>
<p>This new low-temperature, mechanically refrigerated bath for the rapid freezing of tissue samples operates down to −80 °C without the need for expendable refrigerants. Using a liquid medium, the compact tabletop HistoChill rapidly and thoroughly freezes samples to minimize ice crystal formation compared with the slow freezing rates encountered in a cryotome. Frost buildup is minimized while introducing and extracting samples from the bath through integration of a warming loop on the upper outside wall of the refrigeration chamber. A hinged and insulated lid provides easy access to the bath. The HistoChill is available in two configurations: the basic HistoChill for general freezing applications and the advanced model with built-in magnetic stirrer and temperature control. The advanced model also includes digital set point and temperature indication.</p>
