<abstract>
<p>This paper addresses the potential benefits of Child Savings Accounts (CSAs) in citizen–government partnerships on poverty reduction. CSA policies from 10 countries/regions in the world with official governmental website information are analyzed in terms of purpose, target age, account opening process, benefits, contributions, match, and fund usage as possible learning lessons for the USA. All 10 countries/regions with national CSA policies target low-income or disadvantaged children through five elements: 1) seed money for children’s education funds; 2) matching fund; 3) school attendance requirements; 4) graduation as a requirement; and 5) income determination. Aversion to higher taxes may still create difficulties in funding.</p>

<p>Despite being one of the wealthiest countries in the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0020872810392810">International Monetary Fund, 2010</xref>), 12.5 percent of the US population is living in poverty, including 18 percent of its children (based on 2005 data, as cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0020872810392810">US Census Bureau, 2008</xref>). Compared with other Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development [OECD] countries, the USA had the third highest <italic>relative</italic> poverty rate among children (22.4%), counting those in families with less than 60 percent of the median family income – this is only 3.8 percent lower than the 26.2 percent rate in Mexico (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0020872810392810">United Nations Children’s Fund [UNICEF], 2000</xref>). In 2008, only Turkey and Mexico among the OECD countries had greater rates of overall relative poverty than the USA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0020872810392810">OECD, 2008</xref>). Poverty is associated with a variety of social problems, including poor public health outcomes and increased crime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0020872810392810">Do and Iyer, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0020872810392810">Schootman et al., 2008</xref>). Education has been shown to be an effective means of reducing poverty and fostering economic development through increases in productivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0020872810392810">Brady et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0020872810392810">Sperling, 2008</xref>). However, education is not always attainable for children in low-income families. When children do not see education as an attainable goal, efforts to excel in school are minimized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0020872810392810">Elliot and Sherraden, 2006</xref>), suggesting that children of poor families fail to graduate not because of innate deficiencies, but rather due to a lack of resources and encouragement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0020872810392810">Elliot and Sherraden, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0020872810392810">Kanbur, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Poverty during childhood increases the likelihood of poverty during adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0020872810392810">Sherraden et al., 2007</xref>). This paper analyzes the use of a national policy to stop the vicious cycle of poverty by addressing it <italic>when it starts</italic>. Through research on Child Savings Accounts (CSAs) implemented in other parts of the world, our hope is to lay a foundation to persuade individualistic societies such as the USA to support projects that aim to reduce poverty. There are a variety of CSAs in the world, whether publicly or privately established, from the commercial financial products targeted at the wealthy to cash transfers for the poor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0020872810392810">Meyer et al., 2008</xref>). Of interest here are needs-based cash transfers provided to poor children through public policy, with the expressed intent of cultivating human capital (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0020872810392810">Reimers et al., 2006</xref>). When we use the term CSA, we refer to the cash transfer policy designed to help families pay for their children’s future education.</p>
<p>First, we searched for information about the CSA concept and then used internet searches to find public policies that establish child savings accounts that are endorsed and implemented by the governments of various countries around the world. Additionally, a historical analysis examines efforts to start a demonstration child savings project in the USA, illustrating the application of global learning and the potential obstacles that challenge the full implementation of a national CSA policy. The resulting knowledge will facilitate the refinement of CSA-related policies both in the USA and in other countries.</p>
<sec id="section1-0020872810392810">
<title>Information gathering and selection</title>
<p>The information on CSAs for this paper was obtained through systematic reviews of the literature on CSAs using search engines such as Google and databases such as EBSCO. Following the initial thorough review of the literature, CSA policies were identified in nine countries. Additionally, the Children’s Development Bank was utilized because of its multi-regional extent, because it is not a commercial product, and because it serves the poorest children. Following systematic searches with the goal of identifying CSA policies, the official national website for each CSA selected was accessed to obtain current and specific information on each of the policies. National websites for each country were accessed in the original language (i.e. Spanish for Mexico) or in English.</p>
<p>CSAs were selected for inclusion based on the following inclusion criteria: CSAs as a national (or regional) policy implemented by governmental entities, consisting of cash transfers in the form of seed (initial) deposits and/or matching of funds in savings accounts for children up to the age of 18. Commercial child bank accounts were excluded, as were conditional transfers that did not comprise a savings account. Charity cash transfer programs implemented by charity organizations and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) were also excluded, as these do not constitute policy.</p>

<title>Poverty reduction strategies</title>
<p>The structural causes of global poverty (such as racism) lead to the implementation of poverty remediation in the form of economic and social policy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0020872810392810">Lazarus, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0020872810392810">Schweickart, 2008</xref>). Though perceived as a wealthy, developed country, the USA presents unique problems in addressing poverty due to a long-ingrained belief in the individual as being responsible for personal economic success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0020872810392810">Katz, 1989</xref>). Changing policies to reduce poverty has not been a high priority in the USA, and this low interest in poverty reduction can be explained, at least in part, by the lack of political influence wielded by the poor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0020872810392810">Danziger, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0020872810392810">Lindsey, 2004</xref>). In the USA, the poor are discriminatorily perceived as a burden on the back of already overburdened taxpayers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0020872810392810">Lindsey, 2004</xref>). Policies that place conditions on the poor in exchange for aid have been more palatable to voters than those that require income redistribution or the sharing of power and other resources. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0020872810392810">Wilson (1987)</xref> argues that only policies that serve a broad slice of the population garner solid popular and political support. Welfare-labeled programs, such as the Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) implemented in the USA since 1996, carry a stigma that reduces public generosity and cripples delivery effectiveness.</p>
<p>The perception of the poor as unworthy is deeply ingrained in the American ethos, with a general view that people must obtain resources through their own efforts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0020872810392810">Weber, 1930/2001</xref>). We believe that additional policies are needed to lift people out of poverty, rather than simply sustain them day-to-day. While public policy addresses immediate needs in the form of income support, long-term policy on poverty remediation is of critical importance. Policy must address the factors that produce inequality and stigma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0020872810392810">Katz, 1989</xref>), especially in a country with a dual welfare system. One branch in the duality, providing income support for the poor while simultaneously penalizing them for their assets, underscores its counterpart of facilitating asset accumulation among the non-poor by delivering tax breaks. However, the way out of poverty is not through consumption alone, but through the accumulation of assets. The dual system described above is yet another example of structural policy inequities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0020872810392810">Sherraden, 1991</xref>).</p>

<title>Child Savings Accounts (CSAs) around the world</title>
<p>Many countries are addressing the poverty issue through CSAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0020872810392810">Meyer et al., 2008</xref>) and/or other similar policies, such as the conditional cash transfers commonly found in Latin America (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0020872810392810">Fiszbein et al., 2009</xref>). CSA policies allow the accumulation of assets, which may be used by the child for the purpose of wealth accumulation and provide children with the ability to prepare for life’s challenges, such as paying for college or facing an economic crisis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0020872810392810">Meyer et al., 2008</xref>). These asset-based child allowance approaches appear to address most of the issues associated with poverty reduction and may take the form of matched savings accounts for low-income persons – typically used for home-ownership, post-secondary education, and/or small business development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0020872810392810">Curley and Sherraden, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>This analysis focuses on government CSA policies through examining data extracted from the official government websites and refereed journals (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0020872810392810">Fiszbein et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0020872810392810">Meyer et al. 2008</xref>). Ten countries/regions in the world which have already delivered national CSA policies are listed alphabetically in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0020872810392810">Table 1</xref>, with policy descriptions in seven areas: characteristics and procedures, purpose, age eligibility, assessment means, tax criteria, ‘seed’ component, and matching from the government. Through website searches, we found that four of these programs are being implemented in Asia, two in Europe, one in Latin America, one in New Zealand, and two in North America. The USA is not among the chosen countries because only a demonstration project – not a national policy – is supported by pilot funding until 2014.</p>

</table-wrap-foot>
</table-wrap>
<p>All ten countries/regions with national CSA policies target populations of low-income or disadvantaged children, although some, such as the United Kingdom, provide universal programs with additional benefits to the poor. However, these countries use different criteria to classify ‘a low-income child’. These criteria include young children (under age 6), street and working children, or all children (variously defined as people under age 17, 18, or 21). Financial benefits are provided through individual contributions (<italic>n</italic> = 8), an initial contribution from the government (<italic>n</italic> = 7), and government matching of individual contributions (<italic>n</italic> = 6). Six of these programs (Canada, Hong Kong, South Korea, Singapore, Puerto Rico, and Mexico) offer incentives for educational goals.</p>
<p>Because these CSA policies are relatively new, no data exist on the outcomes toward poverty reduction over time. A primary objective of these policies is to increase parental saving rates, particularly among those with low levels of savings. Preliminary data from the UK’s Child Trust Fund is very positive.

<title>Learning through the world’s CSA policies</title>
<p>The ten policies highlight five major elements: 1) seed money for children’s education funds; 2) matching fund; 3) school attendance requirements; 4) graduation as a requirement; and 5) income determination. Whether a universal program, means-tested or income-indexed, these policies also determine how a family can withdraw funds for children’s education. The various definitions of ‘children’, based on the country’s definition (17, 18, or 21), identify a cultural dimension for policy-makers to consider when it comes to policy implementation. The consideration must be in line with other policies, such as child protection and child labor laws that are currently implemented in the country. The main purpose of any CSA policy is to promote asset accumulation, but the manner in which the accounts are set up (matching funds, specified purpose for funds) can foment other policy goals of the country, such as promoting personal responsibility and self-help through savings.</p>
<p>The self-help aspect is particularly important for the implementation of a Child Savings Account policy in the USA because many Americans do not support policies that promote dependency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0020872810392810">Lindsey, 2004</xref>). It is also necessary to consider whether to propose a universal or means-tested policy. Policies that target only the poor may increase stigmatization, especially when the recipients must be present to claim the fund. At the same time, there is much more support for universal programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0020872810392810">Lindsey, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0020872810392810">Wilson, 1987</xref>). While Child Savings Accounts promote educational or business start-up purposes and serve to build assets among children, specific policies must also include additional policy goals. Several countries examined in this paper have implemented CSA policies with educational requirements which aim to promote the creation of human capital. If such a policy is to be implemented in the USA, policy makers must be diligent in determining the criteria for how the money is to be spent on education. On the one hand, creating restrictions as to how the money may be spent may contradict the value of personal freedom which was so eloquently defended by authors such as Milton <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0020872810392810">Friedman (1962/2002)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0020872810392810">Frederick Hayek (1944/1994)</xref>, but such restrictions can ensure that money is spent with the purpose of breaking the cycle of poverty through the provision of education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0020872810392810">Hughes, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0020872810392810">Tilak, 2007</xref>). Policies with educational requirements have the potential to promote societal development.</p>
<p>CSA policies are not without problems or opponents. Hong Kong’s CSA requires that a beneficiary child be assigned a development counselor in charge of helping the child to create an individual development plan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0020872810392810">Child Development Fund, 2008</xref>). The goals of the individual development plan are agreed upon by the child and counselor under a supervisory process. When the child meets their personal goals, the transfer of capital is effected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0020872810392810">Child Development Fund, 2008</xref>). However, this plan requires enormous personnel resources, which makes it impractical as a universal policy.</p>
<p>The Child Trust Fund in the UK, axed in 2010 immediately after the coalition government took office (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0020872810392810">Simon, 2010</xref>), was criticized for the yearly price tag of £400 million. Its opponents have argued that their priority is to cover immediate basic needs, not education. Moreover, given the uncertainty about the effectiveness of CSAs in reducing long-term poverty, the value of such a large investment has been questioned (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0020872810392810">Kober, 2003</xref>). CSA policies that include conditional elements, such as those in Mexico or Singapore, may exclude poor children from receiving the transfers, as the conditions may be difficult for poor families to fulfill. Conditionality often results in fewer children served and, consequently, may be counterproductive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0020872810392810">Ruckert, 2009</xref>).</p>

<title>CSA proposals in the USA: Current and historical</title>
<p>While other countries are implementing and revising their CSA policies, the USA is still working on its proposals. As of January 2003, over 500 CSA initiatives existed in communities across the USA. Although 40 states have passed some form of CSA legislation, the country still has not implemented a universal, government-operated CSA policy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0020872810392810">Corporation for Enterprise Development, 2008b</xref>).</p>
<p>The CSA concept is currently being demonstrated and tested by the Corporation for Enterprise Development (CFED), in an initiative called SEED – Saving for Education, Entrepreneurship and Downpayment Initiative. SEED is being privately funded by several foundations, including the Ford Foundation, the Charles Stewart Mott Foundation, MetLife Foundation, and the Charles and Helen Schwab Foundation. SEED is led by six national partners: CFED, the Center for Social Development at Washington University, the University of Kansas School of Social Welfare, the New America Foundation, the Initiative on Financial Security of the Aspen Institute, and RTI (Research Triangle International), with the goal of modeling, testing, and informing a universal CSA policy for the USA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0020872810392810">Clancy and Sherraden, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>In the SEED demonstration, accounts are opened at birth and ‘seeded’ with an initial deposit of up to $1000. Over time, the accounts are built up by deposits from family, friends, and account holders themselves, as well as augmented by other public and private sources. The savings are restricted for the primary purposes of financing education/training, starting a small business, buying a home, or financing retirement. The initiative began in 2003 and spanned a total of six years, through 2008 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0020872810392810">CFED, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Several leading economists and social policy theorists have advanced the concept of publicly supported CSA mechanisms that begin at birth. In 1998, Robert Haveman of the Institute for Research on Poverty at the University of Wisconsin-Madison proposed a universal personal capital account for youth that would give each 18-year-old access to funds (as a starting point, he suggested $20,000) that could be used for educational and/or medical purposes. If the educational and medical expenses did not deplete the account, the balance could be held to supplement retirement funds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0020872810392810">CFED, 2007</xref>). Soon thereafter, Richard <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0020872810392810">Freeman (1999)</xref> of Harvard University described a strategy that would endow a trust fund for each newborn American calculated in future value equivalent to this person’s social security pension. Funded through progressive taxes on inheritance, wealth, and income, accountholders would be able to spend only the interest earnings; the principal would revert to a revolving fund that would endow the newest generation of Americans. In 2000, Bruce Ackerman and Anne Alstott of Yale University proposed giving each American child $80,000 as a birthright of citizenship. The $255 billion needed to fund it would come from an annual wealth tax equal to 2 percent of every individual’s wealth in excess of $180,000. Stakeholders would have no restrictions on the use of funds, but there would be conditions under which the funds would become available: high school graduates bound for college would have access to the money for tuition; high school graduates bound for immediate employment would have access to 25 percent each year beginning at age 21; high school dropouts would have access to only the earnings of the stake. The proposal would require, if possible, repayment of the $80,000 upon death, thereby creating a revolving pool of funds for future stakeholders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0020872810392810">Ackerman and Alstott, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>In 2003, Ray Boshara of the New American Foundation proposed that American Stakeholder Accounts be established for each child born in the USA. An initial $2000 deposit would be made as a loan from the Social Security Administration (to be repaid over 10 years upon steady employment by the accountholder). Additional contributions (up to $4500) could be earned for completion of education through secondary school and for employment in public or community service. Contributions by the accountholder, family members, and others would be additional ways to supplement accounts. At age 18, the accountholder would be allowed to withdraw funds for education and/or training expenses, purchasing a home, or starting a business (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0020872810392810">Boshara, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>In 2004, Thomas M. Shapiro of Brandeis University proposed a CSA that would endow every child born in the USA with $1000, funded by public or private funds. Contributions to the account could come from private, employer, or charitable sources, and government funds would match the contributions of low-income parents. In 2007, an experimental CSA project was tested and found to be successful, based on inputs from students, parents, and teachers who participated in a public-school-based program that aimed to help families save funds toward and raise students’ awareness of the importance of college education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0020872810392810">Sherraden et al., 2007</xref>). In other programs, additional yearly deposits could be earned for financial literacy training, graduations, summer employment, and community service (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0020872810392810">Ford Foundation, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>With a CSA, after high school, the accountholder would be able to use the funds toward higher education or training; at age 25 or older, the accountholder could also use the funds to start a small business or buy a home; if accounts were still active by retirement age, they could be used for retirement or to pass on to the next generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0020872810392810">Shapiro, 2004</xref>). In 2006, Peter Barnes of the Tomales Bay Institute proposed the creation of a ‘Children’s Opportunity Trust’ that would serve as an inter-generational transfer fund in which all estates over a certain size (~$1 million) would contribute a percentage toward a trust that would be divided among all American children equally. This could replace the current inheritance tax – so that funds would go directly back into the market through the bank or brokerage accounts (managed by parents) of newborn children rather than to the Internal Revenue Service. The funds could be used for education, first home purchase, or to start a business once the child turns 18 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0020872810392810">Barnes, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>In 2007, Lisa Mensah of the Initiative on Financial Security at the Aspen Institute proposed that all children born in the USA receive a beginning endowment provided by the government to open an investment account (~$500); parents would take these certificates to a participating financial institution to open an account in which deposits would grow tax-free. Contributions from family and friends and matching contributions for low-income children, along with investment earnings, would help the account grow. At age 18, the child could use the assets for any purpose, with incentives for use towards education, home ownership, business startup, or retirement income (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0020872810392810">Aspen Institute, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Federal CSA legislation has also been introduced and is known as the America Saving for Personal Investment, Retirement, and Education (ASPIRE) Act. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0020872810392810">New America Foundation (2009)</xref> is providing leadership in policy discussions around the ASPIRE Act, which would establish a Kids Investment and Development Account (KIDS Account) for every child in America at birth. If passed, the account would automatically be opened when a Social Security number was issued.</p>
<p>With this proposal, the account would be endowed with a one-time $500 contribution, and children in households earning below the national median income would be eligible for a supplemental contribution of up to $500. When the child turned 18 and graduated from high school, money saved in the account could be used to pay for college, provide the down payment on a first home, or begin a nest egg for retirement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0020872810392810">New America Foundation, 2009</xref>).</p>

<title>Challenges of CSA implementation</title>
<p>The creation of savings accounts for underprivileged children has been discussed many times in the US government. It is not a new concept, and major steps have already been taken. The idea of CSA first came about in 1995, before any formal proposal was made known to the public, when Senators Robert Kerrey (D-NE) and Joseph Lieberman (D-CT) ‘proposed KidSave Accounts, into which $500 child tax credits would be deposited by eligible families’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0020872810392810">Corporation for Enterprise Development, 2008a</xref>). After the first policy proposal in 1998, the CSA bill was reintroduced in the 2007 legislation and discussed in 2009 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0020872810392810">New America Foundation, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Policy makers with an interest in poverty reduction have repeatedly proposed policies designed to build assets for children from underprivileged families. However, no country-wide initiative has been successfully implemented. In addition to the lack of unanimous government support, the concept of CSA policy comes with a perceivably high cost. With a US economic system that does not encourage government intervention, any costly program that diverts public funds and adds further taxes for citizens may be difficult to implement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0020872810392810">Michelbach et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>The main questions brought forward are: Will CSA be an expense that Americans decide to adopt or reject? Will the good outcomes outweigh the bad ones? Will the exchange for longer-term benefits be worth it? <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0020872810392810">Gokhale and Tanner (2006)</xref> discuss five major downsides to CSA policies: cost and tax increases; negative effects on labor supply, capital accumulation, and productivity; fiscal imbalance that causes income tax rates to rise; dependency on government intervention; and reduction in the national capital stock for future generations.</p>
<p>As we learn from the world’s efforts rather than waiting for a complete resolution of the aforementioned issues, extra efforts must be made to use longitudinal data to evaluate the long-term impact of a national CSA policy on children and their families. One suggestion is to use comparative data from other countries to identify strengths rather than dismissing the policy upfront as ineffective or inappropriate for the USA.</p>
<p>In countries with strong traditions of transfers for children, poverty has remained low, whereas child poverty has increased sharply in recent years for other countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0020872810392810">Barrientos and DeJong, 2006</xref>), including the USA – the richest country in the world in terms of a GDP of over $14 trillion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0020872810392810">US Bureau of Economic Analysis, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0020872810392810">World Bank, 2010</xref>). However, given the difficulties, crafting legislation that is efficient and effective in addressing child poverty requires careful consideration of the various elements that may constitute such a policy. Countries with CSA implementation incorporate different policy elements, such as requiring educational compliance or implementing universal, means-indexed policies. International experiences reveal policy elements that may be appropriate for the development of CSA policy in the USA, as summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0020872810392810">Table 2</xref>. Specifically, lessons to be learned include ways to efficiently implement CSA policies, establish inclusion criteria that aim to promote human capital development, help children in poor families to embrace the savings concept, eliminate economic disparities and stigma, and promote social and economic justice.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Social scientists present a compelling argument that persistent poverty in the USA is a result of our social and economic policies. Structural causes of persistent poverty dictate the use of a policy approach to find a solution. The past few years have witnessed increases in interest around asset-based welfare in the USA and abroad. Several countries have already enacted progressive CSA policies, although it is still too early to determine the extent of their impact on low-income parental rates of saving and/or attitudes about moving toward future opportunities.</p>
<p>As mentioned, several proposals for CSA policies have been constructed in the USA, but to date no national policy of this type has been implemented there (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0020872810392810">Mensah et al., 2007</xref>). The policy proposals in the USA include many of the elements included in CSA policies in other countries, but even though CSAs have been implemented with some success in several countries throughout the world, the USA presents unique challenges in implementing policies that involve cash transfers for the poor and may result in increased taxes. The perception that the poor should help themselves and not expect handouts from the government is deeply ingrained in the American mentality and may provide resistance to the initial grant of money necessary to seed the accounts. Although legitimacy for CSA may be provided through restricted use of funds and the savings effort required from the beneficiaries, the American aversion to higher taxes may still create difficulties in funding.</p>
<p>After reviewing how other countries implement their CSA policies to safeguard children’s education, we see that CSA policies connect social assets to reduction of child poverty. These policies represent a special kind of product with features that help establish ‘ownership [for every family that] would especially benefit 26 percent of white children, 52 percent of black children, and 54 percent of Hispanic children who start life in households without any significant asset holdings’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0020872810392810">Cramer, 2006</xref>). Costs related to the implementation of CSA policies are inevitable, but if a fair ‘playing field’ is created for all children through the chance to live an ‘economically balanced’ life, then the cost is inconsequential. The success of policy development and reform will be contingent upon the strategic positioning of social workers and other concerned citizens in efforts to establish a national CSA policy. Although this area warrants further research, the current analysis introduces strategies through which CSA policies can effectively address the problems of poverty, providing much-needed opportunities for hope.</p>
