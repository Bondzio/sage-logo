<title>Objective:</title>
<p>The aim of the study was to estimate the maximum incidence of agranulocytosis which clozapine would have caused between 2006 and 2010 had there been no blood monitoring system; and to determine the number of clozapine-associated cases of agranulocytosis and related deaths recorded between 1993 and 2011.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1039856213491990">
<title>Method:</title>
<p>Records associating clozapine use with white blood cell deficiency (WBCD), in the Therapeutic Goods Administration’s Case Line Listing of adverse drug reactions, were examined. The figure of 11,000 was used as the population on clozapine each year from 2006–2010.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1039856213491990">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>Between 2006 and 2010 there were 209 cases of clozapine-associated WBCD recorded, probably caused by clozapine in 141 cases. WBCD caused by clozapine could have progressed to agranulocytosis if clozapine had not been withdrawn. The risk of WBCD/agranulocytosis decreased with increasing duration of clozapine use. Between 1993 and 2011 there were 141 recorded cases of agranulocytosis, and four deaths, from clozapine-associated WBDC.</p>

<title>Conclusions:</title>
<p>During 2006–2010, without any monitoring system, the maximum annual incidence of agranulocytosis caused by clozapine would have been 0.26%. The risks of agranulocytosis, and related deaths, decreased with length of time on clozapine. During 1993–2011 141 cases of agranulocytosis, with four deaths, were recorded in association with clozapine use. The monitoring system could have successfully prevented relatively few deaths.</p>

<body>
<p>Due to the fact that a yearly incidence of agranulocytosis of 1–2%, with many deaths,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1039856213491990">1</xref></sup> was expected when clozapine was made available in Australia, as in the USA, a mandatory national blood monitoring scheme was established to minimize these deaths from agranulocytosis by early identification and clozapine withdrawal.</p>
<p>It is the legal responsibility of drug companies to operate monitoring programs and to ensure that all cases of white blood cell deficiency (WBCD) associated with clozapine use are reported for inclusion in the Therapeutic Goods Administration’s (TGA) Case Line Listing of adverse events involving disorders of blood cells associated with clozapine use. Examination of this TGA collection provides data on the actual incidence of WBCD which – had it not been identified with immediate withdrawal of clozapine – could have become agranulocytosis, and provides a record of deaths due to agranulocytosis. This material is not published but it is readily available by application to the TGA in Canberra, Australia.</p>
<sec id="section5-1039856213491990" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>Approval for this study was obtained from the Low Risk Ethics Committee, ACT Health Directorate. The Case Line Listing of adverse events involving disorders of blood cells associated with clozapine use, prepared by the TGA as part of its Adverse Drug Reactions reporting system, was examined for the period March 1993 (when clozapine was first used) to October 2011. The listing included age and sex; date of reporting; date of onset; outcome (recovered, death, not yet recovered, unknown); time on clozapine before the adverse event; concurrent drug use; and adverse reactions (diagnoses).</p>
<p>All cases with WBCD (a diagnosis of agranulocytosis, neutropenia, leucopenia, pancytopenia or unspecified white blood cell disorder) occurring during 2006 to 2010, and all cases of agranulocytosis and all deaths associated with WBCD occurring during 1993 to 2011, were examined in detail.</p>
<p>To calculate annual incidence rates, the figure of 11,000 was taken as the population on clozapine in each year from 2006–2010, derived by reducing the figure of 11,846 quoted by Malagama et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1039856213491990">2</xref></sup> for 2009 to allow for the trend of a gradual increase over time.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1039856213491990" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>In total, 209 cases of WBCD associated with clozapine use were recorded during 2006–2010 (45, 34, 48, 36 and 46 in succeeding years). Only 64 cases were reported to have recovered. In two-thirds of cases, the outcome was uncertain. Agranulocytosis was diagnosed in 33 cases.</p>
<p>Duration of treatment before WBCD occurred was calculated for these 209 cases. In 47 cases, the duration of treatment was not recorded. These 47 cases were allocated to each time grouping (see below) proportional to the representation of that time group amongst cases with a record of duration of treatment. On this basis, WBCD occurred within the first year of clozapine use in 114 cases (55% of all cases), within the first 3 months in 75 cases (36% of all cases), between 3 and 6 months in 21 cases, and between 6 and 12 months in 18 cases. Some 95 cases occurred after 1 year (1–5 years in 58 cases; longer in 37 cases). Three cases beyond 5 years had cancer, and three had other serious co-morbidities; 21 of the 33 cases of agranulocytosis occurred within a year of commencing clozapine.</p>
<p>Multi-drug use (up to eight other drugs) was recorded in 69 cases (33%). Lithium and sodium vaproate, antipsychotics other than clozapine, and drugs with known association with white cell deficiency, were commonly involved. In 26 cases, WBCD was probably caused by something other than clozapine: the use of interferon and/or a diagnosis of hepatitis C in 13 cases, and another relevant co-morbidity in 13 other cases.</p>
<p>From 1993 to 2011, there were 141 cases of agranulocytosis recorded, including three deaths, and there were 10 deaths recorded in association with WBCD (including agranulocytosis), in six of which clozapine was not the cause of death. Of the four deaths probably caused by clozapine, two occurred within 50 days of commencing clozapine use.</p>

<sec id="section7-1039856213491990" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Pharmaceutical companies are required to report all adverse drug reactions of which they become aware to the TGA. The level of reporting of most adverse effects is not high. Because agranulocytosis is a known adverse reaction of clozapine, monitoring white blood cell counts is mandatory. The special controls on clozapine ensure that sponsoring drug companies are aware of every case of WBCD in clozapine users and that all such cases are reported to the TGA. The TGA asserts that there is no under-recording of cases of WBCD within its Adverse Drug Reactions register. Accordingly, this study included all cases of WBCD associated with the use of clozapine. Importantly, the system only identified WBCD when it occurred, in order to facilitate the prevention of agranulocytosis. It did not prevent WBCD. The number of cases of WBCD would have been no different had there been no monitoring system.</p>
<p>Although lack of quality of reporting for each case was not of great significance for the findings concerning the general incidence rate, findings on duration of treatment before WBCD occurred required manipulation of data to cover omissions, and the low proportion of reported final outcomes may have affected the number of cases of agranulocytosis identified.</p>
<p>Annual incidence rates depend upon the number of persons using clozapine. The number of persons on clozapine in each year from 2006–2010 could not be ascertained and a figure of 11,000 was used, heavily discounting the figure quoted by Malalagama et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1039856213491990">2</xref></sup> for 2009 (11,846) to allow for any increase over time, erring on the side of caution so that incidence rates were more likely to be inflated rather than to be underestimated. Malalagama et al.’s figure excluded persons aged under 18 or over 65, which underestimates the population and inflates incidence figures.</p>
<p>During the five years 2006–2010, there were 33 recorded cases of agranulocytosis (annual incidence 0.06%). The incidence of agranulocytosis is probably an underestimate. Ultimate outcome was not recorded in two-thirds of cases. Some cases of neutropenia may have progressed to agranulocytosis.</p>
<p>During the five years 2006–2010, there were 209 recorded cases of WBCD associated with clozapine use – 209 is the maximum number of persons who could have developed agranulocytosis in association with clozapine use between 2006 and 2010. No additional cases of WCBD would have occurred if there had been no monitoring system.</p>
<p>The occurrence of WBCD (potential cases of agranulocytosis) diminished rapidly as length of use of clozapine increased: 75 cases (36%) within 3 months, 114 (55%) within a year, 95 cases (19 p.a.) after clozapine was used for more than a year, and 37 cases (7.4 p.a.) after 5 years of clozapine use.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, not all of these 209 cases of WBCD would have progressed to agranulocytosis had clozapine been continued. Cases with benign neutropenia need to be excluded. Their number cannot be accurately assessed but it is probably considerable. Neutropenia (diagnosable on the basis of one RED report<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1039856213491990">3</xref></sup>) was sometimes inappropriately diagnosed because aberrant blood test results are sometimes temporary and inexplicable.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1039856213491990">4</xref></sup> Benign ethnic neutropenia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1039856213491990">5</xref></sup> results in a ‘personally normal’ result being interpreted as an abnormality. Rajagopal contends that there are different mechanisms for neutropenia and agranulocytosis. About half of the persons with a history of neutropenia can be successfully re-challenged with clozapine.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1039856213491990">6</xref></sup> It is probable that at least 20% (42) of the 209 cases of WBCD had benign neutropenia. Excluding them reduces the maximum estimate of persons who could have developed agranulocytosis in association with the use of clozapine to 167 (annual incidence 0.30%).</p>
<p>This number (167) is probably greater than the maximum number of cases of agranulocytosis which could have been caused by clozapine between 2006 and 2010, because it includes cases associated with clozapine use but due to other causes. The presence of multi-drug use and co-morbidities casts doubt on the primacy of clozapine’s role as a causative factor in at least one-third of cases. However, more definitively, in 26 cases there was strong evidence that another cause was primary. Excluding these, between 2006 and 2010 the maximum number of persons who could have suffered from agranulocytosis caused by clozapine (if clozapine had not been withdrawn) was 141, with an annual incidence rate of 0.26%. If allowance is made for the 33 cases of agranulocytosis which occurred, in spite of the monitoring system, then the maximum number of cases in which agranulocytosis was possibly prevented by monitoring was 22 p.a.</p>
<p>Throughout the whole period that clozapine has been used in Australia (1993–2011), there were 141 cases of agranulocytosis recorded, only three of which resulted in death. There were 10 deaths recorded in persons with WBCD (including agranulocytosis) associated with clozapine use, but six of these deaths were caused by other disorders. There were only four deaths due to WCBD caused by clozapine. Because the apparent death rate amongst persons with agranulocytosis is very low, it is unlikely that many deaths due to agranulocytosis caused by clozapine were prevented by early detection of neutropenia and clozapine withdrawal. However, this conclusion depends upon the assumption that most deaths were reported to the TGA.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Before 1993, it was estimated that the risk of clozapine use causing agranulocytosis would be 1–2% per year, with a high death rate, if there was no system for early detection of blood disorder and quick cessation of the use of clozapine. Using reports of Adverse Drug Reactions associated with the use of clozapine in Australia (using a modification of Malalagama et al.’s figure as the population of clozapine users), it can be concluded that the maximum annual incidence of agranulocytosis caused by the use of clozapine which would have occurred had there been no blood monitoring of clozapine users would have been 0.26% p.a. (28 cases per year) in the period 2006–2010. The incidence rate would have been much higher than this during the first few months of clozapine use (similar to the initial predictions which justified the implementation of the monitoring system) and would have become progressively less as time on clozapine increased.</p>
<p>There were 141 cases of agranulocytosis, but only four deaths from WBCD caused by clozapine (two in the first 2 months of clozapine use) recorded between 1993 and 2011. These findings are comparable with internationally reported experience.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1039856213491990">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>In Australia, the monitoring system has undoubtedly prevented some, but, as the death rate of agranulocytosis was low, not many deaths.</p>
