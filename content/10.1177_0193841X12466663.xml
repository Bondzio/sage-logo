Sweden stands out as one of the countries with the highest cost (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development [OECD] 2009). In 2006, Swedish social insurance expenditure totaled 447 billion Swedish kronor (SEK)<sup>1</sup> or just below 16% of gross national product (GNP; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0193841X12466663">Försäkringskassan 2007b</xref>). One third of this amount comprises payments to sick and disabled.</p><p>In response to rising sickness absence figures, the Swedish government has launched several actions in order to restrain the development. In 2003, the Swedish Council on Technology Assessment in Health Care (SBU) claimed that a crucial factor for the high sickness absence was the lack of a holistic analysis of the need for rehabilitation early in the sickness absence period. By involving behavioral and physiotherapy competence in this process, the two most common diagnoses of sickness-absent individuals—musculoskeletal disorder and/or mental problems—were supposed to be satisfied. This conclusion is also stressed in a report from the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare from 2004 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0193841X12466663">Socialstyrelsen 2005</xref>).</p><p>In Sweden, as well as in other countries, a large number of programs have been launched in order to identify and provide rehabilitation early in the sickness absence period. Several of them have been evaluated from the perspective of the involved personnel’s experiences and attitudes to the programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0193841X12466663">Statskontoret 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0193841X12466663">Socialstyrelsen 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0193841X12466663">Socialstyrelsen 2000a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0193841X12466663">Socialstyrelsen 2000b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0193841X12466663">Hultberg 2005</xref>; Danemark and Kullberg 1999). However, the overall aim of the programs—to reduce the social insurance expenditure—has not been evaluated to the same extent. This is the case for Swedish programs as well as similar programs in other countries (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0193841X12466663">Dowling, Powell, and Glendinning 2004</xref>, for an overview of the situation in Great Britain and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0193841X12466663">Schmitt, 2001</xref>, for the U.S. case). One interesting exception is Kärrholm (2007) who studies the effect of a Swedish collaboration project during the late 1990s. She finds a reduction of short-term sickness absence of about 5.7 days per month 6 years after entering rehabilitation.</p><p>In this study, we evaluate a collaboration program between the Social insurance Agency and the primary health care. In the program, named Resursteam (RT), the sick-listed individual’s medical doctor, her case worker, a behaviorist, and a physiotherapist meet regularly to discuss and assess the insured individual’s need for rehabilitation. The target group consisted of individuals who were assessed by the medical doctor or the case worker to be at risk of becoming long-term sick. Hence, the aim of RT was to intervene <italic>early</italic> in the sickness absence spell and suggest a <italic>suitable rehabilitation</italic> in order to avoid long-term sickness and early retirement. RT was in place in Uppsala County in Sweden, 2004–2007. Our aim is to investigate whether the program is cost-effective, that is, whether it has succeeded in shortening the sick-spell durations of the individuals who received the program and whether this potential reduction offsets the direct costs of the program (the cost of employing behaviorists and physiotherapists). In contrast to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0193841X12466663">Kärrholm (2007</xref>), we do not evaluate the effect of the rehabilitation; we rather study the effect of the multidisciplinary collaboration program with the primary aim of identifying the need of rehabilitation.</p><p>We have conducted a randomized experiment in which 50 eligible candidates were assigned randomly to RT. The randomization was performed by a random generator within the administration system. Since the experiment was small, we also conducted an observational study. A rich data set including individual (social background variables and sickness absence history) as well as sick-spell-specific information (e.g., diagnosis at sick-spell start) allows us to recreate the selection for RT and to verify this strategy with rigorous sensitivity analyses.</p><p>In general, case workers select candidates for the program based on register information on risk factors of long-term sickness. Medical doctors, on the other hand, make their decision after a personal meeting with potential candidates. Thus, it is reasonable to believe that potential selection problems based on unobservable information are more severe for the group of individuals selected by medical doctors. We investigate if the estimated effect is sensitive to whether the individual is initiated by a case worker or a medical doctor.</p><p>The results from the experiment and the retrospective observational study suggest a negative effect of RT, that is, on average, RT prolongs the sick-spell duration by about 3 months.</p></sec><sec id="section2-0193841X12466663"><title>Sickness Absence and Institutions</title><p>The aim of the sickness and disability insurance in Sweden is to provide the population with protection against financial risk associated with illness and disability. All those who have reached the age of 16 and are resident in Sweden are in principle insured and registered with the Swedish Social Insurance Agency.</p><p>There are two main benefits: <italic>sickness benefit</italic> and <italic>sickness compensation</italic> or <italic>activity compensation</italic>. Sickness benefit replaces part of the income loss during temporary illness. The first 14 days of the illness—the sick pay period—the employer pays the sickness benefits. If the illness lasts longer than 14 days, the employer will notify the Social Insurance Agency of the illness. If the insured individual is a student or unemployed, the Social Insurance Agency enters from the second day of the sickness period (there is one qualifying day in each new sick-spell).</p><p>The Social Insurance Agency assesses the entitlement to sickness benefits. The benefit claimant needs a medical doctor’s certificate after the first 7 days of sickness absence in order to verify a reduced working capacity due to sickness. The number of days compensated depends on the length of time the working capacity is expected to be reduced (written on the certificate). In general, an insured person cannot be compensated for a longer period without regular renewal of the doctor’s certificate. The average number of days between two such renewals is 28 days (<italic>SD</italic> = 91). The level of compensation is about 80% of the sickness benefit qualifying income per year up to a maximum of 7.5 times the price base amount.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0193841X12466663">2</xref></sup></p><p>Sickness compensation or activity compensation is paid to individuals whose work capacity is permanently reduced by at least one quarter for medical reasons: activity compensation for those aged 19–29 and sickness compensation for those aged 30–64. If a temporary sickness period develops into permanent work incapacity, the period with sickness benefits could be extended with a period of sickness compensation. The sickness absence duration of interest in this study is the total period of continuous sickness absence, irrespective of benefit type.</p><p>In addition to providing financial insurance, the Social Insurance Agency has the responsibility for providing vocational rehabilitation in the case of sickness absence. For medical rehabilitation, the County Council (Landsting) has the responsibility. The national rules for how these responsibilities should be carried out are vague and, hence, there is large regional variation in how these responsibilities are shared between the two organizations. For example, there are no nationally stated criteria for when an individual qualifies for sickness compensation.</p></sec><sec id="section3-0193841X12466663"><title>The Program</title><p>In Sweden, the Government has entitled particular resources to finance local projects in lines with the national recommendations of a holistic analysis of the need for rehabilitation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0193841X12466663">3</xref></sup> RT is an example of such a local project.</p><p>In March 2004, the Social Insurance Agency in Uppsala and the Uppsala County Council made an agreement to introduce RT in all local care centers in Uppsala County.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0193841X12466663">4</xref></sup> The Social Insurance Agency in Uppsala purchased 1,400 additional behaviorist and physiotherapist consultant hours per year in order to enable RT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0193841X12466663">Försäkringskassan 2007a</xref>). This direct cost of RT corresponds to about 3 days of sickness benefits per insured. That is, the Social Insurance Agency compensates an insured for absence due to sickness in three additional days instead of employing theses consultants, given a fixed budget.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0193841X12466663">5</xref></sup> Thus, once in place, RT is not expensive to run. If the program reduces sickness absence with on average 3 days, the revenue offsets the costs.</p><p>The team meets regularly from the date an eligible insured individual becomes initiated into the program. Recommendations are followed up and discussed in the multidisciplinary group until the case is closed.</p><p>Both medical doctors and the case workers initiate eligible individuals into the program. Of all the individuals initiated into RT, about half of them have been initiated by case workers and the other half by medical doctors.</p><p>The case workers based their decision on RT on five criteria, supposed to be risk factors for long term sickness absence:</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p><italic>Medical basis</italic>: Mental diagnosis or musculoskeletal disorder without further specification but 100% reduced work capacity and/or recommended sickness absence for a longer period than 2 months.</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>Sick-spell history</italic>: Several sick spells in the last years.</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>Work</italic>: Demanding work or unemployment.</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>Family</italic>: Sickness absence among other family members, divorce, or disabled children.</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>Motivation</italic>: No future plan to return to work.</p></list-item></list><p>The case worker, basically, had access to register information about the first four risk factors. Since they did not, in general, meet the sick-listed individuals, case workers lacked information on the sick-listed individuals’ motivation to return to work.</p><p>The medical doctors, in general, personally met their patients but, on the other hand, they probably had less information about the sickness absence of the individual but also of the individual’s family.</p></sec><sec id="section4-0193841X12466663"><title>Data</title><p>The population is taken from the database LOUISE,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0193841X12466663">6</xref></sup> which also contains relevant socioeconomic variables for the study. We sample all individuals over the age of 15 years living in Uppsala County in November 2004. To these data, we match register information from the Swedish Social Insurance Agency on sickness absence spells. These data contain all days reported sick to the Swedish Social Insurance Agency between 1996 and 2004. This register from the Swedish Social Insurance Agency also contains sick-spell-specific information such as, for example, the individual’s medical diagnosis<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0193841X12466663">7</xref></sup> at the sick-spell start. Using data from the Social Insurance Agency in Uppsala, we match (using personal identifiers) information about RT participation and if the individual participated in the experiment or not.</p><p>In order to study the effect of RT on the sickness-spell duration, we have proceeded as follows. Since we have register information on sickness absence, we can observe all fresh spell spells since 1996 and onward. Spells are right censored only due to end of study March 20, 2007. We have multiple sick spells for most of the individuals in our data. For comparison individuals in the observation study, we use the first sick spell beginning after January 1, 2004, that is, when the RT program was introduced. In the within-individual analysis (i.e., we stratify on the individual), we compare this spell with the first previous sick spell starting after January 1, 2001. In the experimental study (started in April 13, 2006), we simply compare the sickness durations of the treated group with the sickness durations of the control group.</p><p>In the experimental study, five individuals are missed; one treated individual did not live in Uppsala in November 2004 and it turned out that four control individuals were not eligible (not sick-listed) at the time of randomization. The reason for this last sample selection is simply that the case workers<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0193841X12466663">8</xref></sup> did not have access to updated information about sick spells when selecting candidates (a few candidates were actually not eligible for RT when selected). Hence, the number of individuals who are possible to use for our experiment is 45 (21 treated and 24 controls).</p><p>In the observational study, the treated population consists of 1,089 individuals who received RT. Among those, 13 individuals are dropped because they are not eligible (not sick-listed) when entered as RT participants in the register.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0193841X12466663">9</xref></sup> Thus, the total number of (sick-listed) RT individuals is 1,076. The number of control individuals is 37,938.</p><p>The sick-spells are created from two different registers: the sickness benefit register and the sickness compensation register. The former contains all individuals receiving sickness benefits and the latter contains all individuals receiving sickness compensation or activity compensation. Since a sick spell with sickness benefits can be extended with sickness compensation, we simply add the sick spell with sickness compensation to the sick spell with sickness benefits <italic>if</italic> the former spell started the day after the latter ended. Of all sick spells used, 2% are extended. Among the RT individuals, the corresponding number is 4%.</p></sec><sec id="section5-0193841X12466663"><title>Evaluation of RT</title><p>The probability of receiving a <italic>suitable</italic> <italic>rehabilitation early </italic>in a given sick spell should increase when into RT. That is, RT should speed up the process with rehabilitation and it should also suggest better rehabilitation schemes than otherwise. Hence, the counterfactual state is <italic>not</italic> without preventive measures; the medical doctor and/or the case worker should suggest a rehabilitation plan also without RT. Any potential effect of RT may, hence, stem from (i) a <italic>more </italic>(<italic>less</italic>) suitable rehabilitation and/or (ii) that the rehabilitation takes place <italic>earlier</italic> in the sickness absence period. We cannot separate the relative importance of these two components of RT.</p><p>In the following subsections, we present the experiment and the observational study together with results from these two studies.</p><sec id="section6-0193841X12466663"><title>The Experimental Study</title><p>The randomization started April 13, 2006, and included all individuals who were initiated into RT by case workers. When a case worker had recorded an eligible for RT in the register, a random generator decided if the individual would be a treated (i.e., initiated into RT) or a control (i.e., not initiated into RT). It is important to note that the randomization was done within the administrative computer system that could not be manipulated by the case workers.</p><p>Since the number of individuals in the experiment is few, the division into controls and treated may be unbalanced, that is, the control group and the treated group may differ with respect to important explanatory variables for the sick-spell duration. In order to study any potential differences we added register information of individual and sick-spell-specific information to the experimental data.</p><p>Descriptive statistics for the treated and controls of variables that are important determinants of long-term sickness absence according to the Social Insurance Agency in Uppsala are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0193841X12466663">Table 1</xref>.

Thus, by controlling for the duration to assignment we also, at least partly, control for individual heterogeneity.</p><p>The RT program was introduced in a time period when the Swedish Social Insurance Agency introduced several measures, sanctioned by the Government, with the aim of decreasing the usage of the social insurance (for an overview, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0193841X12466663">Anderzén et al. 2008</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0193841X12466663">Försäkringskassan 2007b</xref>).

The differences in averages are in line with what could be expected, given the eligible criteria for being initiated into the program discussed in The Program section. The RT group are to a larger extent divorced, have more children, and less educated. They also have more previous sickness absence; both for the RT individual (see Number of days with sickness benefit [SB]/sickness compensation [SC]) and for their family members (see Number of days with SB/SC of family members).

In the second, we study heterogeneous treatment effects and finally we examine consequences of the function form assumption of the Cox regression model.</p></sec><sec id="section12-0193841X12466663"><title>Sample selection</title><p>The identification of an effect from RT is based on the assumption that we can control for the assignment to RT using observed variables. This is quite a strong assumption. However, from a survey (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0193841X12466663">Anderzén et al. 2008</xref>) among the personnel who had experience of RT, we know that 75% of the personnel had never experienced that a patient or insured individual refused to be assigned to RT and 67% had never experienced that a patient or insured individual had proposed RT. Hence, all in all, self-selection does not seem to be a large problem in this study.</p><p>However, there could still be some problems with selection. We investigate this by estimating separate effects for those initiated by case workers and medical doctors. The reason for this is that, in contrast to the case workers, the medical doctors base their decision on a personal meeting with the patient. Thus, the risk of selection bias due to omitted variables is likely to be smaller with respect to those initiated by case workers. When we study the covariates (given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0193841X12466663">Table 1</xref>) for the two groups assigned by case workers and medical doctors, respectively, we find that the two groups of individuals are remarkable similar on average. There are some small statistical significant (<italic>p</italic> value &lt; .10) differences; however, the group assigned by the case workers earn about 10% more, are 1.5 years older, and have about five parentage point higher probability of having a mental diagnosis.</p><p>In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0193841X12466663">Table 5</xref>, we present the estimated effects of RT on the hazard (conditional probability) of leaving a sick spell for the medical doctors (column 1) and case workers (column 2), respectively. As control variables, we include both individual-specific and spell-specific information. The estimated effect of RT is negative and statistically significant for both groups. Compared with the estimate based on all individuals, the effect is somewhat less negative for those initiated by case workers. The difference in effects between those initiated by the medical doctors and the case workers, respectively, is −.14. This difference is not statistically significant at the 5% level; however, it is statistically significant at the 10% level. Hence, we cannot exclude that there may be selection problems associated with those assigned by a medical doctor. Another possible explanation is that the effects are heterogeneous. The fraction with a mental diagnosis is significantly larger in the group assigned by the case workers. Hence, if the effect of RT depends on diagnosis, then the difference between the estimated effects of being assigned by medical doctors and case workers may be due to this difference.</p><table-wrap id="table5-0193841X12466663" position="float"><label>Table 5.</label><caption><p>Estimated Separate Effects of RT on the Hazard of Leaving a Sick Spell Using a Stratified (on Calendar Time) Cox Regression Estimator for the Medical Doctors and Case Workers, respectively.</p></caption><graphic alternate-form-of="table5-0193841X12466663" xlink:href="10.1177_0193841X12466663-table5.tif"/><table><thead><tr><th rowspan="1"/><th>(1)</th><th>(2)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td/><td>Medical Doctors </td><td>Case Workers</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">RT</td><td>−0.421</td><td>−0.281</td></tr><tr><td>(0.057)***</td><td>(0.051)***</td></tr><tr><td>Individual-specific control variables</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>Spell-specific control variables</td><td>Yes</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td>Observations</td><td>37,832</td><td>38,058</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="table-fn5-0193841X12466663"><p><italic>Note</italic>.

Among the RT individuals, 806 of the 1,079 had an earlier sick-spell period that started later than January 2001. The results from this stratified analysis are qualitatively the same as the results in the main analysis. That is, the effect of RT is statistically significantly negative. The estimated effect is a little bit larger (absolute value) than before; however, the precision of the estimates is less good.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0193841X12466663">14</xref></sup></p><p>We have used Cox regression to remove the dynamic selection problem and observed covariates to control for the remaining potential selection problems. The Cox regression models build on an assumed functional form of the hazard rates from a sickness absence spell: We assume that the effect (increase or decrease) is proportional to the baseline hazard. One may be concerned that this functional form is wrong, implying a biased estimate of the treatment effect. In order to test whether the assumed functional form is correct, we have used the nonparametric matching estimator suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0193841X12466663">Fredriksson and Johansson (2008</xref>) in which we perform one-to-one matching based on the covariates displayed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0193841X12466663">Table 1</xref>. Then one separately estimates survival functions for the treated and the matched controls. This estimator, thus, allows for nonmonotonous treatment effects. That is, for example, allowing the effect first to be negative (suggesting an initial locking-in effect when waiting to be rehabilitated) and, in a second stage, a positive effect (on the outflow by the health improvement from the rehabilitation).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0193841X12466663">15</xref></sup> The results from the nonparametric matching estimation concur with the results using the Cox regression model. The time in sickness absence is prolonged by about 15% if assigned to RT and the effect from RT is monotonous, that is, the effects on the hazard are the same irrespective of when in the sickness absence duration the effect is evaluated. In addition, we test for the proportionality assumption using the test suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0193841X12466663">Grambsch and Therneau (1994</xref>). The result from this test shows that the proportional hazard assumption cannot be rejected.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section14-0193841X12466663"><title>Discussion</title><p>The results from the experiment and the observational study suggest nonpositive effects of RT, that is, on average, RT does not reduce sickness absence. Hence, it is not cost-effective. The effect obtained in the observational study is negative and large: an individual attending RT would in expectation prolong his or her duration by more than 2 months. This result is robust to several sensitivity analyses. In the following paragraphs, we discuss two potential explanations for this negative result.</p><p>The first explanation has to do with monitoring and control of the entitlement. An assessor<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0193841X12466663">16</xref></sup> at the Social Insurance Agency formally assesses the entitlement to sickness benefits. This assessor does not meet the sickness benefit claimant and this implies that this assessor needs to rely on a certificate provided by the medical doctor who regularly meets the patient.</p><p>Up to date, there are no nationally stated criteria for when an individual qualifies for sickness benefits. Hence, the certificate is a subjective evaluation by the patient’s medical doctor. The medical doctor is supposed to be the gatekeeper in the insurance but at the same time the patient advocate; concepts such as “not insulting the patient” and “a common understanding of the health problem” are important among Swedish medical doctors (see e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0193841X12466663">Beland 2003</xref>). It has also been documented that the medical doctors find it difficult to carry out their function as claims’ regulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0193841X12466663">Arrelöv, Edlund, and Goine 2006</xref>). Studies indicate that the length of sick leave is largely controlled by the insured’s motivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0193841X12466663">Arrelöv, Edlund, and Goine 2006</xref>) and that doctors not infrequently take decisions contrary their own idea of what would be best for the person on the sick list (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0193841X12466663">Englund 2001</xref>). Thus, the fact that the verification of reduced working capacity basically is—since the assessor does not meet the patience—made by the medical doctor, who does not need to take the formal decision, implies incentives for excess use of sickness benefits.</p><p>The target group for RT was individuals with health problems that are difficult to assess. It is hence also difficult to decide whether they qualify for further sickness benefits. The decision of not allowing an individual to be on sickness benefits is difficult to take. None of the members of the team makes the formal decision. Hence, RT could have created a free-rider problem. The other members of the team may support the medical doctor—who writes the certificate—to suggest rehabilitation also in cases in which this is not appropriate. Hence, the institutional problem associated with sick-listing individuals could have been reinforced with RT.</p><p>Another explanation—related to the former—is about the undesirable consequences of rehabilitation. We have no information about the quality of the rehabilitation received by neither RT individuals nor comparison individuals. However, it is reasonable to assume that RT individuals in general received more extensive rehabilitation than the comparison individuals. A risk with rehabilitation is that also minor health problems become confirmed. This is a phenomenon discussed in the medical literature; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0193841X12466663">Twaddle and Nordenfeldt (1994</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0193841X12466663">Sachs (1987</xref>) claim that sickness in some conditions even could be desirable from the sick-listed individual’s perspective. That is, for some individuals sickness is their identity. Individuals who lack identity and a role in other contexts could be confirmed through medical appointments and rehabilitation. Thus, rehabilitation is not always the best solution. RT may have increased the number of cases in which rehabilitation is not the best remedy.</p><p>These two explanations are in line with the result that only individuals with a musculoskeletal disorder are negatively affected. It may be easier to find rehabilitation with respect to musculoskeletal disorder than mental disorder. Physiotherapy is less controversial and more accessible than treatments for mental disorder. Swedish health care should be based on evidence based knowledge. Physiotherapy has more scientific support than treatments for mental disorder.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section15-0193841X12466663"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This article estimates the effects on sickness absence of a program intended to speed up and, also better target, the rehabilitation needed for sick absent employees. In the program, named Resursteam (RT), the sick-listed individual’s medical doctor, his or her case worker, a behaviorist, and a physiotherapist meet regularly to discuss and assess the insured individual’s need for rehabilitation. The evaluation is based on a small randomized experiment and an observational study.</p><p>The result from the randomized experiment is not statistically significant. However, the point estimate provides the same result as the observational study: The program prolongs rather than shortens the sickness absence spell. The conditional probability leaving a sickness absence spell is reduced by on average 29%, which corresponds to a prolonging of sickness absence by around 3 months.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0193841X12466663">17</xref></sup> This negative effect is in sharp contrast with the ambitions of the program, namely to speed up the rehabilitation and thereby reduce sickness absence costs. The negative result of RT is robust to several sensitivity analyses. Further, the effect is heterogeneous depending on diagnosis of the sick-listed individual. The two most common diagnosis of the target group are diagnoses related to mental problems and musculoskeletal disorder. When estimating separate effect for these two groups we found only negative effects for the musculoskeletal disorder group.</p><p>We discuss two potential and complementary explanations for these results. The first explanation is that RT is an easy way out for the medical doctors from the need of denying individuals the entitlement to sickness benefits. None of the members of the RT team takes the formal decision of entitlement to sickness benefits. Hence, there is a risk that the other members of the team support the medical doctor to suggest rehabilitation also when not appropriate.</p><p>The second explanation is about the potential risk with rehabilitation; that also small health problems may be confirmed and that this may create a sickness identity. If RT induced inappropriate rehabilitation in some cases, this is a potential consequence.</p><p>The two suggested explanations are in line with the result that RT is negative only for those with musculoskeletal disorder but not for those with mental disorder—it may be easier to find rehabilitation for the former than for the latter.</p><p>Our main explanation for this discouraging result is that the team suggests too much rehabilitation; the sick-listed individual becomes confirmed in his or her illness rather than encouraged to get back to work. Our result is also in line with earlier studies of assessments of the need for rehabilitation by multidisciplinary teams. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0193841X12466663">Gustavsson et al. (2011</xref>) study how a multidisciplinary team assessment changes the distribution of long-term sickness absentees. Their result indicates that an assessment does not improve their chances of returning to work, but rather seems to justify disability pension. In the study population of persons on long-term sickness absence, the share of the study population on sickness benefits had decreased and the share on disability pension had increased, 5 years after the assessment).</p><p>It is also important to emphasize that we believe that a suitable rehabilitation for those in need certainly is beneficial both for the health of the individual and in terms of sickness absence cost for the society. This conclusion is in line with the result from an evaluation of a multidisciplinary treatment program in Norway for persons with long- lasting musculoskeletal pain (Haldorsen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0193841X12466663">2001</xref>). The multidisciplinary treatment reported in this study was significantly beneficial for those with worse initial pain (poor prognosis for return to work) but less effective for those with less severe initial pain (better prognosis for return to work). As in Sweden, Norway has generous sickness insurance with high replacement rates and thereby peoples have low economic incentives to return to work from sickness absence. In such contexts, it is important to not relax the control functions of the inflow into sickness absence. Multidisciplinary teams may relax this control function if, for example, multidisciplinary teams are more prone to prolong sickness absence spells, than individual doctors.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0193841X12466663">18</xref></sup></p><p>A final comment is that collaboration between different actors in the rehabilitation process seems necessary. The question is how this collaboration should be designed and organized. Up to now, there is little empirical evidence about the effects of different collaboration solutions on sickness absence. The design of the collaboration evaluated in this article, RT, is in accordance with general recommendations by the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0193841X12466663">Socialstyrelsen 2005</xref>) and the Swedish Council on Technology Assessment in Health Care (SBU-rapport 2003). The result does not support these general recommendations. However, it is important to keep in mind that each collaboration program has its own singularities, which motivate further research about the effects of different collaboration programs.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="conflict" id="fn19-0193841X12466663"><label>Declaration of Conflicting Interests</label><p>The authors declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.</p></fn><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure" id="fn20-0193841X12466663"><label>Funding</label><p>The authors disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: Per Johansson has received funding from the Swedish council for working life and social research FAS (dnr 2004—2005).</p></fn></fn-group><notes><title>Notes</title><fn-group><fn fn-type="other" id="fn1-0193841X12466663"><label>1.</label><p>46.9 billion euros. 1 euro was almost 10 SEK in 1996.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other" id="fn2-0193841X12466663"><label>2.</label><p>The price base amount in 2007 was 40,300 SEK (4,200 Euros).</p></fn><fn fn-type="other" id="fn3-0193841X12466663"><label>3.</label><p>Within the “Dagmar Agreement” (1991–2001), the Government has allowed about a quarter billion SEK yearly to local rehabilitation projects aiming to reduce absence due to sickness.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other" id="fn4-0193841X12466663"><label>4.</label><p>Since October 2006, the collaboration via RT has continued on a voluntary basis.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other" id="fn5-0193841X12466663"><label>5.</label><p>The Social Insurance Agency in Uppsala procured behaviorist and physiotherapist consultants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0193841X12466663">Försäkringskassan 2007a</xref>).

The average received compensation per day to the study population (during the study period) was 185 SEK per day.
