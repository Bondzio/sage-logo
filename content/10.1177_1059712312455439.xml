<abstract>
<p>Language has been argued to exhibit a complex system behavior. In our approach, the syntactic relations of dependency between words have been represented as networks. In a previous study, two English infants’ corpora of utterances were analyzed longitudinally, offering a view of the ontogeny of syntax. Abrupt changes were detected in the growth pattern of the Giant Connected Component – the largest connected set of nodes in a graph. In the present study, we have further analyzed and compared three more infants, from the CHILDES database, learning three different languages: Dutch, German and Spanish. Our results show, along with previous work with English-speaking infants, that all three infants’ syntactic networks change their topology in a similar way, from tree-like networks to small-world networks. This change happens at a similar period in all three infants (between ~700 and ~800 days), regardless of the language they acquire. Our study also shows that the hubs – the most connected nodes in these small-world networks – are always the so-called functional words, which, according to linguistic theory, just contribute to the syntactic structure of human language. The emergence of these hubs happens abruptly, following a logarithmic growth pattern. This developmental pattern challenges usage-based theories of language acquisition and suggests that syntactic development is driven by the growth of the lexicon.</p>

<title>1 Introduction</title>
<p>First language acquisition is perhaps one of the most important achievements of human babies. Scientific study from many fields has paid attention to it for decades. Despite controversies, scholars generally agree on the high complexity involved in this process. Particularly, scientists are fascinated by the rapid acquisition of words, grammatical categories and linguistic structures, more or less at the same time. Thus, in their second year, infants undergo a two-word stage over a few months and suddenly they begin to construct more and more complex linguistic structures. This means that infants, at some point, become able to combine words in a complex, productive, fashion. It is astonishing that they achieve linguistic completeness without explicit instruction from their parents.</p>
<p>Theories of language acquisition disagree mostly on whether infants come to this process equipped with some language-specific innate predisposition, or whether general learning abilities can account for it. Within this latter group, usage-based theories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1059712312455439">Tomasello, 2003</xref>) are the most sophisticated. According to them, infants are thought to grasp the statistical regularities and transitional probabilities present in the input they receive, with the help of a critical social learning ability; the outcome of this process of abstraction is semantically specified schemas, related to each kind of meaningful situation. The nativist approach, on the contrary, insists on the innovative linguistic forms and utterances produced by infants, their rule-like patterns of errors and the lack of negative feedback in the input they get (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1059712312455439">Chomsky, 1956</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1059712312455439">Chomsky &amp; Miller, 1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1059712312455439">Pinker, 1989</xref>). The novelty and creativity involved in this behavior is thought to be beyond the scope of general learning mechanisms, and calls instead for some kind of biological predisposition, species-specific to make possible the development of language. Recently, syntactic recursivity has been single out as the critical innate component required for language acquisition, thought to have evolved in our species only (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1059712312455439">Hauser et al., 2002</xref>). The debate, though, has reached a sort of stalemate.</p>
<p>Given this background, the application of complex systems theory to language offers hope of progress on this classical controversy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1059712312455439">Corominas-Murtra, 2011</xref>), along with the dynamicist approach in cognitive science (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1059712312455439">Gomila &amp; Calvo Garzón, 2008</xref>). While some complex linguistic phenomena have been known for a long time, such as Zipf’s law (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1059712312455439">Zipf, 1936</xref>), recent developments broaden the range of complex phenomena in language to which attention is paid attention: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1059712312455439">De Jong (1998)</xref> proposed a model of lexicon emergence as a self-organized process, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1059712312455439">Steels (2000)</xref> surveys recent work on modeling the origins of communication systems and shows that there seem to be biologically inspired principles behind the emergence of these systems, <italic>self-organization</italic> being one of them. A different line of research applies complex systems theory to syntactic relations: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1059712312455439">Ferrer-i-Cancho &amp; Solé (2001)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1059712312455439">Steels (2000)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1059712312455439">Solé, Corominas-Murtra, Valverde and Steels (2010)</xref>, among others, view language organization in terms of a graph of word interactions. The latter approach reaches two main conclusions regarding the structure of massive corpora of public language: first, a small-world effect, related to the shortest path between words in the graph; and second, a scale-free distribution of degrees. However, this approach assumes an external perspective on language as a network of word combinations, so that it is difficult to draw conclusions from these results on how language, as a cognitive faculty, is organized.</p>
<p>Complex systems have attracted the attention of linguists too. Thus, focusing on frequency of words in the corpora of infants acquiring their first language, Ninio has shown in a series of studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1059712312455439">2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1059712312455439">2006</xref>) that the acquisition of syntactic patterns undergoes an acceleration process that can be described by a <italic>power law</italic>, challenging in this way usage-based theories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1059712312455439">Tomasello, 2003</xref>), which cannot account for this acceleration and novelty effect. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1059712312455439">Tomasello (1992)</xref> posited the Verb–Island hypothesis, according to which infants start producing multi-word speech without knowledge of syntactic categories, such as noun and verb, thus combining pairs of words independently of any other available combinations; words are supposed to be learned in context, but one by one. However, the longitudinal study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1059712312455439">Ninio (2003)</xref> on the development of Subject–Verb–Object patterns (SVO) and Subject–Verb–Indirect Object–Direct Object (SVIO) in Hebrew, showed that:
<disp-quote>
<p>… 40% of the verbs in novel SVO constructions had no antecedent uses in the corpus, and none of the VIO patterns had. Regardless of the presence or absence of antecedent paradigms, the development of the SVO pattern for new verbs was facilitated by other verbs previously learned in the same syntactic construction. (p. 3)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Clearly, Ninio’s work supports the view that infants learn language in a special way; they seem sensitive to syntactic categories/syntactic dependencies from very early on.</p>
<p>However, it is also clear that they are not sensitive to syntax in their performance right from the moment they begin to use language, in their second year of life. It is also equally clear that languages differ in their syntactic structuring. Therefore, it is interesting to study in more detail both the pattern of syntactic development – which takes places mostly during the third year of life – and consider whether this pattern is universal or language dependent. To know in more detail the developmental pattern may provide further constraints on any plausible account of the process. Discovering that the pattern is language independent, despite the syntactic variability of different languages, suggests that it is carried out in a way that it is not just input driven. If syntax governs linguistic structure, and infants learn it effortlessly, an <italic>emergence effect</italic> is to be expected in the timing of syntactic development. This raises the question of whether the same small-world and scale-free structure is also present in the production corpora of infants learning a language. The goal, though, like Ninio’s, is to find the patterns of syntactic development, rather than just the patterns of lexical association in the utterances. Thus, in this paper, we put forward a new approach, which combines a methodological application of complex networks along the lines of Ferrer-i-Cancho and Solé, with the gist of longitudinal studies like Ninio’s.</p>

<title>2 The approach</title>
<p>The proposed approach consists of codifying the linguistic production of a child, collected at different moments during her third year of life, as a series of graphs, of networks, in order to visualize their respective patterns of growth and change, to be able to compare them in the three cases we have selected. How the graphs are to be interpreted in linguistic terms is therefore an important aspect. In a graph, there are a number of nodes connected by means of links. Linguists, regardless their theoretical framework, consider that human words relate to each other in specific ways. How words relate, and how these relationships affect the structure of utterances, is the object matter of syntax. Although a syntactic structure is more than a set of relations between lexical items, we abstract it, thereby obtaining a graph of dependencies of lexical items (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1059712312455439">Figure 1</xref> for details). Under this framework, a lexical item can establish a direct relationship with another lexical item directly or indirectly through another item. For example, “the” and “apple” establish a direct link in the phrase “the apple”. However, these two words can be indirectly related to the word “big” in the utterance “The apple is big”. This is possible because the phrase “the apple” is related to the verb “is”, and this verb is in turn related to the word “big”. Now, we have to imagine these words as represented by nodes on a plane, and their syntactical relationships by means of links among them. In linguistic theory, it is said that when two lexical items check their compatibility, and the result of this checking is the union of the two lexical items in a phrase, the operation Merge has taken place. This operation, along with the operation Move, is considered crucial in modern syntax theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1059712312455439">Chomsky, 2000</xref>). Thus, it is possible to represent and analyze utterances by means of networks, taking into account the crucial aspects of syntactic theory.</p>

<p>Building syntactic networks. The infant (CHI) utters two sentences (A and B), which correspond to two syntactic structures. These analyses can be represented in Dependency Grammar terms, here represented by boxes and links. Given that both A and B share part of the vocabulary, the integration of both sentences into a network (C) avoids the duplication of words like <italic>appeltje</italic>. This kind of network does not capture how many times a word appears, but how many syntactic relationships a word has, and with which.</p>

</fig>
<p>A particular type of network is a <italic>scale-free</italic> network. An interesting aspect of these networks, relevant from a linguistic perspective, is that it is possible to detect the so-called <italic>hubs</italic> easily – the nodes with the largest number of connections. A hub in a syntactic network represents a very important node for syntactic structure, because it is connected with so many words. If hubs are considered the core of a complex system – whose deletion would be critical for the whole system – then the hubs in a “syntactic” network should reflect the syntactic role of those words. Put differently, there should be a correlation between the importance of hubs in a network, and the importance of the corresponding word in the syntactic structure.</p>
<p>Therefore, the project of representing linguistic knowledge through a network suggests itself, just as the project of keeping track of the longitudinal development of such knowledge through infancy, by a succession of such networks, and the identification of which words play this structuring role of a “hub” in the network, if this is the case. Of course, we cannot completely reach this ambitious goal at the moment. However, it is possible to aim at it and to show that this is a promising line of research. The first step requires building bridges between network theory and linguistic theory. How can we capture the essence of the operations behind “the apple is big”, so that it can be interpreted in terms of nodes and links, without losing its linguistic specificity? To this end, we have followed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1059712312455439">Ninio (1996)</xref> in adopting a Dependency Grammar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1059712312455439">Hudson, 1990</xref>; Mel’čuk, 1989). The <italic>dependency relation</italic> is identical to <italic>Merge</italic>. Thus, we have built syntactic networks that capture dependency relations between words, and we have captured the growth and development of <italic>merged</italic> structures. An important property of a merged structure is that it is a binary pyramid hierarchically organized, considered one of the <italic>informatively</italic> richest types of hierarchical structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1059712312455439">Corominas-Murtra et al., 2011</xref>). This procedure fits well with modern linguistic theory and moreover seems suitable for the creation of networks, given that in essence, language always deals with binary combinations, rather than just concatenation of elements – as the approach of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1059712312455439">Ke and Yao (2008)</xref> assumes, who studied individual variability in co-occurrences of words.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1059712312455439">Corominas-Murtra, Valverde, &amp; Solé (2009)</xref>, then, is the first study exemplifying our approach. In that study, two English corpora from the international CHILDES database were analyzed. Each corpus covered roughly from 18 to 30 months of age for each infant. The infants’ utterances from each corpus were extracted, syntactically analyzed and then transferred to network-building software. The software succeeded at getting the syntactic relations between words, and producing the corresponding networks. Interestingly, the analysis of the networks revealed a sharp transition around two and a half years of age: from a (pre-syntactic) tree-like structure to a scale-free, small-world syntactic network. The most connected nodes, the so-called <italic>hubs</italic>, were <italic>functional</italic> words like determiners (e.g., “the”, “a”, “that”). In linguistic theory, functional words are those lexical items that play a nuclear role in syntax, with important structural information, though they are in general considered semantically poorer than other items like verbs, names or adjectives (e.g., “paint”, “big”, “shoe”).</p>
<p>In the present work, we aim to develop this approach further. Since only one language was analyzed – English – no general conclusion could be established regarding whether the developmental path found is language-specific or universal. Case studies of speakers of different languages are required. Therefore, we analyzed corpora from other three infants learning three different languages – Dutch, German and Spanish. The results are quite similar to those learning English: all three infants acquired their respective first language following a similar pattern. In each case and at similar ages (between 700 and 800 days), syntactic networks undergo a sharp transition that changes the topology of the networks, from tree-like networks to small-world networks. As in the English case, the same kinds of hubs were detected in all three languages: <italic>determiners</italic> become the hubs of the transformed networks, later and abruptly, around two and a half years of age. Thus, this new study confirms the previous one with English, supports the idea that there are universal patterns in language acquisition, and suggests an “emergence effect”, related to syntactic productivity, that may be due to an innate predisposition for developing language in <italic>H</italic>. <italic>sapiens</italic>, but that it is driven by the growth of the lexicon.</p>

<sec id="section3-1059712312455439">
<title>3 Procedure</title>
<p>The gist of our study is to keep track of the largest network that joins the lexical items in each infant’s speech. The largest network is called the Giant Connected Component or GCC: a connected component of a given random graph that contains a constant fraction of the nodes of the entire graph. The rest of smaller networks are also taken into account in order to see the evolution of the connectivity: as the GCC growths in size and complexity, the smaller networks disappear progressively. Thus, the present study aims to explore the evolution of the GCC through time, as an abstract representation of the syntactic capacity of the infant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1059712312455439">Figure 2</xref>). Of course, it will always be a conservative representation of the child’s real capacity (production is an under-estimation of understanding).</p>

</fig>
<p>In this study, we have reproduced the procedure carried out by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1059712312455439">Corominas-Murtra et al. (2009)</xref>, and hence we have kept the original criteria and parameters of interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1059712312455439">Corominas-Murtra, 2007</xref>). Three corpora from the international database CHILDES have been analyzed. All corpora contain at least 10 transcribed conversations in which an infant talks with their parents in a natural environment (usually, at home). The languages of these corpora are Dutch, German and Spanish. Three criteria guided the choice of the corpora: (1) a corpus had to contain at least 10 transcriptions as in the previous study on English – in this study the three sets contain 17 corpora. (2) The corpus had to cover at least 300 days of the infant’s life, particularly in the transition from 20 to 30 months of age. (3) Transcriptions must be regularly punctuated (for example, every 10 days or two weeks). The corpora are originally dubbed “Daan” for Dutch, “Simone” for German and “Aguirre” for Spanish, and can be found at the CHILDES component of the TalkBank system website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://childes.psy.cmu.edu/">http://childes.psy.cmu.edu/</ext-link>). Each corpus has been labeled making reference to the temporal frame. Thus “Daan: 2;05.25” means that the transcription belongs to the <italic>Daan</italic> corpus and that the transcription was made when the infant was 2 years, 5 months and 25 days old. However, we are well aware that the procedure is not fully satisfactory, given that for the moment our networks do not capture morphological variation of words, or word order, for instance, which may be syntactically relevant properties, depending of the language in question.</p>
<p>The criteria followed in order to analyze each corpus can be found in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1059712312455439">Corominas-Murtra (2007)</xref>. The three most important aspects are the following:</p>
<list id="list1-1059712312455439" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Firstly, we identified the structures in child’s productions using the lexico-thematic nature of early grammars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1059712312455439">Radford, 1990</xref>).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Second, a basic analysis of constituency is performed, assuming that the semantically most relevant item is the head of the phrase and that the verb in finite form (if any) is the head of the sentence. Finally, a projection of the constituent structure in a dependency graph is obtained. An example of this kind of pre-syntactic network is in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1059712312455439">Figure 1</xref>.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Imitations are discarded.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Linguistic specificity has been attended – for example, the role of particles in Dutch or German – but always following an agreement and keeping coherence through the analyses of the corpora. Since the theoretical discussion on some issues runs the risk of becoming never-ending, and at some point one has to take a decision, we have also tried to avoid ambiguities; linguistic discussions about the status of an element are not considered for the moment. When an element, like for instance the particles of Dutch verbs, has been chosen as head, this criterion has been coherently applied through the whole set of corpora and conveniently explained in the section on lexical hubs.</p>
<p>After analyzing babies’ utterances from each transcription “by hand” in this way, and coding these structures, the analyses were processed by the network software <italic>Cytoscape</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1059712312455439">Shannon et al., 2003</xref>). To make this possible we had to convert the original “.cha” files from CHILDES into something legible for the network software. Four steps were needed:</p>
<list id="list2-1059712312455439" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Each file was converted from .cha to .xml files applying to them the script ToXml.pl, in order to remove all the characters that did not belong to the infant’s expression. We have checked that no piece of speech information was lost during the process. This script was developed by Carlos Rodríguez-Caro and Bernat Corominas-Murtra. The change of format is required by the syntactical analysis program <italic>DGAanotator</italic>.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Syntactic analyses were carried out by linguists, which used the <italic>DGAanotator</italic> program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1059712312455439">Popescu, 2003</xref>), always taking into account the original transcription in order to check the context of the conversation. This program analyzes sentences syntactically, by means of a Dependency Grammar.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>In order to make readable the analyses for the network program <italic>Cytoscape</italic>, the binary combinations of the analyses must be ordered in two columns. To do that, a specific script was created and applied to all syntactic analyses (XML2pairs.py) rendering new files where all the information was ordered in columns, while at the same time capturing the <italic>merge</italic> operation. This script was developed by Harold Fellermann and Bernat Comorminas-Murtra. No piece of information was lost during this process.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Cytoscape was able to read the information from all files without exception and produced the corresponding networks. Cytoscape produced always several networks from each graph, reflecting that not all the nodes were interconnected in a unique network. The <italic>organic</italic> and <italic>circular</italic> representation was chosen in order to detect the hubs and see better the connections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1059712312455439">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1059712312455439">8</xref>).</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The following parameters were longitudinally examined for each of the graphical representations obtained:</p>
<list id="list3-1059712312455439" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Growth of the number of <bold>edges</bold> of the GCC: each edge represents a syntactic link, so that this parameter reflects how many connections there are in the GCC.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Growth of the size of the GCC: each node represents a lexical item. This parameter reflects how many lexical items there are the GCC.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Average degree of the GCC: An interesting measure is the average degree &lt;<italic>k</italic>&gt; of a network. It refers to the average number of connections per node. In the context of syntactic analyses, degree refers to the number of syntactic relationships a particular node (i.e., a word) has. The value of the size of the networks <italic>E</italic> (i.e., the number of edges) can be calculated from the definition of average degree. By definition, the average degree is twice the number of edges <italic>E</italic> divided by the number of nodes (the same edge is counted twice: in the degree of the origin node and in that of the destination node): <italic>E</italic>=<italic>N</italic>&lt;<italic>k</italic>&gt;/2.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Relative size of the GCC: this measure reflects a value of the GCC in relation to the whole network. As said, the GCC is the largest among the existent sub-networks. Its relative size is obtained from dividing the number of nodes of the GCC by the total number of nodes of the network.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Average clustering coefficient: It is a measure of the connectivity; it is the ratio of nodes vs. edges. For example, the same number of edges than nodes indicates a low connectivity, whereas a higher number of edges than nodes indicates that the connectivity of the network is more stressed. The question that describes this measure is “What is the probability that two of my friends are also friends?”</p></list-item>

<p>From each analyzed corpus, the GCC has been selected apart and its statistical information recovered. The <italic>hubs</italic> or “most connected nodes” were identified and their statistical information gathered. We have represented this information trough graphics (see Results). The results from the three corpora have been compared with the published ones from the two English corpora (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1059712312455439">Corominas-Murtra et al., 2009</xref>).</p>

<title>4 Results</title>
<p>Before reporting the results, it is important to keep in mind that they will be affected by the nature and quality of the original data. The CHILDES database was collected quite independently, and without consideration of our purposes, which is a good indicator of the neutrality of the used data that are available in internet and can be checked. The weak point is that these corpora were not collected following the same guidelines, and there are clear differences between them. For example, the Dutch corpora has been gathered following a quite consistent temporal pattern, leaving 10–12 days between each sampling. The German corpora, though, has been gathered in a different fashion. Sometimes the researcher visited the infant three consecutive days in a week. Hence, great differences should not be expected in the corresponding graphical representation. Other eventual problems relate to whether the infant was collaborative that day, or whether she was a little sick or sleepy.</p>
<p>In spite of these difficulties, we have been able to detect commonalities embedded or hidden in the transcription. A look at the networks created on the basis of the three corpora clearly reveals that in the three cases the linguistic development has followed two regimes at two different periods. During the first period, the number of both nodes (lexical units), and edges (syntactic relationships) has a linear quasi-parallel growth. In the second period, the number of edges exceeds the number of edges at length (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1059712312455439">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<p>About 700 days of age, or shortly after this threshold, a change can be detected (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1059712312455439">Table 1</xref>, underlined numbers) consisting in a higher number of edges (<italic>E</italic>) than nodes (<italic>N</italic>). After this point, the distance between edges and nodes will be larger and larger until the number of edges almost doubles the number of nodes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1059712312455439">Figure 3A</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1059712312455439">C</xref>). For example, in the Dutch corpora, the growth pattern threshold is at 761 days (<italic>N</italic>=65, <italic>E</italic>=72). More or less 100 days later, at 854, the new pattern is clearly present (<italic>N</italic>=134, <italic>E</italic>=223). In German, milestones can be detected at 731 days (<italic>N</italic>=121, <italic>E</italic>=162), and more or less 100 days later, at 812 (<italic>N</italic>=160, <italic>E</italic>=227). In the Spanish corpus, the transition goes from 667 days (<italic>N</italic>=79, <italic>E</italic>=101), to almost 100 days later, at 747 (<italic>N</italic>=179, <italic>E</italic>=256).</p>

<p>The <italic>relative size of the GCC</italic> has been calculated for each GCC of the 17 graphs of each language. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1059712312455439">Figure 3(D</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1059712312455439">F)</xref> we have depicted the development of the relative size. The growth pattern followed by the GCC in the three cases seems to be practically linear.</p>
<p>The clustering coefficient or <italic>C</italic> is viewed as the probability that a pair of nodes α and β are connected, since each one is also connected to a mutual friend φ (forming a triangle). Metaphorically speaking, <italic>C</italic> somehow reflects the probability that friends of α are also friends of each other. So defined, it seems clear that <italic>C</italic> is a measure of the local structure of the network.</p>
<p>Typically, the largest value for <italic>C</italic> is 1 for a complete graph (in other words, all nodes are connected with each other) and the smallest is 0, when there are no connections among the nodes (an empty graph). Large values of <italic>C</italic> are indicators of the robustness of the connectivity: if a node is removed and this provokes a disconnection of two portions of the system, this would easily be overcome by simply accessing the adjacent working nodes through short-range neighboring nodes.</p>
<p>The graphics in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1059712312455439">Figure 4(G</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1059712312455439">I)</xref> show the growth of the average clustering coefficient <italic>C</italic> through time. Interestingly, after several corpora where this value is zero or near to zero, it shows a sudden increase. In the Dutch corpora, this happens when the infant was 2;00.04 (i.e., 736 days), increasing the clustering coefficient from 0 to 0.039; in the German corpora, this has been detected at the age of 2;01.21 (781 days), and the value growths from 0.002 to 0.031; in Spanish, this has been detected when the infant is 1;09.27 (667 days), and the value growths from 0 to 0.018. All values are found in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1059712312455439">Table 2</xref>.</p>

<p>A rapid increase in the number of edges is interpreted as a qualitative change in the properties of the network. Interestingly, this increase of edges correlates with a reduction of the <italic>path length</italic>.</p>
<p>The shortest path length distribution is also called the “characteristic path length” or <italic>L</italic>. It represents the average of the shortest distances between all pairs of nodes. It is the average distance to be covered in order to reach the majority of nodes in the graph. Thus, <italic>L</italic> is related to the global structure of the system. It provides the “average minimum distance” between any pair of nodes, hence measuring the typical separation between two nodes in the graph. It can be seen as the average number of friends in the shortest chain connecting two people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1059712312455439">Watts and Strogatz, 1998</xref>). In the networks of our study, after a spurt, there is a tendency to decrease in the vicinity of a value (4 points), suggesting stabilization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1059712312455439">Figures 4A</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1059712312455439">C</xref>).</p>
<p>In scale-free networks, the majority of nodes have just a few edges or links, while a small number of nodes exhibit many links. It is due to this inhomogeneous characteristic that a scale-free network becomes able to tolerate some errors (in other words, it is quite robust against random failures like for instance deletion of nodes). Paradoxically, a scale-free network is also quite fragile to attacks like the deletion of the most highly connected nodes. On the other hand, whereas in exponential networks the probability that a node has a very large number of edges is not very relevant, highly connected nodes become statistically significant in scale-free networks.</p>
<p>We have measured the degree distribution <italic>P</italic>(<italic>k</italic>), defined as the probability that a node as <italic>k</italic> edges. The results are in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1059712312455439">Table 3</xref>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1059712312455439">Figure 4(D</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1059712312455439">F)</xref> shows the evolution of the average degree of the GCC through time for each language.</p>

<p>As mentioned above, it is characteristic of scale-free networks to include few elements (the <italic>hubs</italic>) with a very large number of connections. In this particular case, the hub represents a word that exceeds in connectivity regarding the rest of words. This connectvity has to be understood as syntactic connectvity. Put it differently, the presence of lexical hubs reveals the presence of crucial syntactical elements.</p>
<p>The degree of connectivity of the graph highlights the hubs of the scale-free network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1059712312455439">Figure 5</xref>). This has been done for each GCC and it reveals similar results to those found in the previous study on English corpora. In that study, functional elements like “the”, “a” or “it”, which are semantically poorer than “house” or “dog”, emerged within the network late and abruptly. In these three corpora similar results point to an abrupt emergence of functional words which suddenly become the hubs of the network. Admittedly, some differences are expected due to typological differences among the studied languages, but the take-home message is that the four analyzed languages show similar patterns of acquisition.</p>

<p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1059712312455439">Figure 6</xref>, the emergence of functional words as hubs in Dutch is represented: the determined article (with two forms, <italic>de</italic> and <italic>het</italic> equivalent to the English <italic>the</italic>) and the demonstrative (with two forms <italic>deze</italic> and <italic>dit</italic> equivalent to the English “this”; <italic>deze</italic> is also the plural form equivalent to “these”) are clearly the most prominent. These hubs are followed by the undetermined article (<italic>een</italic> or <italic>‘n</italic>, equivalent to the English “a”), and the second demonstrative (<italic>die</italic> and <italic>dat</italic>, equivalent to the English “that”; <italic>die</italic> can also be equivalent to the plural form “those”). The determined article <italic>de/het</italic> grew in connectivity earlier (at 722 days) and remained quite constant until 827 days, when it spurted again. The spurt of the undetermined article <italic>een/’n</italic> have been detected a little bit later (736 days). Both demonstratives emerge abruptly at 761 days experiencing a rapid acceleration in a short time. The determiner <italic>deze/die</italic> in particular reaches the highest score among the hubs. Other words have been observed, like particles or the pronoun <italic>het</italic> – which is etymologically equivalent to the English “it”. However, as said, Dutch speakers do not use <italic>het</italic> whenever English speakers use “it”. The fact that the phonetic form <italic>het</italic> can be both a determiner (<italic>het boek</italic>, “the book”) and a pronoun (<italic>het is groot</italic>, “it is big”) could be related to this network behavior. Curiously, the phonetic word <italic>het</italic>, whatever its syntactic interpretation, appears quite late, as it is reflected in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1059712312455439">Table 4</xref>.</p>

<p>The examination of the hubs in German is an interesting issue. In both English and Dutch, four kinds of functional words emerged as hubs. In the German corpora Simone, only two have obtained this status. As it is well known, the morphology in German is more complex than in Dutch, and much more complex than in English. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1059712312455439">Figure 7</xref>, we see that the determined article rapidly becomes a hub in German, just as it does in the other two Germanic languages, while the undetermined articles appear later and in modest numbers. The demonstratives in their turn do barely appear.</p>

<p>Longitudinal monitoring of the emergence of some functional words in German. Clearly, the determined article (in the center) is the most relevant showing a late and sudden growth. The undetermined article (on the left) experiences even later this abrupt emergence. However, the demonstrative (on the right) has not emerged as hub, and although acquired and used, it clearly does not play the same role of, for example, the English or Dutch demonstratives.</p>

<p>Remarkably, the emergence of different forms of the article seems to go along the lines of the Dutch article. Nevertheless, it is precisely the richer morphology of German what permits to monitor the different sequences (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1059712312455439">Table 5</xref>). In the first periods, there appears a generic “universal” article <italic>de</italic> only – with the exception of a single appearance of <italic>das</italic>. Gender in German is an important morphological trait: words can fall under three different genders: masculine, feminine or neutral. The presence of this phonetic form already appears in the second corpus with a high score (10 points). However, its presence decreases as we make progress through the corpora, in favor of the other forms, marked by gender. Although the form <italic>die</italic> can be both feminine-singular (nominative or accusative) or the generic plural form (nominative or accusative), it does not spurt as one could expect, suggesting a later understanding of plurality by the infant. The form <italic>des</italic> is marked with an asterisk because it does not correspond to the standard genitive form of the genders masculine and neutral. As it is well known, this genitive form is not used orally. The genitive displays the form <italic>der</italic> for feminine and plural (this form was also absent in the corpora). In these corpora, it corresponds to a form between the universal <italic>de</italic> and the neutral <italic>das</italic>. Finally, the form <italic>den</italic> appears just three times, but when the accusative feminine form has already been detected. It must be noted that, although the relative pronouns in German mostly have the same form of determined articles, at that time the infant did not uttered any relative sentence, so that these forms cannot be confused with relative pronouns.</p>

<p>In Spanish, the picture is just apparently different for several reasons. Spanish is a Romance language that has two genders (masculine and feminine) and displays marks for plurality. As for the learners of the Germanic languages, the hubs are again functional words, also the determined article, the undetermined article and two of the three demonstratives. The determined article is no doubt the most important node in the network, reaching really high scores (almost 50). This article presents four different forms, exhausting all the combinations of gender and plurality. Additionally, there is a neutral form <italic>lo</italic>, a pronoun roughly equivalent to the English “it” when used as a verbal complement (<italic>Ella lo vió</italic>, “She saw it”). The feminine pronoun is <italic>la</italic>, therefore we had to check one by one the nodes linked to these two forms in order to discriminate their syntactic nature. Additionally, there is considerable homophony between the forms when the uttered form is somehow degraded, mostly due to a non uttered coda by the infant: <italic>a –</italic> instead of <italic>la –</italic> can be article singular, article plural (<italic>a niña</italic> “the girl”, <italic>a niñas</italic> “the girls”). The form “a” can also be a preposition, and the links of such nature must not be taken into account. The same can happen in the case of the masculine form <italic>el</italic>, uttered as <italic>e</italic>, which sometimes can be the verb “to be” (<italic>e niño</italic> “the boy” vs. <italic>e bueno</italic> “it is good”). No plural pronoun has been detected – in either possible phonetic form (“<italic>los, las</italic>”, for example: I saw them &gt; (Yo) <italic>los/las</italic> vi). All these possible sources of artifacts have been checked one by one in the networks and accordingly reflected in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1059712312455439">Table 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1059712312455439">Figures 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1059712312455439">9</xref>.</p>

<title>5 Discussion</title>
<p>The pattern in the developmental sequence for the three languages examined here is quite similar to the previous study on English. The three infants acquire their first language in similar ways, regardless the different typology – Germanic vs. Romance, two Indo-European families. A parallel, sudden and abrupt, emergence of functional words, around 700 days of age, seems to indicate the mastering of syntactic categories for word combination. As expected, some differences are also evident due to the peculiarities of each language: in the case of the acquisition of the articles, an English kid has to learn just two (i.e., “the” and “a”); a Dutch infant has to deal with two determined articles and one undetermined (i.e., “de/het” and “een”), whereas the Spanish one differentiates between the forms for masculine/feminine and plural/singular (“el/la” and “los/las”) in addition to a neutral form “lo”, which is a pronoun but that at the beginning is confused with a determiner. In the case of German, the cognitive effort is even greater since there are three genders (called masculine, feminine and neutral) and four cases in the spoken language (Nominative, Accusative, Genitive – for feminine and plural forms – and Dative), so that the number of forms to store in the mental lexicon has to be taken into account for comparisons. On the other hand, whereas German has one demonstrative, English and Dutch have two and Spanish three.</p>
<p>Functional words basically encode syntactic information and the semantics they may exhibit has to be understood in quite formal, relational terms. Interestingly, they appear late in comparison to other words and occupy the place of hubs in the scale-free networks that represent the syntactical knowledge of the infant. This later aspect has to be tinged: let us stress that a graph from a transcription just provides a quite conservative snapshot of the potential of the infant. The graph comes from the available information we find in a transcription. Probably, the linguistic knowledge of the infant is greater and richer. However, the same conservative view is consistently applied to all cases studied. Consequently, the properties of the graphs are an interesting source of information, regarding the ontogeny of syntax in infants. Our most important finding, then, is the change in the topology of network that happens around 700 days of age. The first networks are quite simple, and their nodes exhibit scarce connectivity. This kind of network grow in quantity of nodes and edges in the first period, without relevant qualitative changes; then at some point, a new regime is created, where words are combined productively, and scale-free networks emerge.</p>
<p>The change to scale-free networks is favored by two important characteristics of these networks: most nodes have few edges, but some nodes gain quickly in connectivity, becoming the hubs of the networks. This kind of networks, as it has been mentioned above, are very robust against random attacks – like the deletion of some nodes – but very fragile if the deleted nodes are hubs. The reason is simple: to delete a hub implies the disconnection of a lot of nodes. The hubs we have detected are practically the same in all these languages: functional words like determiners (articles and demonstratives) but also pronouns that appear as direct complement or subject in these languages: <italic>it</italic> in English, <italic>het</italic> in Dutch, <italic>la,lo</italic> in Spanish. Interestingly, our scale-free networks exhibit the small-world effect, through a process that implies an increase of the clustering coefficient <italic>C</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1059712312455439">Figure 5</xref>), and a decrease and stabilization of the characteristic path length <italic>L</italic>. Particularly the latter measure has reached similar scores in all three languages. After an initial spurt of <italic>L</italic>, we see a tendency of this parameter to decrease progressively in all three languages, each time with shorter differences between scores, and the graphic shows a tendency to a stabilization of <italic>L</italic> around four points: in Dutch (926 days, <italic>L</italic>=3,686), in German (895 days, <italic>L</italic>=4,074) and in Spanish (825 days, <italic>L</italic>=4,125). The present work thus provides further support to the pioneer work on English (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1059712312455439">Corominas-Murtra et al., 2009</xref>), given the similar behavior of these three children acquiring three different languages.</p>
<p>In summary, we have found evidence for a universal pattern in language development, and for syntactic productivity appearing around two and a half years of age, driven by the increase of the lexicon. Up until now, five children acquiring four different first languages show a similar patterning in the development of syntax. In addition, the abrupt change of topology of the initial networks to small-world networks and the emergence of functional words as hubs is similar in all five cases. It is true that the evidence is not conclusive, because, from the linguistic point of view, the historical distance between Germanic languages and Romance languages is not huge, and the syntactical distance is not enormous either (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1059712312455439">Longobardi &amp; Guardiano, 2011</xref>). Evidence from infants acquiring non Indo-European languages is also required. These results, then, by themselves, are not enough to settle the question of the nature of language acquisition, although they undermine usage-based theories and learning-based theories in general. These results rather suggest that usage- and learning-based theories contend that syntactic structures are abstracted from the examples at a steady pace (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1059712312455439">Vogt &amp; Lieven, 2010</xref>). Our results rather suggest that syntactic competence is the outcome of a self-organization process that connects words into basic syntactic structures, when the lexical repertoire expands, leaving the basic “merge” operation intact.</p>

<title>About the Authors</title>
<p><bold>Lluís Barceló-Coblijn</bold> is a member of the research group on human cognition and evolution at the University of the Balearic Islands (UIB), where he got his Ph.D. with the dissertation “Recursion, duality of patterning and vocal systems: assessing the marks of language as a <italic>Homo sapiens’</italic> specific faculty”, under the supervision of Antoni Gomila. Lluís holds degrees in Catalan philology and German languages (UIB and Universitt Paderborn) and in linguistics (University of Barcelona and Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam). He has Master’s degrees in cognitive science and language (University of Barcelona) and human cognition and evolution (UIB). He is currently working on an evo-devo-inspired approach to the evolution of the language faculty, giving to complex systems a central role.</p>
<p><bold>Bernat Corominas-Murtra</bold> obtained a degree in physics at the Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, in a graduate program centered in theoretical physics. He followed by obtaining a degree in linguistics at the University of Barcelona, focusing on logics and theoretical syntax. Finally, he obtained a Master’s degree in mathematics in the same university, in a program centered in dynamical systems and stochastic processes, presenting as his Master’s thesis the results of research on nested subgraphs. He began his research activity working within the “ECAgents” project, which ended in 2008. His current research is funded by the James McDonnell foundation through project “Emergence of complexity in tinkered networks”. He has also actively contributed to the “Mesomorph” project, the “ComplexDys” project and the NWO project “Dependency in universal grammar”. His Ph.D. thesis, entitled “An unified approach to the emergence of complex communication”, was advised by Ricard Solé, within the doctorate program of the Parc de Recerca Biomèdica de Barcelona.</p>
<p><bold>Antoni Gomila</bold> is full professor of psychology at the psychology department of the University of the Balearic Islands. His background is in philosophy (Ph.D. in 1990, “After the computational mind”), and his interests have centered on issues at the “no man’s land” of the frontiers between philosophy of mind, psychology and cognitive science: representation and meaning, expression and intersubjectivity, intentional explanation and rationality, always taking an evolutionary perspective into account. He is a researcher of the human evolution and cognition research group. His last book is “Verbal Minds: Language and the Architecture of the Mind” (Elsevier, 2011).</p>
