<p>Michael Morgan, a professor of communication at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, is certainly well positioned to write an intellectual history of George Gerbner. He was a student, colleague, and co-author of Gerbner’s since 1975, when he began his graduate studies at the Annenberg School. In 2002, he edited a special collection of Gerbner’s writing that was organized in a way that revealed Morgan’s special understanding of the challenges as well as the critical contributions that Gerbner, who died in 2005, had made to communication theory and research. This little book takes the next big step along the path toward making those contributions accessible to a wider audience within communications, and within the social sciences and humanities more generally.</p>
<p>While I also claim Gerbner as a teacher, advisor, and colleague for whom much of his writing is quite familiar, I still gained valuable insights from Morgan’s framing of the tensions within his work and in relation to prominent debates within and surrounding the field. Morgan begins his analytical review with Gerbner’s model of communication, and here, as throughout, he underscores Gerbner’s determination that his work would be critical—a value-oriented, normatively structured alternative to what he saw as administratively oriented “techniques of manipulation, persuasion, and attitude change.” Morgan underscores the importance that Gerbner placed on the need for regulatory control of media in the sphere of production in order to ensure that freedom and democracy could be enjoyed in the perceptual domain.</p>
<p>Morgan suggests the possibility that it was Gerbner’s reaction to growing up under fascism that led to his “insistence that democracy requires that private media be regulated by government in order to serve the public interest.” There undoubtedly are a great many other historical, theoretical, and even ideological influences on Gerbner’s approach to critical social research. Morgan uses many of these influences in describing Gerbner’s continually evolving approach to understanding how the transformation of social relations results from the production, distribution, and consumption of the products of an “industrialized, commercial culture.” This process would come to be referred to as “cultivation.”</p>
<p>However, before he takes us there, Morgan provides a quite detailed introduction to Gerbner’s early research and the numerous collaborative research projects that served as a “bridge” to the Cultural Indicators Project, for which Gerbner is most widely known. One of those projects, funded by the federal Office of Education, was a massive, internationally comparative analysis of the images of teachers in popular media in the United States and ten other nations. Morgan identifies this project as Gerbner’s “first major systematic content analysis.” Gerbner’s approach to systematic, quantitative content analysis was shaped by another large, internationally comparative analysis of the “film hero.” This project sharpened Gerbner’s interest in cultural differences in “casting and fate,” or what we might call life chances or comparative risks.</p>
<p>Morgan tells us that it was by the late 1960s that Gerbner had transformed his so-called “institutional approach” into the Cultural Indicators research program. Gerbner actively pursued a hope that the measurement, analysis, and reporting of cultural indicators would become a commonplace, right alongside the economic, political, and social indicators that were being developed in the United States at the time.</p>
<p>Gerbner had also begun to talk about his project in terms of its three primary components: (1) the institutions that were involved in the production of media content, that would be studied through “institutional process analysis”; (2) the content or, more precisely, the social messages that were being produced, that would be characterized by means of “message system analysis”; and (3) the impacts or “consequences and functions” that would be revealed through “cultivation analysis.” This comprehensive research program got its start as part of a massive collaborative effort, administered by the National Institute of Mental Health, which sought to understand the nature and impact of exposure to television violence.</p>
<p>With this as a beginning, the Cultural Indicators Project relied upon a carefully developed methodology for measuring the amount and character of television violence that would last for more than thirty years. Morgan describes the development of a variety of indicators along the way, from a “violence index” to a set of comparative “risk ratios,” that made it possible to call attention to differences in events, interactions, and outcomes observed across groups defined by gender, race, and social class. It is not possible to do justice to the incredible array of analytical frameworks that emerged from these initial measures or that later exploded across the field of media research as the focus moved beyond violence to other aspects of the cultures in which we live.</p>
<p>Morgan discusses many of these studies under the banner of “mainstreaming,” a modification of the original paradigm in a way that allowed for greater appreciation of the relationships between the cultivating influence of media content, and the concrete social experience of the daily lives of different subgroups within the population.</p>
<p>While the bulk of the book is devoted to the description and explication of Gerbner’s contributions to communication theory and research, Morgan devotes a small part of the final chapter to note some of the criticism that over the years had been directed toward the Cultural Indicators Project. He also notes that the media that Gerbner studied for most of his career no longer actually exist. We might wonder what Gerbner would have thought of the Internet as we experience it now, but we can be sure that he would have offered a view worthy of our attention.</p>
