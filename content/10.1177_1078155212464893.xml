<p>In this case report, we review the experience of a patient who presented with early stage pancreatic cancer (Stage IIb) who underwent a Whipple procedure and adjuvant chemoradiation. The patient’s past medical history included early stage colon cancer in remission, post-traumatic-stress-disorder, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, osteoarthritis, gout, and pre-diabetes. Chemotherapy initially consisted of weekly gemcitabine. The patient developed acute gouty attacks after his second dose of gemcitabine, which brought him to the emergency room for emergent treatment on several occasions. Gemcitabine was held and treatment began with fluorouracil and concurrent radiation. After completion of his chemoradiation with fluorouracil, he was again treated with weekly gemcitabine alone. As soon as the patient started gemcitabine chemotherapy the patient developed gouty arthritis again, requiring discontinuation of chemotherapy. The patient received no additional treatment until his recent recurrence 8 months later where gemcitabine chemotherapy was again introduced with prophylactic medications consisting of allopurinol 100 mg by mouth daily and colchicine 0.6 mg by mouth daily throughout gemcitabine chemotherapy, and no signs of gouty arthritis occurred. To our knowledge, this is the first case report describing gout attacks associated with gemcitabine therapy. There is limited data available describing the mechanism that gouty arthritis may be precipitated from gemcitabine chemotherapy. Further monitoring and management may be required in patients receiving gemcitabine chemotherapy with underlying gout.</p>

<p>A 66-year-old Caucasian male presented to the emergency room with nausea, vomiting, and jaundice. The patient’s past medical history included early stage colon cancer in remission, post-traumatic-stress-disorder, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, osteoarthritis, pre-diabetes, and gout. The patient has a family history positive for malignancy including mother and grandmother both with gastric carcinoma and a history of leukemia. The patient has a history of well-controlled gout with an initial presentation 7 years prior to his most current presentation. The patient’s prior presentation of gout was at diagnosis due to joint inflammation in his right foot which required 1 year of allopurinol 300 mg daily and no further therapy or flare ups noted. At initial presentation, the patient underwent an extensive GI workup which revealed a mild biliary dilation on ultrasound. The patient was subsequently admitted and imaged with a computed tomography (CT) scan which showed a mass in the head of the pancreas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1078155212464893">Figure 1</xref>). The mass was 2.1 centimeters (cm) by 1.9 cm, which rose into the medial aspect of the second portion of the duodenum. Biliary dilation was noted as well as several enlarged lymph nodes. The patient was then referred for an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) with stent placement. Biopsies of the bile duct were taken revealing highly atypical epithelial cells with a suspicion of adenocarcinoma. The patient was brought in 3 weeks later for a Whipple procedure and removal of a 2.1 cm mass at the head of the pancreas. The patient’s pathology confirmed a moderate to poorly differentiated pancreatic adenocarcinoma (Stage IIb) and was referred to the medicine oncology clinic for further systemic therapy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1078155212464893">Figure 2</xref>).

</fig></p>
<p>The initial treatment plan consisted of three doses of gemcitabine, followed by fluorouracil chemoradiation, and completion with three cycles of gemcitabine in the adjuvant setting for pancreatic head cancer. The regimen consisted of gemcitabine, 1000 mg/m<sup>2</sup> weekly for three doses, followed by chemoradiation with concurrent infusion of fluorouracil 225 mg/m<sup>2</sup> daily Monday through Friday, followed by gemcitabine 1000 mg/m<sup>2</sup> weekly with 3 weeks of chemotherapy and 1 week off starting 4 weeks after completing chemoradiation for three cycles.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1078155212464893">1</xref></sup> The patient’s laboratories prior to gemcitabine chemotherapy were within normal limits including: white blood-cell count 8.7 k/mm<sup>3</sup>, hemoglobin 12.1 g/dL, hematocrit 37.9%, platelet count 310,000 k/mm<sup>3</sup>, serum creatinine 1.0 mg/dL, magnesium 1.8 mg/dL, bilirubin 0.3 mg/dL, alkaline phosphatase 106 units/L, aspartate aminotransferase 15 units/L, and alanine aminotransferase 16 units/L. A baseline uric acid level was not obtained prior to gemcitabine chemotherapy initiation.</p>
<p>Week 1 of gemcitabine therapy was well tolerated. The patient presented to the clinic a full week later with neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count of 1.4 k/mm<sup>3</sup>), at which time gemcitabine was held for 3 days while labs normalized. Upon normalization, the patient was given week 2 of gemcitabine followed by filgrastim. Approximately 5 days later, the patient experienced swelling in the interphalangeal joints of his hands and toes and later reported to the emergency room with a uric acid level of 5.5 mg/dL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1078155212464893">Figure 3</xref>). Given the patient’s history, current uric acid level, and hand x-ray, he was diagnosed with a gouty arthritis and was treated with indomethacin in the emergency room. Two days afterward, the patient returned to the emergency room with persistent symptoms of another gout attack where he was symptomatically managed in the emergency room and then came to the oncology clinic for his third week of gemcitabine chemotherapy on the day of his emergency room visit. A rheumatology consultation revealed on joint aspiration an acute inflammatory arthropathy of the right second proximal interphalangeal joint due to monosodium urate arthropathy consistent with gouty arthritis. The patient was then prescribed a further course of indomethacin 50 mg three times daily as well as colchicine 0.6 mg twice daily. The treatment resulted in significant improvement of the patient’s erythema, swelling, and pain. Indomethacin was then discontinued and the patient was maintained on colchicine alone at that time.

These changes are most apparent in the 2nd, 3rd metacarpophalangeal joints, radiocarpal as well as ulnocarpal joints. The finding is non-specific but compatible with an inflammatory arthritis, especially given the distribution of the abnormalities. Non-specific mild degenerative arthritic changes are also present in other joints.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1078155212464893-fig3.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>Roughly 17 days after the initial rheumatology consult, the patient started chemoradiation with fluorouracil and completed 4 weeks with no gouty attacks. The patient returned to clinic a month and a half later for his remaining treatment with gemcitabine alone. At the time of gemcitabine re-challenge, the patient was on maintenance allopurinol 100 mg daily and colchicine 0.6 mg twice daily. Approximately 4 days after re-exposure to gemcitabine, the patient presented to the emergency room with symptoms similar to another acute gouty arthritis attack with a uric acid level of 4.4 mg/dL. The patient received treatment with ketorolac 30 mg intravenously, and indomethacin 25 mg three times daily, and was later discharged home. The patient was discharged from the emergency room with instructions to continue on indomethacin 25 mg three times daily and colchicine 0.6 mg twice daily and stopped allopurinol treatment with a follow-up scheduled later in the week with rheumatology and oncology. The patient returned to clinic 2 days later at which time gemcitabine was discontinued due to both thrombocytopenia and acute gouty arthritis attacks. Although it was not clear if the gemcitabine was contributing to the patients worsening gout, given the patient’s history and timeline of treatment it was determined that the patient could not tolerate additional chemotherapy and would be most appropriate to closely follow up with CT scanning. The patient followed up with rheumatology on that day where he was given 1 week of indomethacin 25 mg three times daily and omeprazole 20 mg daily with maintenance on colchicine 0.6 mg twice daily. The patient’s gout symptoms again improved after one full week of indomethacin, which was then stopped and maintained on colchicine alone. A follow-up CT scan was completed 3 months after stopping gemcitabine that showed a complete remission of his pancreatic cancer.</p>
<p>Approximately 8 months afterward during a follow-up appointment, the patient presented with signs and symptoms consistent with supraclavicular adenopathy confirmed by CT scan. A follow-up biopsy confirmed recurrent metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma in the left cervical and perivascular lymph node. Since the disease returned outside of the previous radiation port, the patient was treated with infusional fluorouracil 200 mg/m<sup>2</sup> daily 4 days per week for 4 weeks with concurrent radiation therapy to involved fields followed by systemic chemotherapy. The patient tolerated the 4-week treatment of fluorouracil and radiation combination, with clinical and radiological responses. Various systemic treatment options were considered for his metastatic disease after completion of radiation therapy that did not include gemcitabine in light of his previous gouty attacks. One potential regimen that was discussed included FOLFIRINOX (oxaliplatin, irinotecan, leucovorin, fluorouracil) but was determined to be too toxic for this patient considering his performance status, age, and co-morbidities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1078155212464893">2</xref></sup> Therefore, he was re-challenged with gemcitabine 800 mg/m<sup>2</sup> weekly with maintenance allopurinol 100 mg daily and colchicine 0.6 mg daily to prevent a gout attack. The patient has completed four of the planned six cycles of gemcitabine with no symptoms of gouty attacks.</p>

<sec id="sec2-1078155212464893" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>Pancreatic cancer is the tenth leading cause of cancer in the United States with an estimated incidence of 43,920 new cases in 2012.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1078155212464893">3</xref></sup> Gemcitabine chemotherapy is a commonly used treatment option in the management of resectable and metastatic pancreatic cancers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1078155212464893">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1078155212464893">5</xref></sup> Gemcitabine is also a standard of care recommendation in the National Comprehensive Cancer Network’s treatment guidelines in the setting of adjuvant therapy for resectable pancreatic cancer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1078155212464893">6</xref></sup> Gemcitabine chemotherapy before and after fluorouracil chemoradiation is another common mode of therapy given its 4-month survival benefit compared to fluorouracil chemotherapy and chemoradiation alone.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1078155212464893">1</xref></sup> Gemcitabine is a cell cycle-specific pyrimidine agent, with two modes of action including ribonucelotide reductase inhibition as well as DNA chain termination.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1078155212464893">7</xref></sup> The major dose-limiting toxicity of this treatment is myelosuppression.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1078155212464893">4</xref></sup> There have been many other adverse events reported with this treatment including transient elevations in liver enzymes, mild to moderate nausea and vomiting, maculopapular pruritic rash, and flu-like symptoms.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1078155212464893">7</xref></sup> Currently, the most recent package insert for gemcitabine does not describe any gouty attacks or an increase in uric acid production and subsequent precipitation for arthritic reactions as described in this case report.</p>
<p>To our knowledge, this is the first case report describing acute gouty arthritic attacks associated with gemcitabine chemotherapy in a patient with an underlying history of gout. A literature search has not revealed any previous cases of this reaction; however, there may be a hypothesized rationale or explanation to this observed event. An article published by Xu et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1078155212464893">8</xref></sup> evaluated the major histocompatibility complex class I-related chain A and B (MICA/B) expression in seven pancreatic cancer cell lines in vitro. PANC-1 is a pancreatic cancer cell line that was tested in vitro to gemcitabine, fluorouracil, or radiation. All three of these treatments led to an increase in MICA/B expression and correlated to a 3-fold increase in uric acid levels in the PANC-1 lysates. Additional PANC-1 cell lines were pre-treated with allopurinol 1 hour prior to gemcitabine, fluorouracil, or radiation. Allopurinol inhibited MICA/B expression as well as uric acid production in the pre-treated lysates. The authors concluded that among pancreatic cell lines that received gemcitabine chemotherapy DNA damage occurred and induced MICA/B expression in the lysates which was mediated through an increase in uric acid production. Authors also observed that uric acid production and increased MICA/B expression play an important role in sensitizing pancreatic cancer cells to natural killer cell cytotoxicity. Thus, allopurinol pretreatment in pancreatic cancer patients may affect the immune-mediated effects of gemcitabine chemotherapy.</p>
<p>Although it is reasonable to believe that gemcitabine was involved in this patient’s gouty arthritic attacks, there are several other variables to take into account. Medication adherence is clearly an important marker for improved clinical outcomes. This patient was offered prophylaxis regimens on two separate trials of gemcitabine with allopurinol 100 mg daily and colchicine 0.6 mg daily. The first re-challenge while on prophylaxis the patient developed acute gouty arthritis while the second re-challenge, during the patient’s pancreatic cancer recurrence, the patient did not develop any acute gouty arthritic attacks. It is possible that the patient was non-compliant with his prophylactic drugs during his first re-challenge allowing for an acute gouty episode. Another variable to consider is the dosing strategy utilized in the patient’s allopurinol regimen. Traditional regimens consist of 300 mg daily, except in patients with impaired renal function where doses of 100–200 mg per day can be utilized.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1078155212464893">9</xref></sup> However, our patient did not have impaired renal function but developed an increase in liver enzymes in the past attributed to allopurinol therapy, which is the rationale for the use of the reduced dose of allopurinol. Finally, the use of chemoradiation in our patient may also play a role in the patient’s clinical events. The gouty arthritic attack at first presentation appeared after initial gemcitabine chemotherapy where no previous chemoradiation was given to the patient, the second occurrence of this event did occur after the patient received chemoradiation. It is possible that other treatment modalities have played a role in the development of the patient’s acute gouty events. As described in the article by Xu et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1078155212464893">8</xref></sup> fluorouracil and radiation were also implicated in increasing uric acid levels with in vitro models. Given the many different variables affecting this case, it is impossible to conclusively determine gemcitabine as the causative agent, however, this event was evaluated with a validated adverse drug reaction probability scale.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1078155212464893">10</xref></sup> According to this scale, the adverse event scored a total of five out of a possible thirteen points, making the reaction to be a probable event related to gemcitabine chemotherapy.</p>
<p>Given the proposed mechanism of gemcitabine-induced uric acid release and clinical history of events, it is probable that gemcitabine was involved in this patient’s acute gouty arthritic attacks. Although we determined this event was probably related to gemcitabine chemotherapy, it is difficult to explain why the patient did not develop an acute gouty arthritic attack with each dose of gemcitabine. The patient in this case went on to receive 4 cycles of gemcitabine for his disease recurrence with no further exacerbations of his gouty attacks while on a prophylaxis regimen consisting of allopurinol 100 mg daily and colchine 0.6 mg daily. In addition, there were several variables implicated in this clinical case for the rationale to these gouty attacks including medication non-adherence, allopurinol dosing, and concurrent chemoradiation treatments the patient received.</p>
<p>Gemcitabine is a commonly used chemotherapy agent in pancreatic cancer, where it is reasonable to consider further monitoring of patients receiving treatment with a concurrent history of gout or gouty arthritic attacks. Further reporting of this adverse event will help validate this reaction and need for monitoring of uric acid levels in those patients at risk for gout attacks.</p>
