<abstract>
<p>As the percentage of adults aged 60 and above in the United States grows, the need for clinicians who can work effectively with older adults becomes increasingly vital. In this article, the case of a 77-year-old Caucasian woman diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder and anorexia nervosa is presented. First, the author reviews research and treatments used with schizoaffective disorder and anorexia nervosa in older adults. A theoretical formulation is made using Bob Knight’s contextual, cohort-based, maturity, specific-challenge model as well as a cognitive-behavioral model. The article reviews the first 6 months of treatment with the client and presents a brief discussion of the challenges experienced while working as part of an interdisciplinary team.</p>

<title>1 Theoretical and Research Basis for Treatment</title>
<p>In this article, readers will be introduced to a client referred to as <italic>Rose</italic> who presents with symptoms of schizoaffective disorder and anorexia nervosa. To begin, foundational knowledge of these diagnostic categories is presented, followed by the research and treatments specific to clinical work with older adults.</p>
<sec id="section2-1534650112457457">
<title>Schizoaffective Disorder and Its Treatment in Older Adults</title>
<p>Schizoaffective disorder is a serious mental illness uncommon in the general population during which an individual experiences psychotic and mood symptoms. According to the current version of the <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders</italic> (4th ed., text rev.; <italic>DSM-IV-TR</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1534650112457457">American Psychiatric Association [APA], 2000</xref>), a diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder is dependent on three criteria. First, the individual has had a major depressive, manic, or mixed episode while also experiencing two or more characteristic symptoms of schizophrenia. Second, the individual has presented with delusions or hallucinations without any prominent mood symptoms for a minimum of 2 weeks during the same period of time. Third, the mood symptoms must be present for a substantial portion of the total duration of the illness. Based on the mood symptoms presented, the diagnosis is given one of two specifiers: depressive type or bipolar type.</p>
<p>Compared with other mental illnesses, schizoaffective disorder is rare and its prevalence is not well researched. In <italic>Kaplan &amp; Sadock’s Comprehensive Textbook of Psychiatry</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1534650112457457">2009</xref>), the authors cited a general population study completed in Finland using <italic>DSM-IV</italic> (4th ed.; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1534650112457457">APA, 1994</xref>) criteria that found a lifetime rate of schizoaffective disorder of 0.32% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1534650112457457">Sadock, Sadock, Ruiz, Kaplan, &amp; Ovid Technologies, Inc., 2009</xref>). In a prior edition of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1534650112457457">Kaplan and Sadock’s (1995)</xref> text, similar prevalence is quoted in relation to other schizophrenia-spectrum disorders, with 10% to 30% of patients with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders meeting criteria for schizoaffective disorder. Specific prevalence rates for schizoaffective disorder in late life are not currently available, but research suggests that older adults are more likely to present with a depressive type of schizoaffective disorder than a bipolar type, whereas young adults are more likely to present with a bipolar type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1534650112457457">Cohen, 2003</xref>). Despite its low prevalence, the disorder has a significant impact on an individual and community, and increased research is needed to better understand the disorder and inform treatment.</p>
<p>As with most serious mental illnesses, the usual treatment for schizoaffective disorder is a combination of pharmacologic treatment and psychosocial interventions. Most often, medications must be regulated to stabilize an individual with psychotic symptoms and increase the client’s ability to benefit from psychosocial interventions. In their recent review of research on the diagnosis and treatment of schizophrenia and depression in older adults, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1534650112457457">Felmet, Zisook, and Kasckow (2011)</xref> described the medications of choice identified in the most recent publication of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1534650112457457">Alexopoulos, Streim, Carpenter, and Docherty (2004)</xref>. According to these guidelines, risperidone (1.25 to 3.5 mg/day) is the first line of treatment for late-life schizophrenia. Second-line treatments include quetiapine (100 to 300 mg/day), olanzapine (7.5 to 15 mg/day), and aripiprazole (15 to 30 mg/day). Clozapine, ziprasidone, and high-potency conventional agents have limited support as additional options in older adults. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are then added for individuals with schizophrenia and depression. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1534650112457457">Felmet et al. (2011)</xref>, pharmacologic treatments specifically for schizoaffective disorder are not well established, although antipsychotics, antidepressants, or antimanic agents may be used. Two medications with research-supported efficacy in clinical trials for treatment of schizoaffective disorder are aripiprazole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1534650112457457">Glick et al., 2009</xref>) and ziprasidone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1534650112457457">Gunasekara, Spencer, &amp; Keating, 2002</xref>). All medications should be prescribed and monitored by a geriatric psychiatrist or similar professional who has knowledge of the specific needs of older adults and the decreased dosages required in response to changes in the way that the body responds to and breaks down medications with age.</p>
<p>Numerous research-supported psychosocial approaches to treatment of older adults with schizoaffective disorder are available. These include cognitive-behavioral interventions to treat psychopathology and symptoms, family interventions to improve treatment adherence and prevent relapse, social skills training, and cognitive remediation to behaviorally improve neurocognitive functions such as attention and memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1534650112457457">Felmet et al., 2011</xref>). All of these approaches are set within the context of a team approach, partnering with the medical, behavioral health, social service, and other professionals working with the older adult. Together, the team can treat the psychiatric diagnosis and medical illnesses, while also doing risk assessments and helping the client maintain daily living skills, social relationships, daily activities, and finances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1534650112457457">Felmet et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1534650112457457">
<title>Anorexia Nervosa and Its Treatment in Older Adults</title>
<p>Anorexia nervosa is a disorder that is increasingly identified and diagnosed in older adults, though the research is sparse, requiring clinicians to depend on research and treatment guides created based on young adults. The <italic>DSM-IV-TR</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1534650112457457">APA, 2000</xref>) criteria for anorexia nervosa include refusal to maintain body weight at or above a minimally normal weight for age and height, fear of gaining weight or becoming fat even though underweight, distortions in body image or denial of the seriousness of low weight, and amenorrhea (in postmenarcheal females). These criteria are biased toward identification of anorexia nervosa in young women (i.e., menstruation), although the disorder also occurs in postmenopausal women and in males.</p>
<p>The available research has focused on women in late adolescence and early adulthood and onset of anorexia nervosa during this time, although more recent studies discuss the possibility of a lifetime prevalence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1534650112457457">Chavez &amp; Insel, 2007</xref>) or late onset of the disorder in midlife or late life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1534650112457457">Berry &amp; Marcus, 2000</xref>). The lifetime prevalence rate for anorexia nervosa is estimated at 0% to 7% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1534650112457457">Patrick &amp; Stahl, 2009</xref>). Although the exact prevalence of anorexia nervosa in older adults is unknown, research on eating disorders in women during late life cites rates ranging from 1.8% to 3.8% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1534650112457457">Gadalla, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1534650112457457">Lapid et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Available research looking at anorexia in mid- or late life often compares and contrasts the disorder to what is known about the disorder in adolescence and emerging adulthood. Although pressure for thinness and body satisfaction is commonly cited in research on anorexia nervosa in adolescents and emerging adults, is body dissatisfaction a factor in late life? The research here is mixed. Some researchers suggest that body satisfaction and the importance of body image is stable across the life span (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1534650112457457">Webster &amp; Tiggemann, 2003</xref>) and that body dissatisfaction and eating disorders are consistently prevalent across the life span in men and women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1534650112457457">Patrick &amp; Stahl, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1534650112457457">Lewis &amp; Cachelin, 2001</xref>). Others suggest that aging is linked with greater tolerance of what body sizes are acceptable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1534650112457457">Rand &amp; Wright, 2000</xref>) and greater body satisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1534650112457457">Franzoi &amp; Koehler, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>Specific physical and life factors that are less frequent in younger individuals may increase the likelihood of anorexia nervosa in older adults. Physical factors may include changes in body composition, shifts in weight and fat distribution from the legs to the trunk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1534650112457457">Genazzani &amp; Gambacciani, 2006</xref>), changes in the body due to physical health conditions, weight gain due to medications, and increased difficulty hiding physical changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1534650112457457">Clarke &amp; Griffin, 2008</xref>). Situational factors or life stressors that may lead older adults to develop anorexia nervosa can include a need for control in one’s life or with one’s family members, a plea for attention, protests against living conditions (e.g., nursing home), or economic hardship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1534650112457457">Anonymous, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1534650112457457">Lapid et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Although there are no current guidelines published for treating anorexia nervosa in older adults, the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1534650112457457">APA (2006)</xref> has outlined treatment guidelines for clinical work with adults. These guidelines stress the importance of a team approach where psychologists, psychiatrists, physicians, dietitians, nurses, social workers, and other health care professionals work together. Level of care should be identified based on the need of the client (i.e., outpatient treatment, partial hospitalization, psychiatric hospitalization, and general medical hospitalization). Typical treatments for adult clients include individual, group, and family therapy. Although there is little evidence from controlled studies to guide treatment toward specific therapies with adults or older adults, cognitive-behavioral, interpersonal, and psychodynamic therapy interventions are recommended based on clinical consensus, with clinicians endorsing the frequent use of multiple modalities for the treatment of anorexia nervosa and other eating disorders. Clinical consensus further outlined in these guidelines indicates that treatment should focus on psychosocial interventions that incorporate an understanding of developmental traumas, cognitive development, psychodynamic conflicts and defenses, disorders of self-esteem, self-regulation and sense of self, the complex impact of family relationships, and comorbid disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1534650112457457">APA, 2006</xref>).</p>

<title>Comorbidity of Schizoaffective Disorder and Anorexia Nervosa</title>
<p>The comorbidity of schizoaffective disorder and anorexia nervosa in older adults is not documented. From the available literature with younger participants, one study of female inpatients found that individuals with a diagnosis of schizophrenia or a psychotic disorder were 3 times more likely than inpatients with other primary diagnoses to have a comorbid anorexia nervosa, restricting type, and 2 times more likely to have a comorbid anorexia nervosa, binge eating/purging type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1534650112457457">Blinder, Cumella, &amp; Sanathara, 2006</xref>). In a study of older adults and eating disorders, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1534650112457457">Lapid et al. (2010)</xref> identified a 7% comorbidity of schizophrenia or schizotypal traits in older adult participants with a diagnosable eating disorder, suggesting that the comorbidity in the general older adult population may be low.</p>
<p>It is evident in the review of literature that there is a significant need for research to better inform treatment with older adults. Geropsychology is a developing field, and the need for clinicians who can effectively treat older adults is increasing with the aging baby boomer generation. The following model is one guide available to clinicians for adapting treatment to the specific needs of clients in late life.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1534650112457457">
<title>A Theoretical Frame for Treatment of Older Adults</title>
<p>Moving from a discussion of clinical research to practice, one clinical model available for therapy with older adults is Dr. Bob Knight’s contextual, cohort-based, maturity, specific-challenge (CCMSC) model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1534650112457457">Knight, 2004</xref>). In this model, there are four main elements to consider with each individual case that may influence the clinical presentation and treatment: context, cohort experience, maturity, and age-specific challenges. The first element, context, directs clinicians to take into account factors such as where a client lives (e.g., a senior community or apartment, assisted living, nursing facility, or a home), the service agencies available to older adults (e.g., in-home support, friendly visitors, case management), activities available to seniors (e.g., senior center activities, groups, community programs, educational courses), medical settings with which clients may interact (e.g., rehabilitation centers, outpatient services, hospitals), and age-based laws and regulations (e.g., Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security). Second, cohort effects are factors that are unique to a specific generation and affect their expectations and interactions with others. Cohort effects can include historical life experiences such as the World Wars and the Great Depression, values held by a generation, generational jargon, expected level of education, and expected life path. Third, the CCMSC model directs clinicians to take into account specific challenges and experiences of individuals in late life. These life-stage specific experiences can include loss and grief, caregiving for family members, declining health, onset or progression of chronic illness, and possible disability. In the final component of maturation, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1534650112457457">Knight (2004)</xref> calls attention to the strengths of individuals in late life. With aging comes cognitive and emotional complexity, expertise, competencies, learned interpersonal skills, and depth and range of experience. All of these strengths can add to an individual’s resiliency and ability to adapt to change, making them important to draw on and highlight when promoting mental health and wellness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1534650112457457">Knight, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>In this case presentation, a complex case of a 77-year-old woman diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder and anorexia nervosa is presented. The case is formulated using Knight’s CCMSC model and a cognitive-behavioral model to highlight adjustments that can be made in clinical work to individualize treatment to the needs of older adult clients. The client’s name and history have been altered slightly to protect confidentiality.</p>

<title>2 Case Introduction</title>
<p>Rose is a 77-year-old single Caucasian female of Irish descent. Rose is under conservatorship due to self-neglect as a result of her mental illness. Using the <italic>DSM-IV-TR</italic> diagnostic criteria, Rose meets criteria for schizoaffective disorder—bipolar type—and anorexia nervosa. Schizoaffective disorder symptoms include comorbid symptoms of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, with occasional lifts in mood symptoms while still reporting psychotic features. Schizophrenic symptoms include paranoid delusions, ideas of reference, history of auditory and visual hallucinations, avolition, alogia, and blunted affect. Mood symptoms include depressed mood 5 to 6 days of the week and elevated mood or hypomania 1 to 2 days per week, quickly shifting her clinical picture and ability to engage in therapy. Rose’s symptoms of depression include depressed mood, anhedonia, decreased appetite, inappropriate guilt, difficulty thinking, alogia, and hypersomnia. When presenting with hypomanic mood, Rose displays decreased need for sleep, increased goal-oriented activity, increased speech, flight of ideas, increased energy, mild euphoria, and increased flirtation/physical proximity seeking with others. Symptoms of anorexia nervosa include refusal to maintain normal body weight, fear of gaining weight even though she is underweight, and denial of the seriousness of her low weight. Due to her age, lack of menarche is expected and cannot be considered in the diagnosis of anorexia nervosa.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1534650112457457">
<title>3 Presenting Complaints</title>
<p>Rose was referred for outpatient counseling by her conservator due to increased depression, quick and unexpected shifts in mood and symptom presentation over the course of a week, isolation, and self-neglect, as well as Rose’s risk for being moved from the assisted living facility where she currently resides to a higher level of care such as a skilled nursing facility or hospital.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1534650112457457">
<title>4 History</title>
<p>Information regarding personal history was provided by Rose and supplemented with historical information from her conservator, the assistant manager of the assisted living facility, and her best friend. Rose was born and raised in a family of Irish descent in California. Her father was born in Ireland and immigrated at the age of 17. Her mother was born and raised in New York City. Rose was raised in a traditionally Irish-Catholic family as the youngest of six children, with two sisters and three brothers. Rose reports having strained relationships with her parents, describing them as “strict” Irish parents who were critical of her physical appearance and behavior and enforced strict attention to religious practices. Rose denies a family history of mental illness.</p>
<p>Rose recalls first restricting her eating during middle school, losing 20 pounds over the course of one summer. Pictures suggest that she remained within the normal range for weight, although Rose reports that she was “anorexic,” had a negative body image, feared weight gain, and felt pressure for perfection. She received affirmation for her weight loss and for meeting physical beauty standards. Rose was encouraged by her brother to enter a beauty contest as a teen, and she placed among the top contestants.</p>
<p>Rose’s Irish family instilled in her the values of hard work and self-sufficiency, while the cultural climate of her generation encouraged women toward goals of marriage and building a family. Rose completed high school and went to work as a file clerk until she married the first of two husbands. She was married for 4 years, divorcing due to her husband’s reported alcoholism and frequent absences. Rose reports that around this time, she became pregnant 3 times. Two of the pregnancies were aborted and one was still-born. From Rose’s perspective, “God was punishing me for the things that I have done.” Adding to her stress, at the time of the still birth, Rose’s mother passed away. These events preceded her first-reported psychosis and hospitalization at the age of 27. Rose reported visual hallucinations of meeting the devil in hell.</p>
<p>After her first hospitalization, Rose worked toward recovery. She returned to work as a file clerk and married her second husband. Her second marriage ended within a few years. Rose reported that her second husband abused alcohol and was physically abusive, and that she had an affair. Rose reenrolled in school during her 30s to become an aesthetician and massage therapist. Rose became half owner of a beauty salon, built friendships, and traveled. She recalls feeling “happy.” Yet, looking at pictures from this time of her life, Rose looked dangerously thin. Rose continued to struggle with mental illness, hospitalizations, and body image through middle adulthood. She stopped working at the age of 45 after another psychotic episode.</p>
<p>Rose was most recently hospitalized in 2009 for the eighth time. Prior to this hospitalization, Rose lived in her own apartment and worked 1 day per week while receiving disability income. Rose reports that she had growing debt, worries about her future, and guilt that she was living off of money from the government. As the stress increased, she isolated herself in her apartment and experienced psychotic symptoms. She experienced visual and auditory hallucinations, such as voices telling her that she didn’t deserve her apartment. Rose reports ideas of reference while watching television. Rose hallucinated that a prominent television figure was in her apartment cleaning while threatening to violently kill her. Her conservator reports that Rose’s sister made the phone call that led to her hospitalization.</p>
<p>After discharge, Rose was placed on conservatorship and moved to a skilled nursing facility where she stayed for a series of months. She recalls it as a “terrible place,” although her symptoms decreased and she became involved in daily activities offered by the facility. Once stable, Rose was moved into the assisted living facility where she currently resides. Rose quickly became best friends with a woman with whom she attended daily activities. Rose increased her contact with her siblings, speaking weekly over phone with her sister and monthly with her brother. She also maintained contact with a male friend who she has had a romantic relationship with in the past.</p>
<p>In the months preceding the referral for counseling, Rose began to regress and her depression increased. Her mood continued to fluctuate during the course of a week between severe depression and hypomania. She began to isolate herself in her room, stopped attending residence activities, and began to lose weight. At the time of the referral, Rose was monitored closely by staff at the assisted living who got her out of bed, fed her when she refused to eat, assisted with grooming and hygiene, and assisted with medication management. A geriatric psychiatrist manages Rose’s medications, which include antipsychotics (saphris, zolpidem, and abilify), antidepressants (mirtazapine and bupropion XL), an anticholinergic medication (lorazepam), and a medication to treat parkinsonian side effects (benztropine). Rose also takes stool softeners, fish oil, and over-the-counter vitamins.</p>
<p>Rose has no major medical diagnoses although a nurse practitioner visits the assisted living monthly and monitors Rose’s heart health due to low weight. Rose is 5 feet 7 in. and weights 105 pounds. Thus, her current body mass index of 16.44 places her in the underweight range. Rose is in need of dental care to extract multiple teeth and a new partial denture. She wears glasses, and her hearing is intact.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1534650112457457">
<title>5 Assessment</title>
<p>Rose’s baseline mood and cognitive status were assessed at the beginning of counseling with the Geriatric Depression Scale-Short Form (GDS-S) and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Her cognitive screening score fell within the normative range, not indicating any significant cognitive impairment, scoring 28 out of 30 on the MMSE. Her baseline depression score was suggestive of severe depression, scoring 13 out of 15 on the GDS-S. Her depression was reassessed at 6 months with the Patient Health Questionnaire, scoring 8 out of 27, which suggests minimal depressive symptoms. This assessment was completed on a day that Rose presented with hypomanic mood, and highlights her shift during a week between severe depression and elevated mood. The possibility of a delirium was ruled out by the care team. The client does not currently present with symptoms of dementia due to the apparent fluctuation of her verbal ability, memory, and problem-solving skills with her mood symptoms.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1534650112457457">
<title>6 Case Conceptualization</title>
<p>Rose’s case is conceptualized and presented using Knight’s CCMSC model and a cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) approach. This conceptualization is incorporated into the discussion of her treatment.</p>
<sec id="section11-1534650112457457">
<title>Applying the CCMSC Model</title>
<sec id="section12-1534650112457457">
<title>Context</title>
<p>Rose resides in an assisted living facility. This context is supportive and stressful for her. Rose has access to help from staff members throughout the day, including the manager, nursing assistants, the activities director, and other health professionals who provide treatment within the facility. Staff members take care of her instrumental activities of daily living, including laundry and room care. Meals are provided in the cafeteria at specific times of the day. In addition, Rose lives in the same building as her best friend, making social support easily accessible. This environment also has stressful drawbacks such as frequent loudspeaker calls and tones alerting staff of resident care needs and alerting residents of activities. Rose shares a room with a roommate who spends much of her day in bed, and staff members enter her room abruptly using master keys. Many of the residents in the facility also present with symptoms of mental illness, some of whom present with positive psychotic symptoms that Rose reports make her uncomfortable. Rose attends a partial hospitalization program where she reports feeling supported by staff members but uncomfortable with peers who are also struggling with mental illness.</p>
<p>Rose’s context includes a conservator who oversees Rose’s care, manages her finances, and makes decisions for her. Rose has a positive relationship with her conservator and calls her to discuss concerns or needs, while at the same time Rose reports an age-appropriate desire for increased independence, as well as feelings of guilt that she is not able to be independent. Rose interacts with numerous health professionals during the week who are not only involved in making decisions about her care and supporting her recovery, but also risk disempowering Rose and discouraging her involvement in her care.</p>
<p>Rose’s context also includes the government programs of Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security that provide Rose with health care coverage and income. Although these resources cover much of Rose’s costs, they do not cover other necessities such as dental care. Rose is aware of her limited income and feels continued guilt for needing government assistance.</p>

<p>Rose was born in the mid-1930s and raised during World War II, during the era of pin-up girls and beauty contests. Rose’s Irish-Catholic family instilled in her strict moral standards and religious piety, as well as the hard-working mentality that was a strength to immigrants working to build a life in the United States. Rose was an emerging adult during the 1950s when women were encouraged to go to school or work until they married and began raising a family. Rose married slightly later than other women of her generation and was unable to have children, not meeting the societal standard. She faced stigma from the Catholic Church when she divorced her husband and had two abortions. This stigma is evidenced by Rose’s report of feeling “punished by God” at the time of her still birth, the death of her mother, and her first hospitalization. Drawing on the strengths of societal change, Rose reinvented herself, went back to school, and became part owner of a beauty salon during the era of women’s liberation.</p>

<title>Specific challenges and experiences of older adults</title>
<p>At the age of 77, Rose is faced with numerous age-specific challenges and experiences that impact her clinical presentation, including changes in her physical appearance and ability, as well as loss of independence. Physical changes due to aging that Rose experiences include loss of muscle tone, changes in balance and gait, and decreased visual acuity. Changes in her physical appearance and increased signs of aging challenge her sense of attractiveness, stating concerns that she looks old while commenting on the youth of the clinician. Rose also experiences physical changes caused by medication side effects that include a parkinsonian shuffle with a slightly hunched back and constipation.</p>
<p>In addition to physical changes, Rose experiences changes in her level of independence. It is common for older adults to wrestle with the impact of physical decline on one’s ability to live independently. For Rose, her independence has been taken away by the court system. Health professionals on her care team make decisions regarding her care, and her residence has a set schedule for meals and activities that Rose must adjust to fit.</p>
<p>Finally, Rose presents with a common experience of wanting to give back to society and reflecting on her life. These experiences are explained in Erikson’s life-stage model of psychosocial development. The final two stages of this model are generativity versus stagnation and ego integrity versus despair. In the first, individuals have a desire to be useful and give back to society, whereas in the second, individuals tend to reflect back on life, processing accomplishments and regrets with the goal of finding a sense of peace or fulfillment with one’s life.</p>

<sec id="section15-1534650112457457">
<title>Maturation</title>
<p>By the age of 77, Rose has faced many challenges and developed skills and strengths. Rose’s strengths include her social skills and foundational knowledge of therapy and her mental illness. Rose’s social skills are evident in the positive relationships she has with staff members, the high level of effort staff and health professionals provide to promote Rose’s health, and the presence of long-term close friendships and positive peer relationships. After 50 years of interactions with the mental health system and living with psychosis, Rose has developed an understanding that counseling and health professionals are there to support her mental health. She is aware that medications are an important part of treatment, and she has learned that counseling is a place where she can discuss her concerns.</p>

<sec id="section16-1534650112457457">
<title>Applying a Cognitive-Behavioral Model</title>
<p>A cognitive-behavioral model is used to formulate Rose’s case and inform treatment. A hypothesis is created about her core beliefs and dysfunctional assumptions based on her personal history and clinical presentation, thus forming the foundation for understanding the client. One’s core beliefs are set in early childhood. For Rose, her early childhood included themes of strict adherence to cultural norms of hard work and self-sufficiency, religious piety, and high standards set by her parents over her behavior and physical body. Rose’s core beliefs about herself, her world, and her future stem from these themes. Her view of herself appears to be that she is “not good enough and not doing enough.” This core belief is linked with a dysfunctional assumption that if she is not meeting the standards and expectations set by her parents or those in positions of authority, then she is a terrible person. This thought leads to feelings of guilt and self-loathing, punishing herself for not being enough. Rose also appears to have a dysfunctional assumption that if she is not independent, she is not good enough. As an older adult on conservatorship who does not work and receives financial assistance from the government, she does not meet her own expectations for independence, which then increases her felt guilt.</p>
<p>Coping mechanisms are strategies that individuals learn that help them to address stress and challenges. Coping mechanisms can be functional or dysfunctional, depending on the long-term impact on the individual. One of the coping mechanisms that Rose learned when she was young was to restrict her eating. She was successful in losing weight and received attention and praise, reinforcing her coping mechanism of diet restriction. Rose received positive attention for meeting beauty standards when she placed as a top contestant in a beauty pageant and was encouraged to pursue a modeling shoot. For Rose, this coping mechanism led to anorexia nervosa, which has returned with increased stress and difficulty coping.</p>
<p>A CBT model can also be applied to Rose’s schizoaffective disorder, although onset of the disorder is explained by the diathesis-stress model. According to the diathesis-stress model, the multiple stressful life events during Rose’s late 20s triggered her genetic predisposition to mental illness and led to the presentation of psychotic symptoms. The cognitive-behavioral model is used to understand fluctuations in symptom presentation by identifying triggers that precede the onset of symptoms. Rose’s known triggers are felt pressure from authority figures that lead to increased guilt and tones or announcements over the loudspeaker that lead to increased paranoia.</p>
<p>The CCMSC and cognitive-behavioral models used to conceptualize Rose’s case inform the treatment and chosen interventions.</p>

<title>7 Course of Treatment and Assessment of Progress</title>
<p>Rose has been in treatment with the clinician for 6 months, meeting with the clinician for approximately 30 sessions. Session frequency fluctuated based on the client’s clinical presentation and coordination with other health professionals on Rose’s care team. The clinician and client met weekly for the first 6 weeks, increased frequency to semiweekly for 6 weeks due to symptom severity, and then decreased to weekly sessions once she began attending a partial hospitalization program 2 days per week. The goal of treatment from the perspective of the care team was to decrease Rose’s mental health symptoms and related functional impairments that placed her at risk for being moved to a higher level of care. Rose’s stated goals were to “feel better” and “to be of some use and be able to contribute to society.”</p>
<p>In the initial stages of therapy, the clinician worked to build rapport with Rose while also developing a working relationship with her care team, which included her conservator, psychiatrist, nurse practitioner, assisted living management, the nurse in charge of medication management, and the activities director, as well as her best friend. Rose quickly engaged with the clinician and the process of therapy, which was aided by a moderate symptom presentation at the beginning of therapy. The client stated her goal during the first session, expressed positive regard for the clinician, and endorsed feeling hope and a desire to improve. The clinician worked to build rapport through traditional methods of empathic reflective listening, encouraging verbalization of affect, and partnering with the client in creating her goals. The length of sessions fluctuated from 10 min, when the client’s depression symptoms were severe and she was not engaging with the clinician, to 45 min, when her symptoms decreased and she presented with motivation and high engagement.</p>
<p>During the first weeks of therapy, the clinician worked to create an accepting environment in therapy that would contrast the client’s belief that she needed to meet high expectations to be good enough. The clinician provided positive regard and expressed acceptance liberally, deliberately working to do so when the client’s mood improved and she engaged in a more traditional talk therapy, and when her depression was severe and she was unable to get out of bed. The clinician set regular sessions and came at the same time every week, expressing positive regard, empathy, and acceptance during each session. The goal was to help Rose challenge her dysfunctional assumption that if she did not meet the standards of authority figures, she would not be good enough and to begin to internalize the positive regard. During this time, the clinician introduced a discussion of eating, body image, and health that recurred throughout therapy.</p>
<p>After approximately six weekly sessions, Rose showed no symptom change and there was felt pressure in the care team to move the client to a higher level of care. The clinician advocated for an intermediate step prior to referral to a higher level of care. The care team agreed to the intermediate step, and the clinician increased the frequency of sessions to semiweekly while the psychiatrist increased the client’s dosage of one antidepressant. The clinician focused on CBT techniques of increasing engagement in pleasurable activities aimed at decreasing depression. The clinician encouraged Rose to reflect on pleasant activities she enjoyed in the past and write them in a journal between sessions to build a list of pleasant events. Rose was also encouraged to journal her thoughts and mood between sessions. Rose successfully did this in session with the clinician but was unable to implement it regularly on her own due to the severity of her symptoms. Rose also reported a common issue reported by other older adults of discomfort with writing in a journal due to changes in fine motor ability and self-consciousness over legibility. Therefore, the clinician shifted the treatment approach, discussing changes with the client with the goal of partnering with her and empowering her involvement in her care.</p>
<p>The clinician suggested a behavioral technique and collaborated with Rose to create a chart to track self-care activities she wanted to be able to do independently. A column for tracking mood was included in the chart. The clinician helped Rose set an achievable goal, and Rose identified a reward. The clinical goal for the behavioral treatment was to track Rose’s mood and identify possible triggers to schizoaffective symptoms. Rose met her first goal in 1 month, getting out of bed independently and eating breakfast on her own 2 days in 1 week. Rose was rewarded with an outing to a local coffee shop, during which she spent smiling and stating a desire for pleasant activities to look forward to in the future. The clinician and Rose together set a new goal, but the treatment shifted due to pressure from the care team for faster symptom reduction.</p>
<p>The clinician collaborated with the psychiatrist, conservator, and manager of the assisted living toward the goal of the care team to increasing the client’s care. The clinician worked to empower the client to engage in her care, while referring Rose to a partial hospitalization program. Rose agreed to attend 2 days a week if she continued receiving one-on-one therapy from the clinician. The focus of therapy sessions shifted to supporting Rose in verbalizing her thoughts and feelings about the transition to attendance at the partial hospitalization program.</p>
<p>Rose reported feelings of guilt that she was not improving more quickly, and the clinician worked to decrease the pressure felt by Rose to improve. Rose appeared to be feeling the pressure of the care team to decrease her symptoms quickly, which may have triggered feelings in Rose that are reminiscent of the pressure she felt from her parents to meet their expectations. To decrease the client’s felt pressure, the clinician provided psychoeducation on schizoaffective disorder, normalizing her challenges and setting an expectation of small steps toward improvement. The clinician refocused the client toward goals of focus on activities of daily living and pleasurable activities to enjoy and look forward to. The client identified a pleasant event and coping strategy of smoking with her best friend on the porch, showing a step toward improvement. The clinician continued to provide praise and positive regard for her efforts toward improvement.</p>
<p>Over a series of weeks of attending the partial program 2 days a week and therapy 1 day a week, Rose began to reengage with her resident community, attending one to two activities during the week with her best friend. Her range of affect increased and she began verbalizing her frustration with the requirement to attend the partial program. The clinician responded to Rose’s anger by encouraging her to verbalize her thoughts and opinions, framing it as a positive sign of energy and motivation for change. The clinician encouraged Rose to continue stating her opinions regarding her care, and worked to respond to the client’s opinions to reward and promote Rose’s continued involvement. For example, Rose reported wanting something that gave her purpose, which was incorporated into treatment by giving Rose a plant to care for.</p>
<p>Rose continues to receive counseling and may require ongoing mental health support due to the persistent nature of schizoaffective disorder. She continues to need prompting from staff to get out of bed most days of the week and will eat two meals per day without needing staff to feed her. Rose’s mood continues to fluctuate significantly during the week between depressed mood and hypomanic mood, but she has made a step toward improvement in her ability to reflect on the fact that her mood shifts. Rose continues to attend the partial program 2 days per week and attend therapy 1 day per week, slowly progressing toward her goal to “feel better and have purpose.”</p>

<sec id="section18-1534650112457457">
<title>8 Complicating Factors</title>
<p>Two main factors stand out and complicate Rose’s case. First, Rose’s unique and quickly shifting mood created a challenge for conceptualizing her case and identifying what treatments would promote improvement and mental health. Days that Rose primarily presented with severe depression, poverty of speech, and self-isolation limited her responsiveness to traditional therapy, whereas on contrasting days of improved or hypomanic mood, Rose engaged well in therapy, reflected on her symptoms, stated desire for medication adjustment, and increased social activity in her residence. The extreme shift in her symptoms during the week required the clinician to be flexible with session length and to be prepared with a variety of possible treatment interventions to implement based on the client’s level of symptomatology and engagement.</p>
<p>The second complicating factor in Rose’s case is the team approach. The goal of an interdisciplinary care team is to bring the skills, perspectives, and strengths of different health fields together to identify and promote treatment that will best fit the client’s holistic needs. In practice, Rose’s care team is informally made up of the health professionals working toward improving her mental health. The perspectives and views of the different fields lead to disagreements between health professionals about what interventions will help and whether or how to involve Rose in the decision-making process regarding her care. The medical model brings an expectation of quick recovery where the doctor makes clinical decisions for the client. However, persistent mental illness is not quickly cured. Collaboration and teamwork takes effort, time, and repeated communication, which was challenging in Rose’s case.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-1534650112457457">
<title>9 Access and Barriers to Care</title>
<p>One significant barrier to care for Rose has been accessing dental care. Medicare and Medicaid do not cover dental care, and Rose cannot afford full price dental care or private insurance. Because her dental care needs likely exacerbate her anorexia, the care team has been seeking low-cost dental services.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-1534650112457457">
<title>10 Follow-Up</title>
<p>Rose is receiving continued care with the clinician. The clinician will continue to promote a collaborative care approach with the other professionals in the care team and to increase communication. The clinician will continue to support Rose in her goal of improved mood and desire for purpose and independence.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section21-1534650112457457">
<title>11 Treatment Implications of the Case</title>
<p>Rose’s case highlights the importance of increased collaboration between health professionals on interdisciplinary care teams. Health professionals are trained to work in their specific fields, yet there is a need for health professionals to increasingly collaborate between fields and use the strengths and skills of each. Second, Rose’s case highlights a need for research on appropriate and effective treatments and medications for older adults, and for individuals with schizoaffective disorder, anorexia nervosa, or comorbid disorders. Finally, Rose’s case supports the current developments in the field of psychology to promote specialized training for individuals who will be working with older adults.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section22-1534650112457457">
<title>12 Recommendations to Clinicians and Students</title>
<p>Based on Rose’s case, it is recommended that clinicians working with adults in late life need to adjust the clinical approach to fit the specific needs of older adults. This involves considering the context of the client, cohort effects, maturity factors, and age-specific challenges as suggested in Knight’s CCMSC model. It involves increased attention to medical diagnoses and the impact of these diagnoses on the clinical presentation and mood. It is recommended that clinicians take a team approach to treatment, partnering with the client, other health care professionals, community members, residence staff, friends, and family. Due to changes in the body’s response to and breakdown of medications in late life, it is recommended that clinicians advocate for medication management with a geriatric psychiatrist who can monitor and adjust medications as needed. Finally, it is recommended that clinician’s consider themselves advocates for older adult clients and work to include clients in the care process, advocating for the client’s identified goals and maintenance of appropriate levels of independence as much as possible.</p>
