<abstract>
<p>This article presents a new dataset of indicators of political freedom, property rights and political instability for Zimbabwe for the period 1946 to 2005. The dataset is constructed by systematically coding the three concepts of political freedom, property rights and political instability along a multitude of dimensions. The lengthy time coverage of the dataset allows country-specific econometric analysis to evaluate generalizing propositions about the effects of political institutions on economic outcomes. The dataset also contributes to the dynamic analysis of the effects of political institutions on conflict, a contentious issue in political science. Correlations between the new measures reveal that while political instability has a strong and negative relationship with property rights, it has no significant relationship with political freedom. The finding supports the notion that political conflict is significantly higher in the in-between category of semi-democracy than at either end of the democracy scale. The validity of the dataset is supported by its strong correlations with other conceptually and operationally different measures of political institutions. The new dataset has begun to be employed in country-specific time-series studies of the link between institutions and economic outcomes. Two core results are that property rights influence the volumes of foreign direct investment (FDI) in Zimbabwe and that negative spillover effects of poor institutional environments can occur between neighbouring countries. It is feasible to extend the geographical coverage of the dataset by applying our methodological framework to other countries.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>New developments in the growth literature argue that in addition to factor accumulation and technological innovation, there exist deep structural determinants of economic performance related to the political institutional structure of societies. It is argued that institutional factors such as property rights and rule of law directly influence transaction and information costs thereby affecting economic performance in the long run. Zimbabwe presents a natural experiment on economic disruptions that can occur following a shock to a country’s political institutional framework. Its economy has grappled with a state of rapid socio-economic deterioration with the per capita real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) declining at an annual average rate of 6.2% between 1999 and 2005. A variety of factors ranging from unfavourable climatic conditions<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0022343311434326">1</xref>
</sup> to policy-related macroeconomic imbalances<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0022343311434326">2</xref>
</sup> have been offered to account for Zimbabwe’s growth problem. However, there is a widespread view that weak political institutions characterized by insecure property rights and unreliable rule of law are at the centre of the problem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0022343311434326">Richardson, 2005a</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0022343311434326">b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022343311434326">Bates, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Testing the long-term link between political institutions and economic outcomes presents some methodological difficulties because existing institutional indices have limited time coverage, thus limiting their usefulness in country-specific studies. It is emphasized in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022343311434326">Fedderke, Klitgaard &amp; Akramov (2011)</xref> that cross-country studies do not account for cross-country heterogeneity on the link between political institutions and a multitude of outcomes like conflict and economic development. There is thus a need for clinical country-specific studies, which are only possible in the presence of lengthy datasets.</p>
<p>The purpose of our research is to evaluate the nature of political institutions and political instability in Zimbabwe for the period 1946–2005 by constructing indicators of de jure property rights and political freedom and de facto political instability. The dataset enables the testing of the long-term link between economic performance and institutions at country level, thereby resolving the heterogeneity problems inherent in cross-country empirical studies. The article is organized as follows. The next section provides a brief review of the literature followed by the empirical methodology section. The following three sections present the construction and interpretation of the political freedom, property rights and political instability indices, respectively. The final two sections present some empirical applications of the new dataset and the conclusion of our research.</p>

<sec id="section2-0022343311434326">
<title>Literature survey</title>
<p>One view on the link between economic outcomes and institutions emphasizes the need to start with democratic political institutions and other checks and balances on the government (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0022343311434326">North &amp; Thomas, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0022343311434326">North, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022343311434326">Acemoglu, Johnson &amp; Robinson, 2004</xref>). Once such institutions are in place, investment in human and physical capital and therefore economic growth are expected to follow. An alternative hypothesis, advanced by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022343311434326">Lipset (1959)</xref>, postulates that causality runs from economic performance to political institutions. According to this view, minimum threshold levels of economic development and human capital are required in order to sustain democratic political institutions. Both views, however, emphasize the need to secure property rights in order to support investment in human and physical capital. Empirical literature generally supports that the causal impact runs from political institutions to economic performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022343311434326">Kormendi &amp; Meguire, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022343311434326">Mauro, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022343311434326">Grier &amp; Tullock, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022343311434326">Knack &amp; Keefer, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022343311434326">Acemoglu, Johnson &amp; Robinson, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0022343311434326">Rodrik, Subramanian &amp; Trebbi, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022343311434326">Acemoglu &amp; Johnson, 2005</xref>) but there exists empirical evidence on reverse causality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022343311434326">Helliwell, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022343311434326">Barro, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022343311434326">Pzeworski &amp; Limongi, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022343311434326">Boix &amp; Stokes, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>In testing the relationship between the political institutions and economic outcomes, empirical studies depend on several indicators of political freedom. Existing indicators can be subdivided into objective and subjective measures. Objective measures include the use of voter turnout statistics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022343311434326">Lerner, 1958</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0022343311434326">Vanhanen, 2000</xref>), the composition of the legislative and executive branches of government (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022343311434326">Cutright, 1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0022343311434326">Vanhanen, 1990</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0022343311434326">2000</xref>), or the franchise in a political system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022343311434326">Cutright &amp; Wiley, 1969</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022343311434326">Bollen (1980)</xref> casts some doubt on the validity of objective indicators which may be influenced by other factors that are only marginally related to political rights and civil liberties.</p>
<p>The subjective indicators rely on expert judges who rate countries’ standing on various aspects of political freedom. Subjective indices that dominate scholarly usage include the Freedom House indices of political rights and civil liberties, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022343311434326">Banks’s (1971)</xref> Cross Polity Time Series on freedom of group opposition, competitiveness of nomination process of the chief executive and the legislature and the effectiveness of the elected legislative body in undertaking its duties, the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022343311434326">Bollen (1980</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022343311434326">1990</xref>) democracy index, the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022343311434326">Gurr &amp; Jaggers (1995)</xref> Polity index and the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022343311434326">Gates et al.

</fig>
<p>It is also important to comprehend the political institutions–political instability nexus, an issue that has received significant scholarly debate in political science (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022343311434326">Cederman, Hug &amp; Krebs, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022343311434326">Gleditsch &amp; Ruggeri, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022343311434326">Hegre et al., 2001</xref>). While it is generally accepted that democracy induces peace, there is still debate concerning the possibility that democratization processes may well trigger political violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022343311434326">Cederman, Hug &amp; Krebs, 2010</xref>). For instance, with respect to civil wars <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022343311434326">Hegre et al. (2001)</xref> find evidence that intermediate levels of democracy may induce conflict, but the indicators used have been criticized for endogeneity and measurement problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022343311434326">Gleditsch, Hegre &amp; Strand, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0022343311434326">Vreeland, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Not much work has been done to quantify property rights. Widely used property rights indices are those constructed by the Fraser Institute and the Heritage Foundation. Deficiencies of property rights indicators led some researchers such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022343311434326">Mauro (1995)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022343311434326">Knack &amp; Keefer (1995)</xref> to turn to subjective ratings marketed to international investors by firms like Business International, the International Country Risk Guide and Business Environmental Risk Intelligence who specialize in political risk assessment.</p>

<title>Empirical methodology</title>
<p>There are some methodological and conceptual difficulties in constructing perception-based institutional indices. First, precision may be affected by perceptual biases of the judges making the subjective ratings. Second, the indices tend to summarize a large amount of information across a range of distinct dimensions inevitably hiding the important changes that take place within these dimensions.</p>
<p>We adopt the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022343311434326">Fedderke, de Kadt &amp; Luiz (2001)</xref> methodology which limits subjectivity by using the following rigorous steps suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022343311434326">Bollen &amp; Paxton (2000)</xref>. </p>

<title>Identification of an ideal state</title>
<p>The notion of political freedom or democracy is much debated, but we make no attempt to provide an exhaustive review of the debate. We adopt the three theoretical dimensions of a contemporary liberal democracy advanced by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022343311434326">Gurr &amp; Jaggers (1995)</xref>. The first dimension is institutionalized political competition accomplished through establishment of regular and meaningful competition among individuals and groups and an inclusive degree of political participation in the selection of leaders and policies. The second dimension is the existence of institutionalized constraints on the exercise of executive power. The final dimension is the guarantee of civil liberties to all citizens in their daily lives and in acts of political participation.</p>

<p>The three theoretical dimensions are operationalized through a rating instrument with a check list of 12 subcomponents which are:<disp-quote>

<sec id="section6-0022343311434326">
<title>Interpretation of the political freedom index</title>
<p>The composite political freedom index in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0022343311434326">Figure 2</xref> shows that the country experienced a decline in the quality of political freedom from 1946 up to 1960. This is attributed to the stream of legislation that impinged on the fundamental political and civil rights of the native Africans. The institutional framework reflected the desire of the European (White) elite to prevent both political and economic competition from the Africans (Blacks). Specifically, the electoral franchise was severely limited to the Europeans through the provisions of the Electoral Act of 1951 specifying high income and property requirements. Freedoms of association, assembly, expression, movement and the due process of law were severely restricted.</p>
<p>The sharp decline in the state of formal rights between 1959 and 1960 follows enactment of security laws which severely violated fundamental rights and gave the government wide discretionary powers to arrest and detain without trial and to restrict assembling for political reasons. Examples include the Preventive Detention Act (1959) and the Unlawful Organizations Act (1959).</p>
<p>In the early 1960s, the ruling United Federal Party (UFP) recognized that political and economic exclusion of Africans was not consistent with its goal of industrialization. The institutional framework kept African average incomes at persistently low levels leading to low internal demand. This internal inconsistency led to the liberal reforms of 1961 aimed at political and economical advancement of the Africans. The 1961 constitution introduced the first ever entrenched bill of rights, increased enfranchisement of Africans and introduced minimum representation for Africans in the House of Assembly.</p>
<p>However, the attempted institutional transformation came to a halt in 1962 when the UFP lost power to the conservative Rhodesian Front (RF) which had the backing of white workers, farmers and businessmen. Acts of insurgency by Black Nationalist movements immediately increased. As the government came to grips with the state of increasing political dissent, formal rights started declining from their seemingly better state in 1961 through the enactment of repressive legislation. This phenomenon continued throughout the 1960s. After the RF government, led by Smith, unilaterally declared independence from the colonial power in 1965, another constitution was promulgated. The new constitution gave the government discretionary power to declare states of emergency, to arrest and detain opponents without trial and to censor publications. The situation continued to worsen as the liberation war intensified and the government became determined to restore sociopolitical stability.</p>
<p>The inception of independence in 1980 ushered in a new dispensation with a new bill of rights and provisions for enfranchisement of all African adults. Furthermore, a number of discriminatory laws were repealed. However, the situation started deteriorating again in the mid-1980s as the government enacted laws allowing arbitrary state action at the expense of the rights of individuals. The subsequent acute worsening of formal rights in 2002 was due to the enactment of laws which limited the electoral franchise and freedom of expression and association.</p>

<title>Property rights</title>
<p>Since the Zimbabwean economy is primarily agro-mining, the property rights index relates to immovable property, especially land. The empirical methodology again follows an initial identification of an ideal set of rights. Zimbabwe’s realization of this ideal set of rights is then examined with reference to the most important pieces of legislation affecting these rights over this period.</p>
<sec id="section8-0022343311434326">
<title>Identification of an ideal state</title>
<p>Building on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022343311434326">Honore (1961)</xref>, the ideal set of property rights constitute the rights to (1) possess, (2) use, and (3) manage property, and the rights to (4) capital, (5) security, (6) transmit, and (7) liability to execution (meaning that the property can be taken away). The composite property rights figure ranges from 0 to 100.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0022343311434326">4</xref>
</sup> The full existence of all seven incidents would be equivalent to 100 points. Any variation from this would thus correspond to a less than perfect score.</p>
<p>A further methodological difficulty arises because restrictions on rights to immovable property were executed along racial lines during the colonial era. The post-independence land ownership rights are influenced by the colonial legacy of dualism in land ownership. Land ownership rights are expressed in four main systems of land tenure, namely freehold (private), state land, communal and leasehold (resettlement) systems. The freehold tenure system is prevalent in the commercial farming sector that is predominantly owned by white commercial farmers and transnational companies. The other forms of tenure (communal and resettlements), which are non-freehold, primarily apply to black-owned land. We therefore evaluate the freehold and non-freehold tenures separately. The separate property rights indices are then combined into a composite index, first using the proportions of land available to the different tenure systems, and then using population distribution between different racial groupings. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0022343311434326">Figure 3</xref> shows the two indices for the two tenure systems and the two composite property rights indices from the two different weighting systems.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0022343311434326">
<title>Interpretations of the property rights index</title>
<p>The composite property rights index 1, based on the proportions of land available to the different tenures, assigns almost equal weights to the two separate indices and does not capture the racial misalignments in land ownership. In contrast, the composite property rights index 2, which employs racial proportions, attempts to factor in the racial misalignments. For purposes of tracking the overall structure of formal property rights in Zimbabwe, we choose composite property rights index 2 following the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022343311434326">Acemoglu, Johnson &amp; Robinson (2004)</xref> argument that ideal institutions provide security as well as fair access to a broad cross-section of the society.</p>
<p>The physical and qualitative division of land between Blacks and Whites was legalized initially through the Land Apportionment Act of 1930 which allowed the government to partition the land into European areas, African areas (Tribal Trust Lands), an unreserved area and national land. The tenure systems were lopsided in favour of the Whites and foreign firms.</p>
<p>The deterioration of the status of property rights in 1951 resulted from the enactment of the Land Husbandry Act which allowed the government to remove Africans from the Tribal Trust Lands. It also prescribed stringent measures to force African farmers to de-stock their cattle and modify land tenure practices.</p>
<p>The subsequent improvement in 1961 was due to the constitution which gave the legislature power to amend the Land Apportionment Act and to make provisions for opening up land to Blacks. In the same year, the Land Apportionment Act was amended to create a category of land open to all races. In 1969, the Land Tenure Act was passed to repeal the Land Apportionment Act. Although more land was set aside for black ownership, this was done within a framework that sought to further formalize dualism of land ownership.</p>

</fig>
<p>Independence in 1980 saw the inception of the Lancaster House Constitution which provided for the constitutional protection of all private property. The constitution also prescribed that the acquisition of private property by the government should be on a willing-buyer, willing-seller basis and that compensation for the acquired land should be at market price, promptly paid in the currency of the land owner’s choice. One perspective of these ingrained provisions is that they served to protect existing rights and interests in land belonging mainly to white commercial farmers and some transnational companies. Another perspective is that these provisions imposed constraints on the government’s ability to enhance access for the poor and other marginalized groups to land and land resources.</p>
<p>Beginning in 1985 up to the mid-1990s, the government made several changes to the legal framework directed towards addressing the historically unbalanced access to immovable property. These changes were implemented within the framework of fair compensation and thus posed no serious threat to private property. The mid-1990s, however, saw the enactment of constitutional amendments which removed market-based compensation for land. The biggest blow came in 2000, when the government amended the constitution by completely removing the government’s obligation to pay compensation for land, shifting the onus to Britain, the former colonial power. Further deterioration came in subsequent years as the government introduced further amendments to legislation that were aimed at limiting the jurisdiction of the courts over the land issue.</p>

<title>Political instability</title>
<p>For the purposes of this research, political instability captures internal sociopolitical unrest and disturbances. The composite political instability index is a weighted average of the following subcomponents.</p>
<list list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>Number of declarations and renewals of states of emergencies per year,</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Number of publications banned per year,</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Number of politically motivated arrests per year,</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Number of reported cases of politically-related property damage per year,</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Number of incidences of war-related armed attacks on the general public per year.</p>
</list-item>

<p>While respective weights are selected by a team of experts, the underlying principle is to assign higher weights to dimensions which represent a clear escalation of political instability and are associated with the risk of damage or loss of life.

<p>The political instability index in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0022343311434326">Figure 4</xref> shows that peaks in political unrest occurred in 1960, 1965, the period 1975–79, the mid-1980s and the period 2000–03. The peaks in the 1960s and 1970s correspond to the liberation war. In the late 1990s, particularly 1999, the government’s loss in the referendum and desire to win in the 2000 parliamentary elections led to a violent crackdown on the civil society coalition and opposition political parties.</p>

<title>Application of the data</title>
<p>We compare the new indices with existing, widely used institutional indices. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022343311434326">Table I</xref> reports the correlation coefficients. The new political freedom index correlates well with the Freedom House index of political freedom and the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0022343311434326">Vanhanen (2000)</xref> democratization index with correlation coefficients of 0.76 and 0.89 respectively. The new property rights index has a 0.74 correlation with the Fraser Institute property rights index and a 0.82 correlation with the Heritage Foundation property rights index. Generally, over the time period for which the indices overlap, correlations are high but our indices are generated for a longer time span, allowing us to disentangle the long-run link between economic performance and institutions.</p>
<p>Turning to the relationship between political freedom and property rights, there is a low and insignificant correlation of 0.27 between the new political freedom and property rights indices implying divisibility of the two forms of rights. A cointegration test between the two indices also confirms a lack of any systematic long-run relationship between the two forms of rights.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0022343311434326">5</xref>
</sup> Another key result is that political instability has a significant correlation of –0.72 with property rights but a weak correlation of 0.08 with political freedom. The weak correlation between political instability and political freedom supports the notion that political instability is significantly higher in the in-between category of semi-democracy than at either end of the democracy scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022343311434326">Hegre et al., 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>The new indices have begun to be employed in country-specific time-series studies on the link between institutions and economic outcomes. Two core results are that property rights influence the volume of foreign direct investment (FDI henceforth) and that negative spillover effects of poor institutional environments can occur between neighbouring countries. First, the de jure property rights index is used in the Johansen multivariate cointegration framework to estimate the impact of property rights on FDI in Zimbabwe over the period 1964–2005 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022343311434326">Johansen, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022343311434326">Johansen &amp; Juselius, 1990</xref>). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0022343311434326">Table II</xref> reports the long-run coefficients of the relevant FDI vector. The consistently positive coefficient on the property rights index shows that secure property rights tend to increase FDI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022343311434326">Gwenhamo, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Second, the property rights index is employed to demonstrate the existence of neighbourhood effects or contagion where the institutional environment in <table-wrap id="table1-0022343311434326" position="float">

<p>Spearman’s non-parametric correlation coefficient is used to determine the degree of statistical association between the indices for overlapping years: Our Political freedom (1946–2005), Freedom House Political freedom (1972–2005), Vanhanen Democratization (1980–2005), Our Political instability (1950–2005), Polity (1970–2005), Our Property rights (1946–2005), Heritage Foundation Property rights (1996–2005), and Fraser Institute Property rights (1975–1996). Pearson’s product moment correlation coefficients between the indices are not significantly different from the coefficients reported here. * denotes significance at 5%, ** denotes significance at 1% level. The Freedom House indices are inverted so that higher scores correspond to good institutions.</p>

</table-wrap>Zimbabwe significantly impacts on South Africa’s foreign capital inflows. Again using the Johansen cointegration framework, two separate estimations for South Africa’s FDI function and portfolio investment function are obtained, including the property rights index for Zimbabwe as a control variable. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0022343311434326">Table III</xref> shows that this control variable has a negative coefficient in the FDI equation but a positive coefficient in the portfolio investment equation. This suggests that weak property rights in Zimbabwe tend to increase South Africa’s FDI but reduce its portfolio investment. The probable explanation is that when property rights in Zimbabwe worsen, FDI appears to switch to South Africa as an alternative safer destination. In contrast, poor property rights in Zimbabwe appear to raise the perceived risk for portfolio investment in South Africa, leading to a reduction of portfolio investment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022343311434326">Gwenhamo &amp; Fedderke, 2009</xref>).</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The article assembles a new dataset of indicators of political freedom, property rights and political instability for Zimbabwe for the period 1946–2005. Although the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022343311434326">Fedderke, de Kadt &amp; Luiz (2001)</xref> methodology was followed, improvements were achieved by scoring subcomponents of the de jure indices individually, thereby reducing aggregation biases.</p>
<p>The key strength of the dataset lies in the careful selection and coding of the subcomponents that make up the three indices. The lengthy coverage of the dataset is an added advantage over cross-country datasets in the estimation of the political institutions–economic growth link. The use of cross-country evidence opens the possibility that the interaction between political institutions and economic growth shows considerable country specificity. In the presence of heterogeneity, estimation under a specification that imposes homogeneity on the political institutions–economic growth link leads to biased and inconsistent estimates. The new dataset allows country-specific econometric analysis that resolves the bias-effects of heterogeneity inherent in cross-country estimations.</p>
<p>Correlations between the indices suggest three key issues. The first relates to the relationship between political freedom and property rights. There is low correlation between the two indices, implying a high degree of divisibility between the two forms of rights. This means that even autocratic regimes may choose sound property rights.</p>
<p>The second is the relationship between political instability, on one hand, and political freedom and property rights, on the other. The political instability index bonds well with the property rights index but has no significant relationship with the political freedom index. Third, the new indicators correlate fairly well with some existing commonly used institutional indices, thus raising our confidence on the validity of our own measures.</p>

<p>Although the current dataset stretches for a significant time period, it has a limited geographical coverage which limits its usefulness in panel data empirical studies. To extend the geographical coverage of the data, future research can apply our methodology in order to develop the three institutional indices for other countries.</p>
<p>Extension of the dataset to other countries is also important for comparative purposes. For instance, the institutional structure and change in Zimbabwe was strongly influenced by racial divisions. It is therefore important to use our methodology to develop the institutional measures for a country such as Botswana, with less pronounced racial divisions, and compare the resulting institutional indices with those of Zimbabwe.</p>
