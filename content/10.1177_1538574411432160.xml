<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Pulmonary embolism claims thousands of lives every year and is a leading cause of mortality in hospitalized patients. The first attempt at preventing pulmonary embolism dates back to the 18th century as John Hunter ligated both femoral veins. In the mid 20th century, partially occluding clips were placed around the inferior vena cava (IVC) but were associated with occlusion rates approaching 100%. The use of anticoagulation by means of short- or long-acting drugs and systemic- or catheter-directed thrombolysis has provided major advances in the treatment; however, does not address the prevention of this serious condition. The development of the contemporary Greenfield filter (Boston Scientific, Watertown, Massachusetts) in the 1970s finally provided the effective protection against pulmonary embolism with a much lower rate of caval occlusion. Since then, multiple iterations have developed in an attempt to prevent migration, tilt, fracture, and perforation of the IVC and adjacent structures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1538574411432160">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>In 2002, the Food and Drug Administration approved the Recovery system (Bard, Tempe, Arizona) as the first retrievable IVC filter, and in 2005, the G2 system (Bard) replaced the Recovery system in an attempt to decrease the occurrence of fatigue-related fractures, minimize IVC penetration, and decrease tilt and migration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1538574411432160">2</xref></sup> Initially, the G2 system was introduced for permanent use, but in 2008, it was approved as a retrievable device.</p>
<p>The design modifications in the retrievable IVC filters are intended to allow for removal once the condition at risk resolves. These filters have gained substantial acceptability as a means to prevent the long-term complications inherent to the permanent devices; however, whereas several large series attest to the safety and successful removal, there is a scarcity of reports of significant device-related complications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1538574411432160">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1538574411432160"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1538574411432160"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1538574411432160"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1538574411432160">6</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Radiologic evidence of IVC perforation by filter components is a common finding; however, in spite of the large volume of IVC filters placed annually, adjacent aortic wall penetration is an occurrence rarely reported.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1538574411432160">1</xref></sup>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>An extensive literature review was conducted using the PUBMED database. The keywords “inferior vena cava filter” and “Greenfield filter” were used to search for relevant publications. A second search was conducted using the keywords “penetration,” “perforation,” and “migration”. The results of both queries were merged using the Boolean operator “AND,” and relevant publications reporting an aortic penetration by any of the IVC filter components were selected. Furthermore, publications reporting outcomes of IVC filter placements were reviewed to identify isolated cases of aortic perforation. The reference sections of the selected publications were reviewed to identify additional reports relevant to our study.</p>
<p>The following data were extracted from the literature search: date of publication, age, gender, IVC filter model, clinical and radiologic presentation, time interval between placement and diagnosis, aortic pathology, treatment, and clinical or radiologic surveillance.</p>

<title>Case Report</title>
<p>A 30-year-old female underwent evaluation for bariatric surgery. The past medical history was significant for morbid obesity, chronic anemia, hypothyroidism, and chronic venous insufficiency. The physical examination did not reveal any specific abnormalities except for a body mass index of 62.1. The patient underwent a prophylactic placement of a retrievable G2 IVC filter (Bard Peripheral Vascular) with the intention of removal, once recovered from bariatric surgery. The right internal jugular vein was accessed under ultrasound guidance, a guide wire and introducer sheath were placed, and an IVC venogram was conducted. The G2 filter was deployed just below the first lumbar vertebra and a repeat venogram confirmed proper placement below the renal veins with adequate fixation on the IVC wall and no tilt. Subsequently, the patient underwent a combined laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and hiatal hernia repair. The postoperative course was only significant for the presence of a stricture at the level of the gastrojejunostomy requiring repeated dilatations with favorable results.</p>
<p>Six months later, the patient underwent an attempt at removing the IVC filter. The right internal jugular vein was accessed and a cone removal system could not be advanced over the filter tip secondary to significant tilt. A computed tomogram (CT) scan of the abdomen revealed the filter clearly tilted against the right caval wall and lying just below the renal veins, with 9 of the 12 prongs distinctly displaced and perforating the IVC. Surprisingly, one of the prongs projected medially and penetrated the aortic wall far inside the aortic lumen, and another prong was also markedly displaced penetrating one of the vertebral bodies. There was no evidence of intramural aortic thrombus, aortic pseudoaneurysm, extravasation of intravenous contrast, or aortocaval fistula (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1538574411432160">Figure 1</xref>
).</p>

</fig>
<p>The patient only had a modest weight loss, and after few months, regained her original weight. The case was discussed among several vascular specialists and the options of endovascular exclusion, surgical repair, and a rigorous surveillance were discussed. An endovascular exclusion was deemed not appropriate as the patient did not have any specific aortic pathology, namely, aneurysm, pseudoaneurysm, thrombus formation, and so on. An open surgical approach seemed aggressive and the risks of filter removal would outweigh the benefits, especially in the setting of a morbidly obese patient. After a thorough discussion with the patient, it was decided to continue a rigorous clinical and radiologic surveillance every 6 months or as needed if symptoms developed. Computed tomography scans with and without intravenous contrast every 6 months over a 3-year period were conducted, and the images invariably confirmed the intra-aortic position of the IVC filter prong without any additional radiologic abnormalities. The patient has remained asymptomatic for over 3 years and denies any abdominal pain, discomfort, or throbbing sensation. The radiologic surveillance has been negative at 3 years for the development of an aortic aneurysm or pseudoaneurysm. The images are also negative for the presence of an aortocaval or aorto-intestinal fistula.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>An extensive review of the literature retrieved 12 cases of aortic penetration by an IVC filter (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1538574411432160">Table 1</xref>
). The breakdown of IVC filter models involved was Mobin-Udden umbrella: 1; Kimray-Greenfiled filter: 6; Bird’s nest filter: 2; Simon-nitinol filter: 1; Recovery system: 1; and G2 filter: 1. The age range was 29 to 68 years and there were 11 women and 1 man. The time interval between the IVC filter placement and the diagnosis was 2 to 10 years with an average of 4.75 years.</p>

<p>The presentation of symptoms was abdominal pain in 4 of 12, back and thigh pain in 1 of 12, an incidental intraoperative finding in 1 of 12, acute lower extremity ischemia in 1 of 12, and an incidental radiologic finding in 5 of 12 patients.</p>
<p>Aortic pathology identified included aortic aneurysm/pseudoaneurysm in 4 of 12, aortic mural thrombus without aneurysmal pathology in 3 of 12, aortocaval fistula in 1 of 12, and no specific aortic pathology in 4 of 12 patients</p>
<p>Subsequent treatment included aortic endograft exclusion in 3 of 12, surgical IVC filter removal in 3 of 12, axillobifemoro bypass and abdominal aortic/iliac ligation in 1 of 12, aortic graft replacement in 1 of 12, peripheral surgical arterial bypass in 1 of 12, and no specific treatment in 2 of 12. One patient died as a result of a retroperitoneal hemorrhage and the diagnosis was discovered during autopsy.</p>
<p>Clinical or radiologic follow-up was conducted in 8 of the 11 surviving patients and ranged from 4 to 16 months. A follow-up CT scan was performed in 6 patients. Three patients were treated with an aortic endograft and the CT scan showed complete exclusion of the filter prong without an endoleak or aortocaval fistula. In the remaining 3 cases, the aortic perforation was discovered as an incidental radiologic finding; in 1, a surgical extraction was conducted and a CT scan 6 months later revealed thrombosis of the IVC, and in the remaining 2 cases, the follow-up CT scan at 4 and 16 months later did not show any significant changes. Clinical follow-up without radiologic evaluation was conducted in 2 additional patients at 6 months with a favorable recovery reported.</p>

<sec id="section5-1538574411432160">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In a seminal trial comparing anticoagulation with or without IVC filter placement to prevent pulmonary embolism, filter insertion offered a 4.3-fold decrease in pulmonary embolism; however, it imposed a 1.8-fold increased risk of deep venous thrombosis at 2 years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1538574411432160">19</xref></sup> The use of smaller delivery systems in the last decade has attempted to decrease the incidence of deep venous thrombosis. This latent risk and the increasing younger population susceptible to pulmonary embolism has stimulated an interest to develop retrievable IVC filters to be removed after the hypercoagulable condition resolves, namely, trauma, postoperative recovery, and so on. These design changes attempt to overcome the biological response of the device contact area, although they still pose potential long-term risks of migration, fracture, and perforation.</p>
<p>Despite the various modifications in the IVC filter design, filter leg perforations have been reported at rates as high as 85% to 100% in the earlier iterations and 26% in the newer retrievable filters.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1538574411432160">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1538574411432160">20</xref></sup> The presence of filter prongs outside the contrast column in the IVC can be falsely interpreted as a perforation and can result from epithelialization or intimal hyperplasia covering the filter components adjacent to the caval wall but an extension of 2 to 3 mm outside the column of contrast is generally viewed as a perforation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1538574411432160">21</xref></sup> In contrast, perforation of adjacent structures is considerably rare, with isolated reports of perforation of the duodenum with upper gastrointestinal bleeding,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1538574411432160">22</xref></sup> vertebral bodies,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1538574411432160">18</xref></sup> pancreas,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1538574411432160">23</xref></sup> ureters,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1538574411432160">24</xref></sup> and the aorta.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1538574411432160">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1538574411432160">18</xref></sup> Despite the close proximity of the IVC to the aorta, the high volume of IVC filter placements, and the high incidence of IVC penetration, aortic penetration by the IVC filter prongs has only been rarely reported, in some instances as an incidental finding, or with a symptomatic presentation.</p>
<p>Our case is representative of the prophylactic use of a temporary IVC filter in a patient deemed to have a high risk of deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism after bariatric surgery. The patient had an uneventful placement of an IVC filter with satisfactory radiographic confirmation without tilt or migration. Six months later, significant tilt developed and it was not feasible to advance the retrieval cone over the filter due to the tilt of the filter apex against the IVC wall, with possible filter apex encasement. A subsequent CT scan revealed displacement of the filter apex against the IVC and major displacement and perforation of 9 of the 12 prongs through the IVC wall. One of the prongs clearly perforated the aorta without contrast extravasation or a direct aortocaval communication.</p>
<p>Publications reporting aortic penetration by IVC filters are scattered and only 12 cases were retrieved after an extensive review of the literature (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1538574411432160">Table 1</xref>). In addition, large series of IVC filter placement, largely, do not report the presence of aortic perforation among the complications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1538574411432160">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1538574411432160">6</xref></sup> Among the large series reported, only 2 found aortic perforation as one of the complications. Ferris<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1538574411432160">25</xref></sup> (2 of 320 patients) and McGowan<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1538574411432160">21</xref></sup> (2 of 20 patients) reported radiologic evidence of aortic penetration, without any detail reported regarding each of these patients. Despite using 7 different filter systems, all of these perforations occurred with the Nitinol IVC filter, an earlier iteration with increased incidence of IVC penetration. Among the retrievable filters, the IVC penetration rate was reduced in the new G2 filter, compared with its predecessor, the recovery system (62% vs 26%).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1538574411432160">4</xref></sup> Although device modifications have decreased the incidence of IVC and adjacent organ penetration, these events continue to occur and have not spared the newly developed retrievable IVC filters.</p>
<p>As in the case reported, device tilt may prevent the retrievability of an IVC filter. Lynch reported device tilt as an event occurring during the initial insertion which may prevent the successful removal of a retrievable filter.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1538574411432160">26</xref></sup> It is conceivable that by unevenly projecting the filter prongs against the IVC wall, device tilt may also facilitate the penetration of the IVC and adjacent organs; however, there is conflicting data in the literature regarding an association between filter tilt and migration or perforation of the struts. Binkert reported on 100 patients receiving the retrievable G2 filter and found no association between the degrees of tilt and filter penetration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1538574411432160">4</xref></sup> Others have reported that the association of the respiratory and cardiac motion, and the aortic pulsation, may contribute to filter migration and penetration of the IVC and adjacent structures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1538574411432160">27</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>In 6 of the 12 cases, an incidental radiologic or intraoperative finding was the initial presentation; however, in 5 of the 12 cases, the patients presented with abdominal or back pain. It is frequent to develop transient abdominal or back pain immediately after an IVC filter placement; however, in the setting of an unexplained new onset of these symptoms in a patient with a prior history of an IVC filter placement, a device-related complication should always be considered. Surveillance in these patients has traditionally been performed with a CT scan of the abdomen. Angeli reported a case of aortic penetration diagnosed with ultrasonography and described accurate imaging with this modality for diagnosis and surveillance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1538574411432160">9</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>The presence of aortic penetration by any of the IVC filter components looms as an ominous finding in clinical practice. Although there are few isolated reports in the literature over more than 20 years, there are no collective reviews that present a detailed synopsis of the presentation, treatment, outcomes, and surveillance of these interesting occurrences. Our report aims at presenting a comprehensive review of the clinical and radiologic findings, aortic pathology, management, outcomes, and follow-up of patients with penetration of the IVC filter components into the aortic lumen. Back and abdominal pain and the presence of an incidental finding comprise the majority of presentations. The IVC and aortic penetration has been reported more frequently with the earlier iterations of the IVC filters, however, the liberal use of CT is likely to identify additional cases of aortic penetration. Aortic endograft exclusion, open surgical repair, and nonsurgical radiologic surveillance are valid approaches to this condition and the treatment should be individualized to the specific patient presentation. The follow-up reported has been limited and there is uncertainty of the long-term significance of this finding, especially in the younger population considered for temporary filter placement. Our report presents the longest surveillance in this condition, with biannual CT scans at over 3 years, without evidence of aortic pathology or progression of the migration.</p>
<p>We believe that in the case of a retained IVC filter with penetration of the aortic wall, the primary concern is the surveillance of the development of an aortic aneurysm, in which case, an endovascular stent exclusion would be a reasonable initial approach. Nevertheless, in the presence of an infected IVC filter, with or without an associated aneurysm, an extra-anatomic bypass with extraction of the IVC filter would be more appropriate. In the absence of aortic aneurysmal degeneration, aortocaval fistula, or erosion into other adjacent structures, surgical extraction of a retained IVC filter would be hard to justify unless there were significant symptoms believed to result as a consequence of the retained foreign body.The purpose of this report is to present a case of aortic perforation by an IVC filter and arouse the awareness of this complication. We believe that in the absence of aortic mural thrombosis, aneurysmal changes, or an aortocaval fistula, aortic penetration by an IVC filter may have a benign outcome. Radiologic surveillance with CT of the abdomen is necessary to ensure the absence of aortic pathology; although abdominal ultrasound in the absence of specific symptoms may be a reasonable alternative to explore for long-term surveillance.</p>
