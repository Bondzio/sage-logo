<abstract>
<p>Despite its close geographical, economic, and political ties with mainland China, Hong Kong has not followed the same trajectory on gifted education but instead has preferred to adopt a more Western approach to the definitions and provision for gifted learners (Shi &amp; Zixiu, 2000; Zou, Yang, &amp; Greene, 2007). Hong Kong is, on most measures of international achievement, one of the highest performing educational jurisdictions in the world yet, paradoxically, it is a relatively recent convert to gifted education (GE). Not surprisingly, Hong Kong shares a common cultural tradition with China, especially in terms of the cultural capital derived from Confucianism, which encourages a strong work ethic and in which educational policy sits. This article traces the development of thinking in GE from 1990 and outlines the framework for delivery using the three-tier implementation model. It describes the current GE landscape in terms of its school-based and off-site approaches to GE provision within this model, and it briefly reviews the main strands of research on GE in recent years.</p>

<body>
<p>In a competitive knowledge-based world, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) has not been slow to recognize the need to invest in human capital, and it has established education as one of its “Six Pillars” for economic development in the coming years. In his 2009-2010 policy address, the chief executive signaled a shift from the government’s laissez faire economic policy to one that was to be more closely regulated and one that aimed to broaden the economic reliance on financial services, trade and logistics, tourism, and professional services. He unveiled new incentives to nurture six new industries (the Six Pillars) with educational services alongside testing and certification, medical services, innovation and technology, culture and creative industries, and environmental industries.</p>
<p>Recurrent spending on education overall has steadily risen over the past 10 years to a level of about HK$52 billion in 2010-2011 (or about 25% of all government spending) to become the single largest cost of any government department or policy area. Similarly, the financing of the gifted education (GE) policy in Hong Kong has risen significantly in recent years. In 2006-2007, the Support Measures for Exceptionally Gifted Students included 51 enhancement programs and 36 related activities for gifted students, their teachers and parents, costing about HK$3.8 million in total (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0162353213492701">Examination of Estimates of Expenditure, 2007-2008</xref>). With a total number of beneficiaries estimated to be about 8,000, that is a direct per capita expenditure of HK$475. Annual spending on GE between 2003 and 2007 averaged HK$29 million. With the setting up of the pan-Territory Hong Kong Academy for Gifted Education (HKAGE) in 2007-2008, additional funding to the tune of about HK$24 million per year has been added to this, and the number of beneficiaries (students, parents, and teachers) has expanded considerably.</p>
<p>There is clear evidence to show that Hong Kong is one of the leading educational jurisdictions on some measure of excellence achievement. For example, the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) results for 2011 show that Hong Kong is consistently highly ranked in reading (overall ranking fourth), mathematics (overall ranking second), and science (overall ranking third), and these results have been remarkably consistent over time (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.oecd.org/pisa/">www.oecd.org/pisa/</ext-link>). There is a similar pattern of results from the International Mathematics and International Physics Olympiads in which Hong Kong has taken an active part for many years, given the high regard it places on the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) subjects. In 2011, the Hong Kong teams were awarded two gold, one silver, and three bronze medals, and three gold and two silver medals in mathematics and physics, respectively. In the most recent comparisons for mathematics, the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) reports rank Hong Kong top out of 36 countries at Grade 4 (the equivalent of Primary 4) with a standardized score of 607 compared with a scale average of 500. At Grade 8 (the equivalent of Secondary 2), Hong Kong drops slightly to fourth place with a score of 572, behind Chinese Taipei (598), The Republic of Korea (597), and Singapore (593), but trends over time show that Hong Kong is not only able to maintain but also increase its position in world rankings.</p>
<sec id="section1-0162353213492701">
<title>Background to GE in Hong Kong</title>
<p>It has been 22 years since the Hong Kong Education Commission Report No. 4 (ECR4), the first official document that recognized the need for provision of GE in Hong Kong. Subsequent to the return of Hong Kong’s sovereignty to China, the Hong Kong government has been implementing a series of wider educational reforms, and many of these have incorporated measures to improve the quality of GE throughout the territory.</p>
<p>In the 1970s, Hong Kong placed great emphasis on mass education with the aim of providing general basic education for all appropriate age groups of the population. Since 1979, 9 years of free and compulsory education have been widely implemented. The result, similar to many education jurisdictions across the globe, was the emergence of a common curriculum based on the assumption that “one size fits all”—that the needs of all students could be met from common curricula and common strategies for teaching.</p>
<p>In the 1980s, there was a shift away from the one-size-fits-all paradigm with the recognition that students in the classroom are not all the same, that their differences can seriously affect their capacity to learn. More specifically, the needs of students with learning difficulties began to be recognized and professional support structures were introduced for those with Special Education Needs (SEN). Gifted primary students who had no serious behavioral problems were provided with enrichment courses developed by the Psychological Services Section of the Education and Manpower Bureau (EMB). With the introduction of a range of activities such as “small reporters,” puppets, brainstorming, and project work, it was felt the gifted students’ creativity, problem-solving skills, self-esteem, communication skills, and research skills were enhanced. In many ways, the decade of the 1980s represents the first tentative steps in the formation of informal GE in Hong Kong; it attracted the attention of teachers, parents, and the wider community, and so began the process of getting GE on the public agenda.</p>
<p>It was in the 1990s, though, that GE began to attract serious attention. The Education Commission Report No. 4 in 1990 has become a seminal influence in the evolution of GE because it has clearly defined the term <italic>giftedness</italic> and set the tone and direction for GE development in Hong Kong to the present day. GE, it reasoned, should use the multiple intelligences perspective rather than limiting our understanding to academic excellence, and identification should extend well beyond any IQ test. The ECR4 recommended that Hong Kong should develop school-based programs in mainstream schools, which was affirmed by the positive outcomes of the research and projects conducted thereafter. The report, as a milestone, initiated the development and implementation of GE in Hong Kong.</p>

<title>Aspects of Giftedness That Are Valued: The Importance of Cultural Capital</title>
<p>Cultural educational capital refers to the value systems, thinking patterns, and actions that reflect and influence the attainment of learning and wider educational goals within a particular jurisdiction. In Hong Kong, the legacy of the Confucian tradition is still a potent force in determining attitudes toward education in East Asia and toward GE in particular that are very different from perceptions in the West (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0162353213492701">Phillipson &amp; Cheung, 2007</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0162353213492701">Chen and Chung (1994)</xref>, the principles of Confucian teaching can be summarized as emphasizing education, family system, hierarchical relationships, and benevolence.</p>
<p>Several aspects are worthy of mention in this context. The first concerns the perceived need for controlling impulsive behavior from an early age as part of the preparation for schooling. The father (and more recently the mother) is often seen as the disciplinarian, but his or her role is matched by teachers once the child goes to school. Academic success is predicated on the immediate goal of impulse control no less than on the development of cognitive skills. Therefore, East Asian children are socialized to respect adults and behave in a manner that fosters compliance to regulations. Confucianism advocates hard work as the cornerstone of success in life, and the work ethic among all strata of Hong Kong society is strong. Young people therefore find themselves in a milieu, common to family and school, in which there are high expectations to work hard. “Failure” is often attributed to a lack of application on the part of the student. This approach strikes a chord with the motivational aspects of giftedness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0162353213492701">Renzulli, 2003</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0162353213492701">Sternberg’s (2003)</xref> Wisdom, Intelligence, Creativity, Synthesized (WICS) model.</p>
<p>In a similar way, there are also very strong bonds of filial piety in which meeting the demands of parents is a socializing obligation. Parents, therefore, often play a very active role in their children’s education, whether it be in school or in out-of-school activities. The recent controversy in the United States over <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0162353213492701">Amy Chua’s (2011)</xref> <italic>Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother</italic> publication serves to highlight the perceived and the real differences in parenting roles between the East and West. Cultural capital is transferred between generations with the transmission of attitudes and values from the parents. Sometimes, these can be very strong. With the Confucian emphasis on education, East Asian children are strongly motivated to achieve academically, and this is usually strongly correlated with future occupational preferences, especially for law, medicine, science, finance, and related professions.</p>
<p>If Hong Kong students are often regarded as pragmatic, seeking outcomes from learning that will enhance their status (and income), they also inherit a legacy from Confucian thinking that a person who has completed her learning, and can apply the knowledge and skills thus acquired, is able to serve in some capacity as a public official. This application of talented performance is known as <italic>cheng-cai</italic> but it can be elevated further to become <italic>ren-cai</italic> whereby there is a deep respect and care for the needs of others reflected in the notion of benevolence. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0162353213492701">Chan (2009)</xref> eloquently explained,
<disp-quote>
<p>effortful learning does not have to end in talented performance, but can be brought to a higher level of accomplishment through self-cultivation that transforms and changes one’s beliefs, attitudes, and values to a deep and ultimate concern for the well-being of others. (p. 121)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>It should come as no surprise, therefore, that as part of the delivery model of HKAGE, there is a growing community service component in the student programs.</p>
<p>Whereas there has been an ongoing debate in the West over the compatibility of equity and excellence and the perceived elitism of GE, there is no real comparable debate in China. In fact, elitism is seen as a note of distinction and it is commonplace to call the top schools in Hong Kong elite schools. Inevitably, this creates an extremely competitive environment for entry into the best schools and universities, but it also removes the stigma often attached (in the West) to GE, creating a more welcoming attitude to the concept and its application.</p>
<p>All of this points to the fact that education is seen as a vital ladder for social mobility and self-improvement, a better income, and an increase in status for the family. The cultural capital of Hong Kong favors GE because it fits with the cultural heritage and aspirations of its people. But it also has a higher motivation in which service to the community chimes well with the application of one’s talents. It is not surprising, therefore, to find that HKAGE’s student service program has met with enthusiastic support from its student members.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0162353213492701">
<title>Hong Kong’s Conception of Giftedness</title>
<p>The official (Education Bureau [EDB]) line has always been that gifted students may have exceptional achievement or potential in one or more of the following areas: certain intellectual domains, a specific subject area, original thinking, visual–spatial and artistic areas, social and leadership capacities, athletics, and mechanical skills or other areas requiring motor coordination. Giftedness is not considered equivalent to all-rounded excellence, as some gifted students may only excel in a certain domain. Some gifted students may have special educational needs such as physical or sensory abilities; specific learning disabilities; emotional, behavioral, or social problems; hyperactivity; and so on, referred to as twice- or multiple exceptionality.</p>
<p>Borrowing much of its understanding of giftedness from the U.S. Department of Education and the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0162353213492701">Marland (1972)</xref> Report, the EMB of the HKSAR affirmed in the ECR4 report that a broad definition of giftedness using multiple criteria should be adopted. Generally, gifted children have exceptional achievement or potential in one or more of the following domains:</p>
<list id="list1-0162353213492701" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>a high level of measured intelligence,</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>specific academic aptitude in a subject area,</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>creative thinking,</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>superior talent in visual and performing arts,</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>natural leadership of peers, and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>psychomotor ability (outstanding performance or ingenuity in athletics, mechanical skills, or other areas requiring gross or fine motor coordination).</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>This definition recognized the multidimensional nature of giftedness and the need to move away from reliance on single measures, particularly the IQ test, in identification. It also recognized that students may have exceptional or outstanding performance in more than one domain. With perceptive insight, the report recommended that intelligences can and should be nurtured in particular educational settings using appropriate pedagogical or teaching strategies.</p>
<p>The aim of GE in Hong Kong today is to provide gifted students with educational opportunities necessary to help them develop their potential to the fullest and to become autonomous learners and well-adjusted individuals willing to contribute to the community. The present policy encourages mainstream schools to nourish gifted students through school-based gifted development programs to meet their educational needs (i.e., the needs of the gifted should be met in the regular class using flexible and creative teaching approaches). There is also recognition by the EDB of the need to support gifted students in their social and emotional needs. On-site and off-site support is provided to schools in facilitating them to foster the multiple potential of the gifted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0162353213492701">Tommis &amp; Phillipson, 2013</xref>). Gifted students with special needs should be adequately supported and awareness of their needs should be promoted in all schools at all levels.</p>
<p>GE in Hong Kong is not mandated so there has been a heavy reliance on provision from NGOs, tertiary institutions, social services organizations, private training agencies, overseas consultants, and parent education advocacy groups.</p>
<p>The mission of GE is to fully explore and develop the potential of gifted students systematically and strategically by providing them with opportunities to receive education at appropriate levels in flexible teaching and learning environments. To cater to the educational needs of gifted students, Hong Kong advocates the following principles:</p>
<list id="list2-0162353213492701" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Nurturing multiple intelligences is a fundamental goal of quality basic education and should be the mission of all schools.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>GE should be part of quality education. The needs of gifted students, like their less able counterparts, should basically be met in their own school.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>A broad definition using multiple intelligences should be adopted.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Exploring students’ thinking and creative abilities and social skills should be the foci of GE.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>A holistic approach that recognizes the social and emotional needs, as well as the intellectual needs, of gifted students is an essential component of GE.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Schools should provide sequential and multiple educational activities to gifted students at different levels and ages. (See <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.edb.gov.hk/en/curriculum-development/major-level-of-edu/gifted/index.html">http://www.edb.gov.hk/en/curriculum-development/major-level-of-edu/gifted/index.html</ext-link>)</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Based on these guiding principles, a three-tier GE framework (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0162353213492701">Figure 1</xref>) was adopted in 2000 and modified in 2008 with the emergence of HKAGE because reference to Level 3 providers had to include the significant and expanding role to be played by the academy.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0162353213492701-fig1.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>Level 1 operates at the classroom level within the school. The objectives are to immerse the core elements advocated in GE (i.e., higher order thinking skills, creativity, and personal–social competence) in the curriculum for all students and to differentiate teaching with enrichment and extension activities across all subjects. Level 2 operates through pull-out programs within the school in specific areas (e.g., mathematics, science, languages, creativity, and leadership) outside the regular classroom to allow systematic training for students with outstanding performance. About 10% of the school population is affected at this level. Level 3 caters for the exceptionally gifted students (understood to be the top 2% in the ability range) by providing tailor-made off-site programs in collaboration with universities and other professional bodies.</p>
<p>This model provides the overarching framework for the distinctive conceptual approach toward GE adopted by Hong Kong and the delivery of its key components. It aims to be comprehensive and therefore holistic. It is also distinctive within the Asian education jurisdictions, most notably in its recognition that provision for gifted students can be made at different levels, and take different forms, in the community. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0162353213492701">Table 1</xref> summarizes the main features of this approach.</p>

<title>The Development of Talents in Schools (On-Site) and Elsewhere (Off-Site)</title>
<p>Although there is a history of service provision for GE dating back nearly two decades, the emerging landscape is one in which new players are entering the field all of the time, particularly in the provision for students.</p>
<p>There are a number of agencies catering for GE but arguably the two most important are the Gifted Education Section (GES) of the EDB and HKAGE. GES was established in 2000 and was initially part of the previous Special Educational Needs Section of EDB but since 2003, it has been given its own identity, staffing, management, and budget. The aim was to raise the profile of GE and to provide greater government focus on GE throughout the territory. With the establishment of HKAGE, EDB’s focus is on school-based GE provision.</p>
<sec id="section5-0162353213492701">
<title>School-Based GE</title>
<p>The GES plans, initiates, coordinates, supports, and reviews school-based curriculum development and implementation for gifted students across the territory. It also administers the Fung Hon Chu Gifted Education Centre, which, after a varied history since its inception in 1995, now focuses on the provision of a summer and winter schedule of classes for upper primary and lower secondary students, though the main focus is now to develop teacher resources from the best courses for use in schools. See <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.edb.gov.hk/en/curriculum-development/major-level-of-edu/gifted/index.html">http://www.edb.gov.hk/en/curriculum-development/major-level-of-edu/gifted/index.html</ext-link> for more information.</p>
<p>EDB is clear that school-based approaches should form the major part of GE provision in Hong Kong. The rationale for schools is that school-based education should cater to the learning needs and maximize the potential of all students and as such all schools should provide effective and appropriate learning opportunities for all students, including those who are gifted. The two strategic cornerstones to implementing school-based GE are (a) to formulate a school-based GE policy that offers a coherent and long-term plan for gifted learners, recognizing the resources of each school and (b) the development of a school learning community equipped with the knowledge and skills to effectively deliver the school plan through realistic curriculum planning and differentiated pedagogical strategies.</p>
<p>To facilitate the development of these plans, EDB recommends setting up a school-based GE Team (GET) with a broad membership that might include designated posts such as GE manager, GE coordinator, curriculum leaders such as assistant principal, primary schoolmaster/mistress (curriculum development), panel chairs, student guidance personnel, and educational psychologists (EPs) or school social workers. The remit of each GET should be to offer the rationale behind the GE policy, identify the goals and state the outcomes of any programs, provide for school-wide identification procedures, identify and allocate the resources needed, and evaluate all outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0162353213492701">EDB, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Schools are given advice from EDB on how to identify gifted learners with due recognition made of the varied nature of gifted cohorts (e.g., gifted all-rounder, nonacademically gifted, gifted underachiever) and of the fact that identification “is a process that is best adopted in a school-wide, ongoing approach . . . so that all students have equal opportunities to undergo the selection process” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0162353213492701">EDB, 2012</xref>, p. 35). The objective is to form a school-based talent pool made up of about 10% of the student population in which there is a recursive relationship between the development of the talent pool and the improvements in enriching the curriculum for its target audience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0162353213492701">Renzulli, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>The craft of the teacher in the regular classroom is core to the development of a suitable, enriched curriculum for learners in school-based GE. In its ongoing secondary curriculum reforms, Hong Kong places great emphasis on the need for schools to recognize and adapt teaching strategies to cope with learner diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0162353213492701">EDB, 2008</xref>), although EDB stresses that this is really a case of adopting a professional attitude toward differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0162353213492701">Tomlinson, Brimijoin, &amp; Narvaez, 2008</xref>). It identifies a number of differentiation strategies for schools to consider, including various types of grouping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0162353213492701">Gentry, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0162353213492701">Renzulli &amp; Reis, 1997</xref>), pairs/partners, jigsaw (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0162353213492701">Aronson, 2010</xref>), anchor activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0162353213492701">Langer, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0162353213492701">Tomlinson &amp; Eidson, 2003</xref>), Socratic questioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0162353213492701">Paul, 1995</xref>), and tiered instruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0162353213492701">Adams &amp; Pierce, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0162353213492701">Tomlinson &amp; Strickland, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Meeting the affective needs of students by schools is also regarded as being of crucial importance in Hong Kong. Most research conclusions of all-age high achievers tend to demonstrate that they are emotionally strong, have high productivity levels, high motivation and drive, and low levels of anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0162353213492701">Schuler, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0162353213492701">Whitmore, 1980</xref>). EDB stated that without a proper understanding of the needs of gifted learners, teachers and parents can actually add to the stress of learning caused by unrealistically high expectations. Therefore, there is a strong recommendation for affective education to be seamlessly integrated into school life at different levels: school organization, curriculum planning, classroom teaching, and off-site provisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0162353213492701">EDB, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>The practice, if not the policy, of EDB has evolved over the past 10 years but the goal remains to “reach 100% of the region’s learners in a genuinely inclusive way with a wide remit for accommodating learner diversity through three distinct levels of engagement” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0162353213492701">EDB, 2012</xref>, p. 2). There can be no doubt that Hong Kong has made significant strides in the development of its school-based approach to GE, but it has still not convinced the majority of principals, the key gate keepers, that GE matters. Moreover, the final conclusion of the report by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0162353213492701">Phillipson, Phillipson, and Eyre (2011)</xref> stated despite the high level of public interest in GE in Hong Kong, as well as a number of recent developments, the GE policy upon which GE is based is yet to be evaluated. Without such an evaluation, the impact of change can only remain speculative.</p>

<title>Off-Site GE</title>
<p>With one or two long-standing university student programs and NGO support, off-site provisions for GE have been around longer than school-based support. However, this component of the GE landscape has become much more active—even crowded—in recent years as the universities have seen the possibilities of developing talent for Hong Kong.</p>
<p>A number of Hong Kong’s universities and NGOs now shape the current GE landscape. The longest running provision has been offered by the Chinese University (CUHK) with its Program for the Gifted and Talented (PGT), under the guiding hand of Professor David Chan, in which there are three main areas of work: direct services for gifted and talented students, research and resource development, and professional services and consultation for schools, teachers, and parents (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.fed.cuhk.edu.hk/pgt/index.php?id=about_pgt&amp;lang=en">http://www.fed.cuhk.edu.hk/pgt/index.php?id=about_pgt&amp;lang=en</ext-link> for more information). In addition, CUHK offers enrichment courses for young mathematical and science talent for lower secondary students under the umbrella of a Science Academy for Young Talent established in 2010. The Centre for Child Development at Hong Kong Baptist University (HKBU) runs a Creative Summer Program for senior primary (ages 9-12) students using Renzulli’s Enrichment Triad Model as its framework. The University of Hong Kong (HKU) runs workshops for secondary students in science through their Junior Science Institute (JSI); their General Education Unit started a Summer School for Effective Leadership in 2012 and the University has recently opened the HKU Academy for the Talented, which aims to provide enrichment programs on personal growth and core competencies (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.als.hku.hk/talented/index2.php?id=TXpBPQ">http://www.als.hku.hk/talented/index2.php?id=TXpBPQ</ext-link> for more information). The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) has been running enrichment-type science courses for secondary students for a number of years, but in 2011, it announced the establishment of its Centre for the Development of the Gifted and Talented (CDGT) under the concept of “Dual Programs” whereby secondary students can enroll in university-level courses while still at school. In addition, it has been hosting the Center for Talented Youth (CTY) summer program for the past 3 years. City University’s (CUHK) Faculty of Electronic Engineering offers enrichment programs on a demand-led basis, and there are further enrichment courses in mathematics. More recently, the Hong Kong Polytechnic University (HKPU) has worked with HKAGE in 2010-2011 to offer student programs in electrical and information engineering, applied social sciences, mechanical engineering, and English language. In 2011, HKPU established its PolyU High Achievers Club for primary and secondary students.</p>
<p>NGOs have also played an important part in complementing the GE landscape. The Boys and Girls Club Association (BGCA) has, for many years, offered a counseling service for parents of gifted children and a website with information (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bgcadev.smarkglobal.com/page.aspx?corpname=bgca&amp;i=444&amp;locale=en-US">http://bgcadev.smarkglobal.com/page.aspx?corpname=bgca&amp;i=444&amp;locale=en-US</ext-link>). The Hong Kong Federation of Youth Groups (HKFYG) has run courses on leadership, formerly commissioned by EDB and more recently by HKAGE, for its students. St. James’ Settlement, a social services charity, has offered a Foundation Course in Nurturing the Gifted for serving teachers in its Continued Education Centre.</p>
<p>Off-site support in Hong Kong received a major boost in 2007-2008 with the establishment of HKAGE because, arguably for the first time, GE was to have a more planned and structured approach to GE provision under the umbrella of a single organization. HKAGE first started operations in September 2008 to serve three main stakeholder groups: students, parents, and teachers. Since 2012, research has been added to its service functions. In the first full 3 years (2008-2011) of its existence, HKAGE has directly served more than 11,000 students via a variety of learning experiences (e.g., talks, workshops, courses, competitions), trained more than 7,800 teachers, and supported nearly 17,000 parents. No other service provider in GE has reached this scale of operational activity.</p>
<p>HKAGE is organized into four service divisions. The Student Programmes and Services Division (SPSD) division has the responsibility to plan, organize, and deliver the Level 3 programs for exceptionally gifted students, and the delivery model is based on outsourcing, often to the local universities, NGOs, and prominent academics. The educational integrity of student courses is underscored by a clear pedagogical need for inquiry-based and/or problem-solving-based approaches so that students are immersed in active learning for at least 2/3 of their time. The HKAGE believes that only through their active engagement in the learning process can students improve their self-regulation and take increasing control of their learning environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0162353213492701">Dweck &amp; Master, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0162353213492701">Zimmerman, 1990</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition, HKAGE is developing a website to provide online learning opportunities (a virtual learning environment) for students of ages 10 to 18. There is a learning platform with resource-rich e-modules across a wide range of subject domains that students can access individually, collaboratively, or with the teacher in school-based pull-out lessons. Some modules are curriculum based, and some introduce topics and issues not covered in schools. In all of these modules, the emphasis is on different learning pathways, understanding different learners’ needs, and active learning.</p>
<p>Student membership to HKAGE starts with schools. Each year there is a nomination process whereby schools, including school EPs and social workers, nominate a quota of their students who then undergo domain-based tests or interviews for selection to HKAGE membership and program entry. More than 2,500 students were successful in the 2011-2012 cycle and the numbers increase each year. Quality control is an integral component of the planning, monitoring, and execution of each course and evidence is collected from several sources so that triangulation of results can be made in a rigorous evaluation process.</p>

<title>Important Contributions to the Development of GE</title>
<p>Together, GES and HKAGE have devised a strategic Professional Development Framework for the in-service training of teachers in GE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0162353213492701">Tommis, 2012</xref>). Hong Kong recognizes that teachers play a central role in the delivery of GE but without training and support there can be little progress. The framework offers tiered pathways from the foundation level to the advanced level and a mixture of online and face-to-face courses. Since February 2012, every school is recommended to have two dedicated posts: a GE manager and a GE coordinator. The main role of the former is to facilitate GE development in the school; the latter is the lead practitioner in the pedagogy needed to teach gifted learners. Subject teachers also need training, and this is provided for in the enhancement courses. Training pathways have been put together to precisely meet the needs of these roles, and these are illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0162353213492701">Figure 2</xref>.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0162353213492701-fig2.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>To complement the professional development framework, HKAGE organizes thematic courses for teachers on a host of topics ranging from differentiation in the classroom and evolving concepts of giftedness to identification and twice-exceptionality. Often, eminent speakers from overseas facilitate these courses. Teacher support is also enhanced by the biennial Teacher Conference organized with EDB.</p>
<p>HKAGE also recognizes that parents play a key role in helping their gifted children cope with the challenges of being “different” and that parents also need information, advice, and support. A key feature of HKAGE support for parents is the Consultation Centre, which consists of a free hotline and the advisory services of education advisors and EPs. The hotline aims to provide information and advice for parents (as well as teachers and others involved in GE) and, for cases that are more complex, the services of a registered educational psychologist are available to steer the needs of case conferences. Complementary courses, lectures, parent seminars, and conferences are also organized throughout the year, often in collaboration with voluntary parent groups and NGOs.</p>

<title>GE Research in Hong Kong</title>
<p>With all of this activity in GE in recent years, it might be reasonably expected that a systematically organized research agenda would have increased significantly, but as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0162353213492701">Chan, Chan, and Zhao (2009)</xref> argued, this has not been the case. Nevertheless, “despite the lack of research funding and the lack of a clear agenda for GE research, there is a growing body of research studies relevant to GE over . . . the past two decades” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0162353213492701">Chan, Chan, &amp; Zhao, 2009</xref>, p. 136). The bibliography contains a chronological list of some of the more accessible research articles published over the past 5 years.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0162353213492701">Chan, Chan, and Zhao (2009)</xref> viewed most of this research to be descriptive, and it covers areas such as:</p>
<list id="list3-0162353213492701" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>conceptions of giftedness, including multiple intelligences;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>assessment of giftedness;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>teaching and programming (in the school environment);</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>evaluating gifted programs; and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>social and emotional development of gifted learners.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Their conclusions reflected their concern for research methodologies as well as research findings. They argued that the former should be more rigorous with a better balance between qualitative and quantitative approaches. However, they argued that many research findings are only tentative, and that there needs to be a replication of studies based on larger sample sizes so that we can better understand giftedness and talent development. There should also be a focus on results that yield practical outcomes to help guide and inform Hong Kong’s best practice in the future.</p>
<p>The importance of practical outcomes has also informed HKAGE’s early thoughts on setting up its own Research Division (RD) in 2012. From the start, HKAGE has stressed the need for evidence-based research to support the advice and recommendations it offers across all stakeholder groups. The research focus initially will be on further developing its evaluation framework to make it even more rigorous. The rationale is metaphor-derived and asks the questions, “Where are we going?” “How do we get there?” “Who is joining us on the journey?” and “Have we arrived?” Based on this journey idea, HKAGE has proposed the following key research issues for the next 2 years:</p>
<list id="list4-0162353213492701" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>understanding what constitutes an effective program in GE,</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>assessment of the professional development needs of teachers in GE,</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>HKAGE student tracking study, and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>assessment of student learning outcomes.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The intention is that HKAGE will be in a stronger position to validate its own and similar programs for all stakeholder groups in the future and thereby encourage its development to further its stated vision of becoming a quality educational hub in Asia.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0162353213492701">
<title>Future Directions in Research and Program Development</title>
<p>That there is a need for a clear research agenda in GE is indisputable. What makes up this agenda might, though, be more controversial. Even so, it is possible to identify a number of research strands that would add to the Asian arsenal of empirical evidence on what works in GE within this specific cultural context.</p>
<p>In an environment where Level 3 courses are growing from a diverse range of providers, it is important to know how we might identify the key factors that make for success. In other words, we need a common evaluation framework for program development. It is often assumed that because a course is run at a level in advance of the participating student years that it must be effective. But how do we know this?</p>
<p>The United States has a 20-year history of research into classroom practices in GE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0162353213492701">Archambault et al., 1993</xref>). Hong Kong has a much more limited perspective. With its policy emphasis on school-based enrichment and extension, there is a need to better understand the extent to which teachers modify the curriculum and instruction on a regular basis to suit gifted learners. We need to know how effective teachers are in continuously providing curriculum and instruction of high quality.</p>
<p>The benefits of instructional (flexible or cluster) groupings have been extolled for many years in the West but there is little in the Asian literature on this because most teaching is typically whole-class based. Moreover, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0162353213492701">Kulik (1992)</xref> found ability grouping without curricular acceleration or enrichment makes little difference to student achievement, so any research agenda has to consider grouping with and without these key components. With regard to the U.S. equivalent of Level 2 programs, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0162353213492701">Rogers (1991)</xref> found that enrichment pull-out programs produced substantial academic gains in overall achievement, critical thinking, and creativity. But, to be effective, they had to be linked to instruction that was appropriately differentiated. To date, there has been no research on Level 2 programs to test these ideas and, indeed, there is something of a conceptual gap in the nature of best provisions between Levels 1 and 3. There is no guide to schools on what might constitute an effective pull-out program. Therefore, many interpret this in the form of a competition and nothing else.</p>
<p>Twice- or multiply exceptional students have attracted little research attention in Hong Kong, although the HKAGE has brought some of the main issues to a wider (parent) audience in the past 3 years with the publication of its toolkit. However, there is no research on program outcomes for this at-risk student population, partly because of the difficulties of identification but also because few programs currently exist to cater for this group.</p>
<p>There is also a need to develop practical and adaptable GE resources at Level 1 for teachers in primary and secondary schools that embody not only subject content but also teaching methodologies for learner diversity. In many respects, these need to be linked to the research findings on differentiation and curriculum modification mentioned earlier.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0162353213492701">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Hong Kong has come a long way since the 1990s, but the road is long and the journey far from complete. In the opinion of many, the three-tier model is a useful framework for conceptualizing, implementing, and evaluating GE in the jurisdiction, but the pace of change could be quicker. In particular, there is an urgent need to strengthen practice at Levels 1 and 2 and to embed best practice in schools and regular classrooms by encouraging more schools to join us on this journey. Although the task would be made so much easier if GE were to be mandated, there is a continued need in its absence to persuade and encourage the gatekeepers—mostly school principals—that GE matters and that it should be part of every school’s annual improvement plan. In a period of wider systemic curriculum change at the secondary and tertiary levels, it has been argued that mandating GE would be counterproductive, and that schools have enough to contend with in dealing with core issues. Moreover, the general approach in Hong Kong toward GE is to give schools as much choice and freedom as possible to develop their policies and practices that most suits their resources and needs.</p>
<p>The role of EDB in recommending and promoting GE throughout the territory is crucial here. It has already provided resources in the form of free training, publications, grants, and other forms of support but the essential messages to convince schools that they need to do something have remained unarticulated. Of course, the task is not easy. At the secondary and tertiary levels, there has been a systemic change in the education system, and the process is unfinished as of 2012, so teachers have had to contend with change on a scale rarely seen before. But at the heart of the curriculum changes at secondary level are two cornerstone beliefs: learner diversity and the need for student-centered learning in all pedagogies. Schools and teachers now have the support of a well-structured and organized Professional Development Framework for training teachers in GE so the means to tackle a core competency in GE is in place. The foundations for the further development of GE in Hong Kong have never been more secure but in the absence of a territory-wide strategic plan, there is no room for complacency among policy makers and stakeholders—and those involved in GE will have to work hard to convince schools that learner diversity includes making regular provision for those who are gifted.</p>

<title>Author Biography</title>
<p><bold>Stephen Tommis</bold> is the founding executive director of the Hong Kong Academy for Gifted Education (HKAGE), a post he took up in February 2008. The HKAGE is an initiative to ensure that appropriate provision is made for teachers, parents as well as all gifted students across Hong Kong. Stephen is a graduate of the University of Dundee (MA first class honors), Jesus College, Oxford, where he was awarded the DPhil degree and the Institute of Education, London University where he took a Postgraduate Certificate in Education (PGCE). After a spell in business working as an antique map dealer, he decided that education was his true vocation and so moved to the southwest of England to be a teacher at Sherborne School, an independent secondary school. After 1 year, he was promoted to head of department and subsequently to undermaster. From there, he went to The King’s School, Gloucester, as deputy head and, after 3 years learning the job, was appointed to be headmaster of Abbotsholme School in Staffordshire, completing a 23-year stint of direct involvement with education. Between 2003 and 2008, he was the director of The National Association for Gifted Education (NAGC) in the United Kingdom where he led campaigns to get parents’ needs heard in government and schools.</p>
