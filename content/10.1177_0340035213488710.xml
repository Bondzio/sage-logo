<abstract>
<p>This article presents a comprehensive look into the evolving landscape of libraries in Singapore. Some 190 years ago, two institutions – the National Library of Singapore and the National University of Singapore Library – were instrumental in laying the foundation for libraries in this Southeast Asian island state. Since then, Singapore has seen a proliferation of libraries that include public, academic and special libraries. Supported by government policies and strategies, libraries have remained important in the lives of Singaporeans. In order to adapt to technological developments as well as changes in user demands and behaviours, the nation’s libraries have had to come up with new ways to manage their collections as well as serve the needs of their users. This paper examines the history of libraries in Singapore before throwing the spotlight on library innovations, paying particular attention to digital products and services that include library management systems, e-resources, digital devices as well as the utilization of social media to engage users.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The little red dot, Singapore, is an island city state with no natural resources. Our survival depends on our people, our only precious and critical resource. Thus, it is important for our people to stay relevant, competent and highly skilled. To minimize social disparity and to nurture a talent pool that will contribute to economic viability, our government has placed emphasis on investing in education, training and lifelong learning to create a highly skilled workforce for work in a knowledge intensive industry. In addition, the city state also places emphasis on research and development. The Singapore government announced an investment of SG$16.1 billion or 3.5 percent over the next 5 years starting from 2011<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0340035213488710">1</xref>
</sup>. The government has also invested heavily in lifelong learning and skills upgrading.</p>
<p>It is against this backdrop that the libraries in Singapore were developed to support the national goals to help our people stay abreast and attain a competitive advantage. The libraries thus provided access to reading and research materials and embarked on training each of their target communities to become information literate. Collectively, the libraries journeyed to reach users of all walks of life from cradle to grave.</p>
<p>The authors and contributors will illustrate the evolution of libraries in Singapore as they persevered through the years from providing bread and butter core services and ‘business as usual’ to leapfrogging to play a more responsive, value-added proactive role supporting the societal, academic, research and business needs of our communities in today’s digital era. The advent of technology has also given libraries the opportunity to offer a myriad of possibilities to support learning, discovery and research in this knowledge intensive society.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0340035213488710">
<title>First seeds that spurred growth</title>
<p>Sir Stamford Raffles founded Singapore in 1819. We gained independence in 1965. An analysis of the history of libraries in Singapore revealed twin pillars that sprouted from the first seeds planted more than a century ago.</p>
<p>The seed was planted in 1823 when Raffles, our founding father, mooted the idea of setting up a library to support Singapore’s first educational institution, which was named the Singapore Institution. However, in 1844, a decision was made to expand the library at the Singapore Institution and it was transformed into a subscription-based library service for members. This library evolved into the Singapore Library and its role expanded to include even that of acting as the Curator to the Museum Committee. Several changes took place and progressed into the modern National Library in 1957. It was a long and uphill journey due to priorities in nation building and limited resources.</p>
<p>The second seed was laid in 1905 when the Straits and Federated Malay States Government Medical School set up a small library. This first single library in a medical school marked the beginning of the evolution of academic libraries in Singapore. It has evolved over the years into Singapore’s largest university library system comprising seven libraries at the National University of Singapore.</p>
<p>Hence, the twin pillars: the National Library of Singapore (NLS) with a 190 year history played an important role in developing a public library system to serve the masses, while the National University of Singapore Library (NUSL) with a 108 year history strived as the main academic library for many years until new academic institutions were set up. The twin pillars played an important role in the early development of libraries and librarianship in Singapore. These two stalwarts were joined by each major academic, special and public library that sprouted throughout the years. Through their passion, perseverance and commitment, the pioneer librarians contributed to the development of our libraries, the library profession and the Library Association, and introduced change.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0340035213488710">
<title>A major turning point</title>
<p>In the early years, the public library system in Singapore was managed by the then National Library (NL). The NL would initiate setting up a public library when a constituency reached a population of 250,000. When the government establishes a new academic institution, by default an academic library will be set up to serve the institution’s needs.</p>
<p>However, in the 1990s, as we entered the Internet era, Brigadier-General George Yeo, then Minister of Information and the Arts, queried the legacy practices and guidelines for public library development. He challenged the norms and commissioned the landmark Library 2000 study to review library developments in Singapore in the light of technological developments and birth of the World Wide Web in 1992. The Library 2000 Review Committee involved top executives from the public and private sectors as well as academia, communities and librarians.</p>
<p>The 2-year study resulted in major recommendations that set the pace for library transformation in Singapore. Its report, <italic>Library 2000: Investing in a Learning Nation<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0340035213488710">2</xref>
</sup> </italic>was accepted by the government. One of the first recommendations adopted was the establishment of a new statutory board, the National Library Board (NLB), in 1995 to spearhead the transformation of libraries in Singapore and turn the Library 2000 vision to reality. This had a catalytic impact in transforming the public library landscape.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0340035213488710">
<title>A new organizational structure</title>
<p>When established in 1995, the NLB was chartered to implement the key strategies proposed by the Library 2000 committee. These included: an adaptive public library system comprising the national and public libraries working in cohort with the academic and special libraries, a national collection strategy and knowledge arbitrage. The NLB would also establish symbiotic linkages with business and community groups and offer quality services through market orientation. To bring libraries forward and to be plugged into the social and economic fabric, it was envisioned that exploiting technology and development of a pool of information professionals were critical as enablers.</p>
<p>The NLB today manages the National Library and the public libraries and also operates most of the special libraries in various government agencies. The NLB engages the communities in designing various public libraries. Instead of standalone libraries, libraries are located in shopping malls and housing estates, among others.</p>
<p>The academic libraries report to their parent institutions and come under the purview of the Ministry of Education, while the special libraries are managed by the organizations they belong to.</p>

<sec id="section5-0340035213488710">
<title>The changing landscape</title>
<p>Typically, the library’s role is to acquire, organize, preserve and provide access to information. To add value, libraries began to play the role of coach/mentor/guide/facilitator where they helped nurture reading, inculcate search skills, and assist in research and so on. These are functions that any library can perform and the scope and content varies depending on the type of library and who its stakeholders and clientele are.</p>
<p>The National Library, as the custodian of the nation’s literary heritage, has from time immemorial collected, organized and provided access to this unique and precious heritage. The National Archives of Singapore (NAS), meanwhile, is the official custodian of the corporate memory of the government – it manages public records and provides advice to government agencies on records management. In November 2012, the NLB Act was amended to facilitate the transfer of the NAS from the National Heritage Board to the NLB<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0340035213488710">3</xref>
</sup>.</p>
<p>Likewise, academic libraries have taken on the additional critical role in preserving the academic institution’s heritage and scholarly output while acquiring, organizing and making accessible a rich knowledge base.</p>
<p>The grouping of libraries by type, size and roles is no longer practical in this digital era. The greying of boundaries reinforces the need for greater collaboration amongst libraries on all fronts.</p>
<p>To a large extent, we can envision two major pillars that influence growth and change: the public library system being transformed and repositioned to serve the demands of a more affluent population, and the growth in the number of academic libraries as new institutions of education are being set up. The third pillar, comprising special libraries, is seen to be undergoing consolidation due to rising costs, the financial and economic challenges of the global economy as well as the ready access to free information. Many organizations have scaled down on corporate library services and adopted alternative approaches such as outsourcing, relying on their main office or buying services on an ondemand basis.</p>
<p>The library landscape remains vibrant as libraries are constantly adapting and innovating to cater to the needs of the Gen Y users. Emphasis is placed on redefining the roles and positioning librarians as an integral part of the organization, where many play expanded roles.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0340035213488710">
<title>Prototype Library of the Future</title>
<p>To demonstrate the infinite possibilities of the Library of the Future, the Library 2000 Review Committee sought additional resources from the government to set up a prototype library. The community played an active role in the design and development of the first regional library at Tampines, that was officially opened in 1994, even before the final recommendations of the Committee were presented to the government. Named the Tampines Regional Library (TRL)<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0340035213488710">4</xref>
</sup>, new facilities such as automated check-ins and check-out kiosks, video-on demand terminals, satellite television, access to electronic databases, and a commercially-run bookshop and an IT gallery were introduced. The community was amazed by the new look and suite of services.</p>
<p>Following the success of the TRL, the National Library at Stamford Road was given a much needed facelift<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0340035213488710">5</xref>
</sup>. The renovation transformed the almost 30 year-old library into a modern and spacious National Reference Library and a Central Community Library. New expanded services and facilities such as a Multimedia Centre and Student Reference Centre provided students with the opportunity to use computers and multimedia resources. NLB also launched Reference Point, a call service to handle public enquiries, and set up a Business Information Service. Several thematic collections in the area of Arts, Business, Singapore and Multicultural works were enhanced.</p>

<title>Post Library 2000 developments</title>
<p>Just as the retail and hospitality sector aligns to meet the changing needs and demands of its clientele and ensure it retains market share, libraries in Singapore have also undergone a facelift and adopted consumer-centric approaches in redesigning the spaces, services, and programmes.</p>
<p>Following the vision of the future library as shared through the TRL, the major academic libraries also introduced changes by refreshing their spaces and exploiting technology to offer enhanced services and access. Lifestyle spaces were being created to cater to the Gen Y users. Typically, these lifestyle spaces are designed as creative corners with games, lifestyle collections and cafes. Cafés at the library have become a norm, but it was Dr Tan Chin Nam, Chairman of the Library 2000 Review Committee and founding Chairman of NLB, who first mooted the idea in 1994 of a café at the prototype Tampines Regional Library (TRL).</p>

<title>Library 2010 Report (2005 to 2010)</title>
<p>The Library 2010 (L2010) Report mapped out NLB’s strategic framework to help Singaporeans meet new information and knowledge demands arising from an economy that was becoming more technologically and knowledge driven. In fact, during the 10-year period from 1994 to 2004, the share of professional, managerial and technical jobs created in the labour market had increased from 32 percent to 43 percent, while the share of job holders with at least a post-secondary qualification had grown from 15 percent to 31 percent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0340035213488710">National Library Board 2005b</xref>). This indicated that the Singapore workforce was not only becoming better qualified, but also employed in higher skilled jobs. To help libraries stay relevant in this changing economic landscape, L2010 was to guide NLB to build a round-the-clock library system that provided seamless access to its physical and digital content so that the knowledge embedded could be disseminated easily to library users (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0340035213488710">National Library Board 2005b</xref>). The three guiding principles of the L2010 Report were:
<list list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>Create and change existing libraries into Libraries for Life so that NLB’s network of libraries can provide Singaporeans with multiple avenues to develop their personal knowledge and learning skills.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Refine and deepen existing library services so that NLB’s network of libraries can reach out further to the whole community.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Support the growth of Singapore’s knowledge-based economy by positioning NLB as a coordinator to collect, preserve and disseminate Singapore’s knowledge asset, as well as a creator of content and services to support learning.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
</p>
<p>One of the first and most definitive initiatives launched under L2010 was NLB’s Digital Library. Set up in 2005, the digital library offered users extensive online access to information and resources, including digitized materials and subject databases, e-books and e-magazines. The content was geared towards aligning NLB to become a leading institution in information provision and knowledge development (National Library Board 2006). The digital library provided one seamless interface with access to a wide selection of library services, database services and general information on NLB. Library members could access over 100 online databases with a wide variety of subject content. In addition, they could also perform online library transactions such as applying for renewal of membership, payment of fines and fees, signing up for due date reminder service, and item renewal. All in all, the digital library was to be an encompassing effort by NLB to offer an efficient and convenient service to its users around the clock, whilst expanding its reach to new and untapped communities.</p>
<p>To broaden NLB’s digital reach and to deepen the content of the digital library, NLB created a number of information portals. These included Infopedia in 2008, NewspaperSG in 2009 and MusicSG in 2010. These portals were significant additions to NLB’s digital content. For instance, Infopedia is an online encyclopedia that allows users to search for authoritative articles on Singapore. As these articles cover a wide range of topics such as historical events, arts, culture, economy, government and key personalities, it is a useful reference portal for students and researchers. As for NewspaperSG, it is an online platform that allows users to search, browse and retrieve full text news content from digitized issues of Singapore newspapers dating from 1845 such as <italic>The Straits Times</italic> and <italic>The Singapore Free Press</italic>.</p>
<p>While implementing the digital infrastructure as envisioned by L2010, NLB continued to widen its physical reach by opening more community libraries, which by then were renamed Public Libraries. The Public Libraries continued to organize a myriad of information literacy programmes, and reading campaigns and activities to reach out to different segments of the community (National Library Board 2008). Some of the programmes included ‘READ! Singapore’ for those 15 years old and above, ‘10,000 Fathers Reading!’ for father figures and their children, the national ‘kidsREAD’ programme for children from lower-income families, ‘Read and Reap’ for primary- to college-level students, and the ‘Share-A-Story’ Storytelling Club for seniors, adults and teenagers.</p>
<p>NLB also incorporated new technology and harnessed the connectivity power of social media to enhance the services of public libraries and improve their engagement with the public. For instance, in 2009, NLB introduced the Library in Your Pocket mobile application to provide users easy and convenient access to popular library services on their mobile phones (National Library Board 2010). This was in addition to the myLibrary application on Facebook. The Facebook application enables users to access and share library services and resources through their Facebook page. Besides online initiatives, NLB also introduced a new search facility other than the existing OPAC system. Known as NLB SearchPlus, it allows users to explore both NLB’s physical and digital resources as well as to personalize and save their search results.</p>
<p>The National Library shifted from Stamford Road to a new location at Victoria Street. At the time of its opening in 2006, the new National Library had a start-up collection size of over 634,000 items across a floor area of more than 58,000 square metres, which is five times larger than its previous facility. It comprises the Lee Kong Chian Reference Library, and the Central Public Library. Taking advantage of its new central location, the National Library began holding a series of large-scale exhibitions to highlight the National Library’s collections.</p>
<p>In 2010, NLB embarked on its next phase of strategic planning for the future of its libraries. NLB’s 2020 ‘Libraries for Life’ vision is to foster ‘Readers for Life, Learning Communities, and a Knowledgeable Nation’. The new strategic plan acknowledges NLB’s enduring role of providing not only information resources but also equipping the nation’s citizens with skills to harness information, and encouraging knowledge sharing. It has four strategic objectives:
<list list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>Reading, Learning and Information Literacy: to entrench the reading habit and strengthen the information literacy skills of Singapore’s citizens.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Next-Generation Libraries: to strengthen the role of libraries as well-loved community spaces, where there is equal access to knowledge for all, knowledge sharing, and community engagement.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Excellence in Singapore and Regional Content: where the National Library will ensure an authoritative collection of Singapore content, and engage Singaporeans in discovering, using, and appreciating their Singapore published heritage.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Digital Library: to make a diverse range of digital content and services easily accessible on users’ preferred devices and spaces.</p>
</list-item>
</list>

<title>Transformation at academic libraries</title>
<p>The Lien Ying Chow Library at Ngee Ann Polytechnic (NP Library) was the first academic library to introduce a lifestyle library in 2000. The hip and cool design and décor were aimed at attracting the Gen Y users. It integrates an Internet Café with iPad Services; Interactive Cube with multitouch gaming experience; Board Games Room to develop creativity, sharpen minds and improve vocabulary skills; Music Area; Video Zone; Cablevision programmes and Smart TV and 3D TV experience. The Lifestyle Library was designed to spur and inculcate reading and to inspire students to explore, discover, read and enjoy. Other libraries followed suit.</p>
<p>Temasek Polytechnic (TP Library) had, in 2003, transformed the library’s image from an academic resource provider to an enabler of lifelong learning. One of its floors was renovated with a lifestyle concept to meet users’ expectation for a cosy, welcoming social space. A podium with raised flooring provided the ideal platform to support local arts groups such as a cappella and beat boxing.</p>
<p>The Singapore Polytechnic (SP Library) introduced a creative close-to-nature Hilltop Library with a view and a garden in the library concept. SP Library has since also renovated its spaces and adopted a zoning approach – Quiet Zones for quiet study, Project Rooms and Discussion Zones, PC Zone on an entire floor, a Media Viewing Zone and Colours Zone that introduced materials for personal development and lifestyle based education as part of the Polytechnic’s new General Elective Module (GEMs) curriculum.</p>
<fig id="fig3-0340035213488710" position="float">
<label>Figure 3, 4 and 5.</label>

<p>Singapore Polytechnic's Library designed its spaces according to different zones to suit the various needs of its users. These include zones such as the multimedia and discussion zones. Students are also able to enjoy nature in the indoor Garden in the library.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0340035213488710-fig3.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>Others such as the Nanyang Technological University (NTU Library) and Nanyang Polytechnic (NYP Library) have also introduced learning hubs where students have access to interactive whiteboards, screens and multimedia facilities to enhance discussion and learning.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0340035213488710">
<title>New libraries, new approaches</title>
<p>Whilst the established libraries had the challenge of convincing stakeholders of the need to refresh and reposition their services, the newer libraries were able to jumpstart and offer new technologically-grounded services. For instance, Singapore’s fourth University, the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD), adopted an innovative approach by involving pioneer students to create a learning and discovery space, one that is ‘designed to inspire’ and users will walk away inspired to design.</p>
<fig id="fig4-0340035213488710" position="float">
<label>Figure 6.</label>

</caption>
<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0340035213488710-fig4.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>The SUTD Library adopted new technologies such as surface computing, writable tables and interactive tools to promote collaborative research and learning where groups can share the same surface to discuss, search, save and go. It paid attention to creatively entice the users to DISCOVER, LEARN, SHARE and CONNECT in the physical and virtual space.</p>
<p>Hence, SUTD Library’s key spaces were organized as The RANGE, offering access to a wide range of resources that provides a sensory experience of reading, viewing, touch and feel. The unique touch and feel experience is made possible by a materials hub where users get to see, touch and feel what sustainable materials are instead of imagining. The CANVAS offers the opportunity for teams to scribble notes as they discuss and save the whole discussion for review and sharing. The SPARK with its surface computer technology helps ignite research and discover amongst teams and the GREEN is a cool amphitheatre with synthetic grass that allows students to relax, dabble in board games, create with Lego and other pieces as well as enjoy a talk or programme. iPads, housed in specially designed settings, replaced the traditional OPAC terminals.</p>

</fig>
<p>Likewise, SP Library has created interesting learning spaces where users are inspired to “learn, discover and co-create”. For instance at the Da Vinci Level, it has created a space for architecture and design with funky furniture, pods with projectors, writable tables and walls, Lego sets etc. and this was designed in collaboration with the School of Architecture and the Built Environment. A pilot space, RoBoPod, has been created to inspire engineering students in robotics. It includes Lego Minstorms NXT sets for a hands-on experience. E-I Pod is the space for biomedical research and students are taught research using case-based learning.</p>

</fig>
<p>Libraries such as the NUS and NYP Libraries have created digital 3D library maps using visualization and interactive tools with built-in intelligent path guidance’ features to help users locate spaces and resources at the library.</p>
<p>TP Library has an Interactive Corner which houses a digital panel that features rich media applications developed in collaboration with TP staff and students. One of its most popular applications is the Photo Booth, commonly known as ‘newprint booth’. A photo contest to garner the most ‘likes’ on the library’s Facebook page was a big hit with students. Also in the Interactive Corner, are an iPad and an Android tablet, installed to showcase the iOS and Android library mobile apps developed by TP students.</p>

<p>NTU Library’s facilities include learning pods with smart boards, multiscreen work desks, a recording room, digital newspaper stands and open viewing area. The success led to the development of the second learning commons at the Business Library, which has additional facilities including a mini-cinema, language learning rooms and a career resource corner. One of the key ideas is to provide useful equipment and facilities that students do not normally have at home or elsewhere.</p>

<title>The new National Library</title>
<p>The much awaited National Library of Singapore opened its doors in 2006 at a new location, Victoria Street. The library’s startup collection of 635,000 items was spread over a floor area of 58,000 square meters. It was five times larger than the grand old lady, the National Library at Stamford Road, which had to give way to urban redevelopment despite an outcry to preserve the building.</p>

</fig>
<p>The new National Library building was designed as a haven for Knowledge, Imagination and Possibility and houses the Lee Kong Chian Reference Library and the Central Public Library under one roof. Due to its central location, it has attracted many community groups and organizations to work with the NLB to host thematic exhibitions, talks and public events.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0340035213488710">
<title>Exploiting technology</title>
<p>Singapore libraries have been fortunate to be in the forefront of prototyping new library-based technology applications with industry partners and academia. The libraries served as test beds for innovative library applications.</p>
<p>In the 1980s, when Singapore embarked on a government-wide computerization programme, libraries, too, started to introduce library management systems, access to online catalogues and content from automated microfiche readers to standalone computer terminals to networked systems. We also evolved from access at libraries and local area networks to seamless anywhere-anytime access. NP and SP Libraries were amongst the first to introduce a computerized library system in the early 1980s. By 1999, TP Library had implemented Insphere, a seamless, one-stop gateway to electronic information sources such as networked, multimedia CD-ROMs, Internet, and online research databases as well as digitized past examination papers. Students can also ask for online technical assistance, send a reference enquiry and book a personal computer through the system.</p>
<p>Users are spoiled for choice and have at their hands a plethora of technologies to experience and learn – be it touch screens, multiple screens, tablets, eReaders or mobile devices. Amongst the libraries that have introduced these technologies are: the NTU Business Library’s use of double and triple screens to allow users to search, view and manipulate data, NIE Library’s touch screen OPAC terminals and SUTD Library’s iPads as OPAC and onsite computer. It was also in the 1980s that the government worked with the then National Library to establish the Singapore Integrated Library Automation Service (SILAS) which hosts the national union catalogue. SILAS today conducts training on cataloguing, metadata, RDA and has sharing sessions. It also acts as a gateway to OCLC.</p>
<p>In 2005, NLB relaunched its digital library services which provided the public with access to a wide range of digital information at their fingertips. As Steve Jobs once said, “Stay Hungry, Stay Foolish”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0340035213488710">6</xref>
</sup>, so have our libraries. The librarians have stayed abreast of developments, identified and adapted new and emerging technologies to enhance service delivery and improve on business operations. From tagging books to barcodes and security tags, libraries now exploit RFID technology with enhanced features and use QR codes to facilitate access, promote and track use. Loan systems have evolved to RFID enable self-check machines and automated book drops and sorting systems.</p>
<p>The NUS Library won a patent in 2010 for designing a bookdrop that had two new features: it sends an SMS to the staff member of Loans and Membership and locks the system when the bin is full. Recently, to ease the load of transporting books from the Closed Stacks to the Loans Desk and vice versa, the library fabricated a motorized transporter. It greatly helped our aging workers and resulted in releasing librarians to focus on library users in a value-added and timely manner.</p>

<title>Reaching out: from mobile libraries on wheels to virtual space</title>
<p>On 6 September 1960, a cream coloured army bus chugged its way to Nee Soon Naval Base School and surprised students with its busload of reading materials. At the end of that one short visit, 300 loans were recorded. By end September 1960, the bus had visited 37 schools with 2,000 loans. The success spurred the National Library to set up 12 mobile library service points at various parts of tiny Singapore. The services were phased out in the 1980s as permanent physical library buildings were set up to reach out to residents in various housing estates. However, in 2009, Molly, a cosy wireless mobile service on wheels, was introduced to reach out to the physically challenged, elderly and very young who could not visit libraries. Molly’s visitors enjoyed the activities such as storytelling, puppetry shows, and surfed on iPads or borrowed books using RFID enabled self-check machines.</p>
<p>Fast forwarding to the 21st century, we now see a different kind of mobile media (i.e. social media) that has taken the world by storm. Libraries in Singapore have also jumped on to the bandwagon and began to exploit Facebook, Twitter, Blogs, and mobile applications to reach out to their users and to stay plugged in. Hence, instead of updates through newsletters, bulletins, accessions lists and bibliographies, which may still exist, a myriad of technological options are exploited to provide information to on-the-go users in bite sizes.</p>
<p>TP Library is tapping on the visual appeal of Pinterest to promote its print collections and to foster the reading habit among its young readers. Its Pinterest board introduces books from various genres so that staff and students can visit the site regularly for recommended good reads.</p>
<p>The NUS Libraries, for instance, is extensively exploiting the social media to offer an array of services and more effectively connect with users. Twitter is used to broadcast news of interests with 1000+ followers and this is complemented via Memes that announce news.</p>
<p>In April 2012, the NUS Libraries launched a meme contest that encouraged users to send in library-related news. It was a huge success, drawing over 100 entries and thousands of likes. At its peak, there was a 30,000 weekly reach during the period. As noted by some students, the meme contest became a feedback channel for users to express.</p>
<fig id="fig11-0340035213488710" position="float">

</fig>
<p>It has introduced an online chat service to work in tandem with the FAQs system. Questions received during the chat sessions helped enhance the FAQs. The new FAQ system also has the ability to track what users are searching for and what they are clicking on or not. This allows the library to calculate the hit ratio (success rate) of students searching the FAQ.</p>
<p>The NUS Library had also embraced instant messaging systems and evolved to web-based live chats with librarians assisting users on research queries. It will become the first library to add chat points into the university’s learning portal, Integrated Virtual Learning Environment (IVLE) and expects this mode of communication to rival, if not exceed, email transactions.</p>
<p>Most libraries have, like the NUS Library, experimented with the latest technologies like QR (Quick Response) Codes to bridge real world marketing to virtual content and Foursquare, a location-based service that allows users to check-in and share their location and tips with friends.</p>
<fig id="fig12-0340035213488710" position="float">

</fig>
<p>At the NTU Business Library, we also witness an immersive library experience. The idea was to create a hybrid of physical-cum-virtual environment by exposing users to a range of new media access points to facilitate learning and discovery of library resources while they are in the physical library environment. For example, QR codes were placed in a variety of information posters on book shelves and walls to entice users to use their mobile devices to discover the rich variety of online resources and information on a particular topic.</p>

</fig>
<p>One example was when, in 2012, the hot topic was on business management gurus, 30 large sized panels with QR codes and caricatures featuring contemporary business management thinkers were erected throughout the library and users could scan the QR codes using their smart phones or tablets which provide streamed audio biographies and bibliographies of resources available in the library.</p>

<sec id="section14-0340035213488710">
<title>Anytime anywhere access</title>
<p>Mobile devices have become the main way in which users connect, communicate and discover. Hence our libraries have capitalized on this technology to connect with users.</p>
<p>TP Library’s mobile application includes a timesaving feature such as ISBN barcode scanner to check for item availability and a fun game called ‘Spin Me’, which recommends good reads when a user shakes his/her mobile device.</p>
<p>NYP’s Library On-the-Go is a ‘one portal that runs everywhere’ and NIE’s Lib<italic>GO!</italic> mobile services allow users to check out resources, manage their loans, renewals and e-resources or stay updated on new arrivals or updates while on the move. It’s timely, it’s bite sized, and helps user stay afloat rather than drown in a deluge of information. The NIE Library has launched an online streaming video service.</p>

<title>The right information at the right time</title>
<p>In accordance with Ranganathan’s age old tenet of ensuring “the right information at the right time in the right form”, libraries are venturing into offering a suite of tools and services that will empower the user to extract the relevant information on a timely basis and in a form they prefer. For example, many have introduced powerful search and discovery tools to facilitate one single federated search across a plethora of sources and have these delivered to the user in device-agnostic formats. Power search tools have become the norm and each institute has coined interesting names … LibSearch, PowerSearch, Lib<italic>Discover, Pyxis, </italic>and so forth.</p>
<p>In 2002, TP Library launched its Digital Library Portal, <italic>Spark</italic> which aimed to transform the library into a borderless, state-of-the-art digital library with the implementation of a federated search across a range of diverse resources, link resolver, and a digital media repository for local digitized content. In April 2013, it was replaced with LIBsearch, a search and discovery system. Through a single search box, users can search across the full breadth of content from the library catalogue, local repository, subscribed and open access databases.</p>

<title>Raising Info fluency</title>
<p>Keeping up with the times, most libraries have adopted a multipronged approach to inculcating information literacy and skills in users. Innovative and creative active learning approaches are adopted to engage the public, students, professionals and management to master the effective research techniques and knowledge of resources or learn to use new tools and devices to stay informed. The training programmes often cover four main areas – awareness of resources, research skills, subject information resources and tools for learning and research.</p>
<p>NLB’s READ programme goes back in time and has taken a multitude of approaches to inculcate good reading habits. Reading campaigns and activities including storytelling, ASEAN Children’s Festival and a variety of promotional materials were released to educate the masses on the importance of reading. Popular READ initiatives include ‘10,000 Fathers Reading!’, for father figures and their children, ‘READ! Singapore’ for those above 15 years, national ‘KidsREAD’ for children from lower income families, ‘READ and Reap’ for students and ‘Mobile READ’ which allows readers to read on mobile devices like the iPhone. ‘Share-A-Story Club’ for seniors, adults and teenagers was launched and many readers found the ‘Share-A-Story’ interesting and enlightening as it was akin to discovering part of our history from each other. The Bookcross programme, which encouraged readers to pick a book and share a book was placed at libraries, cafés, and public spaces.</p>
<p>NLB has also started a National Information Literacy Programme, which aims to raise awareness and public recognition of the importance of information literacy skills, and to provide the resources necessary for Singaporeans to become discerning consumers of information. In 2012, NLB started generating publicity about info-literacy: over 6,000 parents, children and teachers were trained at 29 workshops and eight outreach drives across schools and shopping malls.</p>
<p>Most of the academic libraries conduct training during the new cohort orientation period and/or structure more serious classroom training to promote the value of the content and how to exploit the best resources.</p>
<p>The librarians also work in partnership with faculty to offer customized training to support specific research and teaching needs. One such example is the ‘Academic Writing: Imparting Critical Thinking Skills’ that SMU Library conducts with faculty involvement.</p>
<p>Innovative instructional approaches include e-learning tools, quizzes, learning through games and discovery. For instance, SMU Library has introduced a scavenger hunt, while the Singapore Institute of Management (SIM Library) had an amazing race, to entice students to discover nuggets of information and through that understand the importance of finding and using information in a fun way. In addition, a novel approach that SMU Library has taken is to offer a Legal Internship Prep Course (LIPC), which is customized with emphasis on real queries and research methodology. LIPC is conducted at the Supreme Court as part of a compulsory 10-week internship that law students are required to complete. It is designed with the intention of exposing law students to real work situations where one may be faced with limited resources and services compared to an academic research library setting with a dearth of resources and on-demand services.</p>
<p>NP Library has a Wealth Creation InfoCentre to develop students’ financial literacy and investment skills. It houses a wide range of titles on topics related to wealth creation such as personal finance, portfolio management, and guides to investing Students can also practice on Bloomberg Financial Services and simulated investment programs. Its information skills training course is available via an ePlatform and provides scenario-based learning to stimulate students’ higher thinking skills, online games to engage students’ interests, integration of video on-demand to meet the students’ just-in-time learning and an online assessment to test learning outcomes.</p>
<p>Academic libraries also place emphasis on educating the users on the importance of the copyright laws and limitations, anti-plagiarism and citations. They are also involved in campus-wide initiatives on academic integrity education. For example, NTU Library held an anti-plagiarism exhibition comprising student videos, guidelines and tips last year and received positive feedback.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-0340035213488710">
<title>Outreach programmes</title>
<p>Most libraries in Singapore have an aggressive outreach programme. Each organizes various activities, promotions, book launches, and road shows to share with users and other libraries. NTU Library, for instance, held more than 40 exhibitions in the last academic year and its events such as eFest, Academic Publishing Week and other talks are organized annually.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-0340035213488710">
<title>Collection strategy</title>
<p>Each library’s collection development policy is geared towards developing a rich knowledge base to support the needs of their user communities, but collectively they serve the needs of the nation. The more established academic libraries have built up a large base of core print resources that are representative of the best titles in each field. The current emphasis is on a ‘go-digital’ strategy and hence, each is placing emphasis on acquiring e-resources to augment and/or substitute the print collections, thereby promoting anytime anywhere access and freeing up space to create more areas for discussion and interactive learning. Purchase models range from annual licences to perpetual access and/or demand/patron driven models. When TP Library introduced its patron-driven acquisitions model, the instantaneous and ease of access 24/7 via mobile devices proved a hit with both students and staff.</p>
<p>Hence, Singaporeans should not have the need to thirst for information. The three largest libraries account for the wealth of information resources – the National and Public Library system itself has a reservoir of 9 million books, journals and other materials, and the Singapore public will have access to over 3 million e-books by the end of 2013. The NUS boasts of 1.3 million unique titles of print materials and 400,000 e-resources including e-books as of June 2012, while NTU has 820,000 print titles and almost 500,000 e-resources. These rich reservoirs of information resources at our libraries can be tapped directly or via interlibrary arrangements.</p>
<p>Given Singapore’s strategic position and role as a hub for value-added services, libraries have also built up the collection related to its regional ASEAN hinterland extensively. The National Library, National University of Singapore and Institute of Southeast Asian Studies Library (ISEAS Library) can take pride in showcasing their rich Singapore and Southeast Asian Collections as their crown jewels. These are useful to researchers in Singapore and the region. The ISEAS Library’s Private Papers collections include those that belonged to our past leaders such as David Marshall, Lim Kim San and S. Rajaratnam, among others. These libraries have plans to enhance the regional collection in specific thematic areas and exploring possibilities of creating a shared digital repository to promote access.</p>
<p>The academic libraries through the years have built up specialized collections to support the teaching and learning needs and are beginning to serve as de facto ‘national collections’. Examples of specialized collections include:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>the Medical and Law Libraries at the National University of Singapore</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>the Engineering collection and Business Libraries at Nanyang Technological University</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>the Arts/Design and Hospitality/Tourism collections at Temasek Polytechnic</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>the educational resources that support teachers and educators at the National Institute of Education. These materials span the history, systems and policies of the Singapore education system as well as the region and emphasis is placed on the genre covering teaching methods, pedagogy, and curriculum development.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>the rich 600,000 Southeast Asian collection with private collections of prominent persons at the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies Library serve as a research hub supporting researchers from the region and globally.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>In addition, others are developing specializations in other fields such as the law and business/management collections at the Singapore Management University Library. The Singapore University of Technology and Design Library, which is only 2 years old is developing an interesting touch and feel experience with its materials collection and will provide open access to its design and technology collection.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-0340035213488710">
<title>Library portal, window to the world</title>
<p>The new façade that attracts the user is not the physical library but the library web page that becomes the window to the wealth of information and portfolio of services. Singapore Polytechnic’s ELISER is an instance of a portal that has been constantly refreshed and maintained to ensure user friendliness with features to attract users. The key features include personalization and participation, an electronic bookshelf displaying new releases and popular titles, electronic forms to request for services, email and SMS alerts. It is also integrated to the learning management system where library titles are displayed against subjects taught and users can seamlessly access the library catalogue.</p>
<p>To broaden its reach, NLB has created a number of information portals such as Infopedia, NewsPapersSG and MusicSG. As part of the Singapore Memory project, a whole national movement has been orchestrated to capture memories of Singapore. A large scale digitization of Singapore’s history is under way. This includes collecting and digitizing postcards, pictures and other artworks that are contributed by members of the public. PictureSG provides access to photographs and artworks and BookSG provides e-access to rare books and historical materials about Singapore.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-0340035213488710">
<title>Emerging roles</title>
<p>With the proliferation of open access resources and peer-to-peer sharing of information, libraries are constantly faced with the challenge of ensuring stakeholders appreciate and realize the value libraries offer in the accumulation, organization and dissemination of information in cost-effective ways. Most libraries are engaging users and repositioning libraries to raise the visibility and proactively contributing in various initiatives.</p>
<p>Examples include participation in work improvement teams, as resource persons in committees, observing classes and providing reading lists and/or training in class on sourcing for research materials, organizing book launches for faculty, etc. The SMU librarians have taken on the role of supporting the faculty with their research performance assessment and prepare citation analysis reports which help the university’s Office of Research Administration produce research publications report to the stakeholders. The librarians also prepare citation reports for faculty applying for tenure and promotions.</p>
<p>As the National Library of Singapore begins to play the dual role of preserving the literary heritage and oral history of the nation, academic libraries are playing a lead role in preserving the academic and scholarly output of the academic institution. These take the form of institutional repositories that capture, index and archive theses, various academic papers and the history of the institution. NUS Libraries have launched ScholarBank@NUSL. NTU launched DR-NTU and successfully obtained approval from the university in 2011 for an Open Access Mandate requiring faculty to submit their publications and students, their research theses for open access. For SMU, INK has been set up.</p>
<p>The SMU Library also initiated an oral history project ‘Conceptualising SMU: The People and Ideas behind the SMU Story’ to gather records that encapsulate the thinking behind the establishment of SMU, Singapore’s third university.</p>
<p>NP Library has created a gallery which showcases the rags to riches story of its donor, Dr Lien Ying Chow, his legendary business acumen, services to the country, commitment to education and passion for the country. It also includes a rich array of resources on Asian entrepreneurs, pioneers of Singapore, philanthropy and Chinese diaspora.</p>
<p>A Digital Media Repository system was developed by the TP Library in 2004 to collect all things TP such as images, audiovisual, and digitized publications. This was subsequently replaced with ADAM, a digital asset management system, in 2010. To underline the role of the library as the institutional repository for the institution, TP Library will be looking into an integrated archival management solution, which will promote access and presentation of its archive collection.</p>
<p>SP Library has also created the Singapore Polytechnic Memory Project that is aimed at capturing the school’s history and linking the present community to the past. Similarly, NIE has started to create an image bank to capture its 60-year history and other libraries are also embarking on preserving the history, literary heritage and intellectual capital of their institutions.</p>
<p>Knowledge management and collaboration are probably the next big areas that Singapore libraries need to address. Going beyond interlibrary loans coupled with resource constraints and rising costs, it is timely for the libraries to look into perhaps working on a national collection strategy with consortia rates for digital licences, open access to libraries and shared training, knowledge, experience, systems and applications rather than each reinventing the wheel. The libraries under the Council of Chief Librarians have started discussions and hopefully this will come to fruition.</p>

<sec id="section20-0340035213488710">
<title>Manpower development</title>
<p>In line with the proliferation of technology-based services at the libraries and new expanded roles, librarians are renewing and upgrading themselves to be information-savvy professionals. This is important as we are serving a more demanding and affluent user base. Subject specialization becomes important so that librarians understand the domain knowledge and can effectively connect with the users.</p>
<p>In Singapore, librarians have several avenues to upgrade, stay relevant and be equipped with the new skills needed. In addition to the Masters in Information Studies and short courses offered at the Nanyang Technological University, the Library Association of Singapore also organizes continuing education programmes. The Association has set in place a Professional Development Scheme to accredit librarians who participate in various training programmes and demonstrate mastery.</p>
<p>Libraries invest in staff training and development. They organize training with vendors, send staff to conferences and study trips. Some have arranged exchange programmes by twinning with other organizations and partners. E-learning and webinars are becoming a norm as well as peer-to-peer learning through sharing knowledge and interacting via forums and blogs.</p>
<p>Library conferences help librarians keep abreast of changes and trends in the industry. Libraries in Singapore are connected to the wider global library community by participating, organizing and hosting various international and local conferences. For instance, the NLB is organizing the second International Summit of the Book in 2013, while the Library Association of Singapore has its annual conferences. NTU Library organized the 2012 Annual International Association of Scientific and Technological University Libraries (IATUL), which attracted 180 participants from 25 countries. This is the first time IATUL has held its conference in Asia. Singapore will be hosting this year’s IFLA in August 2013.</p>
<p>Our librarians are also plugged into the local and international professional library community. They attend various regional and international meetings and conferences. Libraries have joined as institutional members of various organizations. Examples include membership with the Library Association of Singapore (LAS), Congress of Southeast Asian Libraries, ASEAN University Network Information and Libraries Online (AUNILO), American Library Association (ALA), International Association of Scientific and Technological University Libraries (IATUL), International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions (IFLA), Pacific Rim Digital Library Alliance (PRDLA), Special Libraries Association (SLA), Libraries of the Australian Technology Network (LATN), and OCLC, among others.</p>
<p>These memberships vary from library to library. The NTU Library, for instance, belongs to the Outstanding Academic Papers by Students (OAPS) group of libraries from China, Taiwan, Hong Kong and USA, which aim to promote good scholarly writing by students. NTU has close ties with Wuhan University Library in China, which involves two staff members from each institution spending between 2 weeks to 2 months attachments in the respective libraries annually for the past 4 years. It also provides regular professional staff attachments for regional librarians under their Professional Internship Programme for International Librarians (PIPIL). More than 40 regional librarians have been through the NTU Library since 2006.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Painting the century-old history on a canvas will highlight the meandering paths, the peaks and downs that the libraries had to take in the light of socio-economic development and priorities as the nation progressed. Singapore libraries, we believe, have been fortunate. Despite various challenges, the libraries in Singapore have weathered hard times and good times to rise and meet the information needs of the populace and target communities through a plethora of information resources supporting leisure, education and research.</p>
<p>Looking back, we can proudly say that each librarian has in some small way contributed to the library renaissance in Singapore. This article, we believe, will serve as a window to the world of libraries and librarianship in Singapore.</p>
