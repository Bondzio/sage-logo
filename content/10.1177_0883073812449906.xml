<abstract>
<p>Slit ventricle syndrome is a rare condition whereby brain compliance is reduced and can be associated with intermittent intracranial hypertension. A 19-year-old male with a ventriculoperitoneal shunt for congenital hydrocephalus presented with a 1-day history of headache and drowsiness-symptoms from which he suffered in many recurrent episodes over the past 5 years. The improvement of headaches without surgical intervention led to the diagnosis of migraine. During this hospitalization, episodes of intermittent intracranial hypertension were documented along with the remission and relapse of the symptoms. While the patient’s intracranial pressure was within normal range in over 90% of his monitoring period, which postponed shunting, replacement of his ventriculoperitoneal shut eventually resolved his symptoms. Slit ventricle syndrome with reduced ventricular compliances should be considered in patients with clinical evidence of intermittent intracranial hypertension and small ventricular size. The authors advocate shunt replacement as an appropriate treatment for this condition.</p>

<p>Slit ventricle syndrome is a rare condition in which brain compliance is unusually low. This phenomenon typically occurs during a period of simultaneous brain growth and excessive drainage. The patient may develop high pressures without ventricular dilatation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0883073812449906">1</xref></sup> Furthermore, the symptoms are often cyclical with periods of exacerbation and remission.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0883073812449906">2</xref></sup> Recognition of this syndrome is critical for favorable patient outcomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0883073812449906">3</xref></sup> because the consequences of intermittent hypertension could be progressive.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0883073812449906">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0883073812449906">5</xref></sup> The overall incidence of slit ventricle syndrome ranges from 5% to 34% of all shunted children studied.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0883073812449906">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0883073812449906">7</xref></sup> Though intracranial hypotension or hypertension because of ventricular catheter obstruction has been cited,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0883073812449906">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0883073812449906">8</xref></sup> the pathophysiological mechanisms of slit ventricle syndrome remain to be elucidated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0883073812449906">9</xref></sup> We present one such case of slit ventricle syndrome whereby the patient had a history of intermittent intracranial hypertension and the diagnosis of which was delayed because of a preconception that intermittent increase of intracranial pressure in the setting of “normal range” with small ventricles on imaging studies ruled out intracranial hypertension and shunt malfunction.</p>

<title>Case Report</title>
<p>A 19-year-old male with a right ventriculoperitoneal shunt for congenital hydrocephalus presented to our emergency department with a 1-day history of frontal headaches and drowsiness. He was also noted to have an altered level of consciousness and episodes of emesis. Over the past 5 years, he had been experiencing headaches in an episodic and recurrent fashion at a frequency of approximately once every 3 months and was diagnosed with a migraine.</p>
<p>The patient was admitted to the pediatric ward with the diagnosis of altered mental status and intractable headaches. His mental status deteriorated, which warranted intensive care. A cranial computerized tomography scan showed a slit-like right ventricle and a normal sized left ventricle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0883073812449906">Figure 1</xref>). Lumbar puncture demonstrated opening pressures greater than 55 cm of water and closing pressures at approximately 44 cm of water. Given the elevated opening pressure, an intracranial pressure monitor was placed. Intracranial pressure remained low throughout the 3-day monitoring period. Following the lumbar puncture, the patient’s mental status returned to normal baseline, and his headaches improved. As his intracranial pressure was normal in over 90% of his monitoring period, Neurological Surgery service advised against surgical intervention. Cerebrospinal fluid studies and electroencephalography monitoring eliminated infection or subclinical seizures as causes of his symptoms. Given a past medical history of recurrent headaches and associated altered mental status, as well as the documented association of increased intracranial pressure with clinical symptoms and the improvement of the symptoms with lowered intracranial pressure, a second opinion on the treatment of intermittent intracranial hypertension was sought, and the patient was transferred to a neighboring pediatric neurosurgical specialty service.</p>

</fig>
<p>While at the collaborating medical center, the patient’s headaches recurred. Neurological examination revealed fluctuating mental status characterized by intermittent somnolence. There was persistent emesis and photophobia. A repeat cranial computed tomography scan demonstrated no significant interval changes. Subsequently, an external ventricular drain on the left side was placed to monitor intracranial pressure and to correlate his symptomatology. After draining off approximately 20 mL of cerebrospinal fluid, intracranial pressure remained at 17 cm water or below, and the patient had no clinical symptoms. Approximately 12 hours after removal of the external ventricular drain, the patient had recurrence of severe frontal headaches, multiple emesis, 2 partial seizures, periods of apnea, and bradycardia. A third cranial computed tomography scan showed a slight enlargement of the left frontal ventricle while the right ventricle system remained slit-like (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0883073812449906">Figure 2</xref>). A left ventriculoperitoneal shunt was placed. Postoperatively, the patient’s symptoms resolved, and he was discharged 4 days later on valproic acid for migraine prophylaxis. The patient self-discontinued valproic acid 6 months later. Nine months after the placement of second shunt, the patient had recurrences of headache without change of mental status or emesis. Lumbar puncture documented intracranial pressure of 2 cm of water.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Headaches are some of the most common presenting symptoms in medicine and studies showed that about 4% of the adults suffer from daily headaches worldwide.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0883073812449906">10</xref></sup> In patients with shunted hydrocephalus, the complaint of headache takes on a more critical diagnostic urgency as the outcome of missing a shunt malfunction as the etiology of the headache can have fatal implications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0883073812449906">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0883073812449906">12</xref></sup> The correlation of headache and altered mental status with an increased intracranial pressure in shunted patients with small ventricles could be challenging, especially in subjects with intermittent intracranial hypertension. Comorbic epilepsy and migraine can further complicate precise diagnosis. Severe headache disorder in patients with shunts and small ventricles have been reported in slit ventricle syndrome.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0883073812449906">13</xref></sup> Previously, slit ventricle syndrome has been defined as a triad of symptoms consisting of intermittent headaches lasting 10 to 90 minutes, small ventricles on imaging studies, and slow refilling of the pumping mechanism of the shunt’s valve.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0883073812449906">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>In this report, the patient demonstrated intermittent headaches, some of which may have been because of intermittent intracranial hypertension. As observed in this case, these symptoms, prototypical of slit ventricle syndrome, may continue for many years in cyclical pattern.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0883073812449906">2</xref></sup> This cyclical nature may impede the clinical diagnosis and management of the intracranial hypertension in slit ventricle syndrome. External ventricular drain is a preferred method of monitoring intracranial pressure as cerebrospinal fluid can be removed as well as the intracranial pressure recorded. Since our patient’s intracranial pressure was normal in over 90% of the monitoring period and imaging studies showed small ventricles, the diagnosis of shunt malfunction was not made initially and appropriate treatment was delayed. The concurrent migraine headaches further complicated timely recognition of intracranial hypertension.</p>
<p>In conclusion, “slit ventricle syndrome” with reduced brain compliance should be considered in patients with clinical evidence of intracranial hypertension and small ventricular size. The optimal therapeutic strategy for slit ventricle syndrome remains controversial. Conservative management of slit ventricle syndrome symptoms via an excessive intravenous hydration and a reclined head position was demonstrated to be successful in half of the cases cited by Major et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0883073812449906">9</xref></sup> Furosemide, mannitol, and dexamethasone have also been recommended.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0883073812449906">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0883073812449906">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0883073812449906">14</xref></sup> However, Major et al cautioned that dehydration therapy still remains controversial.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0883073812449906">9</xref></sup> The outcome of this single case supports shunt replacement as an appropriate therapeutic strategy to alleviate symptoms of intermittent, intracranial hypertension in slit ventricle syndrome. Further systemic study on the management of slit ventricle syndrome will shed light on the outcomes of different treatment modalities.</p>
