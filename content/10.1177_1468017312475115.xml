<p>As the number of individuals and families who relocate from their country of origin to seek safety, livelihood and new opportunities for themselves and their children is constantly increasing, there is also a growing need for knowledge about trends, policies and practices related to immigrants, refugees and asylum seekers. The co-editors of this book took it on themselves to provide readers with information about the immigration process and immigration policies and practices as they relate to diverse individual receiving countries in North America (the US and Canada), Asia (Israel, India, Pakistan, Thailand), Europe (e.g. France, Germany, Ireland, Poland, Spain, Russia, UK), Africa (e.g. Egypt, Ghana, South Africa), South America (Brazil) and the South Pacific (Australia, New Zealand).</p>
<p>The book begins with two chapters written by the editors. First, they review the immigration process, its main phases, related factors that affect these phases such as determinants of the decision to relocate, immigrants’ reactions to the process and the view of immigrants in general and of particular groups of migrants by the receiving country as well as the implication of all those factors for policy and services. In the second chapter, the editors focus on analyzing trends in global migration from historical and conceptual perspectives.</p>
<p>The next 27 chapters are organized around the location of countries on the receiving sequence in three parts: nations with large immigration population, nations with increasing immigrant populations and nations with decreasing immigrant populations. Contributors come from various countries and disciplines such as social work, geography, sociology, political science, minority studies, as well as diverse scholarly and professional backgrounds including educators, administrators, researchers and doctorate candidates. Chapters present case studies that address various aspects of the immigration process and its impact on both the migrants and the receiving societies. Authors discuss a diverse plethora of issues such as historical and current trends, the composition, socio-demographic characteristics and motivation of the migrants, pulling and pushing factors, dynamics of the immigration and adaptation processes, legislation, economic impact of immigrants on the workforce. The authors also consider immigration (i.e. who can come in) and immigrants (i.e. how they treated once they are in) policies, services to immigrants by social, health care and educational systems, the challenges to the receiving societies and strategies used to address these challenges, as well as diverse mode of immigrants’ adjusting to life in the new country. Finally, the editors present a summary, which is based on the previous chapters, outlining common themes and issues in today’s migration and draw out economic and social implications.</p>
<p>Reviewing and comparing the content of the various chapters offers readers an opportunity to educate themselves about the various approaches to, and therefore potentially different experiences of immigrants in the countries discussed by authors. While the book offers readers a picture of the social and economic nature of the world of today’s migrants, including the voices of some prominent in the field (e.g. Portes, Rumbaut, Foner), it could have further enhanced its usefulness for those who teach and those who wish to gain comprehensive understanding of the state of the art knowledge in the field of immigration. In addition, addressing some current topics such as the posttraumatic growth in immigration (extensively addressed by Berger &amp; Weiss), nuanced knowledge of the effects of immigration on diverse groups such as adolescents, women and older adults, as well as practice guidelines for addressing immigration-related challenges could also add to the helpfulness of the book for those who study and serve them.</p>
<p>In conclusion, this book can offer knowledge for contextualizing the immigration experience and provide additional reading in teaching about issues, policies and practices relative to immigration as well as principles for offering services to help them address immigration-related challenges.</p>
