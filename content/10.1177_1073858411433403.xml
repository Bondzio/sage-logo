<p>Patients with diabetes can display a broad range of autonomic deficits, including cardiac arrhythmias, orthostatic hypotension, gastrointestinal dysfunction, and circulatory abnormalities, and these can contribute substantially to the course of disease. Neurologists have tended to think that this dysautonomia is the result of an autonomic neuropathy, that is, degeneration of asympathetic or parasympathetic axons or their endings. However, Campanucci and others (2010) present results suggesting that an abnormality of synaptic transmission may contribute. They present data on cultured sympathetic neurons suggesting that nicotinic acetylcholine receptors are inactivated by hyperglycemia via a mechanism that involves reactive oxygen species that attack cysteine residues within the M1–M2 linker, located closer to the intracellular mouth of the channel. The authors demonstrate that consistent with this, ganglionic transmission and sympathetic reflexes are attenuated in diabetic mice but are normal in diabetic mice expressing mutant postsynaptic nicotinic acetylcholine receptors lacking the conserved cysteine residues. These novel results suggest that autonomic dysfunction in diabetes may result from a disruption of ganglionic transmission.</p>

<p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common neurological crippler of young adults in industrialized societies. Its pathogenesis remains unclear. It has been hypothesized that viral infection occurring in genetically susceptible individuals may increase their risk of developing MS, but this hypothesis remains unproven. Now Axthelm and others (2011) describe Japanese macaque encephalomyelitis (JME), a spontaneous inflammatory demyelinating disease characterized clinically by paresis of one or more limbs, ataxia, or ocular motor paresis, often with a relapsing–remitting course. Magnetic resonance imaging of 8 cases of JME demonstrated multiple gadolinium-enhancing T<sub>1</sub> weighted hyperintensities similar to those seen in MS, within white matter of the cerebral hemispheres, brainstem, cerebellum, and spinal cord. Pathological examination revealed multifocal plaque-like demyelinated lesions, including acute and chronic, active demyelinating lesions containing macrophages and periventricular infiltrates of lymphocytes, and chronic–inactive demyelinated lesions. Japanese macaque encephalomyelitis affected a small percentage (1%−3% each year) of animals in the authors’ colony, suggesting the possibility of a genetic susceptibility to the disease. A previously undescribed γ-herpes virus was cultured from white matter of animals with acute JME. Noting that JME occurs spontaneously in only a small percentage of animals suggesting genetic susceptibility, and is an inflammatory disorder, the authors suggest that this spontaneous demyelinating disorder in macaques may shed light on MS.</p>
