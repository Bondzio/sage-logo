<p>It is unlikely that an artificial spleen, a violin fashioned out of tomato boxes and an exhibition of erotic sculpture have ever been included in the same scholarly volume before. These feats of human innovation cannot but impress the reader of Gilly Carr and Harold Mytum’s interdisciplinary collection on prisoner-of-war ‘cultural heritage’. Ingenuity, fortitude and resourcefulness emerge as the hallmarks of ‘creativity behind barbed wire’ (1). Yet these examples demonstrate both the promise and pitfalls of prisoner-of-war studies. From one perspective, such instances of inventiveness illuminate both the privations and opportunities of civilian and military internees in wartime. Alternatively, such episodic studies potentially fragment a field already saturated with the anecdotal and which lacks a unifying theoretical or methodological core. Indeed, Nicholas Saunders’s anthropological <italic>Trench Art</italic> is one of the few academic works repeatedly referenced in this volume. Nonetheless, Carr and Mytum’s volume convincingly balances these difficulties with the exciting possibilities of prisoner-of-war studies.</p>
<p>The 18 chapters investigate a wealth of objects, exhibitions and performances produced in confinement. Although the exclusive focus on the world wars mirrors the wider historiographical bias toward these conflicts, contributors utilize a wide range of case studies. These range from Donato Somma’s study of Italian camps in South Africa during the Second World War to Bernice Archer and Alan Jeffrey’s intricate examination of embroidery and its impact on subjectivity in civilian internee camps in the Far East between 1942 and 1945. Carr and Mytum’s thought-provoking introduction poses questions of artistic merit, identity and narrative, and raises a debate over ‘high’ and ‘low’ art which resonates throughout (6–8). For example, art historians Rachel Dickson, Sarah Macdougall and Ulrike Smalley apply this high-low dichotomy to the artistic output of camps on the Isle of Man. Other contributors dispense with this model; Suzanne Sizek argues that for many upper- and middle-class German and Austrian internees classical music was also ‘popular’ music (41), and Peter Doyle too elevates ‘trench art’ to the ‘high art of kreigie [wartime] “tin-bashing”’ (288). The inclusion of medical apparatus and engineering systems further complicates such categorization. As in the artistic and historical fields at large therefore, no unanimous consensus on ‘high’ and ‘low’ art is reached.</p>
<p>Similarly, many contributors ponder the relationship between creative output and the ‘enforced leisure of internment’ (73). Sizek argues that confinement gave composers Hans Gál (1890–1987) and Franz Reizenstein (1911–68) the time and venue to try new styles, suggesting further that experimentation was at the core of internment creativity. Yet at the same time captivity could reinforce the cultural norms of prisoners before their capture. Harold Mytum’s rigorous study of German photographs from the Isle of Man explains how shared pre-war artistic expectations led prisoner-photographers to adhere to the standards of early twentieth-century composition. On balance therefore, ‘creativity’ seemingly included a mixture of both the familiar and the unfamiliar.</p>
<p>Yet the majority of contributors stress the continuance of class, social, gender, professional and national boundaries. Oliver Wilkinson argues that magazines written by British officers in German camps during the First World War were at pains to promote ‘correct’ societal values in order to maintain existing hierarchies (233). Jonathan Henshaw suggests in his study of Allied nationals in the Weihnsen Internment Camp in China between 1943 and 1945 that the multinational group imprisoned there found it hard to develop a shared, ‘camp’ community identity (164). In other words, national groups in extremis retained, rather than discarded, their pre-war identities. Felicia Yap’s chapter on civil internees in British Asia and Donato Somma’s on ‘Madonnas and Prima Donnas’ in South Africa also show the continuation of pre-war Orientalism and colonial discourse (261). As these chapters tentatively imply, and the work of Heather Jones has demonstrated elsewhere, race and ethnicity are crucial components in military captivity, particularly in the numerous cases when captivity itself is predicated on racial terms.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, fluctuating identities are also evident. In the broadest chapter, both temporally and theoretically, Iris Rachamimov explores breaches of gender norms such as ‘marriage’ between male prisoners in the First World War (303). Elsewhere, Sears Eldredge evokes Mikhail Bakhtin, in all but name, by arguing that theatrical performances enabled a degree of subversion in Chungkai POW Hospital Camp. In a performance of the musical ‘Wonder Bar’ in May 1944, talent rather than rank secured the temperamental Lance Corporal Leo Britt his powerful role as producer-director, as it did for his three lead female impersonators (23). Furthermore, the prisoner of war functioned as a global historical actor. Not only did informal trade exist in some locales between internees and civil populations, but Meg Parkes argues that an information exchange took place near camps in the Far East, as local people taught prisoners which plants were edible or medicinal.</p>
<p>Yet in contrast to this balanced exploration of identity, the notion of ‘captivity’ lurks unacknowledged within many of these essays. Authors seem as bound by the confines of the ‘camp’ as do internees themselves, and the discrete spatial dimensions of these case studies perhaps prohibit a deeper interrogation of the meaning and parameters of captivity. By not addressing wartime imprisonment beyond the camp, one risks cementing an ahistorical image of barbed wire, guards and isolation, which belies the historical variation of military captivity.</p>
<p>Whilst this volume does not broaden the historiographical focus beyond the First and Second World Wars, or manage to escape the virtual barbed wire that encircles the study of military captivity, it remains a fascinating and analytically skilful volume and represents a significant contribution to prisoner-of-war studies.</p>
