<abstract>
<p>The Hueston local transposition flap and Souquet advancement flap are two commonly employed options in fingertip reconstruction after amputation. Both are rectangular flaps rotated so that the free edge advances to cover the defect in the fingertip. They differ in that the Hueston flap does not include the neurovascular bundle in the free edge, while the Souquet flap does include the bundle. In consequence, the Hueston advances further but is half insensate, while the Souquet advances far less but is sensate. We describe a modification of the Souquet flap that retains the advantages of both flaps while avoiding the drawbacks.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Transverse amputation defects in the fingertips can be reconstructed using one of a variety of flaps. The ideal flap has a mechanical quality identical to the skin being replaced and is sensate and homodigital.</p>
<p>The Hueston local transposition flap and Souquet advancement flap are very similar in design. Both are rectangular flaps rotated so that the free edge advances to cover the defect in the fingertip. They differ in that the Hueston flap does not include the neurovascular bundle in the free edge, while the Souquet flap does include the bundle. In consequence, the Hueston advances further but is half insensate, while the Souquet advances far less but is sensate. We describe a modification of the Souquet flap that retains the advantages of both flaps while avoiding the drawbacks.</p>
<p>Transverse amputations of the fingertip that expose bone require flap cover. Numerous options are available and each has its advocates and applications. The key, as in all fingertip reconstruction, is mastery of most available methods so that a specific defect can be matched to the best suited method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1753193412439977">Sammut, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>In fingertip reconstruction, the ideal flap will have a mechanical quality identical to the skin being replaced, and will be sensate (to the discriminatory level of the skin being replaced) and homodigital, to avoid the problem of cortical reorientation.</p>
<p>Two flaps in common use are the Hueston local transposition flap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1753193412439977">Hueston, 1966</xref>) and the Souquet advancement flap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1753193412439977">Souquet, 1985</xref>). These are very similar in design, but differ in qualities of mobility and sensibility.</p>
<p>The Hueston flap is a random rectangular flap raised by dissection superficial to the neurovascular bundle in the leading edge and rotated with the contralateral neurovascular bundle in the base (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1753193412439977">Figure 1</xref>). The leading edge is very mobile and rotates through 90°. Provided the right indications apply and a number of technical details are observed, this flap provides cover of a transverse amputation. The omission of the neurovascular bundle in the leading edge ensures ample mobility at the cost of loss of sensation in the leading half of the flap. This limits its usefulness and also dictates that the flap should always be based on the leading aspect of the digit.</p>

</fig>
<p>The Souquet flap is also rectangular, but contains both neurovascular bundles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1753193412439977">Figure 2</xref>). The leading neurovascular bundle is mobilized (as one would mobilize the neurovascular bundles in an Atasoy flap) by division of fibrous bands and stretch of the vessel and nerve. This inclusion of nerve and vessels limits the mobility of the flap, but ensures normal sensibility.</p>

<title>Modification</title>
<p>We raised the Souquet flap in the standard manner, including the neurovascular bundle in the leading edge, but modified the technique by extension of the leading edge incision in the midlateral line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1753193412439977">Figure 3</xref>). This enables dissection and mobilization of the neurovascular bundle, much as one would in mobilizing an island flap, enabling greatly increased mobility while maintaining full sensibility.</p>

<title>Case</title>
<p>A 31-year-old dentist presented having injured the leading pulp in his right, dominant index fingertip. This had been resurfaced using split skin graft, which was persistently tender because it was adherent to underlying bone. He had had fat injections into the area in an attempt to bulk up the depression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1753193412439977">Figure 4a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1753193412439977">b</xref>). This had simply resulted in a hard, scarred, and tender dimple precisely at the most frequent contact point of the digit. He developed the habit of excluding the finger for tasks requiring precision and dexterity, and this was a serious handicap in his work as a dentist. He requested replacement of this area with sensate, non-tender skin that had a better mechanical cushion.</p>

</fig>
<p>A transposition flap in the general design of the Hueston and Souquet flaps was selected. Because of the oblique orientation of the defect it was necessary to base this flap on the trailing edge. The Souquet pattern of flap was selected, including the leading neurovascular bundle in the flap, to maintain full sensibility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1753193412439977">Figure 5</xref>). In order to obtain adequate mobility and tension-free closure, the leading-edge incision was extended in the mid-lateral line. The neurovascular pedicle was then fully mobilized by division of Grayson’s ligament and all restraining bands. The flap was rotated and inset. The secondary defect was left to heal by secondary intention.</p>

<title>Outcome</title>
<p>The patient returned to work as a dentist within 3 weeks and immediately included this finger in all activity. After some initial hyperaesthesia, sensation settled to normal such that the index was included and used without awareness within 6 weeks. The contour, mechanical property, and sensibility were fully restored (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1753193412439977">Figure 6</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>It cannot be reiterated too often that the key to surgery of traumatic loss of substance of the fingertips is mastery of all available variations of flaps. No flap should be dismissed as useless, and one should resist resorting to a couple of favourite methods because one then tends to adapt the defect to the method when the selection process should be the other way around.</p>
<p>The Hueston flap is a versatile, easily executed, and reliable flap that has excellent mobility. It will adequately cover most transverse amputations at all levels of the digit. One must observe a number of technical details to ensure rotation and a good cosmetic and functional outcome. Its main drawback is the loss of sensation in the leading half of the flap. This restricts its use to defects where it is possible to base the flap on the leading aspect of the digit and excludes its use in some oblique defects.</p>
<p>The Souquet flap is also easily executed and reliable. It maintains full sensibility. It can be based on either the leading or trailing edge of the finger. The inclusion of the leading neurovascular bundle limits mobility and rotation. In turn, this restricts its use to defects where little movement is required.</p>
<p>Our modification benefits from the best of either flap and avoids either drawback. The mobilization of the leading pedicle ensures as much mobility as could be required. Sensibility is maintained from the outset. This makes the flap useful in a variety of orientations of defect and it can be based on either leading or trailing aspects of the digit.</p>
