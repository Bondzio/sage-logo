<sec id="sec2-0959353512472477"><title><bold>Reviewed by</bold>: Nilüfer Ercan, <italic>Middle East Technical University, Turkey</italic></title>
<p>Photographs, videos, drawings, artwork, or namely <italic>the visual</italic> has long been in our lives as part and witnesses of our experiences; but psychology has rarely utilized it as a qualitative source rather than as mere research documentation or face validity tool. In this book, Reavey states an aim to present an overview of this emerging utilization based on theoretical, methodological, analytical and ethical aspects. In order to do so, she brings a considerable number of authors with different research agendas together in 23 chapters. These chapters are organized into four main parts. The first part involves research using photography for topics of interest such as closeness, embodiment, identity, gender, health and autobiographical memory. It is worth noting that research presented in the chapters accommodates related theoretical and methodological details, offering guidance on how to integrate visual data into the research and how to analyze and interpret them. The second part includes research utilizing videos and visual data found on social network sites. The latter sets forth the communicative role of the visual as previously mistrusted and ignored data. The third part comprises research that adapts visual methods for community psychology and social change purposes (i.e. minorities, empowerment, participation). Worthy of note, this part includes an interesting chapter covering the work conducted by an uncommon collaboration of artists and academicians in order to disseminate psychological research.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, meticulously selected chapters in the first three parts thoroughly illustrate the use of <italic>the visual</italic> as an enriching, integrative qualitative method in the study of human experience, and they well exemplify how an important gap is filled by this utilization. For instance, in chapter 4, Del Busso reveals that photo elicitation (use of pre-existing photos) and photo production (photos taken by the participant on purpose and during the research process) let participants provide richer content about their experience in emotional, spatial, relational and sensuous terms. Similarly Pini and Walkerdine (Chapter 10) state that participants better disclose to a videotape in a less invasive environment. In addition to attaining enriched content, other advantages that visual methods provide are exemplified throughout the chapters (i.e. participants’ increased control over the data produced and their active role in the research process).</p>
<p>The fourth and final part of the book involves deep reflections on ethical/ methodological concerns, implications and advantages. Although they are slightly discussed within the chapters in the first three parts, in this part, valuable insight is provided for implementing feminist research ethics (i.e. reflexivity, opportunities to speak out), minding power dynamics, and protecting participant rights/ benefits (i.e. comfort, anonymity, publishing issues).</p>
<p>It should be kept in mind that the narrowed down title of the book <italic>Visual Methods in Psychology: Using and Interpreting Images in Qualitative Research</italic> reflects to the point and rich content. Researchers who are interested in adapting this emerging approach, namely including visual methods in qualitative research in psychology, would most benefit from this book with its wide ranging content, based on inspiring and creative research, while they are guided by the reflections as well. Also, any reader of methodological issues in psychology, gender, feminism and psychology would appreciate the content they come across here.</p>
