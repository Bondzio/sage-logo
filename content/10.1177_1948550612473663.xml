<abstract>
<p>We tested the internal reliability and predictive validity of a new 4-item Short Social Dominance Orientation (SSDO) scale among adults in 20 countries, using 15 languages (<italic>N</italic> = 2,130). Low scores indicate preferring group inclusion and equality to dominance. As expected, cross-nationally, the lower people were on SSDO, the more they endorsed more women in leadership positions, protecting minorities, and aid to the poor. Multilevel moderation models showed that each effect was stronger in nations where a relevant kind of group power differentiation was more salient. Distributions of SSDO were positively skewed, despite use of an extended response scale; results show rejecting group hierarchy is normative. The short scale is effective. Challenges regarding translations, use of short scales, and intersections between individual and collective levels in social dominance theory are discussed.</p>

<p> … perhaps psychology’s greatest insight is that the human mind both forms and is formed by human society. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1948550612473663">Sidanius and Pratto (1999</xref>, p. 61)</p>
</disp-quote>
Our most common collectives—families, workplaces, schools, and societies—are often hierarchical. Social hierarchy is therefore likely to influence people’s orientations toward the social world. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1948550612473663">Pratto, Sidanius, Stallworth, and Malle (1994)</xref> postulated that in societies with group-based hierarchies, people would develop general psychological orientations toward hierarchy, with some people rejecting their unequal and exclusionary nature, and others endorsing their order and appropriateness. People’s degree of approval of group-based hierarchies, namely social dominance orientation (SDO; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1948550612473663">Pratto, Sidanius, Stallworth, &amp; Malle, 1994</xref>), correlates robustly with discrimination and prejudicial ideologies about many kinds of groups (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1948550612473663">Lee, Pratto, &amp; Johnson, 2011</xref>). At the individual level, then, measures of SDO should correlate with attitudes regarding dominant or subordinate groups. In many societies, ethnic or religious minorities, the poor, and women are subordinated. Thus, we expect that protecting or promoting such groups will correlate negatively with SDO across many societies. We term this the <italic>robustness hypothesis</italic>.</p>
<p>Different groups are the special targets of discrimination and prejudice in different contexts. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1948550612473663">Sidanius and Pratto (1999</xref>, p. 61) hypothesized that social dominance drives would be targeted against “groups that are most salient and that define the sharpest power differential within any given society at any given time.” This hypothesis implies that where a group power contest is socially highlighted, the relationship between SDO and attitudes toward treatment of that group should be even stronger. We call this the <italic>moderation hypothesis</italic>. In other words, the size of the relation between SDO and attitudes regarding subordinate groups should be moderated by contextual measures of group power differentiation. Notice, however, that if a group power difference is sociopolitically salient, that does not imply that there is more objective inequality between groups. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1948550612473663">Lee, Pratto, and Johnson (2011</xref>) meta-analytically found that dominant and subordinate groups were more different on SDO not where objective differences were larger, but in more egalitarian contexts. The present study tests the robustness hypothesis and the moderation hypothesis using multilevel modeling with a cross-national survey. This technique simultaneously tests the robustness of correlations between SDO and attitudes concerning three target groups across nations, and whether these correlations are moderated by national indicators of group power differentiation. Using three different targets of dominance motives and a different national moderator for each, the study provides a strong, robust test of both hypotheses.</p>

<title>Measuring SDO</title>
<p>The 16-item “SDO<sub>6</sub>” scale by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1948550612473663">Pratto et al. (1994</xref>) has been used in translations in many cultures (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1948550612473663">Aiello, Chirumbolo, Leone, &amp; Pratto, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1948550612473663">Lee et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1948550612473663">Meyer, 2012</xref>) as a measure of propensity for prejudice. SDO correlates positively with endorsement of ideologies that legitimize inequality, such as racism, sexism, and nationalism, using a variety of culturally appropriate measures, and negatively with endorsement of ideologies that advocate for greater inclusiveness and equality, and with support for policies that would promote these principles (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1948550612473663">Lee et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite its widespread use, some problems have been posed since the scale’s original testing. First, egalitarianism has become more normative in many nations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1948550612473663">Inglehart, Norris, &amp; Welzel, 2002</xref>), leading some to question the usefulness of assessing dominance motives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1948550612473663">Sears, Haley, &amp; Henry, 2008</xref>). In fact, scores on 1–5 and 1–7 SDO scales are typically skewed positively, with very few people at the midpoint or higher. However, the scale still correlates robustly with a variety of criterion variables, indicating that variability of scores on the scale is socially and psychologically meaningful (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1948550612473663">Lee et al., 2011</xref>). Second, using student samples in prejudice research has been criticized for inflating results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1948550612473663">Henry, 2008</xref>; but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1948550612473663">Cohrs &amp; Stetzl, 2010</xref> for contradictory results). Third, sometimes only a subset of the items work to predict criterion variables (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1948550612473663">Freeman, Aquino, &amp; McFerran, 2009</xref>). Fourth, fewer items are more efficient for participants and researchers, and brief personality measures have become common (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1948550612473663">Rammstedt &amp; John, 2007</xref>). Fifth, alternative translations of SDO items into the same language (e.g., Cohrs, Moschner, Maes, &amp; Kielmann, 2005; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1948550612473663">Six, Wolfradt, &amp; Zick, 2001</xref>), and use of different subsets of the 16 items, are abounding. To standardize the scale across countries, it is important to ensure that local connotations of particular words and phrases have comparable meaning, especially for languages spoken in many countries (e.g., Spanish, Arabic). Sixth, the pro-trait and con-trait aspects of the scale are confounded with item wording and may produce two factors (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1948550612473663">Six et al., 2001</xref>). Seventh, although social dominance theory was intended to pertain to all complex societies, the psychological focus of SDO, group dominance versus equality, may be a product of Western political–psychological history. If SDO primarily makes sense to people influenced by this cultural milieu, its robustness would be curtailed and new theorizing would be required.</p>
<p>The present research addressed these concerns as follows. First, to address whether scale truncation contributes to the apparent norm of low SDO, we employed 1–10 scales, rather than the more usual 1–5 or 1–7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1948550612473663">Lee et al., 2011</xref>). Second, to make the scale more efficient, we tested a new, 4-item Short Social Dominance Orientation (SSDO) scale. The items had high item-total correlations from 92 new and old SDO items in pilot studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1948550612473663">Pratto et al., 2012</xref>). To remove a confound in the SDO<sub>6</sub> scale, all items—rather than just the contrait items—are stated as ideals. The items selected are short and direct and were selected to cover different parts of the construct space. Thus, high inter-item correlations were not the aim. Third, we tested the 4 items using the same predictive validity criterion in multiple languages and nations approximately simultaneously. Fourth and most importantly, we tested the scale in numerous cultural–political contexts, including Western democracies (e.g., United States, United Kingdom), non-Western democracies (e.g., Lebanon, Turkey, Taiwan), nations with recent histories of repression (e.g., South Africa, Poland), and nations with both high (e.g., Indonesia, Switzerland) and low (e.g., Ireland, Greece) ethnic and/or religious heterogeneity.</p>
<p>The robustness hypothesis implies that SSDO should correlate negatively with support for policies favoring different low-power groups that are found in many societies, namely the poor, minorities, and women. The moderation hypothesis implies that these correlations should be increased with national moderators that indicate greater salience of each group differentiation regarding power. Specifically, we reasoned that where economic distress is higher, economic insecurity differentiates people less, so we expected national economic distress to weaken the correlation between SDO and supporting aid to the poor. In contrast, democratic societies highlight minority rights and representation, so we expected degree of democratization to strengthen the correlation between SDO and protecting minorities. As higher education is a path to leadership in many societies, in nations in which women complete secondary school at comparable or higher rates than men, the correlation between SDO and attitudes toward women in leadership should be stronger.</p>

<p>We recruited adult participants in culturally appropriate ways, including in-person requests, snowball sampling, and Internet surveys, seeking diversity in terms of sociopolitical attitudes, gender, age, and ethnic or religious affiliation. Each sample had some age spread, which in part reflected the age of its population.

<title>Participant Variables</title>
<p>The initial version of the International Survey on Social and Political Life was written simultaneously in English, Arabic, and Spanish. Translations from English were done by local multilingual collaborators (who were social psychologists or political scientists) in discussion with the first and fourth authors. Appropriateness of the translations was ensured through back translations. After 32 unrelated questions, participants rated their opinion about “aid to the poor,” “protecting ethnic/religious minorities,” and “more women in leadership positions,” from 1 (<italic>strongly disfavor</italic>) to 10 (<italic>strongly favor</italic>). Question about minorities designated ones appropriate to that nation (e.g., religious in Northern Ireland and Lebanon, ethnic in United States and New Zealand).

<title>The Normativity of Rejection of Hierarchy</title>
<p>
<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1948550612473663">Table 2</xref> shows that mean scores on the SSDO were decidedly on the low side of the scale, indicating normative disapproval of hegemony. Means ranged from about 2.5 (Belgium, Bosnia-Herzegovina) to around 4 (United Kingdom, Serbia), but individuals also varied within samples. Nearly the full range of the scale was used in some of the larger samples, and all samples included people at the minimum. In all samples, the maximum was above the midpoint of 5.5, but still substantially below the hypothetical high SDO end of the scale; all distributions were skewed positively, with the exception of the United Kingdom (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1948550612473663">Table 2</xref>). Sample norms are indicated by variance. The mean and standard deviation of SDO for each country were correlated, <italic>r</italic>(18) = .52, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, indicating that when responses were more normative, means were lower. As with previous SDO scales, then, rejection of dominance and inclusion of groups was normative, but some individuals within each sample were more accepting of group hierarchy.</p>

<title>SSDO Scale</title>
<p>The mean inter-item correlation ranged from .18 to .53, with most of them in the range .20–.29 (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1948550612473663">Table 2</xref>). This indicates that items are tapping the same construct but also sample different aspects of the construct space as intended. SSDO had good internal reliability for a brief scale; using <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1948550612473663">Rodriguez and Maeda’s (2006)</xref> formula, the weighted average α reliability was .65 (95% confidence interval: [.62, .67]). There was significant heterogeneity in the coefficient α between countries, <italic>Q</italic>(19) = 97.28, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .0001 indicating differences among nations.</p>
<p>Principle axis factoring on the data revealed only one factor, eigenvalue = 2.00, accounting for 48% of the variance. Confirmatory factor analysis of a one-factor model of the four SSDO items indicated good fit for a large sample, CFI = .993, NFI = .992, TLI = .927, root mean square error of approximation = .06, PCLOSE = .26, χ<sup>2</sup>(1) = 8.66, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .003. Standardized loadings of the 4 items (1–4), respectively, were .45, −.60, .58, and −.43. Tucker’s Phi measures congruence among the items, that is, factorial similarity, within each sample. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1948550612473663">Table 2</xref>, the Tucker’s Phi for SSDO for each nation was higher than the .95 recommended (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1948550612473663">Lorenzo-Seva &amp; ten Berge, 2006</xref>), showing that the scale is unidimensional across nations.</p>
<p>Translators often anticipated which items would not be effective in their contexts. In the Turkish sample, eliminating Item 2, which is negated with a suffix toward the end of the last word, would improve the α from .34 to .54. In the Taiwanese and Chinese samples, eliminating Item 4 would improve the α substantially (.48 to .67 in Taiwan, .56 to .73 in China). In these cultural contexts, superior groups are viewed as benevolent and protective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1948550612473663">Liu, Li, &amp; Yue, 2010</xref>), which makes the evaluative connotation of this item more ambivalent than that of other items.

<title>Hypothesis Testing</title>
<p>The robustness hypothesis implies that the SSDO scale should correlate reliably negatively with attitude toward each target group. The Schmidt–Hunter method adjusts for sample size and internal reliability of the SSDO scale to average correlations across samples (see bottom of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1948550612473663">Table 2</xref>). All three were sizable, but the correlation was smaller for more women in leadership positions than for aid to the poor and protecting minorities. In some of the smaller samples (e.g., Bosnia-Herzegovina), correlations were in the expected direction but were weak enough to be unreliable. There were reliable correlations in all but one sample, and in 15 of the 20 samples, 2 or 3 of the correlations were reliable (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1948550612473663">Table 2</xref>). Inspection of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1948550612473663">Table 2</xref> shows that the size of correlations does not correspond to the language of administration, to major religion of the nation, to level of development of the nation, nor to method of administration.</p>
<p>To control for between-nation (between-sample) variance and to test the robustness hypothesis and the moderation hypothesis simultaneously, we estimated a multilevel model on each attitude. The model tests individuals’ SDO scores at Level 1 and national moderators at Level 2. Using Raudenbush and Bryk’s (2002) notation where <italic>Y<sub>ij</sub>

<p>In <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula1-1948550612473663">Equation 1</xref>, β<sub>1<italic>j</italic>
</sub> is the average standardized slope of SSDO on the attitude. The robustness hypothesis implies that this should be reliably negative. Each person’s attitude is a function of the sample mean, β<sub>0<italic>j</italic>
</sub> (shown in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula2-1948550612473663">Equation 2</xref>), the person’s SSDO score (SDO), and each sample’s slope (β<sub>1<italic>j</italic>
</sub>), which can vary between nations/samples, as shown in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula3-1948550612473663">Equation 3</xref>. If the averaged standardized slope of SSDO is moderated by the national moderator (MOD), then the γ<sub>11</sub> coefficient in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula3-1948550612473663">Equation 3</xref> should be reliable.</p>
<p>We report the average standardized slope of SSDO on the three attitudes (γ<sub>10</sub>), the τ<sub>11</sub> (i.e., the variance in the slope estimate between nations, which is variance of the error <italic>u</italic>
<sub>1<italic>j</italic>
</sub>), the proportion of variance explained by SSDO, and the proportion of that variance associated with the moderator (similar to an <italic>R</italic>
<sup>2</sup> in traditional regression analyses, but for multilevel models; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1948550612473663">Raudenbush &amp; Bryk, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>SSDO reliably predicted opposition to protecting minorities, γ<sub>01</sub> = −.39, <italic>SE </italic>= .03, <italic>t</italic>(18) = −16.09, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001; this effect varied reliably between nations, τ<sub>11</sub> = .009, χ<sup>2</sup>(17) = 31.98, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .02. The proportion of variance explained by SSDO at the individual level was .15. This effect was reliably moderated by the nation’s Democracy Index, γ<sub>11</sub> = −.08, <italic>t</italic>(18) = −3.49, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01. The proportion of variance in covariance of SSDO and attitude accounted for by the moderator was .63, which left no reliable between-nation variance in the slope of SDO, τ<sub>11</sub> = .003, χ<sup>2</sup>(18) = 21.55, <italic>p </italic>= .16. Both hypotheses were confirmed; the lower participants’ SSDO, the more they advocated protecting minorities, and this effect was stronger in more democratic nations.</p>
<p>SSDO also reliably predicted opposition to providing aid to the poor, γ<sub>10</sub> = −.34, <italic>SE </italic>= .02, <italic>t</italic>(18) = −14.13, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, which varied reliably across countries/samples, τ<sub>11</sub> = .01, χ<sup>2</sup>(17) = 42.43, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. The proportion of variance explained by SSDO at the individual level was .09. This effect was moderated by the economic distress, γ<sub>11</sub> = .10, <italic>t</italic>(16) = 3.63, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .004, which accounted for 68% of the variance explained by SSDO. In fact, the moderator left no reliable national variance, τ<sub>11</sub> = .004, χ<sup>2</sup>(16) = 23.40, <italic>p</italic> = .10. Also, in more economically distressed nations, there was greater support for aid to the poor, γ<sub>01</sub> = .20, <italic>SE </italic>= .07, <italic>t</italic>(16) = 3.03, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .008. These results also confirm the robustness and moderation hypotheses, with lower SDO participants endorsing more aid to the poor, but there was more consensus on such aid in economically distressed nations.</p>
<p>Finally, SSDO reliably predicted support for more women in leadership positions, γ<sub>10</sub> = −.27, <italic>SE </italic>= .03, <italic>t</italic>(16) = −10.69, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. This effect varied reliably across nations, τ<sub>11</sub> = .007, χ<sup>2</sup>(17) = 78.34, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. The proportion of variance explained by SSDO at the individual level was .08. This effect was moderated by the educational gender difference, γ<sub>11</sub> = −.06, <italic>SE</italic> = .03, <italic>t</italic>(17) = −2.24, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .04, which accounted for 53% of the covariance of SSDO and attitude regarding women leadership and eliminated between-nation variance, τ<sub>11</sub> = .003, χ<sup>2</sup>(16) = 21.94, <italic>p</italic> = .15. The robustness hypothesis was confirmed; the lower participants’ SSDO, the more they endorsed women in leadership positions, and this effect was stronger where women are gaining educational parity with men. The more a society has the social agenda of empowering women through education, the more endorsing women leaders differentiates lower from higher SDO people. We also tested whether the three moderators hypothesized and reported above predicted the other attitudes, but in no case was an alternative moderator effect stronger than the effect of the specified moderator.</p>
<p>The variances of the SSDO slopes were substantially smaller than the slopes themselves (e.g., .03 vs. −.27 for the smallest slope regarding women leadership), and all were reliably negative as expected. Given that the policies were single-item measures, these are robust effects. The moderation effects were substantially smaller than the SSDO effects, which also indicate the robustness of the SSDO effects. Nonetheless, we found three unique demonstrations of the moderation hypothesis.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The present findings confirm that people in group dominance societies develop general orientations toward hierarchies that influence their relations to a variety of kinds of groups (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1948550612473663">Pratto et al., 2000</xref>). Although people varied on the full range of the scale, these samples are decidedly opposed to group-based dominance. That orientation and immediate context lead people to act in ways that affect the hierarchy (see Pratto, Sidanius, &amp; Levin, 2006). Given the criticisms of SDO scales and student samples, these results confirm the importance of testing theories in varied social and political conditions, including among adults and in developing nations (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1948550612473663">Henrich, Heine, &amp; Norenzayan, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Because SDO is cross-culturally robust, moderation of its effects remain rare. The direct effects of SDO on attitudes toward three different kinds of target groups in 20 countries were over 3 times larger than the moderation effects, so the generality of SDO cannot be denied. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1948550612473663">Pratto et al. (1994)</xref> hypothesized, sociopolitical context helps shape orientations toward group dominance. We found that increased salience of each particular group power differentiation strengthened the correlation of SDO with attitudes regarding such groups. Power salience need not mean minority status or greater inequality; more women being educated, fewer people in economic distress, and more democracy uniquely strengthened the association of SSDO with relevant policy attitudes. These results resoundingly support the idea that relations of attitudes and SDO are strengthened when group differentiation is on the sociopolitical agenda. Our findings clarify whether salience of group differentiation is due to objective inequality or politicization of power. If objective inequality increased the relationship between SDO and the attitude variables, we would have found moderation effects of the opposite signs than we did. Our moderation effects are not just a matter of temporary target group salience (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1948550612473663">Schmitt, Branscombe, &amp; Kappen, 2003</xref>) or personal identity salience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1948550612473663">Foels &amp; Pappas, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1948550612473663">Wilson &amp; Liu, 2003</xref>), but a broadscale and important political context effect.</p>
<p>Conducting multicountry, multilanguage research with adult participants poses particular challenges to researchers. Adults often have no patience for semiredundant items, so developing brief scales is important. The SSDO is more efficient for researchers and less tedious for participants. The SSDO scale is internally coherent, balanced, and does not confound pro-trait and con-trait item direction with whether items are phrased as ideals. However, to write balanced scales that do not confound particular words with direction of the item (e.g., a pro-trait item that uses “equality”), one may need to use negations (e.g., Item 2). In some languages, negations are the first word or prefix (e.g., Italian); in some languages they come in the middle of the sentence, but in Turkish, negations are inserted toward the end of the last word, which makes them easy to overlook. For some participants, the instructions to consider different kinds of groups (e.g., political factions, ethnicities) required them to overgeneralize more than they preferred. Also, for some people, gender is not a “group” but a category. Finally, overtly naming equality, power, and dominance in items in order to ask people how they feel about them requires that (a) there are appropriate terms in the language, (b) that it is polite to designate these ideas, and (c) that people have considered these concepts and feel free to indicate their opinions about them, conditions which are not always the case (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1948550612473663">Meyer, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Using few items may increase error variance. Generally, we found that construct validity results were more robust with samples of 100 or more. There may be a trade-off between the number of items and the number of participants in producing reliable results. For studies with fewer available participants, researchers may opt to use longer measures of SDO, and/or longer measures of criterion variables. Previous cross-cultural research on SDO employed attitude items that are salient and in the parlance of the local context (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1948550612473663">Pratto et al., 2000</xref>); doing so may produce stronger correlations with SSDO.</p>
<p>Another limitation of our study is the small number of nations, although they differ in important ways. Alternative interpretations of the present moderation effects are possible and call for additional research testing more moderators, which would require more and varied nations to be included. Unfortunately, many indices omit non-U.N. member nations, newer nations, and nations in turmoil. Least-developed nations remain understudied.</p>
<p>Research by numerous independent scholars using previous SDO measures has shown that the construct is useful in many different kinds of cultural and sociopolitical contexts for examining sociopolitical attitudes, intergroup prejudice, and discrimination. The present results verify that being low on SDO is far more common than being absolutely high. This is not due to truncation of response scale range; nearly the full range was used in several samples. Nonetheless, like research using previous SDO scales, we found robust differences among people on the SSDO scale that correspond to their sociopolitical attitudes. The present results demonstrate that people’s orientations toward intergroup dominance or equality and inclusion, are broadly applicable in a variety of sociopolitical and cultural contexts.</p>
<p>As predicted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1948550612473663">Sidanius and Pratto (1999</xref>, p. 61), the effects of SDO were moderated by objective social, political, and economic indicators of group power salience (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1948550612473663">Pratto &amp; Shih, 2000</xref>, for parallel experimental evidence). This interplay between individual psychological orientations and social context, central to social–personality psychology, reveals the potential dynamism of hierarchical systems. If hierarchies are contested, they are likely to invoke people’s opposition to hierarchy and may induce political action. The seeds of social change lie in this interplay: The more group power differentiation is made salient, the more people apply their orientation toward group inequality to their attitudes. If they act on that orientation, our results suggest that the vast majority would aim to reduce social inequality.</p>
