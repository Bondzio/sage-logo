<abstract>
<p>Offender risk and needs assessment, one of the pillars of the risk–need-responsivity model of offender rehabilitation, usually depends on raters assessing offender risk and needs. The few available studies of interrater reliability in offender risk assessment are, however, limited in the generalizability of their results. The present study examined interrater reliability in Dutch offender risk assessment by 38 raters who independently assessed 75 offenders. The results show substantial reliability (Tinsley and Weiss’s <italic>T</italic> value ≥ .61) for risk of reconviction and moderate (<italic>T</italic> value ≥ .41) to substantial reliability for offender needs, such as accommodation, finances, or education. These results are discussed in light of a recent British study on the interrater reliability of a comparable risk assessment instrument. The results from the present study show similar to better reliability, leading to the conclusion that greater external validity does not negatively influence interrater reliability results.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Over the past 30 years, structured offender risk assessment instruments have become widely used in corrections and probation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0011128710382347">Bonta, 2002</xref>). Accordingly, a large body of literature exists on the predictive validity of such risk assessment instruments (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0011128710382347">Brennan, Dieterich, &amp; Ehret, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0011128710382347">Flores, Lowenkamp, Smith, &amp; Latessa, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0011128710382347">Hanson &amp; Morton-Bourgon, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0011128710382347">Wormith, Olver, Stevenson, &amp; Girard, 2007</xref>). Surprisingly, though, reliability, in general, and interrater reliability, in particular, are somewhat neglected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0011128710382347">Baird, 2009</xref>). In the case of interrater reliability, this neglect is particularly striking since risk assessment instruments are usually completed by probation officers or other practitioners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0011128710382347">Austin, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0011128710382347">Bonta, 2002</xref>). As a result, risk assessment depends at least in part on the subjective assessment and clinical inference of these raters, and given the possible uses of such assessments—in making supervision and rehabilitation decisions that will contribute to crime prevention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0011128710382347">Andrews &amp; Dowden, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0011128710382347">Bonta, 2007</xref>)—the need for good interrater reliability for such instruments is clearly illustrated. When prosecutors and judges take offender risk assessments into account during an offender’s trial, substandard reliability of such assessments could compromise the fairness of a legal decision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0011128710382347">Bonta, 2007</xref>). Similarly, selection of appropriate behavioral interventions should be free from rater errors in offender risk assessment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0011128710382347">Bonta, 2002</xref>). This article describes the results of a Dutch study of interrater reliability in offender risk assessment.</p>
<p>The recent history of offender risk assessment can be linked to a shift in criminal justice thinking about offender rehabilitation from “nothing works” to “what works” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0011128710382347">Andrews, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0011128710382347">Andrews, Bonta, &amp; Wormith, 2006</xref>). With the advent of meta-analysis as a data analysis technique, it became clear that the 1970s’ view of nothing works in offender rehabilitation was untenable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0011128710382347">Andrews &amp; Bonta, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0011128710382347">Cullen &amp; Gendreau, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0011128710382347">McGuire, 2002</xref>). Instead, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0011128710382347">Andrews, Bonta, and Hoge (1990)</xref> formulated criteria for offender rehabilitation efforts that would lead to reductions in recidivism: the principles of risk, need, and responsivity as articulated in the RNR model. These principles address the issues of which offenders should receive treatment to reduce their risk of recidivism, what behavioral targets should be set, and what treatment strategies ought to be employed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0011128710382347">Andrews, Bonta, et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0011128710382347">Andrews et al., 2006</xref>). In brief, the risk principle states that treatment intensity should depend on the level of risk of re-offending: High-risk offenders will benefit most from high levels of treatment intensity, whereas low-risk offenders should receive minimal or no intervention at all. The need principle suggests that interventions should address dynamic risk factors—or criminogenic needs—because changing these aspects of a person or his or her situation will lead to a decrease in the chance of recidivism. The responsivity principle states that offenders will benefit most from correctional programs that match with their personality, motivation, and ability. Strong empirical support exists for the RNR model: Treatments complying with the RNR principles demonstrate significantly greater effectiveness than criminal sanctions or interventions that do not comply with RNR principles (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0011128710382347">Andrews, Zinger, et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0011128710382347">Di Placido, Simon, Witte, Gu, &amp; Wong, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0011128710382347">Dowden &amp; Andrews, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0011128710382347">French &amp; Gendreau, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0011128710382347">Hanson, Bourgon, Helmus, &amp; Hodgson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0011128710382347">Lowenkamp, Latessa, &amp; Holsinger, 2006</xref>). Furthermore, as countries saw themselves faced with ever-increasing amounts of money to be spent on punishment-oriented policies, the possibility of reducing re-offending through rehabilitation became politically attractive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0011128710382347">Ogloff &amp; Davis, 2004</xref>). Consequently, a number of countries across North America, Europe, and Oceania adopted the RNR model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0011128710382347">Ward, Melser, &amp; Yates, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>For offender rehabilitation to be consistent with the RNR model, knowledge of an offender’s risk level and criminogenic needs is essential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0011128710382347">Andrews, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0011128710382347">Andrews &amp; Bonta, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0011128710382347">Ogloff &amp; Davis, 2004</xref>). Risk and needs assessment should therefore be closely integrated with rehabilitation efforts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0011128710382347">Wong, Gordon, &amp; Gu, 2007</xref>); risk assessment will guide the assignment of offenders to different levels of treatment intensity while assessing needs will inform what criminogenic factors need to be targeted by offering relevant behavioral interventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0011128710382347">Hollin, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0011128710382347">McGuire, 2002</xref>). Within the RNR framework, the assessment of risk and needs is usually done by using one of several structured clinical risk assessment instruments (for a review of risk and needs assessment, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0011128710382347">Andrews et al., 2006</xref>). In justice systems that adopted the RNR model, the most widely used instruments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0011128710382347">Andrews et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0011128710382347">Ogloff &amp; Davis, 2004</xref>) include the American Correctional Offender Management Profiling for Alternative Sanctions (COMPAS; details available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.northpointeinc.com">http://www.northpointeinc.com</ext-link>), the Canadian Level of Service/Case Management Inventory<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0011128710382347">1</xref></sup> (LS/CMI; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0011128710382347">Andrews, Bonta, &amp; Wormith, 2004</xref>), and the British Offender Assessment System (OASys; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0011128710382347">Howard, Clark, &amp; Garnham, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0011128710382347">2006</xref>). On introducing the RNR model in Dutch criminal justice policy, Dutch probation services and the Department of Justice commissioned the development of the Dutch-language <italic>Recidive Inschattingsschalen</italic> (RISc) [Recidivism Assessment Scales] (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0011128710382347">Adviesbureau Van Montfoort &amp; Reclassering Nederland, 2004</xref>). OASys served as an example in the construction of RISc, and both instruments are highly comparable.</p>
<p>Although the predictive validity of the English-language instruments has been extensively studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0011128710382347">Andrews et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0011128710382347">Brennan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0011128710382347">Debidin, 2009</xref>), research on interrater reliability either is lacking—as appears to be the case for COMPAS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0011128710382347">Brennan, Dieterich, &amp; Ehret, 2007</xref>)—or suffers from a number of limitations. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0011128710382347">Andrews et al. (2004)</xref>, for instance, report on the interrater reliability of the LS/CMI based on two (unpublished) studies. The first study investigated a group of 18 offenders with an average of 26 days (<italic>SD</italic> = 16.09) between testing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0011128710382347">Andrews et al., 2004</xref>). Repeat testings were not timed at fixed intervals but occurred because a second practitioner typically conducted a repeat assessment when an offender was assessed in another location or for another reason (compared with the first assessments). In other words, this study used a (small) convenience data set and was not initially designed to evaluate interrater reliability. The second study on LS/CMI’s interrater reliability was conducted with young offenders and included a considerably larger sample of 91 offenders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0011128710382347">Andrews et al., 2004</xref>). For this study, however, Andrews et al. report an average interval between ratings of 365.30 days. As many changes could have occurred in such a long period, it is possible for disagreement among raters to reflect objective differences between rating moments rather than poor interrater reliability.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0011128710382347">Morton (2009)</xref> recently reported the results from a study of OASys’ interrater reliability. In this study, she asked multiple assessors to complete an OASys assessment for one of three video-recorded case studies. These case studies were specifically designed for the study and were filmed with actors playing the offender roles. A random sample of 296 practitioners was identified, of which 178 participated in the study. Each of the participants was sent a DVD with one of the recorded case studies, as well as background information normally available when completing an assessment. Ultimately, approximately 60 assessors assessed each case. Although this design does not suffer from the limitations that affect the LS/CMI studies, the external validity of the study is limited. OASys is a semistructured interview, and individual probation officers have a fair amount of freedom in conducting the interview. Contrary to regular practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0011128710382347">Debidin, 2009</xref>), the design used to study OASys’ interrater reliability left probation officers no opportunity to ask their own questions or to elaborate on subjects they considered important. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0011128710382347">Morton (2009)</xref> comments on this limitation but contends that choosing this design relieves the researcher of the task of disentangling the impact of interviewing styles from the ability of OASys to produce consistent scores. Yet if interviewing style has an impact, this impact can be argued to have relevance to the use in daily practice of an offender risk assessment instrument such as OASys. As a result, the impact of interviewing style also has consequences for the interrater reliability of the instrument.</p>
<p>As a result of the limitations to research on LS/CMI’s and OASys’ interrater reliability, these studies might be overestimating or underestimating these instruments’ reliability. Given the importance of good interrater reliability for offender risk assessment, the current study set out to test the interrater reliability of the Dutch offender risk assessment instrument RISc, using a research design that would counter the limitations suffered by research on LS/CMI and OASys. In cooperation with the Dutch probation services, a study was set up to collect reassessments of approximately 80 offenders some 2 weeks after the initial assessment. Furthermore, instead of having raters judge the video-recorded case studies, the raters performing the reassessments actually interviewed the offenders and completed the reassessment independently of the other raters.</p>

<title>Measures</title>
<p><italic>RISc</italic> is based on the RNR principles and was designed to fulfill the following purposes: (1) assess an offender’s likelihood of recidivism (defined as a new conviction), (2) identify and classify offending-related needs, (3) assess an offender’s responsivity, and (4) indicate the need for further specialist assessment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0011128710382347">Adviesbureau Van Montfoort &amp; Reclassering Nederland, 2004</xref>). The results from a RISc assessment provide an offending-related needs profile that identifies the most important factors contributing to re-offending. Accordingly, RISc identifies the criminogenic needs that rehabilitation efforts should target to reduce the likelihood of reconviction. RISc is completed by trained probation officers and is used by probation services to advise the prosecutor and the court, as well as to formulate supervision and rehabilitation plans.</p>
<p>The instrument consists of 12 scored sections, each corresponding to a criminogenic risk factor: (1) offending history; (2) current offense and pattern of offences; (3) accommodation; (4) education, work, and training; (5) financial management and income; (6) relationships with partner, family, and relatives; (7) relationships with friends and acquaintances; (8) drug misuse; (9) alcohol misuse; (10) emotional well-being; (11) thinking and behavior; and (12) attitudes/orientation. Each section consists of a number of items, varying from 3 to 8; adding up to 61 items (see the <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0011128710382347">appendix</xref> for sample items). Some RISc items use a dichotomous <italic>yes/no</italic> response scale, but the majority of RISc items are scaled 0, 1, or 2, where 0 = <italic>no problems</italic>, 1 = <italic>some problems</italic>, and 2 = <italic>significant problems</italic>. RISc is scored by summing the item scores within each section, with higher scores corresponding to increased criminogenic needs. The item scores of Sections 1 and 2 are combined into one section score relating to information on offenses (both recent and older ones). Raw section scores are converted into weighted scores, recognizing that not all offending-related factors are equally correlated with the likelihood of reconviction. The weights are based on a review of empirical studies of the relative contribution of risk factors to the prediction of reconviction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0011128710382347">Adviesbureau Van Montfoort &amp; Reclassering Nederland, 2004</xref>). Weighted section scores are grouped into three levels of criminogenic needs: <italic>no criminogenic need present, criminogenic need present</italic>, and <italic>serious criminogenic need present</italic>. The likelihood of reconviction—the total RISc score—is calculated by adding together the 11 weighted section scores and is grouped into three risk categories: <italic>low risk, medium risk</italic>, and <italic>high risk</italic>.</p>
<p>At the introduction of RISc in November 2004, experienced probation officers attended a 4-day training on administering the instrument. At present, newly hired probation officers attend the 4-day training and are supervised by higher-ranking probation officers when completing their first assessments. To complete a RISc assessment, a probation worker collects all the information available in file records (such as criminal records and probation services files) and conducts an interview with the offender. Completing a RISc takes about 4 to 5 hours. This includes collecting and reading an offender’s file, conducting the offender’s interview, completing the computerized RISc, and consulting a senior probation officer to discuss the results of RISc.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0011128710382347">
<title>Participants and Procedure</title>
<p>All three Dutch probation organizations participated in the study of RISc’s interrater reliability. In total, 38 probation officers were randomly selected from the pool of certified RISc assessors. Next, these workers were randomly coupled in pairs. Each pair consisted of two probation officers from the same probation organization. The officer pairs were instructed to ask the offenders they assessed through RISc to participate in the study. If an offender agreed to participate, the probation officer provided his or her coworker with the offender’s contact details to make an appointment for a second assessment. The probation officers were instructed to plan the reassessments roughly 2 to 3 weeks after the original assessment. To ensure independence of assessments, the probation officers were instructed not to communicate with each other about the clients they assessed.</p>
<p>The study was conducted in three probation regions in the west and south of the Netherlands—Rotterdam, Alkmaar/Haarlem, and Den Bosch/Eindhoven. In each region, two researchers gave on-site instruction on the study. Furthermore, in each region a senior probation official was assigned as coordinator to supervise the data collection. The researchers met regularly with the coordinators to discuss the study’s progress and to solve any problems that occurred. The offenders signed an informed consent form and were paid €25 for a completed second RISc assessment. The Dutch Ministry of Justice fully compensated the probation organizations for the time the probation officers spent collecting the data for the study. Data were collected between November 2005 and mid-May 2006.</p>
<p>In total, 90 offenders agreed to cooperate in the study, but in five cases the probation officers administering RISc never completed one or both assessments. For seven other cases, the second assessment could not be completed because the offenders did not show up at appointments, on second thought refused to cooperate, or were transferred to a different prison. Another three assessments were excluded because they appeared to have been conducted before the start of the data collection. The final sample thus consisted of 75 offenders who were assessed twice by two different probation officers with an average time between RISc assessments of 31 days (<italic>SD</italic> = 27 days, range = 3-136 days). The majority of the study sample (86.7%) was male, and the sample had a mean age of 35.9 years (<italic>SD</italic> = 13.1 years, range = 18-73 years). A total of 45 (60.0%) offenders were of Dutch ethnic origin, 27 (36.0%) were of non-Western ethnic origin (mostly of Netherlands Antillean and Surinamese origin), and 2 (2.7%) were of Western ethnic origin (non-Dutch). One (1.3%) offender’s country of birth was unknown. At the time of the first RISc assessment, 37 (49.3%) offenders were detained and 38 (50.7%) were on parole or awaiting trial without being in custody. No significant differences were found on gender (χ<sup>2</sup>(1) = 1.44, <italic>p</italic> = .23), age (<italic>t</italic> = 1.06, <italic>df</italic> = 74, <italic>p</italic> = .29), or ethnicity (χ<sup>2</sup>(3) = 0.83, <italic>p</italic> = .84) when the interrater sample was compared with population data from a database containing all RISc assessments (independence of samples was ensured by excluding interrater RISc assessments in calculating population characteristics).</p>

<p>RISc’s interrater reliability was studied at both item level and section level and for the total score. RISc data are either nominal, with a dichotomous <italic>yes/no</italic> response (e.g., detention, drug use), or ordinal (most items, all section scores, and the total score). To study the degree of agreement between the probation officers on <italic>nominal</italic> items, coefficient κ was calculated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0011128710382347">Cohen, 1960</xref>). For the <italic>ordinal</italic> items, the section scores and the total score, the following strategy was used (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0011128710382347">Born, 1995</xref>, pp. 130-132). First, the proportion of agreement was calculated. Because this parameter lacks both a control for chance agreement and a formal test of the degree of agreement, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0011128710382347">Lawlis and Lu’s (1972)</xref> χ<sup>2</sup> was calculated next to test whether the agreement significantly differed from chance agreement. Finally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0011128710382347">Tinsley and Weiss’s (1975)</xref> value <italic>T</italic> was calculated. This index is based on Cohen’s κ and on Lawlis and Lu’s χ<sup>2</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0011128710382347">Lindell &amp; Brandt, 1999</xref>) and indicates the degree of agreement (0 = <italic>agreement does not exceed chance</italic>, 1 = <italic>perfect agreement</italic>). Since the proportion of agreement exceeded 50% for all items, the section scores, and the total score, and since χ<sup>2</sup> was significant in all cases as well, only <italic>T</italic> is reported in this article.</p>
<p>As an exception to the rule, Cohen’s κ was calculated for the ordinal items from Section 2, “Current offense and pattern of offenses”; Section 3, “Accommodation”; and Section 8, “Drug misuse.” For an offender who denies responsibility for the current offense and who has not yet been convicted, Section 2 is not completed. Similarly, a detained offender whose detention is not likely to end within the next 3 months will not be assessed with respect to accommodation. Finally, if an offender does not use drugs, the items on drug misuse are not scored, and the section is assigned a rating 0 = <italic>no criminogenic need is present</italic>. When the described circumstances applied, items from Sections 2, 3, and 8 were recoded “does not apply,” thereby changing the item rating scales from ordinal to nominal. Consequently, for the items of Sections 2, 3, and 8, Cohen’s κ was calculated instead of Tinsley and Weiss’s <italic>T</italic> value.</p>

<p>RISc sections contain 61 ordinal items.

For each section, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0011128710382347">Table 2</xref> shows the number of items in the analyses, the number of items that show at least moderate agreement between raters, and the range of either κ or <italic>T</italic> values. As <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0011128710382347">Table 2</xref> shows, interrater reliability was moderate to substantial for most items. A considerable portion of the items of Section 11, “Thinking and behavior,” and Section 12, “Attitudes/orientation,” however, showed only fair agreement. Obviously, assessing cognitive skills and attitudes is more difficult and relies more heavily on subjective assessments by the probation officers than, for example, assessing education, drug use, or financial management.</p>

<p>Because of RISc’s scoring instructions, Sections 1 and 2, “Information on offenses,” and Section 3, “Accommodation,” were not always completed, which resulted in a lower number of valid cases on these sections than on the other sections. By recoding missing values into “does not apply,” when appropriate, it was possible to analyze interrater reliability for Sections 1 and 2 and Section 3 using a larger sample size (<italic>N</italic><sub>1&amp;2</sub>= 74, <italic>N</italic><sub>3</sub> = 75). These analyses showed that the strength of agreement for these sections remained moderate (κ<sub>1&amp;2</sub> = .48, κ<sub>3</sub> = .54).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The aim of the current research was to evaluate the interrater reliability of the Dutch risk and needs assessment instrument RISc, using a design that is free from the limitations affecting research on the interrater reliability of comparable English-language instruments. The three limitations that this study wished to avoid are (1) too small sample size, (2) a (very) long period between assessments, and (3) no independent interviewing of offenders by the raters involved in the study. As for any psychological instrument, reliability is an important aspect of offender risk assessment instruments such as RISc. Prosecutors and judges take RISc’s assessment of risk of recidivism into account during an offender’s trial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0011128710382347">Andrews &amp; Dowden, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0011128710382347">Bonta, 2007</xref>); hence, the assessment of this risk should meet the strictest standards of reliability. Furthermore, rehabilitation efforts are based on the assessment of offending-related needs, and for these treatment efforts to be effective, a reliable assessment of needs is a prerequisite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0011128710382347">Andrews &amp; Bonta, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0011128710382347">Wong et al., 2007</xref>). The results from the current study revealed moderate to substantial interrater reliability for most of RISc’s items and all its sections. Moreover, substantial agreement was reached between raters on RISc’s total score. The results therefore indicate that, in general, probation officers independently reach more or less the same conclusions on the presence of criminogenic needs and on the risk of reconviction when rating the same offender. This, in turn, means that the information given to judges and prosecutors is largely free from rater bias, thereby contributing to a fair trial. Similarly, the possibilities for effective need-based offender rehabilitation are promoted by reliable needs assessment.</p>
<p>Although the current study set out to test RISc’s interrater reliability in a way that avoided the limitations suffered by research on LS/CMI and OASys, this goal was not fully met. As none of the researchers who were involved in this study work in probation services, it was not possible to control the data collection to the extent that would have been preferable. Although regular meetings were held with the probation officials coordinating the data collection, a number of difficulties were encountered. First, because of other priorities within probation services, data collection proceeded slower than expected. This resulted in a slightly lower number of study participants than the study aimed for. Second, the mean time between interviews was longer than intended: on average 31 days instead of the desired 2 to 3 weeks. During the period between assessments, actual changes in offenders’ situations could have occurred, and this, in turn, may have led to poorer interrater reliability results. RISc, however, assesses criminogenic needs that, in order to change them, are believed to warrant behavioral interventions. Thus, this implies that it is highly unlikely for these factors to change spontaneously over a period of 31 days. Therefore, although this study suffered from limitations, these limitations appear to be minor ones.</p>
<p>As RISc is based on OASys and both instruments are highly comparable, it is interesting to see whether the different designs that were used to study both instruments’ interrater reliability yielded different results. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0011128710382347">Morton (2009)</xref> concluded that the overall interrater reliability of OASys was moderate while concluding that the consistency for the total OASys score was good. With regard to the total score, interrater reliabilities for RISc and OASys are comparable. When compared at the level of sections, however, RISc comes out somewhat better than OASys, with RISc sections’ reliability ranging from moderate to substantial. Furthermore, a comparison of the interrater reliabilities of OASys’ and RISc’s dynamic risk sections reveals considerable differences between both instruments. The most reliable OASys sections are accommodation, drug misuse, and lifestyle and associates (corresponding to RISc’s Section 7, “Relationships with friends and acquaintances”; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0011128710382347">Morton, 2009</xref>). Moderately reliable OASys sections include attitudes, relationships (corresponding with RISc’s Section 6, “Relationships with partner, family, and relatives”), emotional well-being, and education, training, and employability (ETE; corresponding with RISc’s Section 4, “Education, work and training”) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0011128710382347">Morton, 2009</xref>). The least reliable OASys sections are alcohol misuse, financial management, and thinking and behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0011128710382347">Morton, 2009</xref>). In contrast, all RISc sections showed at least moderate reliability. In addition, the most reliable RISc sections were drug misuse, alcohol misuse, emotional well-being, financial management, and relationships with friends and acquaintances; two of these sections were among OASys’ poorest while OASys’ emotional well-being only showed moderate interrater reliability.</p>
<p>The differences between RISc and OASys in interrater reliability are striking since both instruments are very similar. The most obvious conclusion is that the different designs used to study interrater reliability explain a great deal of these divergent results, but the real question is what practical implications this might have. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0011128710382347">Morton (2009)</xref> suggested that interview styles might influence results. However, instead of leading to difficulties interpreting results, taking account of interview styles might actually have resulted in better interrater reliability. This suggests that differences in interview styles do not lead raters to reach different conclusions on offender risk and needs. Therefore, despite the limitations of the current study, these results can serve to strengthen the confidence of both practitioners and offenders in risk and needs assessments that are based on offender risk assessment instruments.</p>
