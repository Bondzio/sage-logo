<abstract>
<p>Aortic dissection is a potentially catastrophic disease with significant mortality and morbidity. Presentations are often atypical and the physician needs to have a high index of suspicion and low threshold to work up these cases. Ultrasound use in the emergency department is becoming an important tool for physicians and can expedite care in many ways. The authors describe the case of a 55-year-old man with uncontrolled hypertension, who presented to the emergency department with acute chest pain radiating to the back and abdomen. A bedside cardiac ultrasound done by the emergency medicine resident showed a flap in the descending thoracic aorta with a preserved ejection fraction and no evidence of a pericardial effusion. Appropriate management was started with intravenous esmolol and nitroprusside and based on the seriousness of the ultrasound findings, a computed tomography scan was done immediately, which revealed a Stanford type B dissection extending from the aortic arch down to the left common and external iliac arteries with a likely area of infarction in the left kidney. The patient was admitted to the cardiovascular intensive care unit and a stent was placed in his left renal artery. He was subsequently discharged home in a stable condition with adequate blood pressure control. The case presentation is followed by a discussion on the diagnosis and management of acute aortic dissection, and the importance of point-of-care ultrasonography in the emergency department is also highlighted.</p>

</p>
<p>Point-of-care or bedside ultrasonography is quickly emerging as a diagnostic tool used by many physicians for diagnostic purposes, procedural assistance, as well as for initiating and expediting treatment. One of the more well-described diagnostic applications for bedside ultrasound is the detection of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1944451611433357">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1944451611433357">3</xref></sup> In fact, it is the initial diagnostic test of choice in unstable patients with a suspected ruptured AAA, because of its ability to be performed at the bedside and stave off a potentially fatal trip to the radiology suite. Over the past decade, the physicians performing the ultrasound exams have gained more experience, and the machines being used have become increasingly better in terms of image acquisition. These advances have enabled physicians facile with ultrasound use to expand the scope of ultrasonography as a diagnostic tool, especially with acute aortic catastrophes. Not only can ultrasonography detect AAA with remarkable accuracy,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1944451611433357">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1944451611433357">5</xref></sup> recent case reports suggest that it can also be used as adjunct to physical examination as well as a first-line diagnostic modality in the detection of the rare syndrome of aortic occlusion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1944451611433357">6</xref></sup> In this report, we describe the utilization of bedside transthoracic echocardiography and abdominal ultrasound as a means to detect an acute aortic dissection (AD). This rapid detection of the patient’s underlying diagnosis greatly expedited both initiation of therapy and time to definitive diagnostic testing and care.</p>

<title>Case Report</title>
<p>A 55-year-old man presented to our emergency department (ED) with acute onset chest pain. His past medical history was pertinent for uncontrolled hypertension secondary to noncompliance with medications. His social history was positive for tobacco and marijuana use as well as heavy alcohol use. His chest pain started suddenly early morning while he was smoking marijuana, and he described it as a continuous pressure and tightness, associated with mild shortness of breath and diaphoresis, rated as 8/10. He presented to the ED about 4 to 5 hours after the onset of his symptoms. He noticed that while he was walking, his pain increased and started radiating to the middle of his back, slowly going down the back, and later on he felt it in his lower abdominal area. He denied any history of prior chest pain, neither at rest nor on exertion, and he had no symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection, no hemoptysis, and he had no risk factors for venous thromboembolism. In the ED triage area, his blood pressure was 192/109 mm Hg, pulse was 68 beats per minute, respiratory rate was 18 per minute, temperature was 36.4°C, and oxygen saturation was 96% on room air. Given the patient’s symptoms and elevated blood pressure, he was moved to the high-acuity area and was seen by a resident physician within 20 minutes of arrival. Physical examination revealed normal heart sounds, with no murmurs, bilaterally equal breath sounds, no jugular venous distention, soft, nontender abdomen, and no evidence to suggest deep venous thrombosis on lower extremity examination. Pulses in the upper and lower extremities were equal and blood pressure was 164/99 mm Hg in the left arm and 162/97 mm Hg in the right arm. His electrocardiogram showed a normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 63 beats per minute, left axis deviation, incomplete right bundle branch block, left anterior fascicular block, as well as left ventricular hypertrophy. The emergency medicine resident’s differential included acute coronary syndrome, AD, and pulmonary embolism as potential devastating entities that required further evaluation. A chest radiograph showed no acute cardiopulmonary findings and no mediastinal widening. Blood work, including a complete blood count, serum electrolytes, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, coagulation profile, troponin, brain natriuretic peptide, as well as a urinalysis and urine toxicology screen was requested. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest with intravenous contrast was ordered, and the patient was given nitroglycerine sublingual 0.4 mg times 3, along with 1 mg of hydromorphone intravenously, with adequate pain control.</p>
<p>One hour after his arrival to the ED, a bedside cardiac ultrasound done by the emergency medicine resident showed a flap in the descending thoracic aorta on the parasternal long-axis view (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1944451611433357">Figure 1</xref>), with a preserved ejection fraction and no evidence of pericardial effusion, and an aortic root diameter of 3.4 cm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1944451611433357">Figure 2</xref>). A suprasternal notch view showed a flap in the distal aortic arch and proximal descending thoracic aorta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1944451611433357">Figure 3</xref>). An abdominal ultrasound showed a flap extending throughout the entire length of the abdominal aorta down to the bifurcation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1944451611433357">Figures 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1944451611433357">5</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1944451611433357">6</xref>). At this time, the result of the patient’s creatinine was not yet known. Given the ultrasonographic findings, an arterial line was placed and the patient was started on esmolol and nitroprusside intravenous drips, which were titrated to achieve a systolic blood pressure of 100 mm Hg. After we explained to the patient the seriousness of the ultrasound findings and the benefit in proceeding to CT immediately regardless of his serum creatinine, he elected to proceed with the CT scan, which revealed a Stanford type B aortic dissection extending from the aortic arch down to the left common and external iliac arteries with a likely area of infarction in the left kidney (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1944451611433357">Figures 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1944451611433357">8</xref>). Vascular surgery was consulted from the ED and recommended adequate blood pressure, pulse, and pain control. The patient was subsequently admitted to the cardiovascular ICU. A formal transthoracic echocardiograph done the following day showed an ejection fraction of 57%, with no wall motion abnormalities, and also visualized the type B aortic dissection. A stent was placed in the left renal artery, and he was discharged home in a stable condition on hospital day 12 with prescriptions for aspirin 81 mg daily, clopidogrel 75 mg daily, labetalol 800 mg thrice a day, and amlodipine 10 mg daily. His serum creatinine levels on admission and discharge were 1.9 and 2.1 mg/dL, respectively. His urine toxicology screen was positive for cocaine, but he denied using it on the day of admission, stating that his last use was several days prior. On follow-up, 6 weeks after his initial presentation, he remains compliant with his medications, is trying to quit smoking, still drinks alcohol, and occasionally smokes marijuana.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The precipitating factor in AD is a tear in the aortic intima possibly secondary to cystic medial necrosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1944451611433357">7</xref></sup> A false lumen is created when blood dissects through the tear, into the aortic media, separating the intima from the media and/or adventitia. Dissection can extend both proximally and distally, involving the aortic valve, major blood vessels, and the pericardial space.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1944451611433357">8</xref></sup> This propagation is responsible for many of the associated clinical manifestations, including ischemia (coronary, cerebral, spinal, or visceral), aortic regurgitation, and cardiac tamponade. It is worth noting that the latter 2 conditions are readily detectable by point-of-care ultrasound. The incidence of AD varies from 2.6 to 3.5 per 100 000 person-years, usually affecting 60- to 80-year-old men.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1944451611433357">9</xref></sup> Risk factors are numerous, including hypertension, atherosclerosis, preexisting aortic aneurysm, vasculitis, collagen disorders (eg, Marfan syndrome, Ehlers–Danlos syndrome), bicuspid aortic valve, congenital defects in the aortic wall, coarctation, Turner syndrome, coronary artery bypass grafting, previous aortic valve replacement, trauma, high-intensity weight lifting, and crack cocaine.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1944451611433357">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1944451611433357">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>Ascending ADs are almost twice as common as descending dissections,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1944451611433357">7</xref></sup> with isolated abdominal ADs being quite rare.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1944451611433357">16</xref></sup> There are 3 different variants of AD, which collectively are now referred to as acute aortic syndromes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1944451611433357">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1944451611433357">18</xref></sup> The first is an intimal tear without hematoma where an intimal tear is associated with exposure of the underlying media or adventitial, with no progression or separation of the medial layers. The second is an aortic intramural hematoma where blood is present in the wall of the aorta in the absence of an intimal tear. The third is a penetrating atherosclerotic ulcer, which often complicates an aortic hematoma, leading to dissection or perforation.</p>
<p>Periaortic hematoma reflects slow oozing from the dissecting aorta, implying impending rupture. In a review of 971 patients with acute dissections from the International Registry of Acute Aortic Dissections (IRAD), 227 (23%) had a periaortic hematoma. It is associated with higher rates of shock, cardiac tamponade, acute encephalopathy and also portends a higher mortality than in patients without periaortic hematoma.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1944451611433357">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>The initial presentation of AD is usually a severe, sharp or tearing anterior chest pain (in ascending AD), or posterior chest, back pain, or abdominal pain (in descending AD), and can radiate anywhere in the thorax or abdomen. The pain can occur alone or can be associated with syncope, stroke symptoms, myocardial infarction, decompensated heart failure, and a variety of other clinical signs and symptoms.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1944451611433357">19</xref></sup> Syncope is almost always associated with proximal (Stanford type A) dissection and with an increased incidence of cardiac tamponade and stroke.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1944451611433357">20</xref></sup> Acute hypertension is more common in descending (Stanford type B) dissections.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1944451611433357">19</xref></sup> Some of the less commonly presenting complications from AD include Horner syndrome from compression of the superior cervical sympathetic ganglion, vocal cord paralysis, and hoarseness from compression of the left recurrent laryngeal nerve.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1944451611433357">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>The differential diagnosis of AD is wide and includes myocardial ischemia, pericarditis, pulmonary embolus, aortic regurgitation without dissection, aortic aneurysm without dissection, musculoskeletal pain, mediastinal tumors, pleurisy, Boerhaave’s syndrome, cholecystitis, atherosclerotic or cholesterol embolism, and peptic ulcer disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1944451611433357">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>As is often the case with the elderly, these patients are less likely to present with abrupt onset of pain, pulse deficit, or a murmur of aortic regurgitation. They have higher rates of atherosclerosis, prior aortic aneurysm, idiopathic dissection, and intramural hematoma. They are less likely to undergo surgery and have a higher mortality with either surgery or medical therapy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1944451611433357">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>In an IRAD review of 464 patients, the electrocardiogram was normal in 31%, had nonspecific ST and T wave changes in 42%, ischemic changes in 15%, and ST segment elevation myocardial infarction in 5%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1944451611433357">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>In an ideal scenario, advanced imaging is not performed until the patient has been stabilized. In reviewing the IRAD data, the initial imaging study was a CT in 61% of the patients, transesophageal echocardiography in 33%, aortography in 4%, and magnetic resonance imaging in 2%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1944451611433357">19</xref></sup> The chest radiograph data showed mediastinal widening in 63% with type A dissections, with pleural effusion present in 19% of cases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1944451611433357">19</xref></sup> Other less sensitive chest radiograph findings are widening of the aortic contour, aortic kinking, displaced calcification, and opacification of the aorticopulmonary window.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1944451611433357">19</xref></sup> Because of the limited sensitivity of chest radiography, additional imaging studies are obtained in nearly all patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1944451611433357">19</xref></sup> CT angiography has a sensitivity, and specificity that varies from 83% to 98% and from 87% to 100%, respectively. Its advantages include availability, identification of intraluminal thrombus, pericardial effusion, and other potential etiologies mentioned in the differential diagnosis above. The main disadvantage is potentially nephrotoxic iodinated contrast and transporting a potentially unstable patient to the radiology suite.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1944451611433357">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>Magnetic resonance angiography is both accurate and noninvasive, showing the presence of a double lumen with an intimal flap. Disadvantages are inconvenience, limited availability, cost, and nephrogenic systemic fibrosis in stage IV or V kidney disease, especially in hemodialysis patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1944451611433357">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>Transthoracic echocardiography is unable to reliably visualize the distal ascending aorta and the aortic arch, thus limiting its use as a definitive diagnostic test. It is most useful for the assessment of aortic insufficiency, pericardial effusion/tamponade, and left ventricular systolic function, as well as an initial screening tool as in our patient.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1944451611433357">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>Transesophageal echocardiography has the advantage of the close proximity of the esophagus to the thoracic aorta and absence of an intervening lung or chest wall. The true and false lumens, thrombosis in the false lumen, pericardial effusion, aortic regurgitation, and proximal coronary arteries are readily visualized. Disadvantages include procedural sedation, and the operator dependent nature of the test.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1944451611433357">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1944451611433357">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>Another way to use diagnostic ultrasound in the evaluation of a patient with a suspected AD is for the physician to perform a screening exam of the aorta at the bedside. Since dissection can involve any part of the aorta from the root to the bifurcation a combined transthoracic and transabdominal approach is necessary. One method to accomplish this is to use 4 imaging windows: suprasternal, parasternal, epigastric, and periumbilical.</p>
<p>The primary use of the suprasternal view is to examine the aortic arch and the great vessels. A low-frequency, phased array transducer should be placed at the suprasternal notch with the patient’s head extended and if necessary, rotated to the left or right to optimize transducer placement in this relatively small area. The indicator should be pointed toward the left shoulder to provide a view where the imaging plane is parallel to the aortic arch (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1944451611433357">Figure 3</xref>). Additionally, to provide optimal resolution of the great vessels, the depth should be decreased relative to a typical cardiac exam.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1944451611433357">26</xref>(pp107-111)</sup></p>
<p>The next imaging window should be obtained using the same low-frequency, phased array transducer in the left parasternal location. Typically, the probe will need to be placed either the third, fourth, or fifth interspace with the indicator pointed toward the patient’s right shoulder in order to obtain a parasternal long-axis view of the heart (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1944451611433357">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1944451611433357">2</xref>). The depth will need to be adjusted (usually increased) in order to image to the level of the descending thoracic aorta. In this single imaging plane both the aortic root and descending thoracic aorta can be imaged simultaneously.<sup>26(pp645-653)</sup> Aneurysm of the thoracic aorta (diameter &gt;4 cm) can be detected using this imaging plane. Another advantage to this view is that the 2 most feared complications of acute AD (cardiac tamponade and acute aortic insufficiency) can also be visualized by the examiner.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1944451611433357">27</xref></sup></p>
<p>The third location to assess is the proximal and middle aorta, which can be visualized transabdominally over the epigastrium. For this part of the exam, the low-frequency, curvilinear probe should be used to take advantage of the large footprint. Ideally, one would attempt to obtain both transverse and longitudinal image of the proximal and middle portions of the abdominal aorta (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1944451611433357">Figures 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1944451611433357">5</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1944451611433357">6</xref>). This is the traditional imaging modality used at the bedside to exclude abdominal aortic aneurysm, defined as diameter &gt;3 cm. If an abnormality suggestive of a dissection is seen such as a linear band with similar echogenicity to the walls of the vessel, color flow Doppler can be used to assess for flow around such a finding.</p>
<p>Finally, the same probe should be moved in a caudal direction to the periumbilical area in order to image the distal abdominal aorta and the bifurcation. As with the previous location, both transverse and longitudinal images should be obtained. The scan should be carried out to the bifurcation and an attempt to identify the common iliac vessels should be made as AD can often affect these vessels as well.</p>
<p>Although bedside ultrasound performed by the physician is an excellent screening tool for aortic disease and should serve as an adjunct to the physical exam in any patient with suspected AD, there are of course limitations to this modality. One of them is operator experience. In its 2009 Policy Statement on Emergency Ultrasound, the American College of Emergency Physicians committee suggested that “the performance of at least 150 ultrasound examinations in critical, or life-saving scenarios promotes a minimum, acceptable level of exposure.” Clearly, to achieve this basic level of proficiency the physician must be dedicated to incorporating bedside ultrasound into the daily management of patients. Body habitus is often cited as a limiting factor to acquiring good ultrasound images. Obesity is very common but can be overcome by decreasing the frequency and also using continuous harmonic imaging. Emphysematous lung disease is a difficulty that when encountered can be more difficult to overcome than obesity. Strategies to compensate include using the patient’s respiratory cycle to your advantage (end inspiratory, or end expiratory holds as necessary) and also using subcostal or subxiphoid imaging windows of the heart as opposed to the transthoracic window. This latter adjustment will improve the views of the heart, but may lead to a suboptimal view of the thoracic aorta compared with the parasternal long-axis view. Other impediments to bedside ultrasound are cost (not all departments have made the financial commitment to purchasing ultrasound machines for physician use), availability (machines are often in use by other providers), and the quality of the machine (the images in our case were obtained with a Zonare z.one ultra convertible ultrasound).</p>
<p>Management in the ED entails airway control (for airway compromise or impending hemodynamic demise), analgesia, intravenous beta-blockade to reduce the heart rate below 60 beats per minute and systolic blood pressure to 100 to 120 mm Hg or the lowest level tolerated. This can be achieved with propranolol, labetalol, or esmolol, with the latter preferable in the acute setting, because of its short half-life and ability to be titrated. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or intravenous nicardipine, verapamil, or diltiazem, are alternatives in patients who cannot tolerate beta-blockers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1944451611433357">17</xref></sup> Patients can be switched to oral therapy after heart rate and blood pressure control has been achieved. If systolic blood pressure remains &gt;100 to 120 mm Hg, intravenous sodium nitroprusside should be added. Nitroprusside should not be used without concomitant beta-blockade, and hydralazine should be avoided because of their potential to induce reflex tachycardia and increase in shear stress.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1944451611433357">17</xref></sup> Inotropic agents should be avoided secondary to an increase in aortic shear stress. The treating physician should keep in mind that hypotension in patients with AD can have a number of etiologies, including acute blood loss, hemopericardium with tamponade, or cardiac failure. If cardiac tamponade with hemodynamic instability is present, a pericardiocentesis should be attempted; however, it may accelerate bleeding and shock.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1944451611433357">28</xref></sup> Bedside transesophageal echocardiography is the diagnostic test of choice in hemodynamically unstable patients with CT, magnetic resonance imaging, or angiography reserved for more stable patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1944451611433357">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>In terms of definitive management, acute dissections involving the ascending aorta are considered a surgical emergency, whereas descending aorta dissections are treated medically unless there is perfusion compromise, presence within an aneurysm, or continued hemorrhage from a presumed aortic rupture.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1944451611433357">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1944451611433357">22</xref></sup> Dissections of the ascending aorta carry a mortality rate of 1% to 2% per hour after symptom onset. The survival benefit from surgery is illustrated in an IRAD review of 547 patients with a type A dissection, of whom 80% were treated surgically. The in-hospital mortality was 27% and 56% for surgical and medical therapies, respectively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1944451611433357">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1944451611433357">30</xref></sup> Surgical therapy entails excision of the intimal tear, interposition of a synthetic vascular graft to reconstitute the aorta, and restoration of aortic valve competence if there is significant aortic insufficiency. Two independent predictors of surgical mortality are an age ≥70 years and hypotension or shock on admission.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1944451611433357">31</xref></sup> Medical therapy focuses on lowering the blood pressure and aortic shear stress to decrease the propagation of the dissection. Long-term survival rate for descending ADs is 60% to 80% at 4 to 5 years and 40% to 45% at 10 years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1944451611433357">32</xref></sup> Spontaneous healing of the dissection, with disappearance of the false lumen due to complete thrombosis, is uncommon.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1944451611433357">33</xref></sup> Based on the IRAD database, survival rates at 1, 3, 5, and 10 years were 96%, 91%, 68%, and 52%, respectively. It is worth noting that survival is similar in type A and type B dissection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1944451611433357">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1944451611433357">35</xref></sup></p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Patients presenting with signs and symptoms potentially consistent with acute AD require a thorough and expedited evaluation. The majority of these patients will require some form of advanced imaging (CT, transesophageal echocardiography, magnetic resonance angiography) to make a definitive diagnosis and to determine therapy. However, given the multitude of symptoms that can be present in patients with AD, it is important to stratify patients in terms of both acuity (via a thorough hemodynamic assessment of preload, afterload, and contractility) and also likelihood of having the disease. In our case report, we describe how point-of-care cardiac and abdominal aortic ultrasound can serve as a risk stratification tool and lead to an expedited evaluation. This test can be performed at the bedside, by the treating physician, and as was the case with our patient, can lead to the initiation of potentially life-saving therapy prior to definitive diagnostic testing. We feel that this case is another in a long line of examples demonstrating why physicians treating undifferentiated patients in an acute care setting such as the ED should have point-of-care ultrasound as a tool in their armamentarium.</p>
