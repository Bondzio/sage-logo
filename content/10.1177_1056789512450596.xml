<p>This study investigated the effects of composite repair patches and number of patch layers on the fatigue behavior of surface-notched composite pipes. The pipes were repaired using glass/epoxy composite patches of two to seven layers. Failure modes were examined and <italic>S-N</italic> curves were plotted. Fatigue tests showed that the fatigue life of the repaired pipes was improved by increasing the number of patch layers. The seven-layer composite patch was most effective in preventing fatigue failure and increasing the fatigue life of the surface-notched pipes.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1056789512450596" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Fiber composite materials are becoming an essential element in major technologies. The mechanical behavior of these materials has been the subject of many research works that used both experiments and numerical simulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1056789512450596">Zako and Uetsuji, 2002</xref>). Compared with many conventional materials (such as steel and aluminum), fiber or particle-reinforced composites offer prominent features such as low density, high strength-to-weight ratio, high stiffness, high toughness, improved creep resistance, enhanced wear resistance, superior environmental durability, custom microstructure-morphology, preferred directionality, and so on (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1056789512450596">Ju and Yanase, 2009</xref>). Fiber-reinforced polymeric composites (also called fiber-reinforced plastics (FRPs)) have gained acceptance for use in many industries including aerospace, automotive, infrastructure, and recently oil and gas. A recent application of fiber-reinforced polymeric composites for the oil and gas industry involves the repair of pipelines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1056789512450596">Goertzen and Kessler, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Due to the fact that many pipelines are reaching the end of their 40- to 50-year operational lifetime, many of them have to be repaired for corrosion defects or dents to continue operation before finally being replaced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1056789512450596">Shouman, 2010</xref>). Adhesive-bonded patching is one of the most widely used repair techniques to cracked or damaged metallic and composite structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1056789512450596">Baker, 1984</xref>).</p>
<p>Repairs made with FRP materials offer distinct advantages over traditional welded repairs in addition to reduced cost. Primary benefits associated with FRP piping repair systems include: (1) The short amount of time needed to complete a repair, (2) The undisrupted fluid transmission in the piping system while the repair is made, and (3) Explosion potential is eliminated since no welding or cutting of the pipeline is required (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1056789512450596">Duell et al., 2008</xref>). An industry analysis showed that, on average, composite repair systems are 24% cheaper than welded sleeve repairs and 73% cheaper than replacing the damaged section of pipe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1056789512450596">Koch et al., 2001</xref>). In addition, since FRPs do not oxidize, further external corrosion of the pipe is arrested, even for through-wall defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1056789512450596">Cuthill, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1056789512450596">Baker (1997)</xref> pioneered the researches relative to bonded composite repair at the Aeronautical and Maritime Research Laboratory for the Royal Australian Air Force. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1056789512450596">Goertzen and Kessler (2007</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1056789512450596">Duell et al.

<p>In this study, the fatigue behavior of surface-notched glass/epoxy composite pipes was investigated experimentally. Surface-notched composite pipes were repaired using two- to seven-layer glass/epoxy composite patches. Composite pipes were subjected to cyclic internal pressure to investigate the effectiveness of the repair. While performing fatigue tests, un-notched, notched-unrepaired, and notched-repaired pipe specimens were used.</p>

<p>The composite pipes used in the study which have six layers were 1 m in length, with an inside diameter of 72 mm, and average wall thickness of 2.3 mm. The pipes were cured first at 135 °C for 2 h and then at 150 °C for another 2 h. The pipes were cut to 300 mm lengths with a diamond-wheel cutting saw. Burn-off tests were performed according to the ASTM D 2584 standard. The fiber volume ratio of the pipe was found to be 0.51. The mechanical properties of the composite pipes were determined by S<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1056789512450596">amancı (2004)</xref> using static internal pressure tests according to the ASTM D 2992 standard. These properties are as given below: Young’s modulus in hoop direction <italic>E</italic><sub>θ</sub> = 23.1 GPa, hoop strength <italic>σ</italic><sub>θ</sub> = 405 MPa, and Poisson’s ratio ν<italic><sub>r</sub></italic><sub>θ</sub> = 0.8.</p>
<p>Axially-oriented surface notches were machined on the pipes using a diamond grinding-disc of 1 mm thickness. Notch aspect ratio was <italic>a/c</italic> = 0.2 and notch-to-thickness ratio was <italic>a/t</italic> = 0.75, where <italic>a</italic> is the notch depth, 2<italic>c</italic> is the notch length, and <italic>t</italic> is the wall thickness of the pipe.</p>
<p>The surfaces of the pipes were ground and cleaned using acetone prior to repairing. Patch repairs were performed using the wet lay-up technique. The composite repair patches had between two and seven layers. E-glass woven roving was used as the reinforcement material for the patches; epoxy was used as the matrix material as also used in the composite pipes.</p>
<p>Burn-off tests were performed and the fiber volume ratio of the composite patch was measured as 0.30. Static tensile tests of composite patches were conducted according to the ASTM D 3039 standard. Test samples 2-, 3-, 4-, 5-, and 6-layer composite specimens of 25 × 250 mm in size were prepared by hand lay-up technique for this test. The mechanical properties of the composite patch were Young’s modulus <italic>E</italic><sub>θ</sub> = 22 GPa, ultimate hoop strength <italic>σ</italic><sub>θ</sub> = 292 MPa, and Poisson’s ratio <italic>ν<sub>r</sub></italic><sub>θ</sub> = 0.16.</p>
<p>The width of the composite patch, <italic>w</italic><sub>p</sub> = 100 mm and average thickness of a single layer, <italic>t</italic><sub>p</sub> = 0.25 mm. Composite patches were wrapped on the surface-notched composite pipes. The wrapping process was started from the opposite side to the surface notch region and performed carefully in order to avoid trapping air between layers. Patched composite pipes were cured at 120 °C for 3 h.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1056789512450596"><title>Experimental procedure</title>
<p>Fatigue tests were carried out on surface-notched composite pipes repaired by composite patches, according to the ASTM D 2992 standard. Tests were also carried out on the un-notched and the notched-unrepaired specimens. A PLC-controlled fatigue test machine was used to perform the tests. Composite pipes were subjected to cyclic loading under open-ended internal pressure conditions. Stress ratio, <italic>R</italic> was 0.05 and frequency <italic>f</italic> was 0.416 Hz (25 cycles per min) in all tests. Specimens were subjected to internal pressure at 35% (140 MPa), 40% (161 MPa), and 45% (181 MPa) of static internal burst pressure. Damage progression was observed until final failure occurred. The number of cycles was recorded during whitening, leakage and final failure were observed.</p>

<sec id="sec6-1056789512450596"><title>Failure analysis of the un-notched and notched-unrepaired specimens</title>
<p>Axial stress did not occur in pipes because fatigue tests were performed under open-ended conditions. It was observed that pipe diameter increases while pipe length decreases under loading. All specimens showed whitening, leakage and final failure damage types. Whitening was the first damage type that occurred in the un-notched specimen caused by fiber/matrix debonding and delamination. This damage propagated parallel to the fiber direction. Micro-cracks formed at the fiber intersection points due to friction and shear effects. Leakage started after micro-cracks had propagated from inner surface to the outer surface of the pipe. Final damage occurred in the region with increased whitening damage by breaking fibers at winding directions.</p>
<p>Whitening was the first damage type observed in notched specimens and occurred in the notch region due to fiber/matrix debonding and delamination. As the number of cycle increased, the whitening region extended in the fiber directions of fiber orientation. Crack formation was not observed on notch tips till the final failure. Micro-cracks propagated from inner surface to the notch depth after micro-cracks had formed at the fiber intersection points.</p>
<p>As the number of cycles increased, it was observed that leakage arrived from the notch depth to the surface subsequently developing into a liquid jet. Fiber fractures occurred in the notch region due to resulting reduction in fiber strength. Final failure occurred after the liquid jet and fiber fracture increased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1056789512450596">Günaydın, 2010</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-1056789512450596"><title>Failure analysis of repaired specimens</title>
<p>Pressurized oil flowing through a fracture in the notch depth passed over the notch spacing between the pipe and the patch and penetrated the interface of the pipe and the patch resulting in debonding of the pipe and the patch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1056789512450596">Figure 1</xref>) (Günaydın, 2010). Fiber/matrix debonding and delamination occurred in the patch. This behavior can be seen as whitening in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1056789512450596">Figure 2(a)</xref>. The area of whitening damage was largest in the four-layer patched specimen. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1056789512450596">Figure 2(b)</xref> shows that fiber/matrix debonding and delamination occurred in the region without patching. This damage was observed in 5-, 6-, and 7-layer patched specimens.

</fig></p>
<p>Due to repetitive loads, shear and friction occurred between crossed fibers in the patch leading to the formation of microcracks in the fibers. These cracks formed at the intersection regions of the fibers and were parallel to the fibers. By increasing the number of cycles, the microcracks propagated from inner surface to the outer surface, and pressurized oil that penetrated between the pipe and the patch bled over the outer patch surface. At maximum pressure value leakage occurred and the pressure then decreased to the minimum value and the leakage stopped. The leak region expanded due to the propagation of micro cracks, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1056789512450596">Figure 3</xref>.
<fig id="fig3-1056789512450596" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>Leakage region expanded by propagation of microcracks.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1056789512450596-fig3.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>The patch debonded from the pipe and inflated in the radial direction due to the oil pressure in the notch spacing. As the number of patch layers increased, the inflated region expanded in the radial direction for 2-, 3-, and 4-layer patched specimens. The largest inflated region was observed in four-layer patched specimen. As pressure value increased, this region expanded.</p>
<p>Increased pressure resulted in further propagation of matrix cracks in the axial direction and a larger number of broken patch fibers. Broken fibers were arranged in hoop direction. Leakage started as a single-point liquid jet and on subsequent cycles, into multi-point jets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1056789512450596">Figure 4(a) and (b)</xref>). When the pressure reached its maximum value, a liquid jet was observed and the patch started to inflate in the radial direction. When pressure decreased to the minimum value, leakage stopped and the patch returned into its original form. A liquid jet was observed periodically until the final failure occurred. Final failure took the form of tearing in the patch.

</fig></p>
<p>Final failure in the specimens repaired using two- to six-layer patches occurred in the patched region. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1056789512450596">Figure 5(a)</xref> shows tearing in the two-layer patch.

</fig></p>
<p>Strength increase in the notched regions was observed mostly in the 5, 6, and 7-layer patches. In these specimens, damage started as whitening in the 2, 3, and 4-layer patched specimens, but the damage growth took different forms. Due to the greater number of patch layers in the 5, 6, and 7-layer patched specimens, whitening, leakage, and final failure occurred after a higher number of cycles and the inflation rate of the patch was lower than in the other patch types. In these specimens, damage occurred in both patched and unpatched regions. Fiber/matrix debonding and delamination occurred in the unpatched region. Whitening, leakage, and fiber breakups were observed in the five- and six-layer patched specimens, but the seven-layer patched specimen showed reduced leakage and no liquid jet. As the number of the patch layers increased, damaged area extended into the unpatched region. The widest area of whitening in unpatched region occurred in the seven-layer patched specimen. Final failure of seven-layer patched specimen was observed in the unpatched region as a tear after whitening concentration increased and fibers broke as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1056789512450596">Figure 5(b)</xref>.</p>

<sec id="sec8-1056789512450596"><title>S-N Curves</title>
<p><italic>S-N</italic> curves based on initiation of whitening and leakage of the repaired specimens are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1056789512450596">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1056789512450596">7</xref>, respectively. These figures demonstrate that the number of cycles of failure initiation reduced as applied hoop stresses increased. In addition, the failure initiation cycles decreased as the number of patch layers decreased.

<p>Curves for applied hoop stress versus the number of final failure cycle (burst cycle) were plotted for all specimens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1056789512450596">Figure 8</xref>). As seen in this figure, the notched-unrepaired specimen had a shorter fatigue life than the others. Fatigue life of the notched specimens was increased by increasing the number of composite patch layers. Also, the fatigue life of the repaired specimens increased as hoop stress decreased. The lifespan of the specimen repaired by five-layer patch was longer than that of the un-notched specimen. The fatigue life of the notched specimen increased 8 times with the 2-layer patch, 11 times with the 3-layer patch, 19 times with the 4-layer patch, 28 times with the 5-layer patch, 63 times with the 6-layer patch, and 80 times with the 7-layer patch.
