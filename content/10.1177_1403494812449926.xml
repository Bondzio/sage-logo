<title>Aim:</title>
<p>To analyse how health risk behaviours (HRB) are clustered and associated with parental background and family wealth among Swedish boys and girls.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1403494812449926">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>Data were collected from Health Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC), a global cross-sectional survey for 1997/98, 2001/02, and 2005/06. A total of 11,972 boys and girls in grades 5, 7, and 9 participated in the study. The pupils were categorised in subgroups according to parental background: Swedish (80.0%), mixed (10.6%), and foreign (9.4%). Cluster analyses were used to identify HRB profiles. Multinomial logistic regression analysis was used to estimate associations between cluster allocation, parental background, and family affluence.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1403494812449926">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>In total 11,232 pupils were identified and allocated to five cluster profiles, half of them in the cluster profile of low-risk behaviour. The most disadvantaged cluster was multiple HRB, which was characterised by high prevalence of smoking, drunkenness, low physical activity, and high soft-drink consumption. The cluster profile of multiple HRB was associated with both mixed background and foreign background in girls and with mixed background in boys. The cluster profile of inadequate tooth brushing was associated with foreign background in both boys and girls. The cluster profiles of multiple HRB and inadequate tooth brushing were associated with low family affluence in girls.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1403494812449926">
<title>Conclusions:</title>
<p><bold>The cluster profiles of multiple HRB and inadequate tooth brushing were associated with parental foreign extraction in boys and girls and with low family affluence in girls. Prevention programmes based on identified clusters of HRB, including consideration of impact of socio-demographic indicators, are needed</bold>.</p>

<title>Background</title>
<p>The adolescence period includes challenging normative behaviours, identity formation, and autonomy from the parents, which for some also might include experimenting with tobacco, alcohol, diet, hygiene habits, and physical activity as well as other positive health and risk behaviours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1403494812449926">1</xref>]. There is an important difference between risk behaviour and health behaviour, as health behaviours (such as tooth brushing habits and mealtime routines) are established in early childhood when the parental influence is strong, while risk behaviours (such smoking and alcohol consumption) are established during the adolescence when the parental impact has decreased [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1403494812449926">2</xref>]. Regular activities such as eating dinner together with the family functions as maintaining health behaviours and protects from health risk behaviours (HRB) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1403494812449926">3</xref>]. Dealing with risk behaviours is for adolescents a stage in the psychosocial developmental process, but considered as unwanted and harmful behaviours by adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1403494812449926">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1403494812449926">5</xref>]. However, components in the social context, such as relations with parents and peers, racial inequalities, gender, economy, and school environment influence social behaviours and the ways in which adolescents approaches risk behaviours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1403494812449926">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1403494812449926">7</xref>]. Gender studies by Sen and Östlin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1403494812449926">8</xref>] claim that the choice of a certain lifestyle is dependent on social constructions and power relations, e.g. gender, class, and ethnicity.</p>
<p>For adolescents of foreign extraction, the social context also includes influences of the parents’ culture of origin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1403494812449926">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1403494812449926"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1403494812449926">11</xref>], especially for adolescents of mixed background [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1403494812449926">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1403494812449926">12</xref>]. Previous studies have shown that the parents’ religion and country of origin influence boys’ and girls’ alcohol preferences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1403494812449926">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1403494812449926">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1403494812449926">12</xref>]. Pupils in Sweden with parents of Turkish or Middle Eastern origin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1403494812449926">9</xref>] or from a Muslim background in the Netherlands, especially the girls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1403494812449926">12</xref>], consume less alcohol than pupils of the majority population. Some studies have shown high alcohol consumption among pupils of mixed background [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1403494812449926">6</xref>] and those of Finnish origin in Sweden [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1403494812449926">9</xref>]. Some cross-national gendered differences in health behaviours have been shown. In countries where increased alcohol consumption was estimated and boys previously consumed more alcohol than girls, the gap between boys and girls has been reduced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1403494812449926">13</xref>]. Girls consume more vegetables and less soft drink than boys [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1403494812449926">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1403494812449926"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1403494812449926">16</xref>]. Boys engage more frequently in physical activities than girls do [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1403494812449926">17</xref>]. In a Swedish study, similar gender differences regarding physical activity were shown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1403494812449926">18</xref>]. Nevertheless, insufficient daily physical activity was significantly associated with low family wealth in Swedish boys, but not in girls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1403494812449926">2</xref>]. One of the gender differences regarding body image is that girls are more engaged than boys in behaviour concerning weight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1403494812449926">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1403494812449926">18</xref>]. Regarding dental health, previous research has shown a connection between family wealth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1403494812449926">19</xref>], personal wellbeing, school satisfaction, and good oral hygiene, as well as differences in oral hygiene habits between boys and girls, as girls report a higher tooth brushing frequency than boys [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1403494812449926">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1403494812449926">20</xref>]. Swedish research shows inequities in access to dental health care and dental health among minority populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1403494812449926">19</xref>]. Recent studies show connections between socioeconomic position and alcohol consumption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1403494812449926">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1403494812449926">21</xref>] and smoking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1403494812449926">7</xref>]. Social variables generate protective health factors as well as health risk factors and should account for a comprehensive whole in the adolescents’ daily environment: i.e. one single risk behaviour cannot be isolated from another. Instead, risk behaviours should be seen as syndromes or concepts of lifestyle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1403494812449926">1</xref>]. The inconsistency in previous research about how HRB patterns are allocated among pupils, and how socio-demographic indicators influence boys’ and girls’ risk behaviours, illuminates the necessity of deeper research about the interplay between socio- demographic indicators and HRBs. However, some American studies stress the importance of framing health-promoting research and interventions for adolescents by identifying cluster profiles for HRBs as well as dividing boys and girls into subgroups according to ethnic origin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1403494812449926">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1403494812449926">22</xref>] and grade [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1403494812449926">22</xref>]. Ding and Young [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1403494812449926">22</xref>] identified risk behaviour cluster profiles as a tool for prediction of future HRBs. One of the aims of identifying cluster profiles is to emphasise the risk behaviour patterns that differ between subgroups of adolescents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1403494812449926">22</xref>]. Cluster analysis makes it possible to analyse pattern profiles instead of single HRB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1403494812449926">23</xref>], which improves the abilities to identify groups of individuals and thereby increase the effectiveness of health promotion programmes. Knowledge about which health behaviours cluster together is important in planning health-promotion interventions and increases the probabilities of success in the reduction of risk behaviours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1403494812449926">23</xref>]. Few previous studies have explored a comprehensive picture of adolescents’ clustered HRBs and the associations between gender, parental foreign background, and family wealth.</p>

<title>Sample and procedure</title>
<p>Data for the present analyses were collected from the Swedish National Institute of Public Health’s survey “Swedish school children’s health behaviour” which is a part of the World Health Organization (WHO) cross-sectional global survey Health Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC). The data collection follows the HBSC standardised international research protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1403494812449926">2</xref>]. The sampling methods were carried out by Statistics Sweden in a two-step cluster design. First, clusters in the form of schools or classes were randomised from the whole country. Second, the whole cluster, a school or a class, was invited to participate in the study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1403494812449926">25</xref>]. Pupils in grades 5, 7, and 9 answered the questionnaires during ordinary school classes. Measurements were included from 1997/98, 2001/02, and 2005/06 because those years included questions about the parents’ country of birth. The response rates for the three measurement occasions were between 85% and 90% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1403494812449926">25</xref>]. The 10–15% pupils who did not participate were absent from school the day for fulfilment of the questionnaire, were of age outside the target group or had too many missing on single questions/items [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1403494812449926">25</xref>].</p>
<p>The present study includes 11,972 pupils. The distribution of pupils was about 2000 in each gender and grade. The Mid Sweden University Research Ethics Committee approved the study as being in accordance with ethical standards (Dnr: MIUN 209/362).</p>

<title>Outcome variables</title>
<p>Seven HRBs were selected and analysed as categorical variables for cluster analyses and as dichotomous variables for all other analyses, with low risk as reference (coded 0). Drunkenness was assessed by a question about the number of times that respondents have got drunk in their lifetime. There were five answer options: never or once (coded 0) and twice or more (coded 1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1403494812449926">21</xref>]. Smoking was assessed by asking for frequency of smoking per week. There were four answer options: never or less than weekly (coded 0) and every day or at least once a week (coded 1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1403494812449926">7</xref>]. Physical activity was assessed by asking how many hours per week out of school time were spent on exercising until getting out of breath or sweaty. There were five answer options: 2 hours or more (coded 0) and 1 hour or less (coded 1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1403494812449926">14</xref>]. The question regarding weight concern for the measurement year 1997/98 was worded as “At present are you on diet? and had three answer options: “no” (coded 0), “no but I ought to” (coded 1), and “yes” (coded 1). For the measurement years 2001/02 and 2005/06, the question regarding weight concern was posed “At present, are you on diet or doing something else to lose weight?” and had four answer options: “no” and “no but I ought to increase my weight” (coded 0) and “no but I ought to reduce my weight” and “yes” (coded 1).</p>
<p>The question about tooth brushing frequency had five answer options: more than once a day (coded 0) and once a day or less (coded 1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1403494812449926">20</xref>]. Vegetables and soft-drink consumption were assessed by asking how many times a week they eat vegetables and drink soft drinks. There were seven answer options. Vegetable consumption was dichotomised as: once a day or more (coded 0) and less than daily (coded 1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1403494812449926">14</xref>]. Soft-drink consumption was dichotomised as: less than daily (coded 0) and once a day or more (coded 1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1403494812449926">14</xref>].</p>

<p>Pupils with two native-born Swedish parents were used as reference category (coded 0), pupils with one Swedish-born and one foreign-born parent were classified as of mixed background (coded 1), and pupils with two foreign-born parents were classified as of foreign background (coded 2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1403494812449926">26</xref>]. Foreign extraction is used as an overall concept and includes both pupils of mixed background and those of foreign background [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1403494812449926">26</xref>]. The material wealth in the household was assessed by family affluence scale (FAS). The instrument includes four questions regarding the number of cars and computers in the household, whether the pupils have their own bedroom, and number of holiday trips made together with the family during the last 12 months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1403494812449926">27</xref>]. The FAS variable was categorised as: high, 6–7 points (coded 0), middle, 4–5 points (coded 1), and low, 0–3 points (coded 2). The FAS instrument is validated by Boyce et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1403494812449926">28</xref>] and shows adequate fit. Grade and period of measurement were included as control variables. Grade was categorised as grade 5 (coded 0), grade 7, (coded 1), and grade 9 (coded 2). Period of measurement was categorised as 1997/98 (coded 1), 2001/02 (coded 2), and 2005/06 (coded 3).</p>

<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>SPSS for Windows version 17.0 was used for all statistical analyses. Prevalence was compared with chi-squared tests. Possible interaction effects were tested by interaction terms built upon the five clusters, parental background, and FAS. However, no interaction effects were found. Differences in the three FAS levels were tested pairwise by chi-squared tests. Variance analyses were used to compare number of HRB between subgroups of boys and girls. According to measurement year 2001/02, the design factor for drunkenness was 2.39 and therefore the recommended 99% significance level (<italic>p</italic>-value &lt;0.01) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1403494812449926">25</xref>] was used for the HRB. Initially 11,972 respondents were included. In the multinomial analyses, 11,082 respondents remained due to missing values in single items. A <italic>p</italic>-value &lt;0.01 was accepted as statistically significant in all analyses.</p>
<p>k-mean cluster analyses were conducted as inspired by French et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1403494812449926">23</xref>] and Weden and Zabin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1403494812449926">11</xref>]. At the first step in the k-mean cluster procedure, all seven HRBs with the original answer options were included and transformed into z-scored variables. Initially we started with 10 clusters. The numbers of clusters were then reduced step by step until the cluster solutions were stable, i.e. had enough individuals and until each cluster had at least one HRB with a z-score &gt;1 standard deviation. The nearest centroid sorting method was used to define clusters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1403494812449926">23</xref>], with the aim of reaching the nearest mean in each cluster by repeated iterations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1403494812449926">29</xref>]. To ensure stability within the clusters, hierarchical cluster analyses with a random sample of 33% of the data material were repeated with 10 different random samples. Five random samples showed equality in the mean cluster centres. One was used as an initial cluster centre in the k-mean cluster analyses of the whole data material [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1403494812449926">30</xref>]. Multivariate analyses were conducted using multinomial logistic regression. Outcome variables were the five identified clusters and the low-risk behaviour profile became the reference category. The predictors included were parental background with Swedish background as reference category, and FAS with high family wealth as reference category.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The seven HRBs fell out into five clusters and the cluster of low-risk behaviour comprised half of the pupils. One of the differences between analysing the HRB as single behaviours and as cluster profiles is that associations with social dimensions are explored more clearly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1403494812449926">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1403494812449926">5</xref>]. For example, in the present study, only girls’ HRB was associated with low FAS. Both girls of mixed background and girls of foreign background showed increased risk of allocation to the cluster profile of multiple HRB. This was also the case for boys of mixed background, but not for boys of foreign background.</p>
<p>More than half of the respondents in the cluster profile of inadequate tooth brushing were boys, which is in line with previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1403494812449926">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1403494812449926">20</xref>]. However, the multinomial analysis (Figure 1) in the present study showed associations with this cluster in both boys and girls of foreign background and in girls with low FAS. Some of the differences in tooth brushing frequency between pupils of Swedish-born parents and pupils of foreign background can be explained by the successful national dental health prevention programme established in Sweden in 1970 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1403494812449926">19</xref>]. Investigations of dental health show high caries frequencies among children in countries from where people who migrated to Sweden originate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1403494812449926">31</xref>].</p>
<sec id="section14-1403494812449926">
<title>Gender perspectives</title>
<p>Our study showed increased risk for girls of foreign extraction and low FAS to be allocated to the cluster profile of multiple HRB. These results could illuminate the specific threats that girls in general and especially girls of foreign extraction are exposed to. Examples are differences in expectations of boys’ and girls’ academic performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1403494812449926">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1403494812449926">33</xref>], responsibility for siblings, assisting in the household, and cultural social constructions of the gender role, which might lead to increased stress among the girls. These expectations are probably expressed as engagement in HRBs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1403494812449926">6</xref>]. Sen and Östlin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1403494812449926">8</xref>] describe how lack of an intersectional perspective in health research has significant human costs and how inequalities in health cannot solely be explained by socioeconomic position. They conclude that analyses of economic class without combination of gender analyses increase the risks of the results being misinterpreted and hiding social inequalities between men and women. These arguments by Sen and Östlin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1403494812449926">8</xref>] might explain the associations found between low FAS in the cluster profiles of multiple HRB and inadequate tooth brushing in girls only. Our findings are similar to those reported by Gillander Gådin and Hammarström [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1403494812449926">18</xref>], which show associations between social indicators and HRBs among pupils in grade 9. In girls, parental foreign background, divorced parents, and unemployment were connected with low physical activity and weight concern. In boys, divorced parents and low parental support were connected with frequent smoking and drunkenness.</p>

<title>Foreign extraction</title>
<p>Fragility due to bicultural stress might partly explain the increased risk for girls of foreign extraction and boys of mixed background being allocated to the cluster profile of multiple risk behaviour in the present study. In the study by Fryer et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1403494812449926">6</xref>], concepts of fragility due to belonging to a family with parents of two different ethnic origins are deduced as reasons behind the increased risk of HRB among adolescents of mixed background. One example of fragility is lack of belonging to a natural peer group, which might press the adolescent to engage in risky behaviours to achieve confirmation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1403494812449926">6</xref>]. While society signals one social norm and the family another, boys and girls of mono-ethnic families usually manage to deal with it according to the families’ own decisions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1403494812449926">12</xref>]. However, that was not the case for girls of foreign background in the present study. In families with one parent of the majority population and one parent of an ethnic minority, the boys and girls have to deal with both social norms in parallel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1403494812449926">6</xref>], both in the family and in the community.</p>

<title>Limitations and strength</title>
<p>One of the weaknesses of cluster analyses is the risk of missing values as the analyses need completely filled questionnaires. However, our study had 11,082 respondents in the final analysis and the total number of respondents missed due to lack of information was low. The 6.3% (<italic>n</italic>=750) of the respondents were excluded in the cluster analysis. This group contained 56% boys, 12.8% of foreign background and FAS levels similar to the pupils who were included in the final analysis. The main reason for exclusion of participants was missing values on certain HRBs, e.g. smoking, soft-drink consumption, and vegetable consumption. In the final analysis, an additional 1.1% (<italic>n</italic>=130) were excluded due to missing values of FAS. Lastly, 10 individuals did not fit in the cluster analysis and we are unfortunately not able to answer why. An obstacle for comparisons between our cluster analyses and those used in other studies is the differences in categorising boys and girls into subgroups. The proportion of pupils of mixed background and pupils of foreign background (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1403494812449926">Table I</xref>) corresponds with proportion in previous research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1403494812449926">26</xref>]. In our study, we categorised boys and girls according to their parental background with no respect to a specific country of origin, as the material is too small for categorisation into such subgroups. In American studies, adolescents often are categorised into subgroups according to their own perception of ethnic belonging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1403494812449926">6</xref>]. However, despite the fact that the USA has a rather large and multiethnic population as compared to Sweden, the US researchers also found that some ethnic groups are at risk of becoming too small for inclusion in the analyses, as in the research by Ding and Young [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1403494812449926">22</xref>], Weden and Zabin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1403494812449926">11</xref>], and Romero et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1403494812449926">10</xref>]. Some advantages of the use of cluster analyses are the possibilities to make distinctions between both HRB and demographic characteristics, as the cluster analyses categorise individuals instead of behaviour variables, as in, for example, factor analysis.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In boys, the cluster analysis showed associations with inadequate tooth brushing and foreign background, and with multiple HRB and mixed background. In girls, the cluster analysis showed associations with multiple HRB and mixed respective foreign background, and in inadequate tooth brushing and foreign background. In girls, the clusters of multiple HRB and inadequate tooth brushing showed associations with low FAS. There is a need of prevention programmes in school health care that focus on signs and consequences of bicultural stress and low material welfare in the family. Results of cluster analyses also function as indicators of which HRB can be promoted in the same interventions and which HRB can follow in addition when an intervention focuses on a single HRB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1403494812449926">6</xref>]. As weekly smoking showed associations with increased risk of allocation to the cluster profile of multiple HRB, prevention programmes against smoking which take socio-demographic indicators into account are needed.</p>
