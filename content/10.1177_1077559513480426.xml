<abstract>
<p>In 1997, the National Institutes of Health within the United States Department of Health and Human Services reviewed the state of its research on child abuse and neglect (US Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, 1997). The findings suggested that although neglect was the most frequent type of child maltreatment, research studies were lacking. Through an unprecedented partnership across federal funding agencies for research on child neglect, research was encouraged in several areas. Over the past fifteen years, consortia of researchers have continued to increase our knowledge of child neglect and to shape the field. Nonetheless, challenges for research on child neglect remain, including the changing demographics of the nation and health disparities. Evidenced-based early interventions and treatments may be an opportunity for prevention of child neglect and improving child welfare services, particularly in an era of health care reform. Developmental researchers across the translational pipeline are encouraged to integrate child neglect research in future studies to inform prevention, treatment and policy efforts for the improved health and well-being of children, families and communities.</p>

<p>In response to requests from the U.S. Congress and scientific reports from the Institute of Medicine (IOM) and National Research Council (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1077559513480426">Institute of Medicine and National Research Council, 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1077559513480426">1998</xref>), the National Institutes of Health (NIH) examined its research on child maltreatment to assess the state of the science, make recommendations for a research agenda, and develop plans for future coordination efforts at NIH about 15 years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1077559513480426">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services National Institues of Health, 1997</xref>). At that time, gaps were identified in “the definition, identification, and assessment of child abuse; the determination of appropriate and effective interventions; and the transfer and application of research knowledge into real world settings” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1077559513480426">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services National Institues of Health, 1997</xref>). Most notably, NIH noted that although child neglect was the most commonly reported form of child maltreatment, it was relatively understudied.</p>
<p>The NIH Child Abuse and Neglect Working Group was formed to focus federal efforts on child maltreatment and tackled the gap of research on child neglect with a special Request for Applications (RFA); (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1077559513480426">National Institutes of Health Office Behavioral and Social Sciences Research, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1077559513480426">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services National Institues of Health, 1997</xref>) and subsequent Program Announcement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1077559513480426">National Institutes of Health Guide for Grants and Contracts, 2000</xref>) to provide an incentive for basic and translational research studies that emphasized strong definitions and assessment of neglect, innovative methodologies, and multidisciplinary approaches. These federal funding efforts were led by NIH partners including the Office of Behavioral and Social Sciences Research, the National Institute on Alcohol and Alcoholism, the <italic>Eunice Kennedy Shriver </italic>National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research, the National Institute on Drug Abuse, the National Institute of Mental Health, and the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke. The scope and funding of the research studies on neglect were enriched through unprecedented multiagency support on the issue of child neglect from the Children’s Bureau of the Administration on Children, Youth, and Families; The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; the National Institute of Justice and the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention in the Department of Justice; and the Office of Special Education in the Department of Education. Working together, these agencies promoted the multidisciplinary and translational approach to child neglect for differential health outcomes and the development of interventions ready for implementation and dissemination for child neglect. The studies varied in their examination of the types of neglect (e.g., emotional, physical, medical); included both animal and human models of neglect; utilized both behavioral social science and neuroscience perspectives; featured longitudinal and prevention studies; and included caseworkers, parents, and children across the developmental life span.</p>
<p>In 2012, the IOM again embarked to update the state of science on child maltreatment with a workshop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1077559513480426">Institute of Medicine and National Research Council, 2012</xref>) and has proposed an in-depth report on report on child maltreatment 20 years after its landmark report, “Understanding Child Abuse Neglect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1077559513480426">Institute of Medicine and National Research Council, 1993</xref>).” This special issue is the third time that <italic>Child Maltreatment</italic> has highlighted federally funded research on child neglect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1077559513480426">Dubowitz, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1077559513480426">Dubowitz, DePanfilis, Boyce, &amp; Runyan, 2004</xref>) and underscores recent scientific progress using innovative methodological approaches and strong conceptual definitions of neglect across multiple levels of analysis. NIH has continued to encourage research on child neglect across its institutes in various science areas. Research in this special issue illustrates novel science nurtured by federal funding for research on neglect that followed from the review of national data and scientific reports. These studies demonstrate careful thought to measurement issues, of and to inclusion of diverse participants, and to explore mechanisms of risk and resiliences for child neglect. It is hoped that the research in this special issue will inform future reports and facilitate translation of science to social policy for child neglect.</p>

<title>Meeting the Challenges of Research on Child Neglect</title>
<sec id="section2-1077559513480426">
<title>Definitional Issues</title>
<p>Though child neglect has long suffered from problems with conceptual and definitional issues (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1077559513480426">Dubowitz, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1077559513480426">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1077559513480426">McSherry, 2007</xref>), the neglect research consortia and other federal funding efforts have strengthened the standard for definitions of child neglect across developmental stages and by multiple source and informants. Researchers are developing advanced methodologies to assemble and analyze complex behavioral and biological data from multiple informants and administrative databases and records on child neglect as demonstrated in this special issue. Widom and colleagues have explored a unique longitudinal, prospective study among diverse participants using both individual and public records to examine neglect and its consequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1077559513480426">Widom, Czaja, Wilson, Allwood, &amp; Chauhan, 2013</xref>). Other researchers have combined multiagency administrative databases and investigated multiple sector service use among subtypes of neglect for children over time to inform intervention and policy for child welfare (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1077559513480426">Jonson-Reid, Drake, &amp; Zhou, 2013</xref>). Biological and behavioral data have also been integrated to understand the potential mechanisms of neglect, particularly the role of cortisol, stress, and emotional regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1077559513480426">Sullivan, Bennett, &amp; Lewis, 2013</xref>).</p>
<p>Research definitions have advanced beyond judicial categories and case reports to define neglect. However, the expanded definitions have generated new hypotheses about the unique contributions of neglect to child and family functioning and the potential for preventive interventions. Though multiple types of maltreatment are not uncommon, the type and severity of child neglect can impact the mechanisms that result in physical health, mental health, substance abuse, and other health risk outcomes. For example, severity of child neglect may mediate relationships for later child psychopathology and maternal substance dependence, as well as the contribution of negative environmental factors such as neighborhood violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1077559513480426">Todd Manly, Oshri, Lynch, Herzog, &amp; Wortel, 2013</xref>). Although particularly difficult, researchers have also examined the role of severity and types of neglect on interventions, such as whether severe physical neglect impacts mental health outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1077559513480426">Taussig, Culhane, Garrido, Knudtson, &amp; Petrenko, 2013</xref>).</p>

<title>Health Disparities</title>
<p>While these methodological challenges remain problematic, the change of demographics in the United States presents exciting opportunities for culturally relevant research, policy, and practice. Minority children are now the majority and immigrant children are the most rapidly growing population in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1077559513480426">Hernandez, Denton, &amp; Macartney, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1077559513480426">U.S. Census, 2013</xref>). Unfortunately, findings on racial and ethnic disproportionality and child maltreatment have been inconsistent across studies and are plagued by concerns with accuracy of child abuse and neglect reporting, socioeconomic influences, and research methodologies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1077559513480426">Ards et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1077559513480426">Drake, Lee, &amp; Jonson-Reid, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1077559513480426">Roberts &amp; Nuru-Jeter, 2012</xref>). Notably in this special issue, Cathy Spatz Widom and her colleagues examine race and ethnicity in their diverse sample and suggest different negative trajectories for mental health disorders, learning and education, and vocations for children of different races and ethnic backgrounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1077559513480426">Widom et al., 2013</xref>). Using large administrative databases, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1077559513480426">Jonson-Reid and her colleagues (2013)</xref> were able to examine race, socioeconomic status among various types of neglect. Similar to other developmental research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1077559513480426">Boyce &amp; Fuligni, 2007</xref>), nativity and other acculturation factors could be strengthened in child neglect and other maltreatment research to reflect the experiences of the diverse population. Researchers are encouraged to improve the measurement of cultural factors to examine health disparities that may or may not exist in child neglect to inform culturally relevant intervention and prevention efforts for the rapidly growing diverse population.</p>

<title>Prospects for Developmental Research</title>
<p>Neglect remains the most commonly reported type of maltreatment and federal funding efforts have continued to focus attention on neglect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1077559513480426">Maholmes, Nicholson, Haverkos, &amp; Boyce, 2007</xref>). There has been notable progress in research on child neglect that should be applauded and many prospects for the next decade. Early interventions such as home visitation, funded by NIH and DHHS, have shown evidence for the prevention of child neglect and achieved wide dissemination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1077559513480426">Donelan-McCall, Eckenrode, &amp; Olds, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1077559513480426">Olds et al., 2010</xref>). Through the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (pp. 216-225), the Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting program was created to deliver evidence-based home visiting programs in communities for families determined at risk, which can prevent child neglect and other forms of maltreatment and mental and physical health outcomes. This is an exceptional example of the translation of science relevant to child neglect to practice and policy. Evaluation research from this effort will yield extraordinary data on child- and family-focused interventions for neglect and the field of dissemination science.</p>
<p>While interventions, such as home visitation, successfully target early childhood when child neglect most frequently occurs, neglect and it effects can occur over the life span when there are other important critical periods or another “window of opportunity” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1077559513480426">Fox &amp; Rutter, 2010</xref>) for interventions. Neurodevelopmental data have shown evidence of brain changes, poor emotional regulation, and neurocognitive deficits among children who have been maltreated, which can affect future decision making and other health risks (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1077559513480426">Weller &amp; Fisher, 2013</xref>). Scientists are challenged not only to improve integration of neuroscience into child neglect research but also to strengthen child neglect factors in normative developmental research across the life span. National surveys, longitudinal research, and other developmental studies, including those in normative populations, have great potential to uncover information about child neglect. This special issue demonstrates only a sample of the remarkable progress of research on child neglect supported by NIH, and its federal and community partners. For the next decade, the challenge of child neglect extends to all developmental researchers, basic and translational, to bring the best science to the field on child neglect for improved science, policy, and practice.</p>
