<title>Current Vitamin D issues in the UK</title>
<p>Vitamin D deficiency is a growing public health concern. On 25<sup>th</sup> October 2011 a parliamentary event took place that warned of the health implications of not getting enough vitamin D and called for the need for action.</p>
<p>With an increase in the number of elderly people suffering from osteoporosis and with more children developing rickets (a disease thought to have vanished) a lack of vitamin D in our diet is becoming a problem. The National Diet and Nutrition Survey (2002) found that 90% of people in the UK do not get enough vitamin D. At the meeting Yamin Qureshi MP noted that if we continue to ignore vitamin D deficiency as a serious public health issue, the cost could be an unwelcome burden on the health service in the future.</p>
<p>Whilst both the Department for Health and the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, recommend vitamin D supplementation for the elderly and children, it is still not known if such advice is being followed. The meeting also noted that advice can be confusing. Recommendations to boost vitamin D levels through increased sun exposure contradict the message by government and cancer charities that staying out in the sun for too long can cause skin cancer.</p>
<p>One of the main barriers to improving vitamin D levels was the lack of evidence base for vitamin D intake. Ash Soni, a Pharmacist and member of the Government’s NHS Future Forum, told the meeting that it was incredibly difficult to recommend to the public how much vitamin D we actually need because there is no firm evidence. Current recommendations also differ. In the UK, the advice is a minimum of 25 nanomoles (nmol)/per litre, but in the US, the Institute of Medicine says that 50 nmol/per litre is adequate. Some experts even suggest that 100-150 nmol/per litre is safe. The evidence is currently being examined by the Government’s Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition (SACN) and for many the findings cannot come soon enough.</p>
<p>So what can we do? For Claire Severgnini, chief executive of the National Osteoporosis Society, allowing food supplement manufacturers to market and develop a range of vitamin D products for various groups and also allow them to make claims about the benefits of vitamin D, would help.</p>
<p>Experts agreed that to tackle the issue, all health care professionals need to be involved and everyone needs to agree on the information. GP, Gill Jenkins pointed out that GPs don’t receive any financial incentives to tackle their patient’s nutritional issues, and so the responsibility is passed on to practice nurses. It was also pointed out that health professionals fail to take a holistic approach. Ash Soni agreed, saying that health professionals focus on the condition rather than addressing the cause. Other speakers blamed this short-sighted approach on the GP Quality and Outcomes framework (QOF) which has led to practices focussing on specific targets and work areas. However if osteoporosis was to become a QOF condition, vitamin D could become the focus for health practitioners.</p>
<p>The meeting heard that advice needs to be clearer and more consistent. GPs need to be clear on the guidelines and debate about Vitamin D supplementation would benefit from cross-professional discussion. The Proprietary Association of Great Britain (PAGB) has made a submission to the NHS Future Forum, calling for its report to contain an action for Public Health England.</p>

<title>The future for public health learning and development</title>
<p>The Royal Society for Public Health (RSPH) have commissioned an in-depth report into the future learning and development landscape for the wider public health workforce.</p>
<p>Although the broad context for health improvement is well established, its architecture is undergoing a radical shift, from a health led service towards a public health system that is local authority led. The report is based on interviews with people in a wide range of public health roles; in both practice and learning settings, local authorities, the NHS, and the third and the independent sectors.</p>
<p>The findings highlight the complexity of developing effective education and learning to support health improvement and the changes that will be needed to ensure that the workforce can operate effectively in the new environment.</p>
<p>This report informs future education and learning in the light of the forthcoming Public Health Workforce Strategy. RSPH wants to share the learning from this work with practitioners and policy makers to stimulate, inform and shape ongoing discussions and bridge the gap between the policy and practice. The intention is to create an ongoing dialogue recognising that the best solutions are co-created.</p>
