<abstract>
<p>Research suggests that college women are at greater risk for rape and sexual assault than women in the general population or in a comparable age group. College women, away from home and family, may turn to friends for support. Friends may experience emotional reactions that affect their own functioning and may not feel they have anywhere to turn. In this study, we interviewed male and female college students who had received a rape disclosure from a friend. Their unique stories provide insight into the secondary effects of rape disclosure on friends. Implications of these findings for college campuses are discussed.</p>

<p>Much prior research demonstrates that college women experience an increased risk of rape and sexual assault compared to their noncollegiate counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1077801213490509">Armstrong, Hamilton, &amp; Sweeney, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1077801213490509">Cass, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1077801213490509">DeKeseredy &amp; Kelly, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1077801213490509">Fisher, Cullen, &amp; Turner, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1077801213490509">Humphrey &amp; White, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1077801213490509">Koss, Gidyez, &amp; Wisniewski, 1987</xref>). Women who are victimized experience a myriad of trauma-related effects as a result of the assault. Decades of research have refined the details—how much trauma is expected, why trauma occurs, how best to treat such trauma—but the basic effect is immutable. Rape and sexual assault have a devastating effect on survivors’ physical, emotional, and psychological well-being. Thus, survivors need support. College women, away from home and family, often times turn to informal support providers, such as friends, for help during the recovery process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1077801213490509">Fisher, Daigle, Cullen, &amp; Turner, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1077801213490509">Starzynski, Ullman, Filipas, &amp; Townsend, 2005</xref>). Despite friends being the first line of defense for many survivors, very little is known about the disclosure process or the impact the disclosure has on friends. Friends of sexual assault survivors are important in their own right, and their unique stories and experiences provide insight into the complicated nature of this devastating crime.</p>
<p>The scope of sexual assault radiates far beyond the primary victim. A small, but growing body of research is documenting the ripple effects of sexual assault, defining “secondary victims” who are also harmed by an assault (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1077801213490509">Ahrens &amp; Campbell, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1077801213490509">Banyard, Moynihan, Walsh, Cohn, &amp; Ward, 2010</xref>). The existing research has primarily focused on how the disclosure affects the person’s ability to offer support to the survivor. To fill the critical gap in the literature, a feminist qualitative methodology was used to explore the experiences of male and female college students who received a sexual assault disclosure from a friend.</p>
<p>The current study is important and unique for two reasons. First, this research promotes a better understanding of the secondary victimization effects that may occur as a result of receiving a disclosure from a friend and thus, a more complete knowledge of the expansive consequences of sexual assault. Second, the current study provides the opportunity to develop more complete services for all individuals involved in the recovery process of sexual assault survivors, including the unique needs of survivors’ friends.</p>
<sec id="section1-1077801213490509">
<title>Review of the Literature</title>
<p>Rape is not rare. Research reports that approximately one in five women are raped in their lifetime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1077801213490509">Fisher et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1077801213490509">Krebs, Lindquist, Warner, Fisher, &amp; Martin, 2009</xref>). For college women, living in an environment that juxtaposes the abuse of alcohol, casual sex, the objectification of women, and a culture that celebrates hegemonic masculinity, the risk of sexual assault is even greater than for women in the general population or in a comparable age group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1077801213490509">Armstrong et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1077801213490509">Cass 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1077801213490509">DeKeseredy &amp; Kelly, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1077801213490509">Fisher et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1077801213490509">Koss et al., 1987</xref>). Research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1077801213490509">Fisher et al. (2000)</xref> indicates that between 20% and 25% of college women are raped while they are college students. Exacerbating the heightened risk of sexual assault for college women, extant literature also shows that they experience a greater risk of attack by individuals they know (e.g., classmates, friends, boyfriends), with as many as 9 in 10 college women who are sexually assaulted reporting they are assaulted by someone they know (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1077801213490509">Fisher et al., 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>In response to the prevalence of sexual assault in the college community, university administrators have invested in initiatives to create safer campus environments for their female student populations (e.g., nighttime campus escorts, better lighting, secure access to student housing) and to provide survivor advocacy and counseling programs as well as campuswide education programs about sexual assault (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1077801213490509">Fisher et al., 2000</xref>). Recently, bystander education programs have advanced this mission further by empowering students to respond when other students are victimized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1077801213490509">Banyard, Plante, &amp; Moynihan, 2004</xref>). Despite such progress, existing initiatives, including bystander education programs, do not recognize the potential <italic>effects</italic> of sexual assault on other members of the campus community beyond the primary survivors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1077801213490509">Banyard et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Sexual assault’s devastating aftereffects do not occur in a vacuum. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1077801213490509">Remer and Fergusen (1995)</xref> stress, “Victimization has a ripple effect, spreading damage in waves out from survivors to all those with whom they have intimate contact” (p. 407). Nearly two thirds of sexual assault survivors disclose the assault to at least one person and the majority of survivors disclose to informal support providers such as friends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1077801213490509">Ahrens, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1077801213490509">Ahrens, Campbell, Ternier-Thames, Wasco, &amp; Sefl, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1077801213490509">Golding, Siegel, Sorenson, Burnam, &amp; Stein, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1077801213490509">Ullman &amp; Filipas, 2001</xref>). Coping with sexual assault can be a significant stressor for all individuals involved in a survivor’s disclosure and subsequent recovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1077801213490509">Ahrens &amp; Campbell, 2000</xref>), such as nonperpetrator family members, partners, and friends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1077801213490509">Daane, 2005</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1077801213490509">Karjane, Fisher, and Cullen (2002)</xref> emphasize that, “the friends survivors disclose their experience to are also likely to be affected, having their own feelings of anger, fear, and/or helplessness” (p. 137). Despite this, there has been little research focused on the impact of sexual assault on these “secondary survivors.” To the extent that the existing literature concentrates on secondary survivors, overwhelmingly the focus is on the manner in which the individual responds to the disclosure and the subsequent support they offer the primary survivor. No research to date has specifically focused on the potential impact of receiving a disclosure of sexual assault on the secondary survivors themselves.</p>
<p>Research on college-age individuals suggests that friends are an especially important support system, fulfilling roles that even family members cannot satisfy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1077801213490509">Buote et al., 2007</xref>). The multiple functions that friends fulfill and their provisions of support and well-being suggest that having close friends during a traumatic experience such as sexual assault would help primary survivors cope. It is unlikely, however, that said friends are any more prepared to manage the trauma of sexual assault than the survivor is. In short, friends may experience secondary victimization effects in response to a sexual assault disclosure. Research has demonstrated the devastating effects that sexual violence has on the primary survivor, but what trauma-related effects are experienced by those closest to the survivor? Experiencing a sexual assault disclosure, even vicariously, may lead to a myriad of harmful effects. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1077801213490509">Figley and Kleber (1995)</xref> assert that, “diagnostic descriptions of what constitutes a traumatic event . . . clearly suggest that mere knowledge of the exposure of a loved one to a traumatic event can be traumatizing as well” (p. 77). The stress of receiving a sexual assault disclosure may be exacerbated by the increased burden of simultaneously internalizing the trauma of a loved one and feeling secondary trauma of one’s own.</p>
<p>To date, research focusing on the impact of a sexual assault disclosure on a friend is minimal. One study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1077801213490509">Ahrens and Campbell (2000)</xref> examined the influence a sexual assault disclosure had on a friend’s ability to provide support to the survivor. Participants reported feeling good about helping their friend but, “even though overall levels of distress were low, a number of distressing emotions were prevalent among participants . . . such as anger, shock by the rape, and a desire for revenge against the assailant” (p. 978). Further research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1077801213490509">Banyard et al. (2010)</xref> using a shortened version of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1077801213490509">Ahrens and Campbell’s (2000)</xref> survey, demonstrated the prevalence of friends’ disclosures of unwanted sexual experiences among college students. Specifically, results indicated that 28.9% of students surveyed had received a disclosure from a friend and females were more likely than males to have a friend disclose to them. Females in the sample reported a greater loss of sense of security and becoming more fearful for their own safety and of becoming a victim of assault than their male counterparts. Males were less likely to report feeling angry at the problem of rape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1077801213490509">Banyard et al., 2010</xref>). In addition, consistent with the previous work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1077801213490509">Ahrens and Campbell (2000)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1077801213490509">Banyard et al. (2010)</xref> found that almost half of their participants reported they were able to be helpful and supportive to their friend.</p>

<title>The Present Study</title>
<p>The present study builds on the existing literature by using qualitative interviews to explore the unique experience of male and female college students who received a sexual assault disclosure from a friend. The current study provides two valuable additions to the literature. First, this research will open the dialog concerning the secondary victimization effects of sexual assault on college friends and, thus, a more complete knowledge of the expansive consequences of rape. Second, this research offers an important addition to the bystander education literature by answering the call for researchers to investigate the perspectives of bystanders themselves—often college friends—so that they may be integrated into bystander education programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1077801213490509">Banyard et al., 2010</xref>). To date, bystander education programs have relied solely on the perspectives of survivors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1077801213490509">Banyard et al., 2010</xref>).</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section4-1077801213490509">
<title>Sampling Procedures</title>
<p>A convenience sample of college students was recruited on the campus of a medium-sized, private liberal arts university in western Florida. College students were recruited through print media advertisements in the school newspaper, flyers distributed throughout campus, and an electronic announcement attached to a weekly event e-mail sent to all students campuswide. All individuals who responded to an advertisement were screened by telephone to determine eligibility. Participants were eligible if they met the following inclusion criteria: (a) they were enrolled at the university, (b) they were at least 18 years of age, and (c) they had received a disclosure from a friend who was sexually assaulted when they were 18 years old or older. Face-to-face interviews were then scheduled with individuals who met the eligibility criteria. All participants received US$10 for their participation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1077801213490509">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Ten male and female college students who had received a rape disclosure from a friend were interviewed to explore the secondary effects of rape disclosure on friends. Seven of the 10 participants were female. At the time of the interview, the average age of the participants was 23 years old (<italic>SD</italic> = 2.63), and ranged from 20 to 27 years old. The majority of participants identified themselves as White (<italic>n</italic> = 7), with the exception of 3 individuals, who identified themselves as Latino (<italic>n</italic> = 2) and multiethnic (<italic>n</italic> = 1). Participants included 3 freshman, 2 juniors, 4 seniors, and 1 graduate student. The majority of the participants knew the survivor prior to the occurrence of the sexual assault (<italic>n</italic> = 7) and their friendships ranged from 2 to 10 years, with the average friendship being approximately 6 years in length.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1077801213490509">
<title>Data Collection</title>
<p>To gain insight into the unique experience of receiving a sexual assault disclosure from a friend, the researchers employed a feminist qualitative approach to data collection and analysis. One-on-one structured, open-ended interviews were conducted with a sample of college students who self-reported receiving a sexual assault disclosure from a friend. The interviews took place in a private, enclosed office and were conducted by one of two female interviewers who had received training in techniques of interviewing participants on sensitive topics. Interviews were tape-recorded and transcribed by the Principal Investigator. Following the interview, each participant was given a debriefing form that provided contact information for local counseling centers.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1077801213490509">
<title>Analysis Procedures</title>
<p>Following the approach of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1077801213490509">Miles and Huberman (1994)</xref>, qualitative content analysis of participants’ responses to two open-ended questions were conducted. The researchers approached the analyses using inductive coding, which allows research findings to emerge from the dominant or repetitive themes inherent in raw data without the restraints imposed by categories established a priori (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1077801213490509">Thomas, 2006</xref>). Inductive coding is especially helpful when coding personal narratives such as interviews where key themes may be obscured, reframed, or left invisible when researchers attempt to assign participants’ responses to preconceived categories (while ignoring responses that do not fit the coding schema).</p>
<p>For the first level of coding, the researchers reviewed the transcripts individually, noting key concepts in each transcript that pertained to the impact of receiving a sexual assault disclosure on a friend. These were identified from the verbatim responses of each participant (e.g., using words such as “shock,” “disbelief,” and “couldn’t believe” to describe the disclosure of the assault were all included under the overarching theme of “shock”). In addition, descriptions by the participants about how they reacted physically to the disclosure (e.g., describing that they never wanted to stop hugging the survivor) were included in the coding. The emergent concepts describing the impact of the disclosure on participants were written on note cards. After this initial set of coding, both researchers discussed their individual coding scheme, discussing disagreements in coding until agreement on the identification of concepts was reached. After establishing a working set of codes, pattern coding was used to develop overarching, repetitive themes, and constructs. Each researcher first conducted pattern coding independently. Patterns were then discussed and disagreements were reconciled by open dialogue and constant comparison to the emotionality of the entire transcript, including descriptions of participants’ demeanor, tone of voice, and any sign of discomfort (e.g., crying).</p>
<p>Although information about the assault and disclosure experiences emerged throughout the interview, two open-ended questions were particularly useful in generating data related to the aims of the current study. These questions invited the respondents to share information about the disclosure and their reactions. Participants answered the following open-ended questions: “How did you react when your friend first told you about the assault?” and “Please tell us about your first immediate thoughts and feelings about the assault.”</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1077801213490509" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>Four repetitive themes were pervasive among the participants’ responses concerning their reactions to receiving a disclosure of sexual assault from a friend: anger, shock/disbelief, feelings of concern, and change in worldview.</p>
<sec id="section9-1077801213490509">
<title>Feelings of Anger</title>
<p>Qualitative analysis of the interview transcripts identified feelings of anger by six of the friends over several different contexts. Anger was expressed by terms such as “mad,” “angry,” and “anger.” First, two participants described feelings of anger toward the perpetrator. One female friend who knew the survivor for 3 years explained her anger toward the perpetrator this way:<disp-quote>
<p>I wanted to strangle him. . . . It was kind of just like disbelief that this kid that everyone knew so well and thought was so cool and so nice would do that and take advantage of her and then I was angry at the same time.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>One male participant who knew the survivor prior to the assault and described the survivor as a good friend for more than 4 years described his anger by saying, “I was also extremely angry at this kid.” In addition, the same male friend revealed that he had later “revenged” the survivor by physically harming the perpetrator.</p>
<p>Second, 2 participants described feelings of anger at the fact that the sexual assault had happened to someone they know. One female participant who had been friends with the survivor for 2 years explained, “I was also angry. I was upset that . . . that someone could have done this to someone that I knew.” Another female participant who had known the survivor prior to the sexual assault and described the survivor as a close friend for 7 years stated, “I didn’t deny [that the assault had occurred] but I was still just like, ‘Oh my god, how could this happen to her? How could this happen to somebody I know?’”</p>
<p>Finally, 2 participants conveyed feelings of anger toward the survivor. One male participant who had been very close friends with the survivor for 4 years and had known the survivor prior to the assault reported, “I got kind of angry. . . . I was . . . I actually got angry at her at first.” He went on to say, “She was just . . . I actually got angry at her first and now looking back in retrospect I really shouldn’t have . . . ” A female participant who had been friends with the survivor for 2 years described her anger at the survivor for not reporting the assault:<disp-quote>
<p>I was crazed, I just I couldn’t understand. I was like ‘but you’re supposed to tell somebody.’ She said that it had been a year or about . . . almost a year and that it was too late. And that just made me mad.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1077801213490509">
<title>Feelings of Shock</title>
<p>Four of the 10 participants expressed feelings of shock after being told about the assault. Shock was expressed with multiple terms, including “shock,” “disbelief,” and “couldn’t believe.” A female friend who had known the survivor prior to the assault and been friends with her for 5 years described her shock as<disp-quote>
<p>Just disbelief. It’s like everyone goes on senior trip nothing bad had ever happened like that. . . . They were just ridiculously stupid, but, um, nothing like that had ever happened. So it was just kind of just a shock.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Another female friend who had been friends with the survivor for 7 years described her reaction: “I mean I was in shock kind of, you know, I just couldn’t believe . . . I didn’t deny it, but still.” A male participant who had known the survivor prior to the assault and been good friends with her for 8 years also said, “After she said what she said [disclosed the assault] we kind of sat in silence for a little bit. I was a little numb. I was a little shocked.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1077801213490509">
<title>Feelings of Concern</title>
<p>Eight of the 10 respondents described feelings of concern for the survivor. Concern was expressed by words such as “worried,” “concern,” “felt numb,” “felt bad for her,” and “horrified.” One female participant who had been friends with the survivor for 8 years explained, “I felt bad for her ’cuz I was like, nobody should ever have to go through that, you know.” Participants also experienced concern about how they handled the disclosure. For example, one female participant who had known the survivor for 7 years revealed, “I really just tried to listen and just hold her hand and just listen. I didn’t know what to say. I didn’t know what words could really, you know, make that any better. I just didn’t have any.” Another female participant who had been friends with the survivor for 7 years explained,<disp-quote>
<p>I don’t know, I asked her if there is anything I can do. I don’t even know what I said. . . . I didn’t know exactly how I could fix it . . . not fix it, but help her. Help, you know, the situation.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>One male participant who had been friends with the survivor for 2 years described his feelings of concern in this way: “I was concerned and I was sad that . . . that this ugly piece of society had kind of barged its way into my life.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1077801213490509">
<title>Change in Worldview</title>
<p>Several participants indicated that the sexual assault disclosure changed the way they thought of the world (e.g., loss of sense of security, no longer felt the world was a safe or fair place). Specifically, the disclosure appeared to change their perceptions of where an assault can occur, who can be sexually assaulted, and who can be offenders. One male student, whose friend of 2 years had been assaulted, described this change in his perception in the following way:<disp-quote>
<p>I was hearing something that I hear about all the time on the news . . . but it’s not something that you have touching your life so I was upset that . . . that someone could have done this to someone that I knew and it was . . . it was almost a humbling experience to know that even in these lofty halls of private academia we are not insulated from some of the more ugly parts of our world.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>A female participant whose friend of 7 years had been raped by a stranger described the sexual assault as a catalyst for change in her own perception of danger. She expressed feeling a new sense of hypervigilance for personal safety. In contrast, a female participant whose friend of 7 years had been attacked by a significant other explained that the attack changed her sense of trust toward men. Specifically, she revealed,<disp-quote>
<p>I feel like, um . . . I don’t know . . . I can’t go without criticizing or very scrutinizing the partners they’re [her female friends] with just to see, you know, “are you the type” or, you know, “are you being too assertive? Are you too possessive? What sort of man are you?”</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Interestingly, change in perception of risk and safety was not a gendered phenomenon. A male participant whose close friend of 3 years was attacked by an acquaintance explained,<disp-quote>
<p>I would say that it gave me a higher sense of surroundings and, um, know the limits of how much I drink and where you are, and things like that so . . . probably a higher sense of security in a way.</p>
</disp-quote></p>

<p>Following a feminist methodology, this research strives to accurately represent the voices of friends. Thus, while we primarily focused on the four most pervasive themes in the responses, other concepts were reported and should be noted. The additional themes included revictimization (of the participant–friend), guilt, change in perception of safety, feelings of betrayal (by the participant–friend), and survivor-blaming.</p>
<p>First, two of the female respondents described how the disclosure brought up memories of their own victimization. They described these feelings in the following ways: “Um, I just have . . . kept telling myself this isn’t your situation and it was very, very hard for me to.” “I felt bad for her ’cuz I was like nobody should ever have to go through that, you know . . . um . . . and it brought back memories of my experience, so . . .”</p>
<p>One of the female respondents described feeling guilty that the assault had happened to her friend of 8 years. The participant disclosed that she knew the perpetrator and had invited him to the location where he had sexually assaulted her friend. She described that she “felt guilty ’cuz he’s [the perpetrator] my friend . . .”</p>
<p>Two respondents described feelings of blame toward the survivor–friend. One male respondent who had been friends with the survivor since middle school had blamed the survivor when she had disclosed being assaulted at a house party that they had both attended. He described,<disp-quote>
<p>I actually got angry at her at first. It was a matter of “why did you go with this guy? I told you if you just waited a little longer and you knew you could have passed out in the truck . . . you could of, you know, why . . . why’d you have to go with him?”</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>He later felt remorse for blaming his friend for her assault and wished he could change that first reaction. A female respondent who had also been molested herself as a child described feeling disappointed in her friend’s negative behavior after she was raped. The respondent felt that the survivor should have reacted differently, revealing that, “when she [the survivor] lost respect for her body and things like that I just was extremely disappointed.”</p>
<p>Finally, one male respondent described feeling like the rape was a betrayal against him, since he knew the perpetrator and the assault happened at a party he and his friends hosted. He described,<disp-quote>
<p>It was a house party . . . but it was predominately kids from my school so it was like . . . it was almost like a trespass on [us]. It felt like “Okay you come to one of our parties and then you do this to one of our people” kind of thing.</p>

<title>Discussion and Implications</title>
<p>This exploratory study built on past research that examined the secondary effects of rape disclosures on the friends of rape survivors. Divergent from the limited past research focused on how friends’ reactions to a disclosure may mediate the primary survivor’s recovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1077801213490509">Ahrens &amp; Campbell, 2000</xref>) we focused specifically on the friends’ personal emotions as a result of their friend’s assault. Our findings suggest that friends are a population that deserves attention in academic research and support services on college campuses tailored to their specific needs. Importantly, based on this preliminary research and in line with the limited prior work, we evince that sexual assault not only affects a primary survivor but also impacts her friends. Specifically, similar to past results by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1077801213490509">Ahrens and Campbell (2000)</xref>, friends in this study discussed experiencing negative feelings including anger, shock, and concern after receiving a disclosure of sexual assault from a friend. Likewise, one male friend reiterated a finding from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1077801213490509">Ahrens and Campbell’s (2000)</xref> work, the desire to seek revenge against the perpetrator who assaulted their friend. In addition, the current study uncovered that friends in the present sample also reported experiencing a change in their worldview after the disclosure. Specifically, this exploratory research demonstrates that receiving a disclosure of sexual assault can change a friend’s feelings of safety, security, and place in the world. Interestingly, the present findings did not appear to be a gendered phenomenon in that both male and female participants reported these feelings. These findings are in line with the broader literature on vicarious crime victimization. Extant studies indicate that witnessing violence, or even knowing someone who has been a victim of violence, may lead to increased perceptions of risk for violence and/or fear of crime victimization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1077801213490509">Ferraro, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1077801213490509">Mesch, 2000</xref>). In addition, prior research concerning vicarious trauma experienced by formal support providers demonstrates that female counselors who have high numbers of sexual assault survivors on their caseloads are at an increased risk of feelings of “disrupted beliefs,” in particular, beliefs about the goodness in others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1077801213490509">Schauben &amp; Frazier, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>Friends’ needs could be easily integrated into most existing services for survivors by simply <italic>acknowledging</italic> that counseling and advocacy centers are open to survivors’ friends as well as the survivors themselves. Counselors and advocates should be prepared to address the feelings and reactions of friends who accompany survivors to their postassault counseling appointments, instead of viewing friends solely as passive support providers for survivors. In addition, due to the pervasive problem of rape and sexual assault among college women, the likelihood that a survivor’s friend may also have a history of sexual victimization is high. Receiving a disclosure from a friend may uncover feelings about a past victimization experience, and resource providers must be aware of this possibility. Without targeted campaigns for secondary survivors, friends may be unsure as to whether or not they are “allowed” to utilize counseling or advocate services and they may dismiss their own feelings as unimportant in lieu of the primary survivor’s needs. Given the research regarding the positive effects of social support post sexual assault (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1077801213490509">Ullman &amp; Filipas, 2001b</xref>), friends of survivors should have access to sources of support.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1077801213490509">Karjane and coauthors (2002)</xref> note that few universities actively advertise (or even provide) sexual assault resources to individuals who need them beyond primary survivors, such as the friends (and fellow students) of survivors. The present research demonstrates that campus communities must supply resources for friends of survivors, including advice and training on how they may help primary survivors recover as well as counseling for the friend’s own personal feelings about, and reactions to, the assault. Resources may be disseminated in multiple student venues, such as new student orientation, resource center trainings, campuswide events, and passive information campaigns (e.g., flyers, billboards, bus stop postings). Preemptive sensitivity training for disclosure may be provided at new student orientation when campus sexual assault policies are discussed, and information for friends could be incorporated into existing literature/pamphlets given to students and posted throughout campus. Additional training sessions could be provided to targeted audiences, such as sorority and campus club meetings/events, and Resident Assistants could be taught to provide small group trainings for students in residence halls.</p>
<p>The present findings emphasize the need for community-level programming on college campuses, such as bystander education. The programs most amenable to the goals of the current research include bystander education programs that target the entire campus community as potential bystanders with the goal of increasing openness and social awareness among all students concerning sexual assault on campus. Bystander education programs should attempt to mobilize students to act on behalf of their friends and fellow students. While most bystander education programs have been created based on the experiences of primary survivors, recent research has called for more attention to the experiences of the bystanders themselves and additional research on how friends feel about acting as safety allies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1077801213490509">Banyard et al., 2010</xref>). The present research is a critical piece in opening the dialogue concerning how friends feel postdisclosure as well as validating campus community-wide initiatives in support of all populations who are impacted by sexual violence.</p>
<p>As in all research, this study is not without limitations. First, the small sample size (<italic>N</italic> = 10) limits the generalizability of the study. Future research should attempt to expand this exploratory research by gathering a larger sample of friends’ experiences receiving disclosures. In addition, an important caveat to the findings is that it is difficult to assess the time ordering and direction of the association between the disclosure of sexual assault and emotional reactions from friends. In the current study, a measure of reactions and feelings to the disclosure from a friend was only available immediately after the disclosure. Future research should include measures of emotionality in multiple time periods after the disclosure to adequately assess the true impact of a disclosure of rape and sexual assault on a friend.</p>
<p>Future research could examine survivors’ reasons for approaching their friends to disclose and try to determine what survivors are looking for from their friends when they disclose. This information could help prepare friends for disclosures and better equip them in guiding them through the disclosure process. Because friends never know when they may receive a disclosure of sexual assault, it is important that friends are prepared to respond.</p>
<p>As both scholars and activists, we must recognize that the impact of rape and sexual assault radiates beyond the primary survivor and that all those affected deserve our validation and support. Findings from the current research highlight the importance of increasing social awareness on college campuses about the secondary effects of rape disclosures on friends. This increased awareness can provide a new direction for improving the support services available to all those effected by rape and sexual assault.</p>
