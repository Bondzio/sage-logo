<abstract>
<p>Military cognitive readiness is a somewhat new concept that has been defined many ways. In this article, I review these definitions and propose that cognitive readiness is not just one construct, but three inter-related constructs akin to the military levels of war and readiness (tactical, operational, &amp; strategic). Each of these constructs requires cognitive performance in complex, uncertain, and stressful military operations. However, the nature of performance is different for each. Thus, each level of cognitive readiness requires different measures. As a first step in the development of measures for operational and strategic cognitive readiness, a review of research related to predicting cognitive performance in complex, uncertain, and stressful operations was conducted. From this review a set of inherent psychological factors and their measures were identified. The article concludes by indicating what future steps are needed to develop measures of both operational and strategic readiness.</p>

<p>Wars may be fought with weapons but they are won by men.</p>
<attrib><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1555343412444606">George S. Patton, 1933</xref></attrib>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>A<sc>s the United States and its coalition partners continue the decade-long conflict</sc> in Afghanistan, it is clear that General Patton’s quote is more resonant today than it was in World War II. Although Patton was most likely referring to the bravery and physical strength of the soldiers, today success in military operations relies equally on the cognitive might of the individual. This is largely because modern technology has provided us with the capability to obtain and distribute vast amounts of information very quickly. The greater availability of information has assigned to junior and noncommissioned officers the decision-making responsibilities reserved for higher-level commanders in past wars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1555343412444606">Krulak, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>Furthermore, the decreased time to make decisions and the increased lethality of weapons has led to an increase in the cognitive demands and stress of modern military operations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1555343412444606">Friedl et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1555343412444606">Martinez-Lopez, 2005</xref>). These increases are troubling, because both higher cognitive demands and higher stress are well known to increase the likelihood of errors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr105-1555343412444606">Thompson &amp; McCreary, 2006</xref>). In fact, 80% of military accidents are caused by human error (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-1555343412444606">Thomas &amp; Russo, 2007</xref>). Moreover, stress has been widely reported to cause long-term psychological injury to our military personnel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1555343412444606">Friedl et al., 2007</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr105-1555343412444606">Thompson and McCreary (2006)</xref> reported that between 10% and 50% of all operational casualties are psychological.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the leading theory of stress, the transactional model of stress, states that the experience of stress is determined not only by the demands of the situation but by individual differences as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1555343412444606">Lazarus, 1999</xref>). More specifically, the presence or absence of a real stressor is less important than the individual’s appraisal of the situation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr105-1555343412444606">Thompson &amp; McCreary, 2006</xref>). Essentially, stress is a cognitive operation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1555343412444606">Matthews, Roberts, &amp; Zeidner, 2004</xref>). In summary, technological readiness is necessary but not sufficient to wage war; understanding the cognitive readiness of military personnel (i.e., soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines) is also necessary.</p>
<p>The term <italic>cognitive readiness</italic> was first used by the military less than a decade ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1555343412444606">Morrison &amp; Fletcher, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr114-1555343412444606">Walsh &amp; Shingledecker, 2006</xref>). The military use of cognitive readiness is not related to the construct as used in developmental and educational psychology, where the construct has a much longer history (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr114-1555343412444606">Walsh &amp; Shingledecker, 2006</xref>). Rather, the military use of the term expands on the concepts of readiness that the military uses to assess the availability of personnel who have completed training and functioning technology. As cognitive readiness is an emerging concept, there is no official definition. The lack of a commonly accepted definition is problematic for conducting both theoretical (basic) and practical (applied) research.</p>
<p>As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1555343412444606">Kuhn (1962/1996)</xref> stated, “[those] whose research is based on shared paradigms are committed to the same rules and standards for scientific practice. That commitment and the apparent consensus it produces are prerequisites for normal science” (p. 11). A commonly accepted definition is such a paradigm. Without a shared definition, it would be impossible for any measure of cognitive readiness to satisfy the four universally agreed-on principles of psychometric testing: reliability, content validity, construct validity, and predictive validity (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1555343412444606">Anastassi &amp; Urbina, 1997</xref>). To push forward the development of a reliable and valid measure of cognitive readiness, this article reviews the cognitive readiness literature, proposes operational definitions of cognitive readiness that mirror the military’s levels of readiness and war, and maps existing measures of constructs known to affect cognitive performance to these definitions.</p>
<sec id="section1-1555343412444606">
<title>Defining Cognitive Readiness</title>
<p>In the cognitive readiness literature, there are many different definitions and uses of the term. Four definitions that represent those found in the literature are presented:</p>
<list id="list1-1555343412444606" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>“possessing the psychological (mental) and sociological (social) knowledge, skills, and attitudes (KSAs) that individuals and team members need to sustain competent performance and mental wellbeing in the dynamic, complex, and unpredictable environments of military operations” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1555343412444606">Bolstad, Cuevas, Babbitt, Semple, &amp; Vestewig, 2006</xref>, abstract);</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>“the mental preparation (including skills, knowledge, abilities, motivations, and personal dispositions) an individual needs to establish and sustain competent performance in the complex and unpredictable environment of modern military operations” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1555343412444606">Fletcher, 2004</xref>, p. 1);</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>“an enhanced state of mental acuity, i.e., the ability of the Soldier to meet the expected cognitive demands of a situation” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1555343412444606">Branscome &amp; Grynovicki, 2007</xref>, p. 1); and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>“the optimization and enhancement of human cognitive performance. It is a critical element for effective operational performance, especially for an individual’s capability to perform multiple functions and to adapt to diverse and rapidly shifting threats” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1555343412444606">Cosenzo, Fatkin, &amp; Patton, 2007</xref>, p. B96).</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Among these different definitions, there are three commonalities. First, cognitive readiness is a predictor of cognitive performance. Second, cognitive readiness requires tolerance of the uncertain, demanding, and stressful environment in which military operations take place. To be clear, cognitive ability is the central component, but other attributes (e.g., personality and motivation) have been shown to affect cognitive performance, particularly in high-stress situations. Thus, these attributes should be considered in the measure of cognitive readiness. Third, cognitive readiness is not something inherent to an individual; rather, it is an interaction between the individual and the anticipated situation. That is, an individual can have an optimum level of cognitive readiness for one set of responsibilities or a military operation, but this may not be optimum for all responsibilities or all operations. These three similarities can be summarized as fitness for the cognitive tasks and experiences an individual is anticipated to encounter during military operations.</p>
<p>However, there is an important distinction between the preceding definitions. Specifically, these definitions can be grouped into two interdependent categories: (a) a KSA (knowledge, skill, and ability or attitude) that is required to perform a military operation effectively (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1555343412444606">Bolstad et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1555343412444606">Fletcher, 2004</xref>) and (b) an optimized state for performance of a military operation (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1555343412444606">Branscome &amp; Grynovicki, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1555343412444606">Cosenzo et al., 2007</xref>). The former category (cognitive readiness as a KSA) implies that cognitive readiness is a competency that can be selected for and/or trained. The latter (cognitive readiness as a state) implies that cognitive readiness is a mental state that is experienced, specifically during military operations. This distinction (cognitive readiness as a KSA or as mental state) has ramifications for use of cognitive readiness as both a theoretical and a practical construct.</p>
<p>The concept of cognitive readiness as KSA denotes that cognitive readiness is an attribute with clear indicators of when an individual is at a specific level of cognitive readiness and prepared to assume a set of responsibilities. KSAs, typically, are measured in terms of levels from novice to expert, with benchmarks indicating where one has crossed into a higher level. As such, an individual’s cognitive readiness for a military operation may improve with training, or degrade with lack of use, but does not fluctuate significantly from day to day. The researchers who approach cognitive readiness as a KSA are concerned with measurement for the purposes of selection, assessment of training effectiveness, and deployment and mission preparedness.</p>
<p>In contrast, those researchers who have defined cognitive readiness as a state have investigated mostly measures that can be used while an individual is deployed. That is, they are examining the impacts of the day-to-day realities of military operations on the abilities of military personnel. The goal of their research is to identify when an individual’s performance has been degraded as a result of stress or workload so that interventions can be made. Often, this research is looking at physiological markers of workload and stress (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1555343412444606">Grier, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>These two avenues of research are not incompatible. Rather, both are necessary for ensuring the performance and well-being of military personnel. In cognitive readiness as KSA, the emphasis is on training and selection before deployment. In cognitive readiness as state, the emphasis is on monitoring during deployment. The Department of Defense’s approach to levels of war and other forms of readiness carries a similar distinction. Specifically, there are three levels: strategic, operational, and tactical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1555343412444606">Joint Chiefs of Staff, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1555343412444606">2010</xref>). The <italic>strategic level</italic> has the longest view and refers to preparedness for a wide range of potential situations. The <italic>operational level</italic> refers to the preparedness to engage in a new deployment or action and perform the anticipated missions for that deployment. The <italic>tactical level</italic> refers to the preparedness to conduct a specific mission in support of a military operation, and of the three levels, it has the shortest timeline. In summary, the military does not refer to one concept of preparedness. Therefore, cognitive readiness should not be treated as a single construct.</p>
<p>Rather, there should be three distinguishable definitions that support the different purposes of military cognitive readiness (e.g., selection, deployment preparedness, and monitoring). Each of these definitions should represent a cognitive fitness for duty for complex, dynamic, uncertain, and stressful military operations. Each definition should also recognize the interaction of situation and individual on the measurement of cognitive readiness. However, what should be measured about the individual varies on the basis of type of cognitive readiness. Specifically, the current state of an individual is more important when one is monitoring readiness while deployed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1555343412444606">Lubin, Fiedler, &amp; Van Whitlock, 1999</xref>). An individual’s more stable attributes and competencies are more important the farther in advance of deployment one is predicting performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1555343412444606">Lubin et al., 1999</xref>). As such, I propose the following three terms:</p>
<list id="list2-1555343412444606" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p><italic>Tactical cognitive readiness</italic>: A state of mental acuity for ensuring an acceptable level of performance during assigned missions.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Operational cognitive readiness</italic>: “The mental preparation (including skills, knowledge, abilities, motivations, and personal dispositions) an individual needs to establish and sustain competent performance in the complex and unpredictable environment of modern military operations” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1555343412444606">Fletcher, 2004</xref>, p. 1).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Strategic cognitive readiness</italic>: An individual’s potential to perform assigned cognitive tasks in the complex and unpredictable environment of modern military operations.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Tactical cognitive readiness emphasizes the state of an individual (e.g., stress, workload, and motivation), because its purpose is monitoring of military personnel so that interventions can be made if cognitive performance is predicted to fall below requisite levels. Strategic cognitive readiness emphasizes the competencies and aptitudes of the individual (e.g., cognitive capabilities, personality) to support selection and assignment to specific positions. Operational cognitive readiness assesses a combination of attributes (i.e., knowledge, skills, abilities) and states (i.e., motivations) to ensure an individual can perform optimally while deployed. In the rest of this article, I review the military cognitive readiness and cognitive performance literature to develop theoretical models that will support development and validation of measures of both operational and strategic cognitive readiness as defined previously. See <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1555343412444606">Grier (2011)</xref> for a similar review of literature relevant to measurement of tactical cognitive readiness.</p>

<sec id="section2-1555343412444606">
<title>Components of Operational and Strategic Cognitive Readiness</title>
<p>Operational cognitive readiness and strategic cognitive readiness are about identifying whether individuals are prepared for the cognitive demands of being deployed. To define operational cognitive readiness, I used <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1555343412444606">Fletcher’s (2004</xref>, p. 1) definition: “the mental preparation (including skills, knowledge, abilities, motivations, and personal dispositions) an individual needs to establish and sustain competent performance in the complex and unpredictable environment of modern military operations.” I defined strategic cognitive readiness as an individual’s potential to perform assigned cognitive tasks in the complex and unpredictable environment of modern military operations. Currently, there exists no measure for either construct.</p>
<p>The development of measures of both operational and strategic cognitive readiness requires an understanding of the constructs important to mental ability and preparation. To that end, a literature review of proposed theories, measures, and training of cognitive readiness was conducted. The resulting list of constructs, which reflect mental ability and preparation, particularly for military operations, are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1555343412444606">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1555343412444606">2</xref>.</p>

<p>It should be noted that these tables do not represent an exhaustive list of the constructs found in the literature. Several constructs were not included in this review because of the lack of agreement as to the nature of the construct. These constructs include emotional intelligence, leadership, and open-mindedness (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1555343412444606">Matthews et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-1555343412444606">Sternberg &amp; Vroom, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr118-1555343412444606">Zuckerman, Kuhlman, Joireman, Teta, &amp; Kraft, 1993</xref>, respectively, for further discussion). They may be important to cognitive readiness, but development of reliable and valid measures of cognitive readiness requires a strong theoretical base. The inclusion of constructs that are muddled would weaken the validity of the resulting measures of cognitive readiness.</p>
<p>Furthermore, constructs related to teamwork are not included. Although teamwork is an essential part of successful military performance, the goal of this literature review is the development of measures of strategic and operational cognitive readiness for individuals. To that end, this article discusses constructs important to the development of those measures. Future work should examine constructs such as task cohesion, social cohesion, shared mental model, leadership, and communication for development of team tactical cognitive readiness and team operational cognitive readiness measures (for further discussion, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1555343412444606">Bolstad et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-1555343412444606">Seong, Springs, Chung, &amp; Avery-Epps, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, looking at the tables, one could perceive the constructs as making up distinct and orthogonal categories. However, these constructs relate to each other in many ways. In fact, many different categorization schemas could be created. These categories merely represent a framework for discussing these constructs in the rest of this article.</p>
<sec id="section3-1555343412444606">
<title>Knowledge</title>
<p>The first construct found in the literature to be discussed is knowledge. It should be clear that the more knowledge an individual has, the better his or her performance will be. In addition, the more knowledgeable an individual is, the more uncertainty is reduced; thus less stress is experienced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr105-1555343412444606">Thompson &amp; McCreary, 2006</xref>). Furthermore, having a foundation of knowledge is necessary for better performance on higher-order cognitive functions. “For example, to determine a creative fix to a machine, one would need at least a basic knowledge of the machine” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr116-1555343412444606">White et al., 2005</xref>; p. 4).</p>
<p>Knowledge is measured by recognition, recall, power, and speed tests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1555343412444606">Kraiger, Ford, &amp; Salas, 1993</xref>). The appropriate measure depends on how the knowledge is to be used. Further investigation is needed to determine the knowledge needed for specific military duties. What follows is a general discussion of three categories of knowledge discussed in the reviewed literature (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1555343412444606">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1555343412444606">2</xref>): military knowledge, deployment knowledge, and general knowledge.</p>
<sec id="section4-1555343412444606">
<title>Military knowledge</title>
<p>As can be seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1555343412444606">Table 1</xref>, three types of military knowledge were discussed in the reviewed literature: (a) job- and task-specific knowledge and skills; (b) formal knowledge of tactics, techniques, and procedures as well as military doctrine; and (c) lessons learned (i.e., the tips and recommendations of military personnel who were most recently deployed). The first two are taught formally in training and represent the minimum an individual must know for his or her position. In comparison, lessons learned are modifications or enhancements to the previous two that are recommended by military personnel who have recently deployed. A matrix mapping these to military jobs and operations would be beneficial to the development of specific operational cognitive readiness measures.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1555343412444606">
<title>Knowledge of deployment environment</title>
<p>Knowledge of the deployment environment is the second category of knowledge discussed in the reviewed literature (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1555343412444606">Table 1</xref>). This is knowledge that is specific to the region to which the military personnel will be deployed and includes cultural, political, and geographic terrain. More specifically, military personnel are taught when making decisions that they must assess the METT-TC (mission, enemy, terrain and weather, troops and support available, time available, civil considerations; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr111-1555343412444606">U.S. Army, 2008</xref>). For counterinsurgency and stability operations, they are taught to consider PMESII (political, military, economic, social, infrastructure, and information systems) or DIME (diplomatic, informational, military, and economic) factors when making decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr112-1555343412444606">U.S. Joint Forces Command, 2006</xref>). The more knowledgeable soldiers are about these factors, the better their decisions will be. Evidence for the importance of this knowledge was provided by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1555343412444606">Plank, Scheff, and Sebok (2010)</xref>.</p>
<p>Specifically, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1555343412444606">Plank et al. (2010)</xref> examined first-person accounts of combat experiences, fatality databases, and soldier surveys to determine whether the “first five firefights” are indeed the deadliest and, if so, why. However, in irregular warfare, firefights are rare. As such, time in deployment was examined. The first and last 3 months of deployment were found to be the most dangerous. For deaths in the initial 3 months of deployment, lack of METT-TC knowledge was cited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1555343412444606">Plank et al., 2010</xref>). To decrease the fatalities during the initial 3 months, military personnel should have greater knowledge of the deployment area prior to the deployment.</p>
<p>This knowledge also reduces the stress experienced by military personnel. “Preparatory information of this sort reduces the novelty, increases predictability and a sense of control, and has been shown to decrease self-reports of anxiety and increase confidence and performance in warfighters” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr105-1555343412444606">Thompson &amp; McCreary, 2006</xref>, pp. 68–69). Predeployment training and assessments should also examine knowledge of the likely stressors (e.g., cultures, temperature) as well. Knowledge of the individual’s own reaction to these stressors is important to ensuring that while he or she is deployed, appropriate appraisals of the situation are made. If the appropriate appraisals are made, the effect of the stress is reduced, because appropriate coping mechanisms can be used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr105-1555343412444606">Thompson &amp; McCreary, 2006</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1555343412444606">
<title>General knowledge and abilities</title>
<p>In addition to military and deployment environment knowledge, general knowledge and psychomotor abilities were mentioned several times in the literature (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1555343412444606">Table 2</xref>). Although at first glance, this may seem surprising, there is research that suggests breadth of knowledge is important for performance. First, the psychomotor abilities mentioned in the literature (e.g., multitasking, dynamic monitoring, sustained attention) are building blocks to the skills individuals are trained to perform. Thus, the greater these psychomotor abilities are prior to training, then the higher proficiency can be achieved. There are many measures of psychomotor abilities for cognitive readiness available, including the Army Cognitive Readiness Assessment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-1555343412444606">Swann &amp; Schmidt, 2005</xref>), Psychomotor Vigilance Test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1555343412444606">Dinges &amp; Powell, 1985</xref>), Automated Readiness Evaluation System Infantry Version (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1555343412444606">Harris, Reeves, Elsmore, &amp; Hancock, 2006</xref>), SYNWORK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1555343412444606">Elsmore, 1994</xref>), and Cognitive Skills Armory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1555343412444606">O’Donnell, Moise, &amp; Schmidt, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Second, junior and noncommissioned officers are making decisions that were made by high-ranking officers in the past (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1555343412444606">Krulak, 1999</xref>). These decisions require what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-1555343412444606">Sternberg (2001b)</xref> called <italic>wisdom</italic> because of their far-reaching consequences. Stenberg theorized that there are five components of wisdom: rich factual knowledge, rich procedural knowledge, life-span contextualism, relativism (knowledge about differences in values, goals, and priorities), and knowledge of ways to manage uncertainty. Three of these are directly related to general knowledge and abilities: rich factual knowledge, rich procedural knowledge, and relativism. For example, even limited experience with a second language creates an understanding of cultural differences that promotes relativism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1555343412444606">Pulakos, Arad, Donovan, &amp; Plamondon, 2000</xref>). Further research is needed to identify a measure of breadth of knowledge that is relevant to cognitive readiness.</p>
<p>Technological competency was another aspect of general knowledge often cited in the reviewed literature (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1555343412444606">Table 2</xref>). Military operations are becoming more technological; new technology is being introduced at faster and faster rates. As it is introduced, technology changes the tactics, techniques, and procedures inherent to military knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1555343412444606">Pulakos et al., 2000</xref>). Understanding how technology works ensures properly balanced trust in automation. Also, individuals with strong technical competencies are more likely to accurately interpret the data provided by the technology. Both reduce the likelihood of human error. Furthermore, these individuals can more rapidly figure out tactics, techniques, and procedures for use with the technology and, thus, maximally leverage the technology’s potential. Finally, individuals with more technological competency will have reduced stress levels, because the technology will not be a source of uncertainty and anxiety. The National Academy of Engineering conducted an investigation of measures of technological literacy but unfortunately found that no single measure was adequate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1555343412444606">Gamire &amp; Pearson, 2006</xref>). The report provides insight into what is needed to develop such a measure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1555343412444606">Gamire &amp; Pearson, 2006</xref>).</p>

<title>Cognitive Functions</title>
<p>The second category to be discussed is cognitive functions and includes decision making, problem solving, planning, analysis, judgment, systems perspective (i.e., awareness of indirect effects), critical thinking, and metacognition. Although each of these was mentioned in the literature frequently (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1555343412444606">Table 1</xref>), the two most important for cognitive readiness are decision making and metacognition. This is because decision making and metacognition inherently include the other concepts.</p>
<p>Specifically, decision making and problem solving are two very similar constructs in psychology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr117-1555343412444606">Zeichmeister &amp; Johnson, 1992</xref>). The distinction between the constructs is the nature and time pressure of the situation. <italic>Problem solving</italic> refers to selecting a solution in a stable environment, which allows for slow and deliberate processing. <italic>Decision making</italic> refers to the selection of a course of action in highly complex and dynamic environments, similar to military operations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr117-1555343412444606">Zeichmeister &amp; Johnson, 1992</xref>). Additionally, analysis, planning, judgment, having a systems perspective, and critical thinking are all necessary to making a decision or solving a problem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr117-1555343412444606">Zeichmeister &amp; Johnson, 1992</xref>). Thus, a training program to improve decision making or a measure of decision-making ability includes many of these concepts.</p>
<p>Decision-making measures specific to the military include the Military Scenarios Instrument and the Organizational Scenarios Instrument (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1555343412444606">Milan, Bourne, Zazanis, &amp; Barone, 2002</xref>). No reliability or validity information on these measures could be found; further research and development are needed. In contrast, the Ennis-Weir Critical Thinking Essay Test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1555343412444606">Ennis &amp; Weir, 1985</xref>) has acceptable reliability and validity. However, it measures only the critical thinking component of decision making.</p>
<p>Metacognition is defined as an understanding and control of one’s cognitive functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-1555343412444606">Sternberg, 1998b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr114-1555343412444606">Walsh &amp; Shingledecker, 2006</xref>). Metacognition is related to decision making, because monitoring decisions and actions as well as an awareness of the components of decision making are inherent to metacognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-1555343412444606">Sternberg, 1998b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr114-1555343412444606">Walsh &amp; Shingledecker, 2006</xref>). As such, metacognition is a necessary attribute for an individual to be effective at military decision making.</p>
<p>Army Field Manuals (FM) 5-0 and 6-0 discuss two approaches to decision making in command and control: the Military Decision Making Process (MDMP) and the Intuitive Decision-Making Process (IDP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr109-1555343412444606">U.S. Army, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr110-1555343412444606">2005</xref>). The MDMP is a step-by-step analytical process: The planner analyses the situation, develops several courses of action, and selects the best course of action after careful comparison. In contrast, IDP is focused on evaluating the situation, identifying a single course of action, and then evaluating the likelihood of success of that course of action. Only if success is not likely should another course of action be considered. IDP was developed as a result of Gary <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1555343412444606">Klein’s (2008)</xref> work in naturalistic decision making.</p>
<p>Department of Defense instructions recommend MDMP when time is not a factor or when an individual does not have much expertise with the situation. In contrast, IDP is recommended when the decision maker has a great deal of experience <italic>and</italic> a rapid action is required (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr109-1555343412444606">U.S. Army, 2003</xref>). Thus, metacognition is necessary to determine which of these decision-making strategies is appropriate. The State Metacognitive Inventory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1555343412444606">O’Neil &amp; Abedi, 1996</xref>) and the Metacognitive Awareness Inventory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-1555343412444606">Schraw &amp; Dennison, 1994</xref>) are two measures of metacognition that have acceptable validity and should be included in measures of cognitive readiness.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1555343412444606">
<title>Expertise</title>
<p>As noted, the decision-making skills used by an individual are dependent on the expertise a person has. Regardless of domain, what separates experts and novices is neither amount of knowledge nor an easily taught strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1555343412444606">Norman, 2006</xref>). As seen by the difference between IDP and MDMP, the difference is something more complex. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1555343412444606">Rasmussen’s (1983)</xref> model of levels of expertise provides a good starting point for a discussion of this difference.</p>
<p>Specifically, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1555343412444606">Rasmussen (1983)</xref> identified expertise as having three stages of development or levels: knowledge based, rules based, and skills based. The knowledge-based level is the first level and requires knowledge of the situation as well as thoughtful analysis. As such, it is similar to the military’s description of MDMP. The skills-based level is the highest level and is similar to the military’s description of when IDP should be used. That is, for an individual who is at the skills-based level, the action chosen is a somewhat automated process based on experience. The rules-based level is an interim step, whereby the individual knows rules that reduce the analysis required compared with the person at the knowledge-based level. However, the rules-based process is not as automated as the skills-based process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1555343412444606">Rasmussen, 1983</xref>).</p>
<p>Thus in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1555343412444606">Rasmussen’s (1983)</xref> model, expertise is the ability to assess a situation and choose an action quickly using few cognitive resources. This expertise is developed through experience, after an individual has a foundation of knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1555343412444606">Norman, 2006</xref>). More specifically, a person can be knowledgeable on a topic but not perform at expert levels. In other words, it is important to measure expertise and not just knowledge when predicting performance. However, there is no general measure of expertise. Rather, one needs to define what is important to the measure of military expertise. Many topics in the reviewed literature are relevant to an understanding of military expertise. These topics include situation awareness, pattern recognition, sensemaking, and automaticity (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1555343412444606">Table 1</xref>). Each is discussed in the next paragraphs.</p>
<p>First, the measurement of situation awareness is important to investigating performance in military operations (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1555343412444606">Salmon et al., 2009</xref>, for a review of such measures). As such, many have proposed that situation awareness is inherent to cognitive readiness. However, in the situation awareness literature, there is much debate about whether situation awareness is a process or a product (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1555343412444606">Salmon et al., 2008</xref>, for a review). Where a researcher stands on this debate determines whether the measure of situation awareness is a component of cognitive readiness.</p>
<p>If one views situation awareness as a process, then situation awareness is a skill, and the measure of an individual’s level on this skill is important to military cognitive readiness. However, the most widely accepted definition of situation awareness is “the perception of the elements in the environment within a volume of time and space, the comprehension of their meaning, and the projection of their status in the near future” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1555343412444606">Endsley, 1995</xref>, p. 36). This definition falls into the product class of definitions, in which situation awareness is an emergent feature between the situation and the individual in the situation. That is, situation awareness is not a skill. Rather, situation awareness is something that exists in a moment of time. Thus, by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1555343412444606">Endsley’s (1995)</xref> definition, situation awareness does not reflect fitness but reflects performance. As such, it is not appropriate for the measure of military cognitive readiness. Because Endsley’s definition is the most accepted definition, I do not include situation awareness as a component of cognitive readiness.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, reviewing situation awareness research provides insight into what constructs are important to military cognitive readiness. Specifically, there are two ubiquitous findings in the situation awareness research that are important for understanding military cognitive readiness and expertise. First, experts have higher situation awareness than novices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-1555343412444606">Sohn &amp; Doane, 2004</xref>). Second, higher situation awareness leads to faster and better decision making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1555343412444606">Endsley &amp; Jones, 1997</xref>). The reason experts have higher situation awareness is that the long-term memory of experts contains structures that enable the integration of the perceived data into patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-1555343412444606">Sohn &amp; Doane, 2004</xref>). The greater one’s expertise with a situation, then the more structures exist for integrating the data into a meaningful pattern. These structures allow for the rapid comprehension and projection of status for that situation. However, an individual without expertise will have fewer structures in long-term memory and will have to rely on analytical skills and working memory for comprehension and projection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1555343412444606">Endsley, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-1555343412444606">Sohn &amp; Doane, 2004</xref>). Essentially, higher situation awareness enables IDP through pattern recognition. Experts have more patterns to compare the current situation than do novices. Because novices do not have the patterns, they must use the more analytical MDMP to determine the meaning of the data. As such, novices experience more mental workload than experts.</p>
<p>Sternberg and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1555343412444606">Hedlund et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1555343412444606">Matthew &amp; Sternberg, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-1555343412444606">Sternberg, 1998b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-1555343412444606">Sternberg &amp; Hedlund, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-1555343412444606">Sternberg, Wagner, Williams, &amp; Horvath, 1995</xref>) referred to these structures or patterns as <italic>tacit knowledge</italic>. Specifically, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1555343412444606">Matthew and Sternberg (2009)</xref> defined tacit knowledge as a “complex set of condition-action mappings through which appropriate action is selected and executed, given specific environmental conditions” (p. 531). These mappings are not formally taught; rather, they are acquired independently through experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1555343412444606">Hedlund et al., 2003</xref>). Often, the expert cannot verbalize the knowledge contained in these mappings to others. Put another way, tacit knowledge provides the skills in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1555343412444606">Rasmussen’s (1983)</xref> skill-based level of expertise. Despite the difficulty with conveying tacit knowledge, Sternberg and his colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1555343412444606">Hedlund et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-1555343412444606">Sternberg et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-1555343412444606">Sternberg &amp; Hedlund, 2002</xref>) have documented techniques for measuring tacit knowledge. In fact, tacit knowledge has been shown to be a valid predictor of performance.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1555343412444606">Hedlund et al. (2003)</xref> cited several studies that showed that tacit knowledge “distinguishes among more and less successful performers in several domains” (p. 118). A measure of tacit knowledge for military leaders was developed by Hedlund et al., but the measure was shown to have limited validity, despite that similarly developed tests for other domains had acceptable reliability and validity. The test used the situation-based judgment format, in which the individual’s ratings of alternative courses of action in response to scenarios are compared with the responses of experts. Other techniques for measuring tacit knowledge include free sorts and structural assessments (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1555343412444606">Kraiger et al., 1993</xref>). Development of a tacit knowledge test for military personnel would be an important component of operational cognitive readiness.</p>
<p>The process by which situation awareness and tacit knowledge are developed is called <italic>sensemaking</italic>. Sensemaking is the effort to bring comprehension to events or experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1555343412444606">Lazzara et al., 2010</xref>). Sensemaking involves seeking out information when one does not have sufficient situation awareness and implicitly learning from this process to build more tacit knowledge. Sensemaking is clearly important to success in military operations. However, not all individuals have the skill. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1555343412444606">Bar-Tal, Raviv, and Spitzer (1999)</xref> referred to this skill as the ability to achieve cognitive structures and developed a measure of it (i.e., the Ability to Achieve Cognitive Structures Scale). Nonetheless, sensemaking or ability to achieve cognitive structures is a skill that can be attained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1555343412444606">Bar-Tal et al., 1999</xref>). The development of this skill will be discussed further in the next section, on motivation.</p>
<p>Another form of expertise discussed in the literature is automaticity (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1555343412444606">Table 1</xref>). Whereas the expertise discussed thus far has been related to decision making and incorporates complex concept-action mappings, automaticity relates to simpler behaviors. However, automaticity and tacit knowledge are both representations of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1555343412444606">Rasmussen’s (1983)</xref> skills-based level. That is, an individual is said to have developed automaticity when he or she learns the stimulus-response mapping such that very little cognitive function is required to perform the action. Examples of behaviors commonly learned to automaticity include bike riding and reading. The behaviors that military personnel should be able to accomplish at the level of automaticity depend on the task, mission, or job to be done. Nevertheless, the more behaviors that can be trained to automaticity, the more cognitive resources are available for other cognitive functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1555343412444606">Kraiger et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1555343412444606">Morrison &amp; Fletcher, 2002</xref>). Testing the automaticity of appropriate behaviors is accomplished through the techniques of interference problems, secondary-task performance, and embedded measurement depending on the behavior (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1555343412444606">Kraiger et al., 1993</xref>).</p>
<p>It should be clear from this discussion that expertise is important for reducing the cognitive demands or mental workload experienced by military personnel. Expertise is also important because it reduces the experience of stress. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr105-1555343412444606">Thompson and McCreary (2006)</xref> described how expertise in parachutists changes their focus from physiological arousal due to stressors to the mission goal:<disp-quote>
<p>[Novice parachutists’] focus then is on coping with their emotional and physical arousal, providing them less capacity to systematically attend to the immediate practical requirements and potential realistic dangers at the critical moments of during the jump. Experienced parachutists, in contrast, have developed a set of technical skills that enable them to perceive less of a gap between event requirements and their coping resources. They also have strategies that enable them greater control of their arousal levels, leaving them more cognitive resources for the technical aspects and any relevant danger signs during the jump. (p. 65)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Thus, the assessment of expertise, and not just knowledge, must be considered in measures of operational cognitive readiness to ensure both performance and psychological health of personnel during military operations.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1555343412444606">
<title>Motivation</title>
<p>Motivation is another category of concepts that was discussed frequently in the reviewed literature (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1555343412444606">Table 1</xref>). Concepts included in this category are locus of control and self-efficacy. These concepts are important to cognitive readiness in two ways. First, motivation is a key component differentiating novices and experts. Second, motivation affects the experience of stress.</p>
<p>In the previous section, it was noted that the difference between experts and novices is experience. Practice is required for an individual to acquire expertise. For an individual to spend sufficient time in practice, motivation is required (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1555343412444606">Ericsson, Krampe, &amp; Tesch-Romer, 1993</xref>). More specifically, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-1555343412444606">Sternberg’s (1998a)</xref> “developing-expertise model” states that a motivation to learn is the driver of deliberate practice, which takes an individual from novice to expert. In this model, “motivation drives metacognitive skills, which in turn activate learning and thinking skills, which then provide feedback to the metacognitive skills, enabling one’s level of expertise to increase” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-1555343412444606">Sternberg, 1998a</xref>, p. 17). In short, motivation leads to higher metacognition, which leads to sensemaking, which leads to expertise.</p>
<p>There are numerous names referring to motivation to learn in the literature: “passionate learner” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr108-1555343412444606">Tucker, Gunther, Pleban, Goodwin, &amp; Vaughn, 2007</xref>), “mastery orientation” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1555343412444606">Dweck &amp; Leggett, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr116-1555343412444606">White et al., 2005</xref>), and “lifetime entrepreneur” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1555343412444606">Breuer &amp; Eugster, 2006</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr116-1555343412444606">White et al. (2005)</xref> described these individuals as viewing experiences as challenges from which to learn and grow. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1555343412444606">Breuer and Eugster (2006)</xref> described these individuals as recognizing that they have the capability to shape the world and are not just reacting to events as they occur. These descriptions of motivation to learn indicate that motivation is required not only to become an expert but to be successful in any field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1555343412444606">Paulaus et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr116-1555343412444606">White et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>A review of the literature indicated two aspects of motivation important to cognitive readiness (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1555343412444606">Table 1</xref>): locus of control and self-efficacy. An individual can have either an external or an internal locus of control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr105-1555343412444606">Thompson &amp; McCreary, 2006</xref>). An individual with an external locus of control is more likely to hesitate in stressful situations and less likely to develop expertise, because he or she views the world as outside of his or her control. Therefore, an individual with an external locus of control is not likely to work as hard to overcome obstacles. Conversely, an individual with an internal locus of control focuses on the goal and his or her ability to accomplish the goal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr105-1555343412444606">Thompson &amp; McCreary, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Locus of control is not a permanent personality trait (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr105-1555343412444606">Thompson &amp; McCreary, 2006</xref>). An individual with an internal locus of control in the face of too many obstacles or under bad leadership can become a person with an external locus of control. Similarly, an individual with an external locus of control under good leadership can become a person with an internal locus of control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr105-1555343412444606">Thompson &amp; McCreary, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>There are two measures of locus of control that could be beneficial to measures of operational cognitive readiness: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1555343412444606">Rotter’s (1966)</xref> Locus of Control measure and Work Locus of Control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-1555343412444606">Spector, 1988</xref>). Both have been validated. Rotter’s Locus of Control measure is very general and may lack the specificity needed for military operations. The Work Locus of Control measure is more specific, but items would need to be modified slightly to be appropriate for military personnel; for instance, the following item is not appropriate to military audiences: “To make a lot of money you have to know the right people.”</p>
<p>The second aspect is self-efficacy, which is an individual’s belief that he or she can accomplish a goal or task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1555343412444606">Bandura, 1977</xref>). It is well documented that self-efficacy is correlated with performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1555343412444606">Bandura, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1555343412444606">Dixon, Patton, Fatkin, Grynovocki, &amp; Hernandez, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr108-1555343412444606">Tucker et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr116-1555343412444606">White et al., 2005</xref>). Furthermore, individuals with lower self-efficacy apply less effort and avoid new challenges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1555343412444606">Dixon et al., 2006</xref>). Like locus of control, self-efficacy is a state. Self-efficacy comes from success at something challenging, which the individual knew required skill to accomplish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1555343412444606">Bandura, 1977</xref>). An individual’s current level of self-efficacy and locus of control have an interactive effect on each other and on one’s ability to handle stress.</p>
<p>Someone with an internal locus of control who is not able to perform a task will have reduced self-efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1555343412444606">Bandura, 1977</xref>). In comparison, an individual who succeeds on a task but has a high external locus of control will not ascribe his or her abilities to success and thus will not increase his or her self-efficacy. Individuals with an internal locus of control but low self-efficacy are more likely to experience stress when the situation is tough, because they are focusing on arousal and attribute this arousal to inability rather than external factors.</p>
<p>Self-efficacy and metacognition also have a complex relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1555343412444606">Moores, Chang, &amp; Smith, 2006</xref>). Recall that metacognition relates to self-monitoring of the decision-making process. Self-efficacy is one’s belief in one’s own ability to accomplish a task. People with high self-efficacy tend to use metacognition while performing tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1555343412444606">Coutinho, 2008</xref>). In fact, a study found that self-efficacy and metacognition were correlated to each other as well as to performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1555343412444606">Coutinho, 2008</xref>). Results from regression analyses showed that self-efficacy explained all the unaccounted variance between metacognition and performance, but metacognition did not account for variance between self-efficacy and performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1555343412444606">Coutinho, 2008</xref>). Thus, self-efficacy is based on metacognition as well as motivation.</p>
<p>The Trait Self Regulation Questionnaire is a combined measure of motivation (effort, self-efficacy) and metacognition (planning, self monitoring) developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1555343412444606">Breuer and Eugster (2006)</xref>. However, it has not been validated. As such, further research into the reliability and validity of the Trait Self Regulation Questionnaire is needed. Particularly, the concurrent validity of the Trait Self Regulation Questionnaire with the reported measures of metacognition and the New General Self-Efficacy Scale (reliablitiy and validation can be found in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1555343412444606">Chen, Gully, &amp; Eden, 2001</xref>) would be of interest. If the Trait Self Regulation Questionnaire is validated, it should be included in measures of operational cognitive readiness. If it is not validated, then the New General Self-Efficacy Scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1555343412444606">Chen et al., 2001</xref>) and the previously mentioned metacognition scales should be included.</p>

<title>Personality</title>
<p>Motivation is influenced by social and organizational factors as well as by personality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr105-1555343412444606">Thompson &amp; McCreary, 2006</xref>). Organizational and social factors are important to measures of team cognitive readiness but are beyond the scope of this work. However, there is evidence that personality measures may have potential value to the measurement of individual cognitive readiness. In fact, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-1555343412444606">Tett, Jackson, and Rothstein (1991)</xref> stated that personality measures are the most popular measures for job selection in the private sector. However, personality measures are not currently used in military selection.</p>
<p>Personality has demonstrated not only a relationship to motivation but also a predictive correlation to performance in the lab (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1555343412444606">Matthews et al., 2010</xref>). However, these predictive capabilities have historically not been seen in the real world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-1555343412444606">Tett et al., 1991</xref>). This may be why the military has not adopted personality measures for selection. Nevertheless, new studies are showing that the predictive power of personality measures in the real world are near the levels observed in laboratory tasks when the measures are collected in highly realistic contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1555343412444606">Matthews et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>It should be noted that an individual’s personality is not the cause of good or bad performance. Rather, certain personality characteristics affect the degree to which stress and workload affect performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1555343412444606">Matthews et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-1555343412444606">Szalma &amp; Teo, 2010</xref>). As such, there is potential for personality measures to add value in measurement of cognitive readiness. Still, additional research is needed for this potential to be realized. Specifically, there is significant debate regarding the definition of personality characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr118-1555343412444606">Zuckerman et al., 1993</xref>).</p>
<p>Personality characteristics can be described as macro- or microlevel traits, and both were discussed in the reviewed literature (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1555343412444606">Table 2</xref>). On the macrolevel, personality is divided into three or five traits that are theorized to be helpful in understanding behavior in a broad range of contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-1555343412444606">Tett et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr118-1555343412444606">Zuckerman et al., 1993</xref>). Conversely, microlevel traits are theorized to affect a person’s performance in specific contexts. As such, the list of microlevel traits is quite long, and many are still being identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-1555343412444606">Tett et al., 1991</xref>). Also, there has been less research on the microlevel traits than on the macrolevel traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-1555343412444606">Tett et al., 1991</xref>). Both macro- and microlevel traits are discussed in relation to cognitive performance next.</p>
<sec id="section11-1555343412444606">
<title>Macrolevel personality traits</title>
<p>On the macrolevel, there are several models of personality, including the five-factor model, three-factor model, and alternate five-factor model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr118-1555343412444606">Zuckerman et al., 1993</xref>). In all of these models, there is agreement on neuroticism and extraversion as personality traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr118-1555343412444606">Zuckerman et al., 1993</xref>). There is evidence that there is a third factor but less agreement on the specifics of this factor, which is labeled <italic>conscientiousness, psychoticism</italic>, or <italic>impulsivity</italic>, depending on the model. The relation of each of these three traits to performance and the experience of stress is discussed next.</p>
<p>But first, it is important to note that just as there are multiple <italic>models</italic> of personality, there are multiple <italic>measures</italic> of personality. The NEO Personal Inventory (NEO-PI), International Personality Item Pool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1555343412444606">Goldberg et al., 2006</xref>), and Mini-Marker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1555343412444606">Saucier, 1994</xref>) measure the traits in the five-factor model. The Zuckerman-Kuhlman Personality Questionnaire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr118-1555343412444606">Zuckerman et al., 1993</xref>) measures the alternate five-factor model. The Eysenck Personality Questionnaire–Brief Version (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1555343412444606">Sato, 2005</xref>) measures the three-factor model. All of these measures have been used extensively by those researching personality. The next paragraphs describe the three traits with the strongest correlations to performance: neuroticism, extraversion, and conscientiousness.</p>
<p>Neuroticism, which is “characterized by a chronic level of emotional instability and proneness to psychological distress” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr113-1555343412444606">Vandenbos, 2007</xref>, p. 622), has the strongest evidence for predicting performance. Many researchers have shown that neuroticism negatively correlates with performance, particularly in stressful environments, such as military operations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1555343412444606">Branscome, Swoboda, &amp; Fatkin, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1555343412444606">Kustabayeva, Panganiban, &amp; Matthews, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1555343412444606">Lubin et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1555343412444606">Mastin, Peszka, Poling, Phillips, &amp; Duke, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1555343412444606">Palinkas, 2001</xref>). Furthermore, individuals who score high on neuroticism experience greater feelings of workload, stress, tense arousal, worry, distress, and negative affect than do low-neuroticism individuals, even when they are able to maintain the same levels of performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1555343412444606">Guznov, Matthews, &amp; Warm, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1555343412444606">Matthews et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-1555343412444606">Szalma &amp; Teo, 2010</xref>). This correlation is more pronounced when the task has high levels of uncertainty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1555343412444606">Kustabayeva et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1555343412444606">Matthews et al., 2010</xref>) or the stressors are social in nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1555343412444606">Guznov et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1555343412444606">Matthews et al., 2010</xref>). This suggests that for high-neuroticism individuals, realistic expectations of situations may lead to higher performance. It also suggests that high-neuroticism individuals may be more adept at tasks that have fewer teamwork requirements.</p>
<p>Extraversion is “an orientation of one’s interests and energies toward the outer world of people and things rather than the inner world of subjective experience … [and is] characterized by positive affect and sociability” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr113-1555343412444606">Vandenbos, 2007</xref>, p. 359). Although there is strong evidence of the existence of this personality trait, the evidence with regard to its correlation to performance is not as strong as that of neuroticism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-1555343412444606">Tett et al., 1991</xref>). If a relationship exists between extraversion and performance, it is a positive correlation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1555343412444606">Palinkas, 2001</xref>). The correlation is strongest when the tasks have a social element (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1555343412444606">Mastin et al., 2005</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1555343412444606">Mastin et al. (2005)</xref> suggested that high-extraversion individuals are energized by the opportunities to be around others. To be clear, high-extraversion individuals do not perform better or worse on teams, but they do perform better with others around. Conversely, high-neuroticism individuals do not perform better or worse when others are around but do perform worse on teams.</p>
<p>Conscientiousness is “the tendency to be organized, responsible, and hardworking” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr113-1555343412444606">Vandenbos, 2007</xref>, p. 218). Conscientiousness is one of the traits in the five-factor model. As noted, there is agreement between the five-factor model, alternative five-factor model, and three-factor model on the existence of neuroticism and extraversion but not on other traits. That said, there is overlap between (a) conscientiousness; (b) psychoticism, “characterized by aggression, impulsivity, aloofness, and antisocial behavior” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr113-1555343412444606">Vandenbos, 2007</xref>, p. 757) in the three-factor model; and (c) impulsivity in the alternate five-factor model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr118-1555343412444606">Zuckerman et al., 1993</xref>). This is surprising, as both conscientiousness from the five-factor model and impulsivity from the alternate five-factor model have shown positive correlations to performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1555343412444606">Branscome et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1555343412444606">Cosenzo et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1555343412444606">Lubin et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1555343412444606">Matthews et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1555343412444606">Palinkas, 2001</xref>). If the factors do overlap, one would expect that conscientiousness would be positively correlated and impulsivity would be negatively correlated. Further research is needed to understand the relationship of conscientiousness and impulsivity to each other and to performance. It is likely that the relationship depends on the nature of the task.</p>

<sec id="section12-1555343412444606">
<title>Microlevel personality traits</title>
<p>Despite the fact that the macrolevel view of personality is more parsimonious, the microlevel view allows a researcher to examine relationships between specific personality traits and specific tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-1555343412444606">Tett et al., 1991</xref>). As such, it may be more practical to examine the microlevel of personality for predicting future performance than to examine the macrolevel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-1555343412444606">Tett et al., 1991</xref>). However, there is no universal list of microlevel traits. As such, researchers often develop measures of traits that are similar to or overlap with other microlevel traits. This makes it challenging for those researching cognitive readiness to be aware of all pertinent microlevel personality traits. As can be seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1555343412444606">Table 2</xref>, several traits, including need for certainty, self-control, and hardiness have been theorized to affect cognitive readiness. However, propensity for cognitive failures and distress tolerance are two microlevel traits not discussed in the cognitive readiness literature but worthy of further investigation. Each of these is discussed in detail next.</p>
<p>Need for certainty is one microlevel trait that has many names, including “intolerance of ambiguity” and “need for cognitive structures” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1555343412444606">Bar-Tal et al., 1999</xref>). By any name, need for certainty is clearly important to cognitive readiness, when one considers that uncertainty is inevitable in military operations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1555343412444606">Fletcher, 2004</xref>). There are several scales for this trait; the two most often used in cognitive readiness research are the Uncertainty Response Scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1555343412444606">Greco and Roger, 2001</xref>) and the Need for Cognitive Structures Scale (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1555343412444606">Cosenzo, Fatkin, &amp; Branscome, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>The Uncertainty Response Scale was developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1555343412444606">Greco and Roger (2001)</xref> and has three subscales: (a) Emotional Uncertainty, which measures maladaptive coping to uncertainty; (b) Desire for Change, which measures the degree to which an individual likes change; and (c) Cognitive Uncertainty, which measures a preference for planning. The scale has shown acceptable reliability and predictive validity. Greco and Roger found that individuals with higher emotional uncertainty experienced higher stress when performing tasks. However, as the individuals gained information during task performance, the stress they experienced reduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1555343412444606">Greco &amp; Roger, 2001</xref>). Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1555343412444606">Cosenzo et al. (2005)</xref> had participants complete emergency response calls in either a high- or a low- stress environment. They found that individuals with high Desire for Change and Cognitive Uncertainty scores completed calls faster than individuals with low Desire for Change and Cognitive Uncertainty. Essentially, the results suggested that individuals comfortable with uncertainty, as measured by the Uncertainty Response Scale, performed better in uncertain environments than did those who prefer certainty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1555343412444606">Cosenzo et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>The Need for Cognitive Structures Scale was developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1555343412444606">Bar-Tal et al. (1999)</xref> in conjunction with the Ability to Achieve Cognitive Structures Scale, discussed in the section on expertise. Need for cognitive structures is related to uncertainty in that individuals with low need for cognitive structures are comfortable even if they are not certain about the information, whereas individuals with high need for cognitive structures feel uncomfortable if the information is not organized in some way (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-1555343412444606">Sutton, Cosenzo, &amp; Pierce, 2004</xref>). However, interpretation of the Need for Cognitive Structures Scale almost always requires the use of the Ability to Acquire Cognitive Structures Scale. Essentially, need for cognitive structures is a mediator for ability to achieve cognitive structures in terms of the difficulty of making decisions under stress. Individuals with a low ability to achieve cognitive structures (i.e., sensemaking ability) and a high need for cognitive structures experience more difficulty than do those with a low ability to achieve cognitive structures and a low need for cognitive structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1555343412444606">Bar-Tal et al., 1999</xref>). Conversely, those individuals with high ability to achieve cognitive structures and high need for cognitive structures experience less difficulty than do those with a high ability to achieve cognitive structures and a low need for cognitive structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1555343412444606">Bar-Tal et al., 1999</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1555343412444606">Bar-Tal et al. (1999)</xref> described individuals with a high need for cognitive structures and high ability to achieve cognitive structures as having functional impulsivity and those individuals with low need for cognitive structures and low ability to achieve cognitive structures as having dysfunctional impulsivity.</p>
<p>Another factor that repeatedly appears in the literature is hardiness (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1555343412444606">Table 2</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1555343412444606">Bartone, Roland, Picano, and Williams (2008)</xref> defined hardiness as a “psychological style associated with resilience, good [psychological] health, and performance under a range of stressful conditions” (p. 78). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1555343412444606">Bartone (1991)</xref> developed and validated the Dispositional Resilience Scale, also known as the Bartone Hardiness Scale. The scale has shown to be significantly correlated to success in a special forces training course (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1555343412444606">Bartone et al., 2008</xref>) and to good psychological health after exposure to combat and life stressors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1555343412444606">Bartone, 1999</xref>). More recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1555343412444606">Hystad, Eid, Laberg, and Bartone (2011)</xref> found that a Norwegian version of the Bartone Hardiness Scale administered during the 1st week of a 3-week selection period successfully predicted the candidates who were admitted into military officer schools.</p>
<p>A related construct, self-control was also mentioned in the literature (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1555343412444606">Table 2</xref>). Self-control is defined as controlling thoughts, emotions, impulses, and performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1555343412444606">Baumeister, Stillwell, &amp; Hetherton, 1994</xref>). Self-control is characterized by the ability to “change inner responses as well as interrupt undesired behaviors” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-1555343412444606">Tangney, Baumeister, &amp; Boone, 2004</xref>, p. 275). Self-control is similar to hardiness in that both relate to controlling emotions and performance. However, hardiness emphasizes the ability to handle highly stressful situations, whereas self-control relates more to normal daily stressors. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-1555343412444606">Tangney et al. (2004)</xref> reviewed several measures of self-control and found them lacking in terms of practicality, validity, and reliability. Thus, they developed the Self Control Scale and reported acceptable validity and reliability for it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-1555343412444606">Tangney et al., 2004</xref>). Finally, research has shown self-control to be correlated with numerous positive outcomes, such as psychological health, higher grades, and interpersonal success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-1555343412444606">Tangney et al., 2004</xref>). However, research is needed with regard to the effect of self-control on the experience of stress and performance, particularly in military operations.</p>
<p>Distress tolerance is a construct that relates to both hardiness and need for certainty but was not discussed in the reviewed literature. Specifically, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr119-1555343412444606">Zvolensky, Vujanovic, Bernstein, and Leyro (2010)</xref> presented a model of distress tolerance in which tolerance of uncertainty, tolerance of ambiguity, tolerance of frustration, tolerance of negative emotion, and tolerance of physical discomfort are components of distress tolerance. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-1555343412444606">Simons and Gaher (2005)</xref> defined distress tolerance as a “meta-emotion construct that consists of one’s evaluations and expectancies of experiencing negative emotional states” (p. 83). Despite the newness of this construct, the Distress Tolerance Scale has demonstrated acceptable reliability and validity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-1555343412444606">Simons &amp; Gaher, 2005</xref>). Furthermore, research has found that distress tolerance is correlated to the severity of posttraumatic stress disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1555343412444606">Marshall-Berenz, Vujanovic, Bonn-Miller, Bernstein, &amp; Zvolensky, 2010</xref>). As with self-control, additional research is needed to understand the relationship of distress tolerance with performance in military operations.</p>
<p>A final related construct is propensity for cognitive failures. As with distress tolerance, this construct was not reported in the reviewed cognitive readiness literature. Proffered by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1555343412444606">Broadbent, Cooper, Fitzgerald, and Parkes (1982)</xref>, the Cognitive Failures Questionnaire is a measure of distractibility and error proneness. It has been shown to have a correlation with vulnerability to stress as well as a correlation to the number of accidents an individual experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1555343412444606">Larson, Alderton, Neideffer, &amp; Underhill, 1997</xref>), both of which are inherent to military cognitive readiness.</p>
<p>In summary, there is strong evidence that an individual’s personality may affect his or her ability to complete a specific task. However, there is research that still needs to be conducted to fully understand these relationships. For example, distress tolerance, self-control, and hardiness are three different microlevel personality traits that have valid measures but appear to be very similar. There are other similar personality constructs in the literature as well (e.g., explanatory style; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1555343412444606">Peterson, 1991</xref>). Furthermore, microlevel and macrolevel personality measures have not been compared in terms of predictive power and parsimony. More generally, future research is needed to identify which measure or combination of measures is most predictive of fitness for duty in military operations. When this research is completed, personality measures might be pertinent for inclusion in a measure of strategic cognitive readiness.</p>

<title>Cognitive Capabilities</title>
<p>After personality measures, measures of cognitive capabilities are the second-most-common measures used for personnel selection in private industry. Within the military, cognitive capability measures are the most commonly used for selection and assignment. Cognitive capabilities cited in the reviewed literature included intelligence, speed of processing, agility, and memory capacity (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1555343412444606">Table 2</xref>). An individual who has greater cognitive capability will use less mental workload in performing a given cognitive task. Thus, individuals with greater cognitive capabilities will have higher levels of cognitive readiness.</p>
<p>Cognitive capabilities are most commonly assessed by measures of general intelligence, or <italic>g</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1555343412444606">Matthews et al., 2004</xref>). Intelligence as measured by <italic>g</italic> is the most validated predictor of an individual’s competence and job performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1555343412444606">Blair, Gamson, Thorne, &amp; Baker, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-1555343412444606">Sternberg &amp; Hedlund, 2002</xref>). Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1555343412444606">Gottfredson (1997)</xref> reported that individuals who measured high in <italic>g</italic> are better able to handle complexity. That is, the more complex and unpredictable a work environment (e.g., military operations), the more important intelligence is to success.</p>
<p>The concepts of rapid execution, agility, and memory skills are concepts that appeared frequently in the reviewed cognitive readiness literature (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1555343412444606">Table 2</xref>) and are closely linked to intelligence. Intelligence is often viewed as tantamount with speed of processing or execution speed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1555343412444606">Neisser et al., 1996</xref>). The link between speed of processing and intelligence is strongest when the tasks are highly complex, such as military operations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1555343412444606">Conway, Cowan, Bunting, Therriault, &amp; Minkoff, 2002</xref>). Agility occurred frequently in the reviewed cognitive readiness literature but with multiple definitions. Most often, agility was linked with processing speed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr106-1555343412444606">Tillson et al., 2005</xref>). Memory capacity, particularly, working memory capacity, has also been postulated to have a very strong link to <italic>g</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1555343412444606">Conway et al., 2002</xref>). The link is so strong, that it has been speculated that <italic>g</italic> is working memory capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1555343412444606">Conway et al., 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>In short, memory capacity, rapid execution, and agility are all correlated to <italic>g</italic>, which is measured by intelligence tests, such as the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale. The SAT, ACT, and Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery (ASVAB) are also correlated to <italic>g</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1555343412444606">Koenig, Frey, &amp; Detterman, 2008</xref>). As all U.S. military personnel have taken at least one of these tests (i.e., SAT, ACT, or ASVAB) prior to military service, it would be more practical for future research and development of a cognitive readiness measure to investigate the use of the ACT, SAT, and ASVAB rather than intelligence tests as a measure of cognitive capabilities.</p>

<title>Adaptability and Creativity</title>
<p>Finally, the interrelated constructs of creativity and adaptability often appeared in the reviewed literature (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1555343412444606">Table 2</xref>). Creativity was commonly viewed as the ability to deal with novel challenges by generating new ideas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1555343412444606">Morrison &amp; Fletcher, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-1555343412444606">Sternberg &amp; The Rainbow Project Collaborators, 2006</xref>). Adaptability could best be defined as an aptitude for performing effectively in changing environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1555343412444606">Ployhart &amp; Bliese, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr106-1555343412444606">Tillson et al., 2005</xref>). Effective performance in changing environments involves either (a) selecting the appropriate procedure or (b) generating a new response. Thus, creativity is often viewed as a critical component to adaptability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1555343412444606">Ployhart &amp; Bliese, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1555343412444606">Pulakos et al., 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Adaptable performance has often been called <italic>genius</italic> (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1555343412444606">Lowe &amp; Ng, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-1555343412444606">Sternberg, 2001a</xref>). However, it is my belief that it is the rareness of adaptable performance that leads people to make this linkage. It is not that adaptability as an attribute is rare. Rather, situations that allow for adaptive performance are few and far between. To be clear, adaptability and creativity are aptitudes; creative and adaptive performance are the realization of these aptitudes. Numerous situational, organizational, social, and individual factors are needed for the occurrence of highly creative or adaptive performance.</p>
<p>Specifically, adaptive performance requires deep knowledge of the task procedures as well as situation awareness. Without situation awareness, the individual would not recognize that the situation had changed. Furthermore, without a deep knowledge base, the individual would not know how to select or create a new procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr108-1555343412444606">Tucker et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr116-1555343412444606">White et al., 2005</xref>). In fact, measures of adaptability have shown a positive correlation with education level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1555343412444606">McNeely, O’Connell, &amp; Hall, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition, adaptive and creative performance require decision making and metacognition. For a person to make a decision about a course of action (novel or otherwise) in a changing environment, the individual often has to define the problem space in a new way (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-1555343412444606">Sternberg &amp; Vroom, 2002</xref>). This definition of the constraints or problem space is a key step in the decision-making process. Adaptive and creative performance also showcase high metacognition, because inherent in redefining the problem space is the recognition that the current knowledge and viewpoint are affecting the decision making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-1555343412444606">Sternberg &amp; Vroom, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Similarly, for someone to be creative or adaptive requires the person be motivated to do so. Therefore, environmental and social factors can reduce creative and adaptive performance. More specifically, proposing a creative idea requires defying convention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-1555343412444606">Sternberg, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-1555343412444606">Sternberg &amp; Vroom, 2002</xref>). If an environment does not support risk taking, then individuals will not attempt to be creative; rather, they will follow proscribed procedures. This explains why measures of adaptability are positively correlated with measures of personal control, job satisfaction, commitment, and managerial support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1555343412444606">McNeely et al., 2004</xref>). Furthermore, highly creative individuals often have high self-efficacy and are highly motivated to learn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-1555343412444606">Sternberg &amp; Vroom, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Adaptive performance overlaps so much with the theoretical components of cognitive readiness that it could be viewed as synonymous. However, measures of adaptability, such as the Individual Adaptability Measure (I-ADAPT-M; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1555343412444606">Ployhart &amp; Bliese, 2006</xref>) and the McNeely Adaptability Scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1555343412444606">McNeely et al., 2004</xref>), were designed to be applicable regardless of task or environment. Conversely, I have characterized cognitive readiness as fitness to a task. As such, the nature of the task is important to the measure of cognitive readiness, and this factor distinguishes adaptability from cognitive readiness. Still, the degree to which an individual has a proclivity for adaptive or creative performance increases his or her cognitive readiness. Therefore, measures of adaptability and creativity should be examined in the development of measures of cognitive readiness.</p>
<p>The two measures of adaptability mentioned previously (i.e., I-ADAPT-M and the McNeely Adaptability Scale) have acceptable reliability. In addition, the I-ADAPT-M has acceptable construct validity. However, predictive validity assessments could not be found for either measure. Thus, further investigation of both measures is needed. In contrast, there are several creativity measures that have acceptable reliability and validity. These include the Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1555343412444606">Kim, Cramond, &amp; Bandalos, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr107-1555343412444606">Torrance, 1974</xref>), the Sternberg Triarchic Abilities Test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-1555343412444606">Sternberg &amp; The Rainbow Project Collaborators, 2006</xref>), and the Rainbow Measures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-1555343412444606">Sternberg &amp; The Rainbow Project Collaborators, 2006</xref>).</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In conclusion, military cognitive readiness is a new but important construct for ensuring the performance and psychological health of military personnel. Many have theorized and researched on this topic. However, the literature has suffered from a lack of a common definition. In fact, one can identify three distinct constructs, which I have equated with the military levels of war and readiness: strategic, operational, and tactical. This review focused on identifying the psychological constructs inherent to strategic and operational cognitive readiness. In addition, the measures of these supporting constructs were reviewed. I conclude this review by proposing models of operational and strategic cognitive readiness, which should serve as the foundation of a development plan for operational and strategic cognitive readiness measures.</p>
<sec id="section16-1555343412444606">
<title>Operational Cognitive Readiness</title>
<p>The following constructs from the reviewed literature are pertinent to operational cognitive readiness: knowledge of the military and the deployment environment, motivation (self-efficacy and locus of control), expertise (tacit knowledge, automaticity, and sensemaking), and cognitive functions (decision-making skills and metacognition). These constructs should be considered for operational cognitive readiness versus strategic cognitive readiness, because they are the most malleable. That is, they are the constructs that can be changed through training and experience. As such, measuring these constructs close to deployment will provide an indication of fitness for the cognitive demands of that deployment.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, not all of these constructs have validated measures (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1555343412444606">Table 3</xref>). Therefore, researchers should pursue development of knowledge and expertise measures using the procedures advocated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1555343412444606">Kraiger, Ford, and Salas (1993)</xref>. These measures should cover military and deployment area information, as described earlier. Furthermore, researchers should investigate the validity of the Military Scenarios Instrument and the Organizational Scenarios Instrument as measures of military decision making. Additional research into the Trait Self Regulation Questionnaire as a more parsimonious measure of metacognition and self-efficacy is also recommended. Finally, research evaluating whether <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1555343412444606">Rotter’s (1966)</xref> Locus of Control measure or a military-specific Work Locus of Control measure is more predictive of military performance is recommended.</p>

<p>After a validated measure of each construct has been identified, researchers should investigate how the measures should be weighted to best predict military cognitive performance. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1555343412444606">Figure 1</xref> represents a theorized notion of how these constructs may interact when used to measure operational cognitive readiness and predict performance. Specifically, I theorize that knowledge and expertise will be captured in one factor, as will metacognition and decision making. Each of these, along with motivation, will have strong predictive validity of performance in military operations but will also be correlated with the others. As such, the amount of weight to assign each measure must be determined. Determination of the weights for each construct in predicting fitness and ergo performance requires access to military personnel before and during a large-scale military exercise or similar opportunity to examine performance. Specifically, prior to the exercise, the personnel would complete the selected measures. These measures would then be analyzed against the performance of the participants.</p>

<title>Strategic Cognitive Readiness</title>
<p>The following constructs from the reviewed literature are pertinent to strategic cognitive readiness as defined previously: cognitive capabilities (intelligence), personality (various macro- and microlevel traits), general knowledge and skills (breadth of knowledge, technological competency, and psychomotor abilities), creativity, and adaptability. Each of these constructs, with the exception of general knowledge and skills, represents individual traits that are not likely to be altered by training or life experience. As such, these constructs are more useful in identifying the individuals who will best be capable of success in military operations before they receive any training. These constructs also can be used to identify the occupational specialty each recruit should pursue within the military. Unlike the other constructs within strategic cognitive readiness, general knowledge and skills is malleable. It is included in the strategic cognitive readiness measures because it provides an indication of what foundational training may be necessary prior to the occupational specific training.</p>
<p>As can be seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1555343412444606">Table 4</xref>, most of these constructs have valid measures. In fact, validated measures were found for each construct except breadth of knowledge and technological literacy. Thus, researchers should pursue development of both. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1555343412444606">Gamire and Pearson (2006)</xref> provide a good outline for the development of a technological competency measure. Researchers should also investigate the measures in each construct, particularly, the personality measures, to identify which has the best predictive validity as well as which is the most practical for military selection.</p>

Specifically, I theorize that cognitive capabilities will have the strongest weight not only because it is a strong predictor of performance but also because it is correlated with knowledge, creativity, and adaptability as well. Personality will have the second-strongest weight because of its strength in predicting performance, and it is correlated with creativity and adaptability. Adaptability will have the lowest weight, as each of the other constructs is correlated with it. However, the specific weights of each construct must be investigated. This research will require access to military recruits just before basic training and through advanced training. Specifically, at the beginning of basic training, recruits should be asked to complete the selected measures. These scores combined with the scores from the cognitive capability measures used already in selection should be analyzed against the recruits’ performance in basic and advanced training.</p>

<title>Implications</title>
<p>Military cognitive readiness is a new but important construct for ensuring the health and performance of military personnel. As with many new constructs, researchers have applied the term <italic>cognitive readiness</italic> to several theoretically different but related constructs. In this article, I have reviewed the literature and attempted to disambiguate military cognitive readiness into three separate constructs. In addition, I presented a path ahead for research and development of measures for two of these three constructs, operational and strategic cognitive readiness, by reviewing the literature on each of the psychological constructs that others had deemed inherent to cognitive readiness. It is hoped that this article provides a foundation for the development of valid measures of strategic and operational cognitive readiness that will assist in the selection and assessment of military personnel as well as advance our knowledge of these important constructs.</p>
