<abstract>
<p>The objective of this study was to examine the associations of family, school, peer, and attitudinal factors with cannabis use among three immigrant generations of youth. The sample consisted of 3,134 students from the 2009 Ontario Student Drug Use and Health Survey, a provincewide survey of 7th- to 12th-grade students. Results indicate that the odds of using cannabis were lower among first-generation immigrant youth than among second as well as third and later generations. The immigrant generations were more similar than different in the significance of family, school, peers, and attitudinal factors on cannabis use. Parental education, however, was found to differ in its effect on cannabis use across generations. Findings suggest that factors that influence cannabis use may be similar across immigrant generations and that further research is needed on the effects of parental education and the mechanisms through which protection and risk to immigrant generations occur.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The use of cannabis among youth is of concern because of the often-risky nature of such use and the negative consequences and harm that may accrue into adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022042612436652">Canadian Centre on Substance Abuse, 2007</xref>). This has led to much research on the factors that may influence cannabis and other drug use among adolescents, especially with regard to family, school, and peers. Family factors such as good parental support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022042612436652">Felix-Ortiz, Fernandez, &amp; Newcomb, 1998</xref>) and monitoring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022042612436652">Branstetter, Furman, &amp; Cottrell, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022042612436652">Ledoux, Miller, Choquet, &amp; Plant, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022042612436652">Piko &amp; Fitzpatrick, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0022042612436652">Wang, Simons-Morton, Farhart, &amp; Luk, 2009</xref>), high parental involvement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022042612436652">King, Vidourek, &amp; Wagner, 2003</xref>), good parent–adolescent relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022042612436652">Ledoux et al., 2002</xref>), and living in an intact family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022042612436652">Kuntsche &amp; Silbereisen, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022042612436652">Ledoux et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022042612436652">McArdle et al., 2002</xref>) have been associated with lower risk of drug use. School-related factors such as skipping classes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022042612436652">Hallfors, Cho, Brodish, Flewelling, &amp; Khatapoush, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0022042612436652">Vucina &amp; Becirevic, 2007</xref>) and poor academic achievement have also been associated with greater risk of drug use. The influence of peers has been evident in research findings that adolescents who have friends who use drugs are at greater risk of drug use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022042612436652">Chabrol et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022042612436652">Mandara &amp; Murray, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0022042612436652">Saint-Jean, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>An important consideration in thinking about potential influences on cannabis use during adolescence is the role of sociocultural factors. The adolescent years may be more precarious for foreign-born youth and native-born youth with foreign-born parents than for other adolescents because many immigrants find themselves caught between two cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022042612436652">Harris, 1999</xref>). Research suggests that as immigrants become more acculturated, they adopt the attitudes, social norms, and behaviors of the mainstream or a social reference group within their adopted country (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022042612436652">Gil, Vega, &amp; Dimas, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0022042612436652">Vega &amp; Amaro, 1994</xref>). As early theories suggest, the process of assimilation takes place over generations, rather than within a single generation, with each subsequent generation becoming more mainstream than the last (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022042612436652">Alba, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022042612436652">Gordon, 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022042612436652">Harris, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0022042612436652">Rumbaut, 1997</xref>). According to this view, native-born children of immigrant parents (second generation) will have adopted cultural norms and values that reflect Canadian society to a greater degree than foreign-born, first-generation children. Furthermore, native-born children of native-born parents (third and later generations) will have adopted the values and norms of the host culture to a greater extent than second-generation children. Thus, the behavior of foreign-born children may be based more on their socialization in their country of origin, whereas the behavior of second-generation children may more likely reflect the host culture despite attempts by immigrant parents to maintain some traditions and values from their country of origin.</p>
<p>Much of the existing research on cannabis use among immigrant generations of youth indicates lower prevalence rates of drug use generally among foreign-born than native-born youth (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022042612436652">Blake, Ledsky, Goodenow, &amp; O’Donnell, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022042612436652">Canadian Council on Social Development, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022042612436652">Gfroerer &amp; Tan, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022042612436652">Hamilton, Noh, &amp; Adlaf, 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0022042612436652">Pena et al., 2008</xref>). There are several perspectives on the lower risk of drug use among foreign-born youth. A protective culture perspective suggests that less drug use among the foreign born may be due to the protection afforded them by their culture, which may be exemplified by greater social and family bonds as well as more motivation for academic and career achievement compared with native-born peers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022042612436652">Kulis, Marsiglia, Sicotte, &amp; Nieri, 2007</xref>). Greater monitoring of behavior by immigrant parents and close-knit community members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0022042612436652">Zhou, 1997</xref>) may have similar effects. A resilient immigrant perspective would suggest that immigrants may simply be more resilient to factors that tend to increase risk of drug use because the immigrant selection process favors more highly resilient individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022042612436652">Burnam, Hough, Karno, Escobar, &amp; Telles, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0022042612436652">Vega et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0022042612436652">Vega, Sribney, Aguilar-Gaxiola, &amp; Kolody, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Although immigrants may be somewhat protected by their culture, aspects of family relationships may be negatively affected by the acculturative process. Arguments suggesting greater risk of drug use and other health-risk behaviors among adolescents with foreign-born parents often rely on the conflict that may arise due to different rates of acculturation between parents and children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0022042612436652">Phinney, Ong, &amp; Madden, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0022042612436652">Portes &amp; Rumbaut, 2001</xref>). Relationships between parents and children are usually disrupted because of the migration process, which contribute to acculturative stress and intergenerational conflict (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0022042612436652">Zhou, 1997</xref>). Foreign-born youth are often torn between upholding the traditional values from home countries that are often stressed by parents and engaging in behaviors that will hasten their acceptance into a particular peer group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0022042612436652">Zhou, 1997</xref>). Such youth may also experience role reversal wherein they are involved in parental activities in which they normally would not be involved if not for adaptation difficulties experienced by their parents, for example, poor English language proficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022042612436652">Coll &amp; Magnuson, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0022042612436652">Zhou, 1997</xref>). Family conflicts and detachments can result in greater susceptibility to peer pressure, which, in turn, may elevate the risk for adolescent drug use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022042612436652">McQueen, Getz, &amp; Bray, 2003</xref>). There have been research reports of greater pressure from peers to engage in violence and substance use, as well as reports of less support from parents to resist such pressures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022042612436652">Blake et al., 2001</xref>). There is also some research suggesting greater risk behaviors among immigrant youth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022042612436652">Brindis, Wolfe, McCarter, Ball, &amp; Starbuck-Morales, 1995</xref>; Romero, Martinez, &amp; Carvajal, 2001).</p>
<p>Despite research examining differences in cannabis use across immigrant generations, much less attention has focused on whether factors often associated with substance use in the general population differ in their influence on immigrant generations of youth. Given that the reasons for engaging in behavior problems such as drug use may involve factors such as peer pressures and family conflict, and that the extent to which these are experienced may vary across immigrant generations, it is important to examine the degree of importance of these factors in drug use for different immigrant generations of youth. The main objective of this study is to examine the associations of family, school, peer, and attitudinal factors with cannabis use separately for three immigrant generations of youth—first, second, and third and later generations. Attitudinal factors reflect individual’s approval or disapproval of drug use and perception of the risks associated with drug use, and have been found to be associated with individual drug use among adolescents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022042612436652">Kilmer, Hunt, Lee, &amp; Neighbors, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022042612436652">Martins, Storr, Alexandre, &amp; Chilcoat, 2008</xref>). Such attitudinal factors may be particularly important for foreign-born youth given that attitudes may be driven by culture. Studies of three or more immigrant generations are especially lacking in the area of cannabis use.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section3-0022042612436652">
<title>Data</title>
<p>Data for this study were derived from the 2009 Ontario Student Drug Use and Health Survey (OSDUHS), a provincewide survey of 7th- to 12th-grade students within regular public or Catholic schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022042612436652">Paglia-Boak, Mann, Adlaf, &amp; Rehm, 2009</xref>). The survey was administered in classrooms through anonymous, student-completed questionnaires. Conducted every odd year since 1977, OSDUHS employs a two-stage cluster design involving a random selection of classes from within a random selection of schools (probability proportional to size) stratified by region and school type (elementary/middle or secondary). The 2009 total sample was 9,112 students from 47 school boards, 181 schools, and 573 classrooms. The completion rate for students was 65%. Absenteeism (13%) and unreturned forms or lack of parental consent (22%) were the main reasons for noncompletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022042612436652">Paglia-Boak et al., 2009</xref>). Specific items important to this study (e.g., friends who use drugs) were only asked of a random half sample of 4,261 students, and thus this half sample is the basis for these analyses. Individuals who were less than 12 or older than 19 years of age were excluded from analyses. The Research Ethics Board of the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health approved the OSDUHS survey. Further details regarding the study design are available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.camh.net/research/population_life_course.html">http://www.camh.net/research/population_life_course.html</ext-link> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022042612436652">Paglia-Boak et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0022042612436652">
<title>Measures</title>
<p>The dependent variable, <italic>cannabis use</italic>, was based on a survey question asking the frequency of cannabis use in the last 12 months. Cannabis was also referred to as marijuana, hashish, hash oil, “pot,” “weed,” “grass,” and “hash.” Respondents were provided with eight response choices. Responses were collapsed to create a binary (yes/no) measure of cannabis use. Respondents who indicated that they used cannabis at least once in the last 12 months were classified as having used cannabis (yes). Those respondents who did not use in the 12 months prior to the survey, who have never used cannabis, or who reported that they did not know what cannabis is were classified as not having used cannabis in the last 12 months (no).</p>
<p>The independent variable, <italic>immigrant generation</italic>, is represented by dummy variables contrasting three groups. First-generation immigrants are foreign-born youth. Second-generation immigrants are native-born youth (i.e., Canadian born) with at least one parent who is foreign born. Third- and later-generation immigrants are native-born youth with native-born parents.</p>
<sec id="section5-0022042612436652">
<title>Relationship with parents</title>
<p>Two factors were used to examine family process. <italic>Parent–adolescent relationship</italic> was derived from two questions: “How well would you say you are getting along with your mother?” and “How well would you say you are getting along with your father?” Respondents could respond that they were getting along very well, OK, or not well to each question. Responses to the two questions were combined to create a dichotomous measure where 1 represents students who get along well or OK with both parents (or with one parent if they have only one parent) and 0 represents students who do not get along with one or both of their two parents and students with one parent who do not get along with that parent. <italic>Parental monitoring</italic> was based on the question “In your free time away from home, how often does at least one of your parents know where you are?” Response choices ranged from 1 (<italic>always</italic>) to 5 (<italic>never</italic>). The measure was recoded to represent parents always having knowledge of students’ whereabouts (1) versus not always having such knowledge (0).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0022042612436652">
<title>School</title>
<p>Three variables were used to assess school factors. A <italic>skipped class</italic> measure was based on a question asking students how often in the last 4 weeks have they “gone to school, but skipped a class when you weren’t supposed to?” Response choices were recoded to reflect a dichotomous measure of never skipped versus skipped a class. <italic>Academic performance</italic> reflects grades in school and was measured as usually gets “As” (1) versus do not usually get “As” (0). <italic>Drug access</italic> was measured by a question asking if anyone had offered, sold, or given the student an illegal drug on school property. Response choices were yes (1) or no (0).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0022042612436652">
<title>Friends’ drug use</title>
<p>Use of drugs by respondents’ peers was assessed by a question asking students to indicate the proportion of their close friends who use marijuana or hashish. Responses were collapsed into three categories: none, some, and about half or more.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0022042612436652">
<title>Attitudes toward cannabis use</title>
<p>Two measures were used to assess attitudes. <italic>Disapproval of cannabis use</italic> was based on responses to a question asking students if they disapproved of adults smoking marijuana regularly. Response choices were “don’t disapprove,” “disapprove,” and “strongly disapprove.” The categories for disapprove and strongly disapprove were combined to create a dichotomous measure of disapprove (1) versus do not disapprove (0). <italic>Risk of harm</italic> was based on a question asking students the degree to which they thought “people risked harming themselves (physically or in other ways)” if they smoked marijuana regularly. Response choices were “no risk,” “slight risk,” “medium risk,” “great risk,” and “don’t know.” Responses were grouped to create a dichotomous measure of great risk (1) versus no, slight, or medium risk (0). “Don’t know” responses were treated as missing.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0022042612436652">
<title>Parental education</title>
<p>This measure was constructed by combining two questions on father’s and mother’s highest level of education. Parental education was a categorical measure reflecting the education of the parent with the highest level of education. Parental education responses were grouped into three categories: (1) high school or less, (2) some college or university, and (3) university degree. The approximately 10% of respondents who reported that they did not know their parents’ educational level were treated as missing cases. Analyses indicate that “don’t know” respondents to parental education tended to be younger (63.7% were aged 12-14 years and 81.6% were aged 12-15 years) than those who knew their parents’ highest level of education.</p>
<p>Additional measures included gender measured as male or female, respondent age measured as individual years ranging from 12 to 19, and family structure measured as living with two biological or adoptive parents (1) versus living in other family types (0).</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0022042612436652">
<title>Analyses</title>
<p>Given the complex sample design, Taylor series methods within Stata 11 were used to compute unbiased variances, standard errors, and point estimates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0022042612436652">StataCorp, 2009</xref>). Analyses were weighted to adjust for the unequal probability of selection. Logistic regression was used to examine associations between immigrant generation and cannabis use. Analyses were also conducted separately for first, second, and third and later generations of immigrants. Given the use of separate group analyses (by immigrant generation) and a binary dependent variable, additional analyses were conducted to test for unequal residual variation across immigrant generations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022042612436652">Allison, 1999</xref>). Heterogeneous choice models under ordinal generalized linear models were used to test for unequal residual variation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0022042612436652">Williams, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0022042612436652">2009</xref>). None of the tests were significant, which indicated that findings of differences between groups were not due to unobserved heterogeneity. Wald tests were subsequently used to test the significance of differences between immigrant generations.</p>
<p>Missing cases on each variable ranged from 0% to 2.3%, with the exception of “don’t know” responses on parental education (10.4%), friends who use illegal drugs (9.1%), and beliefs about cannabis use (5.3%). “Don’t know” responses were treated as missing and were handled using listwise deletion.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Characteristics of the sample are outlined in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0022042612436652">Table 1</xref>. The students were approximately 15 years of age on average, 48.5% were male, and 47.2% had parents with a university degree. Almost 40% reported that their close friends did not use drugs, 77% disapproved of adults using cannabis on a regular basis, and 59% felt that people who used cannabis regularly risked great harm to themselves. Comparisons between immigrant generations indicate that first-generation immigrant students have more highly educated parents, they get better grades in school, they are more likely to disapprove of regular use of cannabis, and believe that there is great risk from regular use of cannabis. Third-generation immigrant students have a greater proportion of close friends who use drugs, they are less likely to disapprove of regular use of cannabis, and they are more likely to see minimal risk in regular use.</p>

<p>The results of logistic regression analyses examining the association between immigrant generation and cannabis use are outlined in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0022042612436652">Table 2</xref>. Model 1 includes controls for age, gender, family structure, parent–adolescent relationships, and parental education. Despite these controls, first- and second-generation immigrant youth were found to have lower odds of using cannabis than third and later generations. Additional analyses using Wald tests indicated that there was no significant difference between first and second generation in the odds of using cannabis. Model 2 includes additional controls for school factors, peer drug use, and attitudes toward cannabis use. Consistent with Model 1, first-generation immigrant youth had significantly lower odds of using cannabis than third and later generations. The odd ratio among first-generation immigrant youth was 41% less than the odds among their third-generation counterparts. This represents an increase in odds of cannabis use once school, peer drug use, and attitudinal factors were considered. In contrast to Model 1, there was no significant difference between second and third and later generations after adjusting for school, peer, and attitudinal factors. An additional Wald test also indicated no significant difference in cannabis use between first and second generations. Model 2 also indicates that the odds of cannabis use increased with age and that the school, peer, and attitudinal factors examined were all significantly related to cannabis use. Skipping classes was associated with greater odds of using cannabis than was not skipping classes. Being offered drugs at school and having close friends who use drugs were associated with greater odds of cannabis use than were not being offered drugs and having no friends who use drugs, respectively. Students who disapproved of adults regularly using cannabis or who believed cannabis use to be harmful had less odds of engaging in cannabis use.</p>

<p>To examine whether factors associated with cannabis use differ across immigrant generations, separate analyses by immigrant generation were conducted. Wald tests were used to test for differences in coefficients between the immigrant generation models. Results of the logistic regression for each immigrant generation are provided in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0022042612436652">Table 3</xref>. Only the final model with adjustments for all covariates is presented for each immigrant generation. Results show more similarities than differences to the fully adjusted final model for the full sample.</p>

<p>The main group difference was in the significance of parental education. Parental education was significantly associated with cannabis use among first- and second-generation immigrant youth but not among third and later generations. The nature of the relationship was also not the same for the first and second generations. Among first-generation immigrants, the odds of cannabis use for youth whose parents had a high school diploma or less were almost 4 times those of youth whose parents had a university degree. Among second-generation immigrants, the odds of cannabis use for youth whose parents had high school or less education were one-third times those of youth with university-educated parents. Wald tests indicated that the effect of parental education among second-generation immigrants was significantly different from its effects among the other immigrant generations, <italic>F</italic>(1, 162) = 10.40, first versus second generation, and <italic>F</italic>(1, 162) = 6.33, second versus third generation. Earlier tests for unequal residual variance across immigrant generations were not significant, thus findings of differences by parental education were not due to unobserved heterogeneity in the immigrant generation subsamples.</p>
<p>The other variables examined showed similar associations with cannabis use across the three immigrant generations of youth. Skipping classes and having close friends who use illegal drugs were consistently associated with significantly greater odds of cannabis use. Despite some cursory evidence for the significance of some factors in one immigrant generation but not another generation (e.g., age, being offered drugs at school, or parental monitoring), Wald tests indicated that such differences were not significant between immigrant generations, with the exception of parental education.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The main objectives of this study were to examine the relationship between immigrant generation and cannabis use, and to determine if particular characteristics are differentially associated with cannabis use across immigrant generations of youth. Research suggesting differences in health-risk behaviors across immigrant generations, with greater risk among later generations have given rise to questions related to whether different factors may contribute to risk behaviors. This study examined the role of demographic characteristics as well as family, school, peer, and attitudinal factors in cannabis use among the full sample as well as subsamples of first-, second-, and third- and later-generation immigrant youth.</p>
<p>Consistent with earlier research showing less drug use among foreign-born youth (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022042612436652">Blake et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022042612436652">Gfroerer &amp; Tan, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0022042612436652">Pena et al., 2008</xref>), findings from the current study indicated that the odds of using cannabis were lower among first- and second-generation immigrant youth than among third and later generations. The gradient-like relationship that is usually suggested between immigrant generation and health-risk behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0022042612436652">Pena et al., 2008</xref>) was not strongly evident for cannabis use when demographic, family, school, and peer-related factors were considered. This suggests that the main difference lies between youth with foreign-born parents and those with native-born parents.</p>
<p>Despite suggestions of immigrant generational differences in how demographic, family, school, and peer factors relate to drug use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0022042612436652">Saint-Jean, 2010</xref>), the current study found little difference across immigrant generations. Using separate group analyses to better delineate differences, only parental education was found to differ across generations in its effect on cannabis use. Among second-generation immigrant youth, those with less educated parents had lower odds of using cannabis than their peers with university-educated parents. This indicates that less parental education may protect second-generation immigrant youth from cannabis use but increase the risk of cannabis use within other immigrant generations. Findings for second-generation immigrant youth are thus contrary to research findings that low socioeconomic status is generally associated with greater risk of drug use among youth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022042612436652">Hamilton et al., 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022042612436652">Hamilton, Noh, &amp; Adlaf, 2009b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022042612436652">Lemstra et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0022042612436652">Pena et al., 2008</xref>). Research specific to cannabis use has been more equivocal, with findings of positive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022042612436652">Bachman, Johnston, &amp; O’Malley, 1981</xref>), negative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0022042612436652">Pena et al., 2008</xref>), and no associations with socioeconomic status variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022042612436652">Chedebois et al., 2009</xref>). The parental education findings in the current study indicate that there is something about an education level of high school or less among parents that confers some protection to native-born children of foreign-born parents, at least with regard to cannabis use. Further research is needed to investigate factors that contribute to the effects of parental education and the mechanisms through which protection and risk to immigrant generations occur.</p>
<p>There are several limitations to this study that should be noted. The analyses could only determine the association between cannabis use and particular aspects of family, peers, school, and attitudes toward drugs because of the cross-sectional nature of the data. It could not be determined whether particular factors influenced cannabis use or whether cannabis use influenced aspects of family, peers, and other variables of interest. Another limitation is that data on country of birth, length of residence in adopted country, and age at arrival were unavailable; thus, an important aspect of acculturation could not be considered in analyses. This was also the case for race and ethnicity because such information was not included within the data. Inability to adjust for race and ethnicity means that unobserved differences in the ethnic composition of different immigrant generations may account for some generational differences in cannabis use given the ethnic diversity of the population sampled. The province in which the survey was conducted is home to approximately 55% of the foreign-born population in Canada (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022042612436652">Chui, Tran, &amp; Maheux, 2007</xref>) and is thus highly diverse, especially within urban areas that constitute a large percentage of the sample (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022042612436652">Paglia-Boak et al., 2009</xref>). An additional limitation is that survey participation was limited to students within the regular public and Catholic school systems and, therefore, the data do not represent students in private and other types of schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022042612436652">Paglia-Boak et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>In conclusion, this study indicates that there are more similarities than differences across immigrant generations in the associations between cannabis use and many family, peer, school, and attitudinal factors. This suggests that although foreign-born youth may be less likely to use cannabis than native-born youth, the factors that influence their use may be similar. Findings of a positive and negative effect of lower parental education suggest that further research is necessary to understand the role of parental education and the mechanism through which it influences cannabis use among youth of different immigrant generations.</p>
