<title>Objective:</title>
<p>To explore the limitations of the concept of ‘truth’ in the ontology of evidence-based psychiatry and to provide expanded ontological foundations for psychiatric practice based instead on the ontology of the French existential-phenomenologist, Maurice Merleau-Ponty.</p>

<title>Conclusions:</title>
<p>Evidence-based medicine is founded on a ‘scientific’ ontology of ‘causality’, which equates ‘truth’ with effecting statistically-significant changes in objective measures of disease by a specified treatment. Because of the absence of biological markers of disease in psychiatry, evidence-based psychiatry equates ‘truth’ with effecting changes in observable psychometric measures of behaviour. This is the same ontology underlying marketing ‘spin’ and all attempts to effect pre-determined behavioural change. In contrast, Merleau-Ponty’s ontology rejects causality and mind/body duality, and views ‘truth’ as the expression of our deepest embodied feeling and perception of the world, which establishes all our thinking, and on which all our thinking relies, including ‘scientific’ thinking. Merleau-Ponty’s ontology is therefore a preferable foundation for psychiatric practice, because it allows psychiatrists to consider the ‘truth’ of clinically important, but non-measurable, aspects of psychiatry while not excluding ‘scientific’ thinking, but recognising its limitations and potential for misuse.</p>

<body>
<p>Questions regarding truth frequently arise in psychiatric practice. What is the ‘true’ meaning of my symptoms? What is my ‘true’ self? Do I really have choices? What is a ‘true’ reason to go on living? Can I ‘truly’ trust you? Are you telling me the truth? In a post-modern age, such questions of truth may seem outdated or perhaps, unanswerable. However, when it comes to the lived experience of psychiatric care, such questions of truth take on a pivotal importance, for example, in the treatment of a suicidal patient.</p>
<p>The ontology of evidence-based psychiatry (EBP) equates ‘truth’ with the production of pre-determined behavioural changes. While this kind of ‘truth’ leads to easy decision-making for bureaucrats, it reduces psychiatry to efficient behavioural manipulation or ‘spin’, and excludes as meaningless all the above questions of truth.</p>
<p>The French existential-phenomenologist Maurice Merleau-Ponty (1908–1961)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1039856213486216">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1039856213486216"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1039856213486216">3</xref></sup> developed an ontology which is uniquely suited to psychiatry, because it encompasses a conception of truth beyond predetermined behavioural change, to include the kind of non-measurable truths essential to psychiatric practice.</p>
<p>While these truths will be familiar to many psychiatrists, as they resonate with many psychodynamic and existential practices prior to the advent of evidence-based medicine, what Merleau-Ponty offers is a robust ontological foundation to counter the behavioural ‘spin’ of EBP.</p>

<p>‘To say that the world <italic>is</italic>, by nominal definition, the object <italic>x</italic> of our operations is to adjust the scientist’s epistemic situation to the absolute, as if everything that was and is has never existed save in order to enter the laboratory. Thinking “operationally” becomes a sort of absolute artificialism,….if this kind of thinking takes over humanity…man truly becomes the <italic>manipulandum</italic> he thinks he is, then we enter into a cultural regimen in which there is neither truth nor falsehood concerning humanity and history, then we enter into a sleep or nightmare from which nothing would be able to awaken us’ (Merleau-Ponty, 2007).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1039856213486216">4</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The ontology of evidence-based medicine is scientific causality: one of assuming that everything in the world exists as a result of natural laws and chance. Its ‘hierarchy’ of evidence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1039856213486216">5</xref></sup> uses statistical analysis to separate out ‘true’ cause and effect from chance appearance. Whether this statistical analysis is done according to the procedures and assumptions of classical parametric statistics, or the alternative Bayesian analysis, the ‘truth’ or ‘verification’ of a causal model is determined by the accuracy of its probability predictions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1039856213486216">6</xref></sup> of the ‘effects’ produced by a specified ‘cause’. This ontology of causation and measurable verification generally works well in biological medicine, where the aim is, for example, to shrink a tumour in response to chemotherapy.</p>
<p>But psychiatry has no biological measures of disease. In EBP, behavioural measures derived from psychometric scales are substituted for biological measures of ‘effect’ and also for ‘cause’, in the case of manualised psychotherapies; however, any attempt to separate cause and effect in psychiatry inevitably leads to a tangle of confusion and contradiction. For example, do thoughts ‘cause’ the body to act, like a ‘pilot in his ship’ as cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) assumes;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1039856213486216">7</xref></sup> or is our mind ‘caused’ by bodily neurochemistry, as those who promote pharmaceuticals believe; or is our behaviour ‘caused’ by our external circumstances, as social psychiatrists argue? As I have detailed in a previous article,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1039856213486216">3</xref></sup> the whole probabilistic ‘causal’ model makes no sense in psychiatry, as cause and effects are abstractions from a unity of experience. When two patients mark an item the same way on a psychometric test, this behaviour may have many vastly different underlying ‘true’ meanings, but will be scored the same for statistical analysis</p>
<p>EBP ignores these incoherencies and researchers just assign cause and effect in their models and psychometric instruments, prior to their studies and statistical analyses. The problem is that this a priori separation of cause and effect is itself not based on anything objective, and may reflect a behavioural change that promotes vested interests, such as selling pharmaceuticals or cutting costs. The mere appearance of ‘statistically significant’ correlations, no matter how powerful, does not at all indicate causation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1039856213486216">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1039856213486216">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>As Edward Bernays,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1039856213486216">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1039856213486216">11</xref></sup> the ‘father of spin’ and incidentally the nephew of Sigmund Freud, first demonstrated, behaviour can be deliberately manipulated in a statistically predictable direction that mimics the natural laws of causality, particularly when considering group behaviour.</p>
<p>Indeed, the ontology of evidence-based medicine when applied to psychiatry is the same ontology of ‘truth’ that underpins marketing, ideological propaganda, compliance programs and ‘social engineering’. Whether intended for good or for ill, all these ideologies are based on efficiently facilitating measurable behavioural changes; their concept of ‘truth’ is whether these behavioural changes have taken place as predicted.</p>
<p>Hence, it is not surprising that with the advent of EBP, those treatments which promote the most efficient pre-determined measurable behavioural changes within a group, i.e. medications and behavioural therapies, have come to predominate and are often termed ‘best practice’.</p>

<title>Merleau-Ponty’s ontology of truth</title>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>‘The movement toward adequation, to which the facts of dis-illusion bear witness, is not the returning to itself of an adequate Thought that would have inexplicably lost sight of itself - <bold>nor is it a blind progress of probability, founded on the number of signs and concordances.</bold> It is the prepossession of a totality which is there before one knows how or why, whose realizations are never what we would have imagined them to be, and which nonetheless fulfils a secret expectation within us, since we believe in it tirelessly’ (Merleau-Ponty, 1968). <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1039856213486216">12</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Although Merleau-Ponty never completed his work on truth and many of his writings were published posthumously, as Moorhouse<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1039856213486216">13</xref></sup> indicates, ‘Merleau-Ponty’s understanding of truth permeates and is manifested in his writings and is the raison d’être of his work.’</p>
<p>For Merleau-Ponty, science conceptualises the world in terms of a causal ontology, a ‘subjective’ mind separated from an ‘objective’ world, which thought can conquer with its measurements, algorithms and operations. Truth is then a proposition of thought which corresponds to a ‘fact’ about the world. Merleau-Ponty rejects this notion, but similarly rejects a ‘pure’ unembodied subjectivity - the ‘<italic>cogito</italic>’, the ‘thought’, as an origin of truth.</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>‘Our purpose is not to oppose to the facts objective science coordinates a group of facts that “escape” it - whether one calls them “psychism” or “subjective facts” or “interior facts” - but to show that the being-object and the being-subject conceived by opposition to it and relative to it do not form the alternative, that the perceived world is beneath or beyond this antimony, that the failure of “objective” psychology is - conjointly with the failure of the “objectivist” physics - to be understood not as victory of the “interior” over the “exterior” and of the “mental” over the “material,” but as a call for the revision of our ontology, for the re-examination of the notions of “subject” and “object.”’ (Merleau-Ponty, 1968).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1039856213486216">12</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Merleau-Ponty’s ontology of truth is based on our deepest embodied (pre-conceptual) feeling and perception, what he describes as ‘mute experience of a mute meaning’,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1039856213486216">12</xref></sup> ‘the perceptual faith’,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1039856213486216">12</xref></sup> the ‘unjustifiable certitude of a sensible world’,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1039856213486216">12</xref></sup> and a ‘silence’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1039856213486216">12</xref></sup></p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>He believes that:</p>
<p>‘Before our undivided existence, the world is true; it exists. The unity, the articulations of both [truth and world] are intermingled. And this is to say we have a global notion of the world whose inventory is never complete, and that we experience in the world a truth which shows through and envelops us rather than being held and circumscribed by our mind’ (Merleau-Ponty, 2007).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1039856213486216">7</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Thought, is never in full possession of itself. It is not because I think that I am in love, for example, which makes it true. Merleau-Ponty writes: ‘The world is not what I think but what I live through.’<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1039856213486216">14</xref></sup>…‘In the proposition: ‘I think, I am’…it is not the ‘I am’ which is pre-eminently contained in the ‘I think,’ not my existence which is brought down to the consciousness which I have of it, but conversely the ‘I think,’ which is re-integrated into the transcending process of the ‘I am’, and consciousness into existence.’<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1039856213486216">14</xref></sup>‘…The ultimate court of appeal in our knowledge of these things, [is] our <italic>experience</italic> of them.’<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1039856213486216">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>Merleau-Ponty sees mind, body and world as ‘reversible’ dimensions of one field of ‘Being’ which he terms ‘flesh’…‘[which] is not matter, is not mind, is not substance. To designate it, we should need the old term “element” in the sense it was used to speak of water, air, earth, and fire, that is, in the sense of a <italic>general thing</italic>, midway between the spatio-temporal individual and the idea, a sort of incarnate principle that brings a style of being wherever there is a fragment of being’ (Merleau-Ponty, 1968).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1039856213486216">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>He views our perceptions as originating in a kind of coiling over of this ‘flesh’ upon itself during embryogenesis, leading to a ‘dehiscence’,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1039856213486216">12</xref></sup> ‘fission’<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1039856213486216">12</xref></sup> of its own mass, ‘creating a central cavity’,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1039856213486216">12</xref></sup> a separation, divergence, spread, deviation (<italic>écart</italic>), which ‘is not a <italic>void</italic>, it is filled precisely by the flesh as the place of emergence of a vision, a passivity that bears an activity - and so also the divergence between the exterior visible and the body which forms the upholstering (<italic>capitonnage</italic>) of the world’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1039856213486216">12</xref></sup> There is a blind spot at the source of our consciousness where it reconnects with its origin in the ‘flesh’, which Merleau-Ponty likens to the blind spot, the ‘<italic>punctum caecum</italic>’<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1039856213486216">12</xref></sup> of vision, where ‘the retina is blind at the point where the fibres that will permit the vision spread out into it’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1039856213486216">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>Merleau-Ponty’s ontology of elemental ‘flesh’, body/mind ‘reversibility’ and a ‘blind spot’ may seem initially farfetched, but Merleau-Ponty points out that we can experience all of this directly, whenever we choose, by just reflecting on our own experience.</p>
<p>Consider our left hand trying to experience our right hand as both ‘object’ and ‘subject’, simultaneously.</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>‘My left hand is always on the verge of touching my right hand touching the things, but I never reach coincidence; the coincidence eclipses at the moment of realisation, and one of two things always occurs: either my right hand really passes over to the rank of touched, but then its hold on the world is interrupted; or it retains its hold on the world, but then I do not really touch <italic>it -</italic> my right hand touching, I palpate with my left hand only its outer covering…..this is not a failure. For if these experiences never exactly overlap, if they slip away at the very moment that they are about to rejoin, if there is always a “shift,” a “spread,” between them, this is precisely because my two hands are part of the same body, because it moves itself in the world, because I hear myself both from within and from without. I experience – and as often as I wish - the transition and the metamorphosis of the one experience into the other, and it is only as though the hinge between them, solid, unshakeable, remained irremediably hidden from me. But this hiatus between my right hand touched and my right hand touching, between my voice heard and my voice uttered, between one moment of my tactile life and the following one, is not an ontological void, a non-being; it is spanned by the total being of my body and by that of the world’ (Merleau-Ponty, 1968).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1039856213486216">12</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In other words, we can reverse the experience of body and mind, but we cannot experience the origin of this ‘reversal’ itself. Just as when I look in a mirror, I cannot see myself in the act of seeing; the ‘hinge’ between these two views of reality is invisible to me. Merleau-Ponty believes this deep sense of never quite coinciding is the true source of our movement and expression, the origin of meaning. He also believes ‘reversibility’ applies to the self/other relationship, which could be compared to the empathic ‘hinge’ of ‘participant-observation’<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1039856213486216">15</xref></sup> in psychiatric practice.</p>
<p>The ‘<italic>punctum caecum</italic>’ invites comparison with the ‘mindfulness’ movement’s enjoinder to go beneath our thoughts, to re-join a unity of existence.</p>
<p>Merleau-Ponty argues that if we were to make explicit the ontological framework of the human body, it would not be as an object or a subject, rather we would see ‘that the structure of its mute world is such that all the possibilities of language are already given in it. Already our existence as seers(…as beings who turn the world back upon itself and who pass over to the other side…) and especially our existence as sonorous beings for others and ourselves contain everything required for there to be speech from the one to the other, speech about the world.’<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1039856213486216">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>‘And, in a sense, to understand a phrase is nothing else than to fully welcome it in its sonorous being, or as we put it so well to <italic>hear what it says (l’entendre).</italic> The meaning is not on the phrase like the butter on the bread, like a second layer of “psychic reality” spread over the sound; it is the totality of what is said, the integral of all the differentiations of the verbal chain; it is given with the words for those who have ears to hear’ (Merleau-Ponty, 1968).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1039856213486216">12</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Merleau-Ponty’s ontology gives an ontological foundation for the importance of verbal expression of embodied feeling in psychiatry. He notes that:<disp-quote>
<p>‘…successful expression frees what has always been held captive in being, an inner communication is established in the density of personal and interpersonal time through which our present becomes the <italic>truth</italic> of all the other knowing events. It is like a wedge we drive into the present, a milestone bearing witness that in this moment something has taken place which being was always waiting for or “intending to say” (<italic>voulait dire</italic>), and which will never stop if not being true at least signifying and stimulating our thinking apparatus, if need be drawing from it truths more comprehensive than the present one. At this moment something has been founded in signification; an experience has been transformed into its meaning, has become truth. Truth is another name for sedimentation, which is the presence of all presents in our own. That is to say that even and especially for the ultimate philosophical subject, there is no objectivity which accounts for our super-objective relationship to all times, no light that shines more brightly than the living present’s light’(Merleau-Ponty, 1964).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1039856213486216">16</xref></sup></p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>From Merleau-Ponty’s ontology, the psychiatric patient is not an object to be manipulated, but a human being who is always expressing a truth of his/her lived experience, even though his/her ‘<italic>cogito</italic>’ may not be aware of it. Our job is to try and help the patient express this truth in a more creative way than his/her current symptoms allow, for the ‘flesh’, according to Merleau-Ponty, is full of ‘equivalencies’ in its dimensions and there are an infinite number of ways to express the truth that one is experiencing. There is never going to be a final ‘objective’ truth in thought, as if there were some ‘Absolute’ mind, what Merleau-Ponty calls a ‘<italic>kosmotheoros’</italic>,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1039856213486216">12</xref></sup> but rather an embodied truth which builds on itself to greater and greater depths, with time and lived experience.</p>
<p>From a Merleau-Pontyian perspective, the ‘verification’ of any ‘evidence-based’ intervention is determined by whether, and to what extent, it has facilitated or hindered this process of expression of a truth that increasingly resonates with the patient’s deepest feeling and perception.</p>
