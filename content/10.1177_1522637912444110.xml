<p>On November 30, 1912, forty-nine journalism educators that included two women met to form the American Association of Teachers of Journalism. The group elected Willard G. Bleyer of the University of Wisconsin–Madison as its first president. It wasn’t until 1931 that anyone thought to collect dues. The modest fee of $1 when adjusted for today’s inflation rate is still a good deal—$14 (today’s dues of $110 for a regular member would mean an $8 initial donation in 1931). In 1950, the name of the organization was changed to the Association for Education in Journalism with “and Mass Communication” added in 1982.</p>
<p>In August 1966, Walter B. Emery, not the Egyptologist, but the longtime professor of communications at The Ohio State University with a memorial scholarship in his name to help fund graduate student research, was the first to have a study published in <italic>Monographs</italic>. More than two hundred long-form and often groundbreaking articles and research studies followed Emery’s “Five European Broadcasting Systems.”</p>
<p>The one hundredth anniversary of AEJMC at its annual conference this August in Chicago promises to be a joyful celebration of an organization that supports educators, professionals, and students as it continues to be a relevant, innovative and valuable source of information and inspiration. As part of the festivities, the editorial board and myself chose the most influential pieces published based on board member preferences and the number of times each work was cited by others. In chronological order, the <italic>Monographs</italic> Top Ten are:</p>

<p>Time will tell if Rita Colistra’s research study included in this issue will be added to future “Best of” lists, but it should. It is rare to read a study that is useful for media professionals who need to use their resources effectively and efficiently, government policy makers who must make decisions about media guidelines, and academics who wish to advance agenda- and frame-building theoretical approaches. Live long and cite often.</p>
