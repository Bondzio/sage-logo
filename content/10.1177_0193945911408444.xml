<abstract>
<p>The primary purpose of this study was to test a hypothesized model describing the direct effects of learning variables on anxiety and cognitive learning outcomes in a high-fidelity simulation (HFS) experience. The secondary purpose was to explain and explore student perceptions concerning the qualities and context of HFS affecting anxiety and learning. This study used a mixed methods quantitative-dominant explanatory design with concurrent qualitative data collection to examine variables affecting learning in undergraduate, beginning nursing students (<italic>N</italic> = 124). Being ready to learn, having a strong auditory-verbal learning style, and being prepared for simulation directly affected anxiety, whereas learning outcomes were directly affected by having strong auditory-verbal and hands-on learning styles. Anxiety did not quantitatively mediate cognitive learning outcomes as theorized, although students qualitatively reported debilitating levels of anxiety. This study advances nursing education science by providing evidence concerning variables affecting learning outcomes in HFS.</p>

<p>Health care educators are changing the landscape of higher education. These educators are using high-fidelity simulations (HFSs) to bridge the gap between the digital learner and a rapidly changing health care environment. Human patient simulators used in HFS are full-bodied mannequins capable of imitating a patient’s physiological responses to applied interventions via an operator-controlled computer. This type of high-fidelity technology, though, comes with a steep cost, during a time when receiving educational grant funding is very competitive. To purchase merely one HFS, schools spend between US$30,000 and US$300,000, depending on the simulator’s physiological complexity. More importantly, 77% of the 1,060 nursing programs surveyed nationally use medium stimulators and HFSs to substitute traditional clinical time with simulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0193945911408444">Hayden, 2010</xref>). Schools are using these simulators, despite having minimal data to determine the efficacy that using HFS leads to improved cognitive learning outcomes. Thus, health education scholars are calling for research to determine the effectiveness of using HFS as a teaching method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0193945911408444">Halstead, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0193945911408444">Hayden, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0193945911408444">Jeffries, 2007</xref>). Yet, before empirically determining the efficacy of simulation, it is important to explore variables with potential to affect the educational outcome of simulation experiences. The literature suggests that there are many variables that affect learning such as environment, nutrition, emotions, gender, sleep, culture, learning styles, and previous learning experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0193945911408444">Jensen, 2000</xref>). However, there are no studies to date examining variables affecting learning in a simulated environment. The current study tested a predictive model to determine the variables that affected learning outcomes.</p>
<sec id="section1-0193945911408444">
<title>Factors Affecting Learning</title>
<p>It is important to account for variables affecting learning when using teaching strategies and conducting research to determine the effectiveness of those strategies. Sleep is one such variable. Sleep loss impairs cognition, recall, attention, response inhibition, and divergent thinking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0193945911408444">Curcio, Ferrara, &amp; Gennaro, 2006</xref>). Furthermore, lack of sleep even for one night can lead to poor decision making, lack of flexible and innovative thought, an inability to focus attention on essential information, and helplessness to change strategies when the unexpected occurs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0193945911408444">Harrison &amp; Horne, 2000</xref>). The ability to think clearly to make good decisions is important when faced with a potentially volatile medical situation presented in a simulation experience.</p>
<p>Nutrition, likewise, affects cognition, memory, and mood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0193945911408444">Benton, Slater, &amp; Donohoe, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0193945911408444">Smith, Clark, &amp; Gallagher, 1999</xref>), all of which are important factors in any learning experience. Furthermore, an association exists between consuming breakfast and being alert, pleasant, and calm prior to beginning a test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0193945911408444">Smith et al., 1999</xref>). Those who eat breakfast continue to feel calmer in the posttest period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0193945911408444">Smith et al., 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>A student’s learning style also has the potential to affect learning. Perceptual learning styles involve using the auditory, visual, auditory-verbal, tactual, and kinesthetic senses to gain information about the given environment or situation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0193945911408444">Rundle &amp; Dunn, 2008</xref>). An auditory learner prefers to learn new material by listening, whereas a visual learner prefers seeing images or reading the material to be learned. The auditory-verbal learner learns best when given the opportunity to discuss new material, making it personally meaningful. Finally, tactual and kinesthetic learners prefer a hands-on approach. The tactual learner uses small motor skills such as taking notes, whereas the kinesthetic learner uses gross motor skills, such as doing a procedure. The value of determining student learning styles is an ongoing debate. Although some contend learning occurs best when teaching modalities match student learning styles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0193945911408444">Lovelace, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0193945911408444">Rundle &amp; Dunn, 2008</xref>), others argue that students learn best when the content to be learned drives the appropriate modality with which to teach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0193945911408444">Nilson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0193945911408444">Willingham, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Anxiety, test anxiety (TA) in particular, also influences cognitive learning outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0193945911408444">Papanastasiou, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0193945911408444">Sarason, 1973</xref>). Similarly, an individual’s performance is negatively affected when that performance is tested or critiqued (J. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0193945911408444">Meyers &amp; Martin, 1974</xref>). State anxiety (A-State) is an emotional reaction consisting of feelings of tension, apprehension, and nervousness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0193945911408444">Spielberger, 1966</xref>). This is a direct effect of the activation of the autonomic nervous system. The threatening situation evoking A-State is more likely to be an instance in which a person’s adequacy is being evaluated, where failure is a possibility, and threats to self-esteem are at stake. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0193945911408444">Spielberger (1966)</xref> found persons who were test anxious approached tests with elevated A-State scores, thus leading to the theoretical formation that TA is a situation-specific anxiety trait.</p>
<p>Simulation is similar to testing for several reasons. During a simulation, the student’s performance is inevitably critiqued, independent of a subsequent grade. When a student performs in front of others, erroneous answers and faulty execution of nursing interventions are apparent to all. This is particularly true when video playback is a component of the debriefing period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0193945911408444">Elfrink, Nininger, Rohig, &amp; Lee, 2009</xref>). Although existing studies have examined student anxiety during clinical experiences following simulation experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0193945911408444">Bremner, Aduddell, Amason, &amp; VanGeest, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0193945911408444">Hogan, 2004</xref>), there are only anecdotal accounts of anxiety during an HFS experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0193945911408444">Beischel, 2007</xref>). The literature supports that TA has a powerful affect on learning outcomes. Similar to TA, it is anticipated that heightened anxiety negatively affects learning outcomes when a student participates in an HFS learning experience.</p>
<p>Improving the quality of student learning outcomes is the purpose of seeking innovative teaching methods, such as HFS. If elevated anxiety does indeed exist in a simulation experience and learning is thereby challenged, interventions must be developed to decrease debilitating anxiety. Yet, there are no reported quantitative studies examining the variables that affect learning in an HFS experience, nor whether anxiety has a mediating effect on the learning outcomes in a simulation experience.</p>
<p>The construction of the conceptual model with specified relationships was based on a theoretical framework derived from literature examined for this study, empirical research, and practical experience (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0193945911408444">Figure 1</xref>). The model proposes that learner characteristics, including learning style, preparation for simulation, prior HFS experience, direct patient care experience, and anticipated grade in the course directly affect learner anxiety and cognitive learning outcomes. Likewise, the model proposes that the learner’s lifestyle characteristics, including nutrition and sleep directly affect anxiety and cognitive learning outcomes. Finally, the model proposes that anxiety is a mediating variable to cognitive learning outcomes. Specifically, learner and lifestyle characteristics cause anxiety in the learner; this anxiety, in turn, causes a change in the learner’s cognitive learning outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0193945911408444">MacKinnon, 2008</xref>).</p>

<title>Purpose</title>
<p>The purpose of this mixed methods study was twofold. The primary purpose was to test a hypothesized model describing the direct effects of learning variables on anxiety and cognitive learning outcomes as well as the mediating effects of anxiety on cognitive learning outcomes in a high-fidelity human patient simulation experience. The learning variables hypothesized to affect anxiety and cognitive learning outcomes included anticipated course grade, perceptual learning style, nutrition, sleep, preparation, work, and prior simulation experiences. The secondary purpose was to explain the quantitative results using student perceptions concerning the qualities and context of HFS that affect cognitive learning outcomes. The research aims were as follows:</p>

<sec id="section4-0193945911408444">
<title>Design</title>
<p>This study used quantitative + qualitative explanatory mixed methods with simultaneous qualitative data collection design (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0193945911408444">Creswell &amp; Plano Clark, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0193945911408444">Morse &amp; Niehaus, 2009</xref>). The core component in this study was quantitative. The data obtained from the Elsevier Evolve pretest/posttest scores and learner and lifestyle characteristic questionnaire facilitated a general understanding of conceptual relationships. The data obtained from the S-Anxiety Scale quantified the mediating effect of anxiety. As using a quantitative approach would not have described the context in which anxiety existed, a supplementary component with a qualitative approach was used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0193945911408444">Morse &amp; Niehaus, 2009</xref>). The supplementary component explained student perceptions concerning their anxiety and the resultant impact on learning in a simulation experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0193945911408444">Morse &amp; Niehaus, 2009</xref>). Approval was granted from the University of Cincinnati Institutional Review Board prior to participant accrual.</p>

<title>Sample</title>
<p>Baccalaureate nursing students (<italic>n</italic> = 130) enrolled in a Foundations of Nursing Practice I course at a Midwest university were recruited to participate. There were no exclusion criteria. The grade point average required to be admitted to this nursing program was 3.41, demonstrating the average student’s cognitive and decision-making ability as well as the ability to read, write, and speak English. Structural modeling requires a minimum of 5 to 10 participants per parameter to be studied (L. S. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0193945911408444">Meyers, Gamst, &amp; Guarino, 2006</xref>). Furthermore, the minimum sample for the maximum likelihood estimation should be 100 participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0193945911408444">Kline, 2005</xref>). A total of 124 students consented to participate. Reasons for refusal to consent were not revealed. There were 14 parameters in this study’s initial model requiring between 70 and 140 participants; thus requirements for sample size were met. The structural equation model in this study only includes observed variables, and such modeling is also called path analysis. Therefore, path analysis will be used hereafter.</p>

<title>Quantitative Measures</title>
<sec id="section7-0193945911408444">
<title>Learning and lifestyle characteristics</title>
<p>Learner and lifestyle characteristics, variables hypothesized to affect learning, were measured using an investigator-constructed descriptive Learner and Lifestyle Characteristics Questionnaire (LLCQ). Learner and lifestyle characteristics, including demographic data, anticipated grade in the course, preparation for simulation, food and drink ingested, and hours slept prior to simulation experience were obtained. Clinically related learner characteristics included work and prior HFS experiences.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0193945911408444">
<title>Learning styles</title>
<p>The Building Excellence (BE) web-based survey was used to measure learning styles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0193945911408444">Rundle &amp; Dunn, 2008</xref>). The BE survey measures six subscales categorized as Environmental, Perceptual, Psychological, Sociological, Physiological, and Emotional elements. Testing each subscale was beyond the scope of this study. The purpose of this study was to determine which perceptual element affected student anxiety and learning outcomes in this new learning environment. Thus, the perceptual subscale, including auditory, visual, tactile, kinesthetic, and auditory-verbal learning styles was used. The BE consisted of statements using a 5-point response scale to which the participants’ answered 1 = <italic>strongly agreed</italic> to 5 = <italic>strongly disagreed</italic>. The Cronbach’s alphas of each of the perceptual elements are as follows: auditory = .91, visual picture = .92, visual text = .68, tactile and/or kinesthetic = .87, and auditory-verbal = .72 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0193945911408444">Rundle &amp; Dunn, 2008</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0193945911408444">
<title>Cognitive learning outcomes</title>
<p>Two Elsevier Evolve, 30-question, multiple-choice, custom exams were used to measure cognitive learning outcomes. One exam was used as the pretest, the other as the posttest. The change of scores between the pre- and posttests determined the participants’ cognitive learning outcomes in this study.</p>
<p>Elsevier nurse educators developed the custom exams using test items from the Elsevier database, which best measures the nursing knowledge and competencies coordinated with the course content. The didactic faculty member and primary investigator discussed each question to determine content validity. Each fundamental specialty exam test item had a Kuder Richardson Formula 20 (KR-20) estimated reliability coefficient ranging between .86 and .99 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0193945911408444">Morrison, Adamson, Nibert, &amp; Hsia, 2004</xref>). The cumulative difficulty level of each test item was no less than 40% with a point-biserial correlation coefficient of .15 or above (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0193945911408444">Morrison et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>The pre- and posttests were created as parallel forms. The pretest KR-20 for this study was .93 with a difficulty level of .71 and the posttest KR-20 was .90 with a difficulty level of .71. The analysis for reliability and difficulty level demonstrated that these tests were parallel forms.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0193945911408444">
<title>A-State</title>
<p>A-State was measured using the Spielberger’s S-Anxiety Scale Y Form, a subscale of the State Trait Anxiety Scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0193945911408444">Spielberger, 1983</xref>). The scale consists of a 20-item 4-point Likert-type scale evaluating how participants feel at a given moment in time given a specific situation 1 = <italic>not at all</italic> to 4 = <italic>very much so</italic>. The extensively used S-Anxiety Scale measures the participants’ qualities of tension, nervousness, worry, and apprehension. The scale has item-intensity sensitivity and has been used to measure A-State under broadly varying stress conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0193945911408444">Spielberger, 1983</xref>). Cronbach’s alpha, in an examination scenario, has yielded a reliability of .92 to .93 for college students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0193945911408444">Spielberger, 1983</xref>) and .93 in this study population.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0193945911408444">
<title>Qualitative Measures</title>
<p>A Factors Affecting Learning Questionnaire (FALQ) was used to elicit student perceptions about any factors that may have affected learning during the simulated experience. The FALQ asked one open-ended question concerning the students’ perceptions about factors affecting their learning. The Laboratory Director asked the same five questions to each group during each debriefing period, directing the questions separately to each participant. The five questions included (a) How did you feel about the scenario? (b) If you had to do it differently, what would you do? (c) How will you apply what you learned today when you start clinical? (d) Did you learn anything in your role? and (e) Do you feel more confident now than when we started?</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0193945911408444">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>This study was nested within an already existing pre–post test simulation experience for these students. All students in the fundamental course had completed the BE survey as a homework assignment within the first 2 weeks of the term. The Laboratory Director posted the simulation assignment on the course management system (Blackboard<sup>TM</sup>) 2 weeks prior to the scheduled simulation experience. All students assigned to simulation for their clinical laboratory day were administered the pretest in the computer laboratory, proctored by the primary investigator. Consented students completed the S-Anxiety Scale and the LLCQ following the pretest. The S-Anxiety Scale was continually referred to as the Self-Evaluation Questionnaire, in an effort to minimize bias toward anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0193945911408444">Spielberger, 1983</xref>). Participants were instructed to respond to the items on the Self-Evaluation Questionnaire relevant to how they felt about the pending simulation experience.</p>
<p>The students assigned to simulation were divided into groups of approximately five to six students to each group. Each group completed the simulation experience at their appointed time. While waiting for the simulation experience, the remaining students completed a documentation learning module with a clinical instructor, not included in this study.</p>
<p>The students were admitted into the simulation laboratory where the Laboratory Director discussed the scenario and elicited questions. Students randomly selected participant roles: Student Nurse 1, Student Nurse 2, Family Member 1, Family Member 2, Observer 1, and in some groups, Observer 2. The Laboratory Director conducted the simulation for each group. Two cameras and a boom microphone captured the simulation experience. The simulation scenario concluded following the students’ identification of deteriorating “patient” vital signs and summoning appropriate help or after a maximum of 15 min.</p>
<p>At the conclusion of the simulation scenario, the Laboratory Director conducted a 15 min debriefing. Directly following the debriefing period, each group proceeded to the adjacent monitored computer laboratory and were administered the posttest. Subsequent groups followed until all students completed their simulation experience and testing.</p>

<sec id="section13-0193945911408444">
<title>Quantitative Data Analysis</title>
<p>All participant data were coded for confidentiality purposes. SPSS 17.0 was used to analyze the data. The data set was examined for missing data. Given that there were 33% missing data on the ethnicity variable, the variable was deleted from the data set. The remaining missing data, up to 2% on three variables, were missing completely at random and were replaced with mean substitution (L. S. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0193945911408444">Meyers et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>An exploratory factor principal component extraction with varimax rotation was conducted using seven learner and lifestyle characteristic variables to account for the covariation among these variables, as suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0193945911408444">Byrne (2001)</xref>. Theory guided the variables used in the factor analysis. The Kaiser−Meyer−Olkin measure of sampling adequacy was .571, demonstrating an adequate sample (L. S. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0193945911408444">Meyers et al., 2006</xref>). Three learning styles—tactual, kinesthetic, and auditory-verbal—loaded on the first component; anticipated grade, health conscious, and direct patient care experience loaded on the second; and preparation loaded on the third. To differentiate which learning style affected anxiety and cognitive learning outcomes, the tactual and kinesthetic learning styles were combined into hands-on learning, and the auditory-verbal learning style was left by itself. The second component was combined into one variable and named readiness to learn.</p>
<p>Path analysis, a structural model for observed variables, was conducted using AMOS 17.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0193945911408444">Arbuckle, 2008</xref>). The path analysis was used to determine causal relationships between the variables. The assumption of normality was met and the model was identified. The path analysis coefficients were assessed for statistical significance. Nonsignificant indicators were deleted as necessary, given theoretical soundness. Modification indices and theoretical soundness were used to determine the addition of any new paths. Standardized direct and indirect effects were determined by path coefficients. Model fit was assessed using the following absolute fit measures: chi-square <italic>p</italic> &gt; .05, goodness-of-fit index (GFI) &gt; .90, and root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) &lt; .08, whereas incremental fit measures were assessed to compare the proposed model to the independence model: adjusted goodness of fit (AGFI) and normed fit index &gt; .90 (L. S. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0193945911408444">Meyers et al., 2006</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section14-0193945911408444">
<title>Qualitative Data Analysis</title>
<p>NVivo 8® (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.qsrinternational.com">http://www.qsrinternational.com</ext-link>) software was used to organize and manage the qualitative data obtained during the debriefing period and the FALQ. The answers were first grouped by the debriefing and questionnaire questions and by participant role. Next, the answers were grouped in accord with categories used in the path analysis. The data were then explored and queried for relationships among variables.</p>
<p>Inherent to all research, threats to the validity of qualitative data conclusions are a concern. The scientific rigor of this study was maintained using various criteria. All biases toward anxiety and learning were recorded prior to data collection with subsequent examination during data analysis. A complete audit trail, including videos, audiotapes, transcripts, and notes to map steps taken during the analytic process maintained dependability and confirmability. Credibility was enhanced by engaging in a systematic search for alternative themes and relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0193945911408444">Patton, 2002</xref>). The data were organized in different groupings in an attempt to explicate different findings while continually seeking alternative possibilities.

<title>Mixed Method Analysis</title>
<p>Researchers using mixed method designs often make comparisons to explain the quantitative and qualitative data. To this end, the data sets in this study were compared to form a complete picture of anxiety’s mediating effect on learning outcomes. The data sets were examined to confirm whether the qualitative data explained the survey and scaled data. Any dissonance among the results triggered a return to the data for further consideration. This strategy facilitated an understanding of how well the qualitative data explained the quantitative results, thus lending confirmation to the quantitative results.</p>

<title>Characteristics of the Participants</title>
<p>The mean age of the participants was 21 years with a range of 19 to 49 (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0193945911408444">Table 1</xref>). They were predominantly White females. Only three participants had experience with HFS. About 63% (<italic>n</italic> = 78) of the students reported active preparation, reading new material or reviewing past notes, for one or more hours prior to the simulation experience. Student Nurses 1 and 2 were responsible for implementing clinical reasoning during the scenario. To this end, the student nurse roles were considered active, whereas the family member and observer roles nonactive. Approximately 62.9% (<italic>n</italic> = 78) were nonactive, whereas 37.1% (<italic>n</italic> = 46) were active. The learning styles in which the participants scored “strong” were as follows: auditory 3.2% (<italic>n</italic> = 4), visual (picture and word combined) 29.8% (<italic>n</italic> = 37), tactual 6.5% (<italic>n</italic> = 8), kinesthetic 10.5% (<italic>n</italic> = 13), and auditory-verbal 49.3% (<italic>n</italic> = 61). When asked about nutrition consumed prior to the simulation experience, 83.1% (<italic>n</italic> = 103) of the participants had either eaten or drunk nutritional supplements such as protein shakes.</p>

Readiness to learn was inversely related to anxiety. Anxiety correlated with a strong auditory-verbal learning style and preparation for the simulation experience. A strong auditory-verbal learning style was correlated with cognitive learning outcomes, whereas a strong hands-on learning style was inversely correlated with cognitive learning outcomes. Finally, a strong auditory-verbal learning style was correlated with a strong hands-on learning style.</p>

<p>The standardized coefficient was moderate (β = −.31, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01), indicating that readiness to learn inversely affected anxiety. Readiness to learn had no quantitative affect on learning outcomes in this study. Although the quantitative results suggest being health conscious, anticipating an A in the course, and having direct patient work experience decrease anxiety, there were no comments addressing this. Three of the six participants who reported their learning was affected by being tired or hungry, also reported anxious feelings, but did not verbalize a perceived relationship between their anxiety and hunger or tiredness.</p>

<p>Spending one or more hours preparing for the simulation directly affected anxiety (β = .22, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). Although the quantitative data indicated that preparing for the simulation increased anxiety, students reported the opposite. The majority of participants reported feeling unprepared for the simulation experience. Students made comments such as “Not prepared and I just didn’t know what to do. I couldn’t remember all of that stuff yet” and “I definitely would try to be better prepared . . . I just felt uncomfortable.”</p>

<p>There was consensus among participants in their belief that the debriefing period was an important asset to their learning. Comments such as, “The discussion afterwards [debriefing period] furthered my learning,” and “I was nervous at the time, but after discussing the situation, I felt better” were expressed repeatedly.</p>
<p>Although the simulation was stressful for some, students readily agreed that the debriefing period provided space to discuss strengths and weaknesses and to ask questions. Furthermore, students valued having others on whom they could rely. Students found it helpful to discuss their thoughts aloud, facilitating connections and synthesizing their knowledge base. A Student Nurse 1 expressed, “Having the other student nurse there to collaborate with when making decisions [was helpful].” Students in this experience were novices, inexperienced in clinical, but several felt empowered having other students with whom to discuss the process. One student wrote, “I didn’t know what to expect but worked through them with the help of my classmates.”</p>

<sec id="section24-0193945911408444">
<title>Strong hands-on learning</title>
<p>Having a strong hands-on learning style was inversely related to cognitive learning outcomes, demonstrated by a low standardized coefficient (β = −.17, <italic>p &lt;</italic> .05). In addition, a strong auditory-verbal learning style is directly related to a strong hands-on learning style, as demonstrated by the low to moderate standardized coefficient (β = .24, <italic>p &lt;</italic> .01). Some students perceived that having been hands-on during the simulation would have increased their learning. Only seven students in nonactive roles reported that their learning was negatively impacted by being in such a role. For instance one observer stated, “Not being involved in the activities and just watching the others perform the tasks may have hindered my ability to learn a great deal from this simulation.”</p>
<p>Yet, 28 students specifically commented that they benefitted from being in nonactive roles. These students made statements such as, “Not being able to perform hands-on but I still learned a lot from observing.” In fact, many nonactive participants commented that the simulation was a positive learning experience because they were stress free. “I think that I was able to concentrate on the particular scenario and what was going on more, not having the anxiety of being the student nurse. I felt more confident viewing as a family member.” To further characterize this perception, one student stated, “I was able to watch without being nervous, I may have learned more this way than if I was the nurse.” Still another student exemplified the benefit of being an observer stating,<disp-quote>
<p>Yeah, I actually think I learned a lot because I didn’t have to worry about getting nervous and actually having to do it. I was able to sit here and watch and say, “okay, well what would I do,” having the luxury to see what he did.</p>

<title>Research Aim 3: To Determine Whether Anxiety Mediates Cognitive Learning Outcomes</title>
<p>The standardized indirect effect between anxiety and cognitive learning outcomes was −.08, indicating anxiety does not mediate cognitive learning outcomes as theorized. Although the quantitative data do not indicate anxiety-affected cognitive learning outcomes, 33% (<italic>n</italic> = 41) of the participants reported that anxiety did negatively affect their learning and ability to perform. Comments such as “Nerves caused me to think slower, and I couldn’t participate to the best of my ability” were echoed by participants throughout the debriefing period. Students exemplified cognitive interference through comments such as, “I was also very nervous which affected my ability to think clearly,” and “My nervousness and anxiety which make it hard to think straight.”</p>
<p>Anxiety was infectious. A student in the observer role, sensing anxiety from others, reported how anxiety affected his overall learning stating, “Factors that affected the simulation . . . the anxiety that everyone had over doing it ‘right’.” Students perceived the simulation was a performance test, “I feel like we were all so nervous to mess up or fail that we approached the experience as a test rather than a simulation. We were more focused on passing than taking care of the patient.”</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The purpose of the study was to determine whether the hypothesized individual and/or lifestyle characteristics directly affect anxiety or cognitive learning outcomes and to determine whether anxiety mediates cognitive learning outcomes. The study findings suggest being ready to learn, being prepared for simulation, and having an auditory-verbal learning style influence student anxiety. Whereas, strong auditory-verbal and strong hands-on learning styles influence cognitive learning outcomes. The study findings also suggest that anxiety does not mediate cognitive learning outcomes.</p>
<p>Among the variables studied, readiness to learn which included eating, sleeping, and anticipating an A in the course had the greatest affect on anxiety. The results indicated that the more a student was ready to learn the less anxiety the student experienced. These findings are consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0193945911408444">Benton et al. (2001)</xref> who found eating prior to performing cognitive tasks resulted in lower anxiety. Although studies have reported that eating and sleeping prior to a learning experience increases cognitive learning outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0193945911408444">Benton et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0193945911408444">Harrison &amp; Horne, 2000</xref>), these findings were not supported in this study. Although a few participants perceived that eating and sleeping prior to the simulation experience affected their learning, eating and sleeping did not improve the participants’ measured cognitive learning outcomes.</p>
<p>The next most influential factor affecting anxiety was preparation for simulation. Specifically, those students who prepared longer experienced more anxiety. A total of 62% of the participants reported having actively prepared for the simulation for more than 1 hr, yet, when asked about variables affecting their learning, students repeatedly reported feeling ill-prepared for the simulation experience. The amount of time spent preparing was self-reported; thus, it is possible students overreported the amount of time spent preparing for the simulation experience. Yet, it is possible that students did indeed prepare for more than 1 hr but became anxious during the pretest when they realized their preparation was inadequate. Statements such as, “The quiz was also intimidating,” support this premise. Moreover, it is possible that anxious students spent longer hours studying than their nonanxious counterparts, similar to the participants deemed test anxious in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0193945911408444">Benjamin, McKeachie, Lin, and Holinger’s (1981)</xref> study. But, because student anxiety was measured subsequent to preparation, it is difficult to know whether students were anxious while they studied.</p>
<p>A strong auditory-verbal learning style was the next factor most likely to influence anxiety. The quantitative data suggested that having a strong auditory-verbal learning style likely resulted in increased anxiety when anticipating a simulation experience. There were no participants who commented on being auditory-verbal learners. Students were more likely to state that they were kinesthetic learners. It is conceivable if a student perceived being an auditory-verbal learner, yet believed the simulation experience was a kinesthetic learning opportunity, the student’s anxiety may have increased.</p>
<p>Having a strong auditory-verbal learning style had a direct effect on cognitive learning outcomes. This finding supports the evidence that, auditory-verbal learners learn best when they are afforded the opportunity to discuss the material presented in a learning environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0193945911408444">Rundle &amp; Dunn, 2008</xref>). In contrast, the evidence also supports <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0193945911408444">Willingham’s (2005)</xref> theory that academic achievement occurs when the content drives the teaching modality. Perhaps simulation followed by a reflective discussion such as debriefing is the most appropriate modality to teach students how to “put it all together,” as was the objective of this learning experience.</p>
<p>A strong hands-on learning style was the final factor having a direct effect on cognitive learning outcomes. The evidence suggests the learning that occurs in HFS experiences is not a result of the kinesthetic opportunity that simulation provides. In fact, given the negative relationship found between having a strong hands-on learning style and cognitive learning outcomes, having a strong hands-on learning style may be a detriment. The relationship between strong hands-on learning and strong auditory-verbal learning suggests that students have dual learning styles. For this reason, one may question the theoretical mind-set that students should be taught using their specific learning style.</p>
<p>The findings suggest anxiety does not mediate cognitive learning outcomes as theorized. This finding may indicate that the tool failed to accurately measure the students’ anxiety. It is possible that using a different tool may have revealed the anxiety students reported as experiencing during the simulation. It is also conceivable that measuring anxiety prior to the simulation experience confounded the results. In this study, anxiety was measured directly following the pretest, prior to the simulation experience. As this was the first HFS experience for these beginning nursing students, the level of anxiety measured prior to the HFS may not have been at a level that interfered with their learning. Comments from active participants, such as, “I was nervous. He [SimMan] kept saying he didn’t feel better and there wasn’t much I could do” and “I felt like I was a deer in the headlights. I had no idea what to do. I was really nervous . . . I felt like I was doing it wrong” illustrate the anxiety students perceived during the simulation. Measuring anxiety during the simulation experience may have yielded different results.</p>
<p>The decrease in the mean posttest scores was an unanticipated finding considering the Elsevier Evolve custom pre- and posttests were parallel and examined for validity prior to administration. A few plausible causes may explain this finding. First, students may have been tired and hurried through the posttest. Second, the posttest, a test used to measure learning in the cognitive domain, may have failed to measure the affective learning that occurred as a result of the HFS experience. In example, when asked what they learned during the simulation, students stated, “I was on the other side of patient care . . . It was good to experience how a family member would react to a new nursing student,” “I felt that I learned a lot from the experience regarding how to interact with a client and/or family members,” and “I participated in the simulation experience, playing the role of family member, which allowed me to better asses and understand how a student nurse should interact with a client’s family members and visitors.” These comments allude to learning in the affective domain rather than the cognitive domain as measured. Finally, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0193945911408444">Dolcos and McCarthy (2006)</xref> discovered via neuroimaging, emotional distracters impair the area of the brain responsible for working memory, negatively affecting cognitive function. One may presume perceptions of failing the HFS, as illustrated in aforementioned comments, was an emotional stimulus for the students in this study. It is conceivable that this emotional stimulus was strong enough to evoke cognitive interference while testing. In other words, students, ruminating over their perceptions of failing the simulation experience, may have been distracted from the task at hand, taking the test, resulting in decreased posttest scores.</p>
<p>The findings in this study provide valuable insight into the variables that affect cognitive learning outcomes when participating in an HFS. But, as with all research, there were limitations. First, the sample limits the generalizability of this study to undergraduate baccalaureate nursing students in a fundamental nursing course. Second, there were also some limitations with data collection. The accuracy of the self-report information, hours spent studying, nutritional status, and hours of sleep could not be confirmed. It is conceivable that the participants overestimated their hours spent studying. Third, anxiety was measured prior to the experience. Given the students’ qualitative reports of anxiety, measuring anxiety during the simulation experience may have yielded a more accurate representation of student anxiety. To better capture the anxiety perceived during the simulation, one could establish baseline anxiety prior to the experience, followed by the administration of a 10-item S-Anxiety subscale midway through the simulation experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0193945911408444">Spielberger, 1983</xref>). Using the short subscale would minimize the interruption and thus maintain the fidelity of the simulation experience. Finally, allowing time for reflection between the simulation experience and testing may have altered the findings.</p>
<p>The participants in this study experienced a decrease in cognitive learning outcomes following the simulation experience. Although plausible causes were presented, further research is warranted to determine the cause of decline in the learning outcomes. The study should be replicated to determine model fit using different levels of nursing students. Given the dissonance concerning student perception of preparation, further research into how students prepare for simulation experiences is warranted. Measuring anxiety during the simulation rather than prior to the experience should be investigated. Interventions are needed to decrease anxiety experienced by nursing students in all clinical situations to optimal levels. Subsequently, experimental studies to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions used to decrease anxiety are needed. Most importantly, the ultimate determinant of the effectiveness of simulation lies with whether the knowledge gained in simulation experiences is transferable to the clinical arena. Studies are needed to determine if the use of HFS impacts patient care outcomes.</p>
<p>Studying best practices in nursing education is important. The use of HFS in nursing education is growing with little data to guide its use. Using mixed methods to determine the relationships between diverse variables, anxiety, and cognitive learning outcomes proved to be invaluable. This study provides the platform on which to advance the science of teaching using HFSs.</p>
