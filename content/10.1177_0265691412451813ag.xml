<sec id="sec1-0265691412451813ag"><title>Guy Thomson, <italic>The Birth of Modern Politics in Spain: Democracy, Association and Revolution, 1854–1875</italic>, Palgrave Macmillan: Basingstoke, 2010; 376 pp.; 9780230222021, £68.00 (hbk)</title>
<p>A century before Andalusia became a favourite destination of mass tourism in the 1960s, the region was a hotspot of insurrections and popular uprisings. Yet far from the romanticized image of Andalusians as passionate, backward bandits that English and French travellers created in the nineteenth century, these revolutionaries were well-organized, progressive middle classes, workers and peasants who embodied the vanguard of the Spanish pro-democracy movement. As in many other European countries, the reaction to the 1848 revolution in Spain consolidated a conservative liberalism, which highly restricted the franchise and limited civil and political freedoms. By 1856, most Spaniards found themselves living in a repressive constitutional system controlled by a right-wing clique that did not grant them the right to vote and actively persecuted the liberal left. In this context of political exclusion, progressive liberals and democrats were forced to go underground, and, once the conservatives abolished the National Militia, soon understood that their chances of returning to the political arena depended on how successfully they could organize a popularly-backed, revolutionary pronouncement by the military.</p>
<p><italic>The Birth of Modern Politics in Spain </italic>analyses the emergence of conspiratorial networks and revolutionary uprisings in a region of Eastern Andalusia in the period 1856–1875. The book focuses on three cities and their surrounding judicial districts: Loja and Alhama, in the province of Granada, and Antequera, second city of the province of Malaga. This region was the political territory of the seven times conservative Prime Minister Ramón María Narváez, but also a stronghold of the liberal left and the geographical centre of the July 1861 democratic uprising. By concentrating on local/regional history Guy Thomson is able to follow the different lives of mayors, civil governors, local judges, Protestant evangelists, democrats, and all sorts of squabbling neighbours. In particular, he focuses on the long-lasting rivalry in the town of Loja between Ramón María Narváez and Rafael Pérez del Alamo, a veterinarian blacksmith and leader of the local Democrats. This small-town enmity works in the book as a metaphor for the emergence in the region of two increasingly polarized areas of political sociability.</p>
<p>Thomson’s book is firmly placed within the revisionist school, which questions the idea that nineteenth-century Spanish history was a catalogue of ‘failures’ that precluded the country from having a solid bourgeois revolution, a first-class empire and a strong enough liberal state to nationalize the masses effectively. The revisionist school, which had become the dominant historiographical trend over the last decade, has demonstrated that Spanish history pursued much of the same modernizing course as other European countries throughout the nineteenth century. <italic>The Birth of Modern Politics in Spain </italic>contributes to this revisionism and traces the emergence in Eastern Andalusia of modern forms of political sociability, such as casinos, clubs, mutualist associations and tens of democratic secret societies, together with the rapid onset of telegraphs, roads and railways. Thomson is particularly competent at showing the influence of Giuseppe Garibaldi’s movement on Spain, not only in terms of bolstering democratic ideas, but also at the organizational level, with <italic>carbonari</italic> societies mushrooming all over Eastern Andalusia. The author’s convincing interpretation of the 1861 Loja Revolution as a modern, democratic, middle class-led uprising also falls into this revisionism and challenges the traditional view of the events in Eastern Andalusia as an early-modern type protest of the dispossessed against the negative consequences of the liberal elites’ accumulation of property.</p>
<p><italic>The Birth of Modern Politics in Spain</italic> is a good read and is based in a fine array of primary sources. Although there is much fascinating detail in these pages, Thomson appears to be writing mostly for specialists in nineteenth-century Spanish history. A reader not familiar with the period may feel a bit lost in the twists and turns of the reign of Queen Isabel II. The book would have benefited from a further account of the national political and social context in which the series of pro-democracy uprisings took place in Eastern Andalusia. Additionally, some aspects analysed in the book, such as the role of local police forces and the gerrymandering tactics to win elections, could have profited from a comparison with similar functions and political manoeuvres in the UK, France or Germany. By checking to what extent the Spanish political experiences at the local level were similar to other European cases, the author would have been able to test further his revisionist theses.</p>
<p>Still, <italic>The Birth of Modern Politics in Spain</italic> is an original and important contribution to the growing body of literature that seeks to reassess the role of the bourgeois revolutions and the liberal state in nineteenth-century Spain. Thomson compellingly shows that a rapid process of political modernization took place in Eastern Andalusia, where democrats of different social classes put up an enduring fight to end privileges and defend a community of citizens equal before the law in civil and political rights. He offers what we could call historical food for thought, when – in current times – we are witnessing the dismantling of the mechanisms that seek to correct social inequalities, and more and more political and economic power is concentrated in the hands of a few.</p>
