<abstract>
<p>This article empirically examines the effect of social background, education, and school organization on adolescent tobacco use in the Netherlands. We test theories of norm enforcing and horizon expanding social networks and distinction by examining the relationship between daily smoking behavior and school organization. Using the 2007 Dutch National School Survey on Substance Use, we find that individual student characteristics are more important predictors than school characteristics. Importantly, social background effects are clearly mediated by school tracks, suggesting that tracking helps us to explain social gradients in substance use. However, school context plays almost no role in adolescent smoking behavior. One exception concerns students in the general track, for whom we find that smoking is further reduced when they are placed in the same school organization as students of the vocational track. This is in line with the theory that tracking differences are magnified in a context where interaction between students from different tracks is promoted.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The relationship between smoking and health hazards and mortality is well documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0044118X11407642">World Health Organization, 2008</xref>), which has led to many studies aiming to explain why people start and continue smoking. A growing body of literature on adolescent substance use (such as smoking) examines peer influence and peer group membership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0044118X11407642">Aloise-Young, Graham, &amp; Hansen, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0044118X11407642">Hussong, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0044118X11407642">Kuipers &amp; de Zwart, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0044118X11407642">Mercken, Candel, Willems, &amp; de Vries, 2007</xref>). This approach finds strong positive relationships between adolescent substance use and that of their peers. Besides peer influence, parental smoking and drinking also plays an important role in adolescent tobacco and alcohol use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0044118X11407642">Engels, 1998</xref>). Furthermore, the inverse relationship between unhealthy behavior, such as smoking, and socioeconomic status among general populations is internationally well established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0044118X11407642">Cavelaars et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0044118X11407642">Kawachi, Kennedy, &amp; Glass, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0044118X11407642">Pampel, 2005</xref>). However, studies across different countries show an inconsistent picture regarding socioeconomic background and adolescents’ smoking behavior. Some studies show no or slight differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0044118X11407642">Botting &amp; Bunting, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0044118X11407642">Challier, Chau, Prédine, Choquet, &amp; Legras, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0044118X11407642">Donato, Monarca, &amp; Chiesa, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0044118X11407642">Glendinning, Shucksmith, &amp; Hendry, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0044118X11407642">Mullan &amp; Currie, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0044118X11407642">Tuinstra, Groothoff, van den Heuvel, &amp; Post, 1998</xref>), whereas other studies show higher frequencies of smoking behavior among children with low socioeconomic status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0044118X11407642">De Vries, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0044118X11407642">Lowry, Kann, Collins, &amp; Kolbe, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0044118X11407642">Van Lenthe, Boreham, &amp; Twisk, 2001</xref>). American studies from the 1950s, with some exceptions, repeatedly observed an inverse relationship between parents’ education and teenage smoking and consistently point out that smoking prevalence is higher among teenagers with lower educational aspirations or achievement (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0044118X11407642">Waldron &amp; Lye, 1990</xref> for overview). Some of these studies hint on the idea that the effect of social background characteristics, such as parental educational level, might be mediated through school tracking. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0044118X11407642">Waldron and Lye (1990)</xref> indeed show that the parents’ education effect on smoking is mediated through school track. The effect of the school environment has also been studied in earlier studies on substance use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0044118X11407642">Ellickson, Bird, Orlando, Klein, &amp; McCaffrey, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0044118X11407642">Kumar, O’Malley, Johnston, Schulenberg, &amp; Bachman, 2002</xref>). Yet studies have thus far neglected an important channel through which social background and peers may affect smoking behavior of adolescents: the school environment. It might well be the case that the variations across countries have something to do with how a countries’ educational system allows variation in school organization. By school organization, we refer to whether and how different school types/tracks are, or are not, placed together in one school location. The question how school organization, social background, and school composition in terms of social background of pupils in the school affects adolescent smoking behavior is, to the best of our knowledge, never been addressed in a country with a strongly differentiated educational structure such as the Netherlands.</p>
<p>This is unfortunate as the school is a central place where friendship networks are formed and smoking behavior is diffused. Furthermore, given that there is a strong social selection in different educational tracks, social origin affects children’s smoking behavior, partly because children are educated in particular school organizations characterized by their own social background. It is therefore relevant to know more about how school contexts affect adolescent tobacco use. The school context is particularly relevant as school organizations differ in the kinds of networks that are facilitated and the kinds of norms that are thus conveyed. The facilitated networks within the school can vary significantly in terms of school composition, that is, the average distribution and spread of social background variables of students such as parental educational level and attitudes toward smoking behavior.</p>
<p>Certainly in a strongly differentiated educational system such as in the Netherlands, with completely separate multiple-year tracks often in separate school buildings from the age of 12 onward, networks may be very homogeneous within schools and heterogeneous across schools in terms of social origin and norms related to tobacco use. Yet because school organizations differ in the extent to which they offer multiple tracks, it may be the case that such organizational features of schools affect children in different educational tracks and of social backgrounds differently. The research question of this article is, “To what extent is adolescent smoking behavior affected by social background, type of education, school composition and school organization?”</p>
<p>A graphical representation of the Dutch educational system is given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0044118X11407642">Figure 1</xref>. The Dutch secondary educational system consists of different tracks with separated programs (often) in different geographical locations. Secondary education begins at the age of 12, is compulsory until the age of 17, and is divided in three different tracks that grant admission to three different levels of continuing education. When moving from elementary school to high school, at the age of 12, there is an important selection moment for students concerning their future educational track. Elementary school teachers decide what track is suitable for a student based on the outcomes of a national test (“CITO-toets,” approximately 80% of all Dutch elementary schools use this test). In most cases, parents follow this advice but sometimes try to get their children in a higher track, but the high school in question can refuse this request based on elementary school teacher’s advice. So the outcome of the “Cito” test and the advice of elementary school teachers have a significant influence on the high school career of Dutch adolescents. After elementary school, there are three track options: VMBO (prevocational), HAVO (general), and VWO (academic). VMBO programs take 4 years and focus on preparatory education for enrolment into senior secondary vocational education (MBO).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0044118X11407642">1</xref></sup> There are two secondary programs that grant admission to higher education. HAVO is a 5-year program; the minimum requirement for access to HBO (tertiary vocational education). Only a VWO (preparatory academic education) diploma grants excess to university education (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0044118X11407642">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Theory and Hypotheses</title>
<p>Most studies that look at the role of social class in smoking behavior look at traits of the general population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0044118X11407642">Pampel, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0044118X11407642">Pampel &amp; Rogers, 2004</xref>). These explanations have some credence, yet they fail to account for changes over time and the role of contextual structures of the actual place and time of smoking initiation. The majority (approximately 90%) of Dutch begin smoking before the age of 18 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0044118X11407642">Gielkens-Sijstermans et al., 2009</xref>). Thus, if we want to find the cause of why adolescents start smoking and what the role of social background is, the most obvious place to look is the high school context. More specifically, looking at the school context is relevant for two reasons. First, within schools students build up their peer networks that are held to be significant for smoking behavior, either through selection or influence. Different school organizations facilitate different kinds of networks, and it is relevant to know whether the social composition of schools affect smoking behavior. Second, in the Dutch context, with a strongly differentiated educational structure with different school types and school organizations from the age of 12 onward, the choice of school type is significantly affected by children’s social background, which may mean that the social background effect runs partly through differential choice of school type and school organization (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0044118X11407642">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Social Background and Adolescent Smoking in the Netherlands</title>
<p>According to Netherlands Statistics data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0044118X11407642">Centraal Bureau voor de Statistiek [CBS], 2007</xref>) people with higher levels of education are less likely to smoke (and in particular fewer cigarettes) than people with lower levels of education. The National “Peilstationsonderzoek” of 2003 by the Trimbos Institute shows significant differences in smoking behavior between Dutch high school students from age 12 till 18 from different educational tracks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0044118X11407642">Monshouwer, van Dorsselaer, Gorter, Verdurmen, &amp; Vollebergh, 2004</xref>). For example, the percentage of students who smoke on a daily basis is five times higher among students from the vocational track (VMBO-p) than among students from the university-preparatory track (VWO; 16.4% vs. 3%). This reflects an odds ratio of 6.3.</p>
<p>This study looks at two different aspects of social background; parental educational level and parental attitudes toward their children’s smoking behavior.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0044118X11407642">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Through socialization, it is more likely that children pick up positive norms toward smoking, especially, if they see a significant other doing it. Given the negative association between socioeconomic position and smoking, it is plausible that norms on smoking behavior are reproduced across generations along a continuum of socioeconomic attainment. This leads us to expect the following hypothesis:</p>
<list id="list1-0044118X11407642" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 1</italic>: Parents’ educational level has a negative effect on smoking.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>However, parents play an important role in adolescent smoking behavior through other mechanisms as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0044118X11407642">Engels, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0044118X11407642">Wood, Read, Mitchell, &amp; Brand, 2004</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0044118X11407642">Engels (1998)</xref> sums up three possible avenues through which parents affect their children’s smoking behavior. First the <italic>availability</italic> of cigarettes in a household where the parents smoke might increase the chance that children pick up smoking. A second possible reason is that children pick up smoking by <italic>imitating</italic> their smoking parents. Third, some authors hypothesized that <italic>family norms, values</italic>, and <italic>lifestyles</italic> affect children’s smoking behavior (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0044118X11407642">Engels, 1998</xref>, pp. 63-64 for discussion).</p>
<p>The latter argument supports a social capital perspective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0044118X11407642">Coleman, 1988</xref>) that states that parents play an important role in enforcing norms that refute deviant behavior such as smoking. Therefore, we argue that parental norms toward smoking play a significant role in the initiation of adolescent tobacco use. If parents condone smoking, it becomes more likely that their children start smoking. Hence, our second hypothesis is as follows:</p>
<list id="list2-0044118X11407642" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 2</italic>: Students with parents who disapprove of smoking are less likely to smoke than students with parents who approve of smoking.</p></list-item>
</list>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0044118X11407642">
<title>Adolescent Smoking and School Tracks</title>
<p>Independent of social class origin, it may be expected that school type/track affects smoking behavior. One mechanism in this regard concerns the differential myopia across school tracks with regard to costs and benefits of behavior. In the academic, university-preparatory track, it can be assumed that students have a longer time horizon with regard to the costs and benefits of their studies than in the vocational track. In the vocational track, students are likely to enter the labor market before the age of 20, which is when they will start to earn incomes. Students in the academic track, however, will consider their educational career ended not before completing university around the age of 23, implying that a longer time horizon is needed to reap the benefits of education. Extending this line of reasoning to health-related behaviors such as smoking, it is plausible that students enrolled in the vocational track are more myopic than students in the academic track, leading to less disapproval concerning smoking, as the short-term gains may outweigh the long-term “costs” of bad health. Hence, our third hypothesis is as follows:</p>
<list id="list3-0044118X11407642" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 3</italic>: Children enrolled in vocational tracks smoke more often than children enrolled in higher level tracks.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>However, an alternative theory that explains why school track affects smoking behavior is that school types differ in terms of the composition of student populations in important ways. School composition refers to the distribution of social background characteristics, such as parental attitude toward smoking and parental educational level, at the school level.</p>
<p>First, given that social origin affects school track and smoking, between-track smoking differences may reflect differences in social background of student populations. Second, if social networks are essential for the diffusion of smoking, it is likely that the social composition of the school affects students’ smoking behavior independent of individual characteristics. Given the social selection in school track, it is likely that the social composition varies in terms of parental education and parental norms regarding smoking, both at the individual and at the school level. We test our fourth hypothesis put forth as follows:</p>
<list id="list4-0044118X11407642" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 4</italic>: Compositional differences are responsible for track effects on smoking, that is, controlling for school composition in terms of social background and smoking attitudes will decrease the effect of track on smoking behavior.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Moreover, because school networks are so essential for the diffusion of smoking behavior, it is unlikely that children’s smoking behavior can adequately be explained by examining their individual (parental) characteristics, without paying attention to the composition of the school. If school networks are indeed important, it is likely that relevant characteristics of the parents of peers affect smoking behavior of children in addition to the characteristics of their own parents. Thus, for the two parental characteristics under study (parents’ education and parental norms regarding smoking), we expect the following:</p>
<list id="list5-0044118X11407642" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 5</italic>: The composition of the school, in terms of parental characteristics, affects smoking behavior over and above the effects of individual characteristics.</p></list-item>
</list>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0044118X11407642">
<title>School Organization and Effects on Smoking</title>
<p>The Dutch educational system is a very interesting case to investigate differences across tracks in terms of smoking behavior. In the Dutch system, although strongly differentiated in different school tracks, there is variation among school organizations in the number of tracks that are offered. Some organizations offer all three tracks (vocational, general, academic), whereas other schools only offer the vocational track, a combination of general and academic tracks, or, in some cases, only the academic track. Given this variability, we can more closely scrutinize the tracking arguments explained above. Assuming that mixed schools—schools that offer VMBO as well HAVO and VWO tracks at one location—offer more possibilities for contacts between pupils of different school types than schools that only offer either academic/general tracks or the vocational track, such contacts could lead to two different scenarios.</p>
<p>First, intertrack contacts could lead to an intensification of between-track differences resulting from differences in lifestyle preferences. This leads to magnified effects of school track in mixed schools relative to separate schools. Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0044118X11407642">Bourdieu (1984)</xref>, some authors argue that smoking can be seen as part of a lifestyle, as an expression of taste that is used to delimit symbolic boundaries between social groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0044118X11407642">Pampel, 2006</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0044118X11407642">Pampel (2006)</xref> tested this cultural hypothesis by looking at the correlations between smoking and music preferences. He concluded that both socioeconomic status and cultural tastes correlate with smoking behavior.</p>
<p>Following this line of thought, we argue that smoking as a means for distinction may particularly play a role if people of different social groups are confronted with each other. Assuming that lifestyles related to smoking are different across school types, we can thus hypothesize as follows:</p>
<list id="list6-0044118X11407642" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 6a</italic>: Smoking differences across school tracks become more pronounced if students of different school tracks are placed in the same school locations.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>An alternative theory concerning school organizations would, however, start from the idea that contacts between students of different social groups modify networks within schools in such a way that networks are more diverse with regard to social class, learning abilities, and lifestyles. If this is true, mixed schools may offer “bridging” networks more than schools that only offer one school type, and more norms may be disseminated that originate from groups other than one’s own. Such networks are similar to what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0044118X11407642">Morgan and Sørensen (1999)</xref> have called <italic>horizon-expanding</italic> networks. Through horizon expansion, it may then be expected as follows:</p>

<title>Data Analytic Approach</title>
<p>Testing Hypotheses 1, 2, and 3 is done by a fairly straightforward estimation with individual-level variables. The school-level variables, to examine the school composition and organization effects, need more elaboration. In the sociological literature, it has been shown that the school context determines school outcomes through the school norms that are conveyed through networks surrounding schools. In contexts where there is much interaction among parents, between parents and school officials, and between parents and children, it is said that homogeneous “norm-enforcing social networks” are created that positively affect schooling outcomes and negatively affect deviant behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0044118X11407642">Coleman &amp; Hoffer, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0044118X11407642">Dijkstra, Veenstra, &amp; Peschar, 2004</xref>). For norm enforcement to develop, it is essential that networks are homogeneous, and it can thus be expected that a lower school-level dispersion in social background variables leads to stronger norm-enforcement. As the data set does not provide network variables, a proxy variable for network effects is needed to examine the effect of school composition as stated in Hypotheses 4 and 5.</p>
<p>The effect of school composition is examined in two ways. First, the parameters of the <italic>average</italic> educational level of the parents and <italic>average</italic> parental attitude on smoking behavior is estimated in Model 4 (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0044118X11407642">Table 2</xref>). Second, the parameter for the <italic>dispersion</italic> (standard deviation) of the educational level of the parents and parental attitude on smoking behavior is estimated in Model 5 (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0044118X11407642">Table 2</xref>). The first step in testing Hypothesis 4 is to model the effect of school track in Model 3. The second step is adding the parameters for the <italic>average</italic> score of the educational level of the parents and parental attitude on smoking behavior in Model 4 and the parameters for the <italic>dispersion</italic> of the educational level of the parents and parental attitude on smoking behavior in Model 5 and see if this significantly changes the school track parameters.</p>

<p>To test Hypotheses 6a and 6b on the school organization effects of “horizon-expanding social networks” on smoking behavior, a dichotomous variable “mixed schools” is constructed that indicates whether different schools are geographically located at one location (building) or at separate locations (buildings). The next step is to look at the interactions with different school tracks at the school level. Again, the mixed-school variable is a proxy for social network effects.</p>

<title>Data and Method</title>
<sec id="section8-0044118X11407642">
<title>Data</title>
<p>The data come from the Dutch National School Survey on Substance Use 2007 (DNSSSU). This is a cross section study among 12- to 18-year-old high school students. The sample consists of schools and classes nested in schools. First, the schools were randomly sampled, and, second, within these schools classes were randomly sampled. In total, 7,415 students have been interviewed. From 4,119 students of this sample, the parents were also interviewed. From the data set, we only used the students with information on the parents. Because of the differences in duration of the different tracks, we only looked at respondents from age 12 till 16 to prevent an overrepresentation of HAVO and VWO students. After deleting respondents with missing values, the number of cases is 3,984, nested in 147 schools.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0044118X11407642">
<title>Dependent Variable</title>
<p>The dependent variable is “smoking.” The original smoking variable is an ordinal scaled variable that ranks in eight categories from “I never smoked” to “more than 20 cigarettes a day.” Because of the large 0 category, a linear (OLS) model is not adequate; therefore, the smoking variable was recoded in the dummy variable daily smoker versus nondaily smoker and used in a binary logistic multilevel model (see below).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0044118X11407642">
<title>Independent Variables</title>
<p>Gender is labeled 1 = <italic>girl</italic>, 0 = <italic>boy</italic>. The variable “age” ranges from 12 to 16 years. The variable “school type” has three categories: VMBO (prevocational), HAVO (intermediate general education, preparing for tertiary vocational college), and VWO (academic track, preparing for university). Parental educational level is used as an indicator for social background. This is an ordinal variable with 4 dummy categories. At the school level, the average and standard deviation was generated.</p>
<p>Mixed school organization is a dichotomous variable with the category on the school level: 0 = <italic>only a VMBO school or a school offering only HAVO and/or VWO</italic>, and 1 = <italic>a VMBO with a HAVO and/or VWO school at single geographical location</italic>. The parental smoking attitude variable that consisted of two questions: “Do you find it acceptable that your child experiments with smoking?” and “Do you think is it alright if your child would smoke on a daily basis?” The two items have a correlation of .60. At the school level, the standard deviation of parental smoking attitude was calculated for every school. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0044118X11407642">Table 1</xref> gives an overview of the descriptive statistics of the used variables.</p>

<sec id="section11-0044118X11407642">
<title>Multilevel Logistic Regression Modeling</title>
<p>As the research question and hypotheses deal with school composition, a OLS regression model would not be appropriate. With OLS regression, the assumption is that all cases (e.g., students) are independent and randomly sampled. In our data, students are nested in schools, therefore the OLS assumption of independent residuals becomes invalid. To disentangle the explained variability, a two-level logistic multilevel model is used with two levels: the student and the school. More specifically, given the dichotomous nature of the dependent variable, a binary logistic model with random intercepts is used.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0044118X11407642">Table 2</xref> shows the results of seven multilevel logistic regression models used to test our hypotheses (Models 0-6). Models 1 through 6 show no significant gender effect on smoking. The effect of age is significant and stays more or less the same across Models 1 through 6; a higher age increases the risk to be a daily smoker.</p>
<p>In Model 2, we find evidence that parents’ educational level has a negative effect on smoking. Students with parents educated at the upper secondary or tertiary level are significantly less likely to be a daily smoker than students with parents educated at lower levels. This confirms the first hypothesis. The second hypothesis is also confirmed. The association between parental attitude and smoking is positive and stays more or less the same across Models 2 through 6. Thus, if parents approve of smoking, this is positively related to smoking. In line with the literature, this clearly points out that parental education and attitudes play a significant role in adolescent smoking.</p>
<p>In Model 1, we find evidence that students enrolled in vocational tracks more often smoke than students enrolled in higher tracks. This confirms the third hypothesis. This makes it plausible that students in vocational tracks are more myopic than students in higher tracks. In Model 3, we see the effect of parents’ education largely disappear. This indicates that parents’ education has an indirect effect on smoking, running through educational track. Even if we control for compositional effects in terms of parent characteristics on the school level in Models 4 and 5, the track effect holds up. This refutes our fourth hypothesis that compositional differences are responsible for track effects of smoking. Rather, within tracks, we see that parents’ education hardly matters, whereas for students with similar social backgrounds, educational track remains influential.</p>
<p>With Models 4 and 5, we test the hypothesis how the composition of the school (measured by the two parental characteristics under study: parents’ education and parental norms regarding smoking) affects smoking behavior over and above the effects of individual characteristics. We examine the composition of the school in two ways: by examining the <italic>average</italic> score on these variables at the school level and by examining the <italic>dispersion</italic> within schools. Model 4 shows that the average score of parents’ education has a positive effect on smoking. So, among students with the same individual social background, we find that students are more inclined to smoke if they attend a school with a high average parental educational attainment. Model 5 shows that the dispersion of parents’ education at the school level has a negative effect on smoking. Parental norms regarding smoking on the school level have no significant effect.</p>
<p>Hypotheses 6a and 6b test two different scenarios for how school organization affects smoking. Intertrack contact can intensify between-track differences due to a taste for distinction. Therefore, Hypothesis 6a argues that smoking differences across schools become more pronounced if students of different school tracks are placed in the same locations. Model 6 shows that this is only the case for intermediate general (HAVO) students. HAVO students, who smoke less than VMBO students, smoke even less when they attend a school that also houses prevocational (VMBO) students. This can be interpreted by the argument that smoking is used to delimit symbolic boundaries between different social groups. If this is true, then Hypothesis 6b, which argues that through horizon expansion smoking differences between students of different school tracks are less pronounced in mixed schools relative to separate schools, must be refuted.</p>

<title>Conclusion and Discussion</title>
<p>This study provides a unique and significant contribution to increasing knowledge of adolescent smoking behavior by investigating how the physical organization of the Dutch educational system—separate school tracks in separate locations or together in one location—interacts with social background.</p>
<p>In line with existing research, we found evidence that individual characteristics such as socioeconomic background and parental attitudes toward smoking play a role. However, this article shows that the effect of social background is mediated by school tracks. Social background effects are almost fully explained by differential educational enrollments of students in different tracks. Within tracks, social background has hardly any effect on smoking. Tracking differences persist after controlling for social background, indicating that for students of similar backgrounds, tracking affects smoking in a predictable way; students in lower tracks are more likely to smoke daily than students in higher tracks.</p>
<p>We also examined possible effects of school composition and organization that were expected based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0044118X11407642">Morgan and Sørensen’s (1999)</xref> thesis on horizon-expanding and norm-enforcing social networks. Based on this perspective, it was argued that students in mixed-track schools had a more horizon-expanding network, leading to the incorporation of norms of other groups than one’s own. By contrast, in schools that only offer general/academic tracks or the prevocational track networks were assumed to be more homogeneous and norm enforcing. This led us to hypothesize that students in the prevocational track would smoke less whereas students in the general/academic tracks would smoke more, if they were placed in a mixed school (compared with a single-track school). We did not find evidence for this hypothesis. On the contrary, we found that students in the general track, who smoke less than students in the prevocational track, smoke even less if they are placed in a school that also houses the prevocational track. This finding may be explained by the theory that smoking (or not smoking) is part of a lifestyle where a sense for distinction becomes more prevalent if students are placed in environments where contacts with other groups are promoted.</p>
<p>Some caution is justified concerning horizon-expanding and norm-enforcing networks because our data have no network data on friendship networks. The survey data used here for the measures for the compositional effects are not optimal to measure network effects. We had to make assumptions about the norm-enforcing or horizon-expanding structure of networks. The mean and standard deviation of parental educational level and attitudes on smoking and a dichotomous variable for school organization are used as proxy indicators for social capital. Yet we do believe that this operationalization, to a certain degree, approximates measuring social capital affects because using family background characteristics are proven to be good indicators for social capital in former studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0044118X11407642">Coleman, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0044118X11407642">van de Werfhorst, 2004</xref>). Moreover, school composition effects have often been theorized from the perspective of social networks in educational studies.</p>
<p>Taking into account these limitations, our study does provide some relevant information for smoking-prevention education. The study shows, in concordance with other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0044118X11407642">Waldron &amp; Lye, 1990</xref>), that school track matters in the variation of not only smoking prevalence but also social background. In addition, we found some small but significant effects of the mean and standard deviation of parental educational level and the interaction of school organization with intermediate general education. Dutch high school smoking prevention education is differentiated between tracks, but prevention education programs directed at their parents are not. The fact that students attending the lower tracks are more likely to have family backgrounds with low socioeconomic status and higher smoking prevalence suggest this differentiation be taken into account when developing and implementing smoking-prevention education programs.</p>
<p>To open up the black box of network structures for the explanation of substance use of youngsters, it is therefore essential to incorporate network analysis. If proper network data and techniques are used, it is plausible that network effects get a more serious place in the explanation for smoking behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0044118X11407642">Mercken, Snijders, Steglich, &amp; de Vries, 2009</xref>). The balance in favor of individual characteristics in the survey data of this article may result from the fact that network data have not been used.</p>

<p>The VMBO program has four tracks varying significantly in terms of academic achievement. However, in this study, we focus on variations between rather than within different school types.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the National Peilstation Survey does not include parents’ occupation or income as additional measures of social background. Yet given the pivotal role of education for smoking and of parents’ education for track placement of children, we contend that parents’ education is highly relevant to study the relationship between social background, type of education, and smoking.</p>
