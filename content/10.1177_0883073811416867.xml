<p>The aim of this study was to assess the effects of chronic iron deficiency on neuropsychological traits in infants. We established the nutritional iron status and assessed the neuropsychological characteristics of 58 Mexican 14- to 18-month-old infants. The Bayley Scales of Infant Development, preschool language scales and an environmental sound perception task designed expressly for the study, were used. The infants’ mothers were asked to fill out 2 questionnaires concerning their child’s sociodemographic background. Six different neuropsychological domains were analyzed. Results showed that the chronic iron deficiency group did show significantly lower scores on language, environmental sound perception, and motor measures, when compared with infants with normal nutritional iron status at 6 and 14 to 18 months. Our conclusion is that the development of language and motor skills and environmental sound perception appeared to be sensitive to the effects of chronic iron deficiency in infants.</p>

<body>
<p>Iron deficiency is the most prevalent childhood nutritional disorder worldwide.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0883073811416867">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0883073811416867">2</xref></sup> It can be related to such factors as a diet low in iron, impaired intestinal iron absorption, and parasitic infections. Since iron intervenes in numerous metabolic processes, including oxygen transportation, adenosine triphosphate production, metabolism of neurotransmitters, DNA synthesis, and myelin production, several health processes could be affected in children who have a low concentration of this element. Iron deficiency is classified in 3 stages: (1) iron depletion, a decrease in the normal reserve that has no functional consequences; (2) iron deficiency without anemia, biochemical changes reflected in the normal seric ferritin reserve; and, (3) iron deficiency anemia, subnormal concentrations of seric ferritin and hemoglobin.</p>
<p>Previous findings related to the effects of iron deficiency without anemia on cognitive development in infants are inconsistent. Some studies indicate no association, but low performance scores on the Bayley scales of infant development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0883073811416867">3</xref></sup>; whereas others have found lower performance among infants on the mental,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0883073811416867">4</xref></sup> motor,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0883073811416867">5</xref></sup> and behavioral<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0883073811416867">6</xref>
</sup> tests included in those scales. In more recent studies, an adverse effect of iron deficiency without anemia on motor development has been reported more consistently, based on observations of motor activity at home<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0883073811416867">7</xref></sup> and using motor development assessment tools such as the Peabody Developmental Motor Scale, the infant neurological international battery, and the Bayley behavioral rating scale; or through more informal assessments of the gross motor development milestones and a sequential/bi-manual coordination toy retrieval task.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0883073811416867">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>With respect to iron deficiency anemia, study results are more consistent and show a broader cognitive, motor and behavioral impairment in infants. However, they cannot be considered conclusive. Several studies of infants indicate that iron deficiency anemia is associated with significantly lower performances on the mental,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0883073811416867">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0883073811416867">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0883073811416867">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0883073811416867"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0883073811416867"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0883073811416867">12</xref></sup> motor,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0883073811416867">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0883073811416867">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0883073811416867">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0883073811416867">12</xref></sup> and behavioral tasks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0883073811416867">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0883073811416867">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0883073811416867">12</xref></sup> included in the Bayley Scales of Infant Development, the Denver Developmental Screening Test,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0883073811416867">4</xref></sup> in observations of motor activity recorded in the home,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0883073811416867">7</xref></sup> in a motor development assessment battery,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0883073811416867">8</xref></sup> and in behavioral observations measuring the duration and frequency of free play in both the laboratory<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0883073811416867">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0883073811416867">14</xref></sup> and at home.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0883073811416867">14</xref>
</sup> In addition, the functional isolation hypothesis has been explored in infants with iron deficiency anemia. This hypothesis, derived from research on generalized undernutrition, holds that a decrease in the activity of malnourished infants leads them to seek less stimulation from their physical and social environments. In response to the infants’ behavior, caregivers thus tend to offer less stimulation. Over time, these altered behavior patterns can impede the child’s normal acquisition of environmental information and adversely affect her/his development.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0883073811416867">14</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Although existing studies of the effects of chronic iron deficiency on infant abilities are few, some have found significantly lower scores on the Bayley mental<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0883073811416867">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0883073811416867">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0883073811416867">12</xref></sup> and motor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0883073811416867">12</xref></sup> scales in infants who have been affected by iron deficiency anemia for more than 3 months. As we have seen, most of those studies used standardized developmental tests, such as the Bayley scales, and took global scores as the principal measure of outcomes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0883073811416867">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0883073811416867">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0883073811416867">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0883073811416867"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0883073811416867"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0883073811416867">12</xref></sup> Few, however, have done analyses of specific items related to language,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0883073811416867">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0883073811416867">15</xref></sup> attention,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0883073811416867">16</xref></sup> recognition memory,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0883073811416867">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0883073811416867">17</xref></sup> object permanence,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0883073811416867">17</xref></sup> and gross motor development.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0883073811416867">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0883073811416867">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0883073811416867">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0883073811416867">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0883073811416867">18</xref></sup>

<p>In this study, the effects of chronic iron deficiency on neuropsychological traits were assessed in 14- to 18-month-old infants who had been diagnosed with iron deficiency 1 year earlier. To evaluate them, we used Aylward’s general neuropsychological design<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0883073811416867">19</xref></sup> for early neuropsychological assessment. Our hypothesis was that, even at such an early age, the effects of chronic iron deficiency on neuropsychological development would be detectable, but that no underperformance would be found when infants at this age (14 to 18 months) presented iron deficiency for the first time.</p>

<title>Selection and Description of Participants</title>
<p>Subjects were recruited from a previous study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0883073811416867">20</xref></sup> (n = 154) conducted at “Doctor Juan I. Menchaca” Civil Hospital in Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico. In Monterrosa et al<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0883073811416867">20</xref></sup> research, infants were followed from birth to 6 months in a nutritional evaluation. We invited all parents of Monterrosa et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0883073811416867">20</xref></sup> sample that could be reached by telephone or at home when their infants were 14 to 18 months old. A total of 74 families were contacted (48%), as the rest were no longer living at the addresses recorded for the earlier study, but of those 74 only 58 mothers (38% of the total of Monterrosa et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0883073811416867">20</xref></sup> sample) gave their written consent for the blood venipuncture test required to determine their infants’ current nutritional iron status (serum ferritin and hemoglobin), and for the neuropsychological assessment. The Ethics Committee/Institutional Review Boards of the Instituto de Neurociencias (Neuroscience Institute) at Universidad de Guadalajara (University of Guadalajara) and the “Doctor Juan I. Menchaca” Civil Hospital approved the study design.</p>
<p>The inclusion criteria for Monterrosa et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0883073811416867">20</xref></sup> study were: first or second child, physiological gestation ≥37 weeks, birth weight ≥2500 grams, no perinatal pathology, no congenital malformations or genetic alterations, no prenatal infections, Apgar ≥7 at 5 minutes, and no chronic illness or neonatal hypoxia sequelae. Mothers’ ages ranged from 18 to 33 years (mean, 25.5 years) and no iron deficiency, with or without anemia, had occurred during their pregnancies. The infants had been given a blood venipuncture test at 6 months to verify their nutritional iron status (seric ferritin and hemoglobin concentration) but no neuropsychological assessments were conducted at that time, nor were their developmental milestones registered. All the infants that presented iron deficiency with or without anemia at that time received oral iron therapy (daily doses of 15 mg/kg of ferrous sulfate for 2 months).</p>
<p>The diagnostic biochemical criteria used by the previous study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0883073811416867">20</xref></sup> and in this study, were those proposed by the World Health Organization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0883073811416867">2</xref></sup>: for the normal iron nutritional status group, hemoglobin (grams per deciliter) ≥11 and seric ferritin (micrograms per liter) ≥12; for the iron deficiency without anemia group, hemoglobin (grams per deciliter) ≥11 and seric ferritin (micrograms per liter) &lt;12; and for the iron deficiency anemia group, hemoglobin (grams per deciliter) &lt;11 and seric ferritin (micrograms per liter) &lt;12. The hospital’s laboratory determined the concentrations of serum ferritin using immunoabsorbent assay, while hemoglobin concentrations were measured using an automated blood cell counter.</p>
<p>In this study, 58 infants aged 14 to 18 months were included. According to their iron nutritional status, the infants were grouped as follows: normal iron nutritional status, n = 30; iron deficiency without anemia, n = 17; iron deficiency anemia, n = 9; iron deficiency without hemoglobin value n = 2. No significant sociodemographic differences were found among these groups. In all 4 groups, the majority of the infants were boys, while the caregiver was most often the mother. Most of the children were living with both parents; the majority of the fathers were employees, while the mothers were homemakers. Mean parents’ age and parents’ number of years of schooling were also similar among groups (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0883073811416867">Table 1</xref>

<p>To determine the effect of chronic iron deficiency (the presence of iron deficiency on both blood tests: at ages 6 and 14–18 months) on cognitive development, our main objective, 2 groups were subsequently formed on the basis of the presence or absence of chronic iron deficiency at both ages tested: thus, group 1 included 25 infants that presented normal iron nutritional status at 6 and 14–18 months (hereinafter the always normal iron nutritional status group), while group 2 was made up of 6 infants that presented iron deficiency with or without anemia at both 6 and 14–18 months (hereinafter the chronic iron deficiency group). In the latter group, 1 infant presented iron deficiency without anemia at both ages, 3 infants showed iron deficiency without anemia at 6 months and iron deficiency anemia at 14–18 months, and 2 infants had iron deficiency without anemia at 6 months and presented iron deficiency but lacked the hemoglobin value at 14–18 months old. No significant sociodemographic differences were found between the 2 groups (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0883073811416867">Table 2</xref>
). Twenty-seven infants were not taken into account in the second analysis, as 15 of them presented a disparity between the iron concentration results on the 2 blood tests. Of the remaining 12 infants, 5 presented anemia without iron deficiency at 6 months, and no seric ferritin or hemoglobin values were available for 7 of them at age 6 months.</p>

<title>Assessment</title>
<p>Each child was assessed using the following tests:</p>
<p>(1) The Bayley Scales of Infant Development.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0883073811416867">21</xref></sup> This test was used to measure the mental and motor development and to evaluate the behavior of the infants. Mental, motor, and behavioral standard scores were computed.</p>
<p>(2) Preschool language scales<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0883073811416867">22</xref></sup> were used to measure receptive and expressive language ability. Three raw scores related to auditory comprehension, expressive communication and total language were taken into account. We used the raw scores because this test has not been extensively used in Mexican populations so no normative data is available for the country.</p>
<p>(3) An environmental sound perception task designed expressly for this study to evaluate the infants’ ability to identify nonverbal auditory stimuli. Ten physical toys or objects (dog, bird, telephone, rooster, car, crying baby, rattle, keys, cat, train) and the recordings (5 seconds each) of their respective sounds were used: dog barking, bird singing, telephone ringing, rooster crowing, car starting, baby crying, rattle shaking, keys moving, cat meowing, and train whistling. The 10 objects were placed together in front of the child, who was then asked to listen to the sounds one-by-one and point to the object that was related to it. One point was given for each correct match, so the maximum score was 10. Before using this task in this study, 14 sounds were pretested with a pilot group of 26 infants (10 girls, 16 boys) aged 14 to 22 months (mean, 16 months), used to assess the adequacy of this task for this age range. A mean of 5 (standard deviation 2.36) correct answers was obtained. Ten of the 14 sounds were chosen, as the other 4 proved difficult to identify at this age.</p>
<p>Evaluations of the infants and interviews with their mothers were all conducted by the first author in a spacious, well-lit room, free of distractions, in “Doctor Juan I. Menchaca” Civil Hospital’s nutrition wing. Each child’s mother was present in the room throughout the evaluation process. It is important to note that this was a blind study, so the psychologist in charge of assessing the infants had no knowledge of their iron nutritional status. The assessment sessions lasted 2 hours. Finally, the blood venipuncture process was carried out by a trained pediatric nurse on the same day as the neuropsychological assessment, but in a different room. The psychologist was not present.</p>

<title>Statistics</title>
<p>All data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) for Windows, release 11.5.0.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0883073811416867">23</xref></sup> Standard scores for the Bayley Scales of Infant Development and raw scores for the preschool language scale were obtained. Later, the raw scores from the tasks included in the tests were converted into percentages and arranged in 6 neuropsychological domains: environmental sound perception, receptive language, expressive language, fine motor abilities, gross motor abilities, and executive function (namely, A-not-B, problem solving, and tool use) following the general neuropsychological design proposed by Aylward<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0883073811416867">19</xref></sup> for early neuropsychological assessment. Cronbach <italic>α</italic> analysis was then applied and found internal consistency reliability among the items in each 1 of the 6 neuropsychological domains, as follows: environmental sound perception, <italic>α</italic> (0.6727); receptive language, <italic>α</italic> (0.7809); expressive language, <italic>α</italic> (0.7650); fine motor abilities, <italic>α</italic> (0.5541); gross motor abilities, <italic>α</italic> (0.7579); and executive function, <italic>α</italic> (0.6320).</p>
<p>Two analyses were carried out, the first included n = 56 infants divided into 3 groups: (1) normal iron nutritional status, n = 30; (2) iron deficiency without anemia, n = 17; and, (3) iron deficiency anemia, n = 9. In the second analysis (n = 31), 2 groups were compared: group 1 was the always normal iron nutritional status, n = 25; and group 2 was the chronic iron deficiency, n = 6.</p>
<p>The categorical variables were analyzed using chi square, while the continuous variables were examined with the Mann Whitney-<italic>U</italic> test for the 2 groups, and the Kruskal-Wallis test for the 3 groups. The level of significance was set at <italic>P</italic> ≤ .05.</p>
<p>Because we had only 2 small groups for the second analysis, we used not only statistical significance to evaluate the results, but also strengthen the statistical analysis by applying the effect size of Spearman r<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0883073811416867">2</xref></sup> (squared r), a standardized, objective measure of the magnitude of an observed effect.</p>

<p>The second analysis compared the scores obtained by the always normal iron nutritional status group (n = 25) with those of the chronic iron deficiency group (n = 6). This comparison showed that the latter had achieved significantly lower scores on the Bayley motor scale, in expressive communication, and on the total language subscale of the preschool language scale. Later analysis of the neuropsychological domains showed that the chronic iron deficiency group had lower scores than the always normal iron nutritional status group on environmental sound perception, receptive language, gross motor abilities and expressive language. To reinforce the statistical analysis, Spearman r<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0883073811416867">2</xref></sup> (r squared) was applied to measure the effect size of chronic iron deficiency. This measure showed an effect of medium size, per Cohen,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0883073811416867">24</xref></sup> for environmental sound perception and expressive language; an effect larger than small size, also per Cohen,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0883073811416867">24</xref></sup> was evident in the scores for receptive language and gross motor abilities (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0883073811416867">Table 4</xref>). It is worthwhile to note the importance of our findings of the effect size, since the analysis was conducted with such a small sample.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The main aim of this study was to ascertain if an early chronic iron deficiency effect on cognitive, motor, and behavioral development is observable when infants are 14 to 18 months old.</p>
<p>The first analysis was conducted to determine whether iron deficiency presented for the first time at 14 to 18 months of age affects neuropsychological development, but the comparison of 3 groups of infants (normal iron nutritional status, iron deficiency without anemia, and iron deficiency anemia) showed no differences among them.</p>
<p>Previous studies of infants have reported negative effects of iron deficiency anemia on scores attained on the Bayley mental scale,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0883073811416867">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0883073811416867">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0883073811416867">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0883073811416867">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0883073811416867"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0883073811416867">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0883073811416867">15</xref></sup> the Denver Developmental Screening Test,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0883073811416867">4</xref></sup> and the Bayley motor scale.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0883073811416867">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0883073811416867">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0883073811416867">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0883073811416867">12</xref></sup> Moreover, those studies have observed certain behavioral peculiarities that led to the infants studied being characterized as fearful,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0883073811416867">3</xref></sup> insecure,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0883073811416867">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0883073811416867">14</xref></sup> unhappy,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0883073811416867">14</xref></sup> cautious,<sup>

<p>In contrast, findings for iron deficiency without anemia groups have been inconclusive, neither entirely consistent nor coincident. On the 1 hand, Lozoff et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0883073811416867">3</xref></sup> found that iron deficiency without anemia is not associated with low scores on developmental tests, nor with behavioral alterations, and that only the iron deficiency anemia condition affects cognitive, motor and behavioral development in infants. Similarly, Deinard et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0883073811416867">6</xref></sup> reported no differences between infants with moderate and severe iron deficiency without anemia compared with a normal iron nutritional status group, though variations in their behavioral characteristics were seen. Finally, Oski et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0883073811416867">26</xref></sup> identified only a trend toward lower scores on the Bayley mental scale in the iron deficiency without anemia group.</p>
<p>Contrary to those results, Akman et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0883073811416867">4</xref></sup> and Baptista-González et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0883073811416867">5</xref></sup> found that iron deficiency without anemia does indeed affect cognitive development, and that its effect is already evident during infancy. Moreover, this latter work<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0883073811416867">5</xref></sup> pointed out that the degree of cognitive impairment increases with the severity of the iron deficiency condition.</p>
<p>The fact that we found no differences among groups can be related to the similarity of the sociodemographic context and perinatal background of the 3 groups included in our study (see Methods, and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0883073811416867">Table 1</xref>).</p>
<p>Indeed, several of the studies that found an effect of iron deficiency anemia on cognitive, motor, or behavioral development have also identified an association between iron deficiency anemia and certain demographic differences,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0883073811416867">10</xref>
</sup> including family composition,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0883073811416867">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0883073811416867">10</xref></sup> the intellectual and educational characteristics of mothers (lower intelligence quotient,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0883073811416867">10</xref></sup> fewer years of schooling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0883073811416867">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0883073811416867">12</xref></sup>), and some personality traits of the infants themselves (eg, higher timidity).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0883073811416867">17</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>It is important to mention that the World Health Organization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0883073811416867">2</xref></sup> reported a disparity in the prevalence of iron deficiency without anemia/iron deficiency anemia in preschool children between developed (10%–20%) and developing countries (30%–80%). The differences in the prevalence of iron deficiency without anemia/iron deficiency anemia between these types of countries could be related to variations in the socioeconomic and cultural background that characterized each one.</p>
<p>Thus, the association between iron deficiency (with or without anemia) and socioeconomic indicators of poverty can represent confounding variables for interpreting the effect of iron deficiency (with or without anemia) on psychomotor development, because when family and biological variables are controlled for, the effect of iron deficiency (with or without anemia) decreases, as in our study. It is important to consider that risk factors do not normally occur in isolation and that a combination of a larger number of such factors increases the probability that infants will achieve lower scores in cognitive, motor, or behavioral development.</p>
<p>The second analysis was conducted to explore our main objective; that is, to determine whether early chronic iron deficiency affects cognitive, motor, and behavioral development.</p>
<p>One unpredicted finding was that at 6 months of age, 7 infants presented iron deficiency and at 14 to 18 months, 6 of those children still had that deficiency, despite having received oral iron therapy (daily doses of 15 mg/kg of ferrous sulfate for 2 months).</p>
<p>The literature contains reports that between 36%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0883073811416867">10</xref></sup> and 57.89%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0883073811416867">12</xref></sup> of infants with moderate iron deficiency anemia fully corrected their iron and hemoglobin values after receiving 3 months of iron supplementation. Treatment failure found in this study can be related to the discontinuation or irregular administration of treatment, as Mexico has a high incidence of interruptions of therapeutic treatments for various diseases (55.5%–60%), especially chronic ones, complex treatments, treatments of more than 7 days’ duration, and in pediatric patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0883073811416867">27</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Concerning the comparison of the task scores between the 2 groups, infants with chronic iron deficiency underperformed the always normal iron nutritional status group on 4 of the 6 neuropsychological domains that were assessed: environmental sound perception, gross motor, receptive language, and expressive language. It is noteworthy that the scores achieved on the scales used to evaluate these 2 groups all fell within the normal range, a pattern that has been observed in other studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0883073811416867">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0883073811416867">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0883073811416867">12</xref></sup> According to the World Health Organization,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0883073811416867">2</xref></sup> infants that presented iron deficiency will have a delay in their psychomotor development, and when they reach school age they will show impaired performance in tests related to language, motor skills, and coordination, equivalent to a 5- to 10-point deficit in intelligence quotient. However, to our knowledge, mental deficiency in those children has never been reported.</p>

</sup> and Walter et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0883073811416867">12</xref></sup> already reported a negative effect of chronic iron deficiency (≥3 months) on cognitive,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0883073811416867">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0883073811416867">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0883073811416867">12</xref></sup> motor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0883073811416867">12</xref></sup> and language<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0883073811416867">12</xref></sup> development in infants. Upon doing follow-up on their samples, they found that this effect was still observable in school performance during childhood and even adolescence.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0883073811416867">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0883073811416867"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0883073811416867"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0883073811416867"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0883073811416867">32</xref></sup></p>
<p>In infancy, language and motor skills undergo rapid development, while in this same period we also see advances in other cognitive domains; for example, executive functions. While our study found no differences in the tasks related to executive functions (A-not-B, problem solving, tool use), Carter et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0883073811416867">17</xref></sup> reported lower scores on the object permanence task, though not on the A-not-B test, in infants from 9 to 10 months with iron deficiency anemia. In general, greater variability in the expression of cognitive development is characteristic of younger age groups when a cognitive domain is just beginning to develop; thus, our results suggest that at the ages we studied, it is too early to perceive the effects of chronic iron deficiency on functions that attain higher levels of development later in life, such as executive functions. Hence, we would expect that the effects of chronic iron deficiency on those functions would appear at more advanced ages, so longitudinal studies covering a wider age range are needed to assess the effect of infantile chronic iron deficiency on executive functions.</p>
<p>During the last trimester of pregnancy and the first 2 years of postnatal life, rapid brain growth occurs. This is called a “growth spurt,” a period in which the central nervous system is extremely vulnerable to nutritional deficiencies. Although there is a greater chance of recovery in early stages of development, it is probable that in these stages chronic iron deficiency does affect brain plasticity significantly and its effects would appear primarily in a lag in language and motor development. At older ages, the effects of iron deficiency might be manifested in other, more complex, and sophisticated cognitive functions.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our study has produced 4 main findings. First, we found that almost all the infants that presented iron deficiency at 6 months still had it at 14 to 18 months. Second, chronic iron deficiency has an effect on cognitive and motor development that is evident during infancy and expressed in poor performance on tasks related to language, motor abilities and environmental sound perception. Third, no effect of nonchronic iron deficiency was evident, suggesting that when iron deficiency is nonchronic it has adverse effects on a child’s neuropsychological development only when combined with certain environmental and biological variables. This could explain the fact that, in some studies, nonchronic iron deficiency is related to low scores. Finally, the observable effect of the actual scores achieved were all within the broad range of normal; from a neurodevelopmental perspective none would be considered significantly delayed or justify a developmental diagnosis at this moment of development. However, evaluating other aspects that can be examined at older ages, such as mathematics skills, reading, memory, attention, and executive functions could reflect a greater impact on cognition. Thus, the results for the age group studied in this research cannot be generalized to other cohorts, due to the absence of cognitive functions that only become evident later in life. Longitudinal studies over a wider age range can provide information on changes in the manifestations of the effects of chronic iron deficiency on neuropsychological development in relation to the age of children.</p>
