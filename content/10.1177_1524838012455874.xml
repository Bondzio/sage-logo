<abstract>
<p>Women who experience intimate partner violence (IPV) victimization are more likely to struggle with substance abuse problems than are women who do not experience IPV. Given the connection between IPV victimization and substance abuse, recommended practices urge collaboration between domestic violence service agencies and substance abuse treatment agencies to provide comprehensive services for women with these co-occurring problems. However, domestic violence and substance abuse services have unique histories of development that have led to distinct ways of service delivery. To promote successful collaborations, service providers and researchers are developing strategies to foster relationships across the two service sectors. The authors conducted a review of this emerging body of knowledge with the aim of assembling recommendations for strategies to foster collaboration between domestic violence and substance abuse services. The authors identified 15 documents for review inclusion and our analysis established 5 categories of documents. Findings yield key collaboration strategies and recommended service models. In addition, the review determined the existence of considerable challenges to promoting collaborative relationships between domestic violence and substance abuse treatment service sectors.</p>

<body>
<p>Women who experience intimate partner violence (IPV) are more likely to struggle with substance abuse problems relative to women whose lives are free from such victimization. The relationship between IPV and substance abuse is complex and diverse, with little evidence to clarify the directionality and risk processes between these two problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1524838012455874">Testa, 2004</xref>). Nonetheless, research has shown that women victimized by IPV have substance problems at 5 times the rate of women in the general population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1524838012455874">Logan, Walker, Cole, &amp; Leukefeld, 2002</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1524838012455874">Kilpatrick, Acierno, Resnick, Saunders, and Best (1997</xref>) conducted one of the few longitudinal studies of these two issues, and determined that women’s use of drugs nearly doubled the likelihood of experiencing an assault. Recent research has added to the evidence about the relationships between IPV and substance abuse problems. One study of IPV survivors in a domestic violence shelter determined that nearly 68% were at moderate to high risk for substance abuse problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1524838012455874">Fowler, 2007</xref>). Similarly, in a sample of African American women treated in an emergency department, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1524838012455874">Hankin, Smith, Daugherty, and Houry, (2010)</xref> found those who screened positive for IPV were at significantly higher risk of substance abuse (i.e., alcohol, drugs, and nicotine) than women who did not screen positive for IPV. The link between IPV and substance abuse problems was also demonstrated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1524838012455874">Martin, Beaumont, and Kupper (2003</xref>), who determined a relationship between IPV and substance use among pregnant women, particularly those experiencing physical and psychological IPV.</p>
<p>Given the connection between IPV victimization and substance abuse, recommended practices for addressing these co-occurring problems urge domestic violence agencies and substance abuse treatment services to screen, to assess, and to assist women with both issues in a coordinated way (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1524838012455874">Bennett &amp; Bland, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1524838012455874">Finkelstein, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1524838012455874">Humphreys, Regan, River, &amp; Thiara, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1524838012455874">Logan et al., 2002</xref>). Recommended practices also encourage domestic violence service agencies and substance abuse treatment agencies in the same community or locale to collaborate in providing comprehensive services for women with these co-occurring problems. However, domestic violence and substance abuse treatment services have unique histories of development that have led to service delivery in distinct ways in each sector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1524838012455874">Bennett &amp; Bland, 2008</xref>). Thus, collaboration between the domestic violence services and substance abuse treatment sectors tends to be infrequent and superficial. As a result, IPV and substance abuse problems are typically addressed independently, with separate intervention strategies. With such single-focused approaches, providers may never address the problem that they consider ancillary. Moreover, the issue that providers deem to be the focal problem might not ever be fully addressed because the unaddressed ancillary problem maintains the focal problem.</p>
<sec id="section1-1524838012455874">
<title>Domestic Violence Services</title>
<p>Domestic violence agencies typically offer crisis intervention, advocacy, individual counseling, support groups, and shelter services with the aim of providing safety for survivors and accountability for perpetrators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1524838012455874">Macy, Giattina, Sangster, Crosby, &amp; Montijo, 2009</xref>). Within the context of these services delivery strategies, providers offer information and emotional support to help survivors regain a sense of control over their lives, to understand their options, and to identify courses of action that survivors feel are best for them to pursue. The literature typically describes such interventions as based on the empowerment philosophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1524838012455874">Black, 2003</xref>). Domestic violence services are considered to be empowerment-based services when providers: (a) collaboratively and actively involve the survivor in service planning; (b) emphasize survivors’ strengths and resources; and (c) provide information and teach skills to enhance survivors’ self-efficacy (Busch &amp; Valentine, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1524838012455874">2000</xref>). The literature on domestic violence services recommends that providers seek to help all survivors using such empowerment-based services, including survivors with substance abuse problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1524838012455874">Macy et al., 2009</xref>). Nonetheless, research has shown that domestic violence service providers often report significant challenges in delivering services to survivors with such problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1524838012455874">Macy, Giattina, Crosby &amp; Parish, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1524838012455874">Macy, Giattina, Montijo, &amp; Ermentrout, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1524838012455874">Zweig, Schlichter &amp; Burt, 2002</xref>). Further, considerable controversy exists in the literature regarding how domestic violence service providers should address the needs of survivors with substance abuse problems, particularly when delivering shelter services to survivors with these co-occurring problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1524838012455874">Macy et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1524838012455874">Zweig et al., 2002</xref>).</p>

<title>Substance Abuse Treatment Services</title>
<p>The National Institute of Drug Abuse (NIDA; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1524838012455874">2009</xref>) recommends both medication and behavioral therapy as effective treatment approaches for substance abuse. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1524838012455874">NIDA (2009)</xref> notes that behavioral therapies for substance abuse treatment include approaches such as cognitive behavioral therapy, motivational interviewing, and multidimensional family therapy. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1524838012455874">NIDA (2009)</xref> also indicates these treatments can be delivered in outpatient or residential settings. A recent nationwide survey determined that general substance abuse counseling is used nearly universally by treatment facilities in the United States (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration [SAMHSA], <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1524838012455874">2010</xref>). This type of counseling is a short-term treatment comprised of supportive and expressive therapeutic techniques.</p>
<p>Although substance abuse counseling is the most pervasive form of treatment in U.S. treatment facilities, we note the recent development of the trauma-informed substance abuse service framework and associated treatment strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1524838012455874">Covington, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1524838012455874">Elliott, Bjelajac, Fallot, Markoff, &amp; Reed, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1524838012455874">Fallot &amp; Harris, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1524838012455874">SAMHSA, 2011</xref>). This novel service framework seeks to modify the ways in which mental health and substance abuse treatments are delivered to account for clients’ experiences of trauma, including various forms of violent victimization (i.e., childhood abuse, sexual assault, and IPV). For example, trauma-informed service strategies include maximizing clients’ control over their treatment plans, and minimizing the use of interventions that might cause clients to experience additional trauma (e.g., the use of physical restraints in psychiatric settings).</p>
<p>Trauma-informed approaches hold much appeal, and research findings on this service framework are promising. For example, randomized controlled trials of Seeking Safety—a trauma-informed treatment designed for individuals with co-occurring posttraumatic stress disorder and substance abuse—showed positive results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1524838012455874">Najavits, 2007</xref>). Nevertheless, the use of trauma-informed treatments is not widespread. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1524838012455874">SAMHSA (2010)</xref> determined that only 21% of U.S. treatment facilities use trauma-informed interventions either “always” or “often.” Nearly a third of U.S. treatment facilities reported using such interventions “rarely” or “never.” In addition, research on the efficacy of trauma-informed treatment is nascent. More work is needed to establish the efficacy of this service framework. Findings from a multisite, quasi-experimental study showed that even though the implementation of trauma-informed strategies had positive benefits for women’s mental health symptoms, such strategies did not produce similar effects for substance abuse symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1524838012455874">Morrissey et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>A potential limitation of the trauma-informed service framework for the co-occurrence of IPV and substance abuse specifically is the framework’s focus on trauma generally. Because the framework does not focus specifically on IPV-related trauma, the approach may overlook IPV survivors’ critical and unique needs, particularly those facing current and ongoing IPV. The specific needs of IPV survivors can include: (a) criminal justice issues related to IPV that are distinct from criminal justice issues related to substances; (b) issues around co-parenting with abusive partners and child custody; (c) divorce and separation; (d) emergency shelter and transitional housing; (e) stalking and threats by current or former partners; (f) legal remedies such as protection orders; and (g) issues around efforts by current and former partners to undermine survivors’ substance abuse recovery as a manifestation of IPV. In addition, women with co-occurring IPV and substance abuse problems who are mothers face distinct challenges regarding child protection services because IPV is considered a form of child endangerment in many communities. For these reasons, even substance abuse treatment agencies that use trauma-informed service frameworks may find it worthwhile to collaborate with domestic violence service agencies.</p>

<title>Current Research</title>
<p>To help promote successful collaborations between domestic violence and substance abuse treatment services, providers and researchers have been developing a body of knowledge regarding the recommended strategies to foster relationships across these two service sectors. This emerging literature is comprised of both empirical research and recommended strategies based on providers’ practical experiences. To the best of our knowledge, no comprehensive and systematic review of this literature has been undertaken. Such a review has the potential to summarize all recommended collaborative strategies into one document that, in turn, could provide valuable information to providers in both settings.</p>
<p>To help address this critical knowledge need, we conducted a comprehensive and systematic literature review of documents offering information or recommendations regarding collaborations between domestic violence and substance abuse services. Specifically, we sought to answer the following research questions. First, what types of documents (e.g., expert opinion, literature review, or empirical studies) have been developed regarding collaborations between domestic violence and substance abuse services? Second, what specific methods were used to develop each document type? Related to this second question, we were concerned with the methodological rigor used to develop the various documents. Third, what specific strategies or recommendations does this literature offer to promote effective collaborations between domestic violence services and substance abuse treatment services?</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1524838012455874" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>The overall aim of this review was to assemble documents that offered information or recommendations regarding collaboration between domestic violence and substance abuse services to help women affected by both issues. To address this overall aim, our research team used three search strategies to identify relevant documents. First, we performed a systematic literature review by searching databases (i.e., PsychInfo, Academic Search Premier, Social Services Abstracts, and PubMed) using combinations of the following key words and phrases: <italic>domestic violence, intimate partner violence, family violence, drug abuse, alcohol abuse, treatment</italic>, and <italic>intervention</italic>. In all, we identified 651 articles as potentially relevant for review.</p>
<p>We reviewed these articles using the following inclusion criteria: (a) the primary population of interest was women with co-occurring IPV and substance use disorders; (b) the document’s focus was on service collaboration (e.g., coordination, integration, or linkage) between domestic violence and substance abuse services for women, including identifying potential barriers; (c) articles offered advice, strategies, implications, or recommendations regarding service collaboration; and (d) the setting or intended audience was specific to IPV, substance abuse, or both. We set no exclusion criteria based on date of publication; however, all identified documents were published from 1992 to 2010. Of the 651 potential articles identified, 5 satisfied the criteria for inclusion in the review.</p>
<p>Given the paucity of peer-reviewed and scientific literature relevant to our review, we then used two additional search strategies. We conducted an Internet search using Google and GoogleScholar to locate relevant governmental documents, organizational manuals, and other documents related to domestic violence services and substance abuse services. These searches were conducted using the same combinations of the key words and phrases noted above. The third strategy consisted of a backwards search of documents that had previously been identified as relevant. Overall, both strategies resulted in a wider scope of publications for consideration, including best practice manuals, governmental and agency reports, and online articles. These additional search strategies yield another 20 documents potentially relevant for review. We carefully reviewed each to ensure that the documents met the expressed purpose of the review. Following review and discussion to reach consensus regarding the documents, an additional 10 document were determined to be relevant. Thus, 15 documents in total were identified for inclusion. For both the database and Google searches, we consulted with librarians at our university to determine the best key words and search strategies.</p>
<p>Next, we conducted an in-depth analysis of the relevant documents. To aid this analysis, we developed an abstraction tool that addressed the specific research aims of the review; this tool was used to review each document systematically. For each document, the tool captured information regarding the aims of the document, intended audience, service models, process strategies, study designs and samples, methodology, results, implications, strengths, and limitations. Documents were then compared to identify common themes and review findings.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1524838012455874">
<title>Findings</title>
<p>Documents reflected a wide variety of methods and focused on various components of service collaboration of domestic violence and substance abuse services for women. Nonetheless, our review efforts showed that the documents could be separated into five categories: (a) literature review and expert opinion; (b) surveys of current service delivery practices; (c) research on service provider perceptions of these co-occurring problems; (d) evaluation of services; and (e) evaluation of trainings. Accordingly, we organized the reviewed documents into these five categories. We also organized <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1524838012455874">Table 1</xref> to present key findings and recommendations of each document by these five categories. Detailed information about each reviewed document is presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1524838012455874">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<p>Two documents explored information or recommendations regarding service collaboration based on expert opinion and literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1524838012455874">Fazzone, Holton, &amp; Reed, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1524838012455874">Zubretsky, 2002</xref>). One document provided recommendations based on a brief literature overview and the author’s practice wisdom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1524838012455874">Zubretsky, 2002</xref>). The second document’s recommendations were based on an extensive literature review as well as the joint efforts of a committee composed of both domestic violence service and substance abuse treatment experts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1524838012455874">Fazzone et al., 1997</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section8-1524838012455874">
<title>Key findings and recommendations</title>
<p>One strategy recommended for collaborative efforts between domestic violence and substance abuse treatment services involves a model of coordinated services. The main components of this model entail cross-training of providers, cross-screening of clients, and cross-referral of clients with co-occurring IPV and substance abuse problems. Case management and collaborative treatment planning to coordinate services across agencies are also critically important strategies in this model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1524838012455874">Fazzone et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1524838012455874">Zubretsky, 2002</xref>). Additional key strategies to implement this model include: (a) a shift from “sobriety first” service philosophy to a “safety first” philosophy; (b) an emphasis on effective working relationships between service systems; (c) an acknowledgment of existing differences between programs; (d) a consideration of community-specific resources, needs, and culture; and (e) an emphasis on open, honest communication between collaborating service agencies. In particular, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1524838012455874">Zubretsky (2002)</xref> recommended coordinated services as a promising model for collaboration given the constraints of current political and systemic service frameworks. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1524838012455874">Zubretsky (2002)</xref> also posited that the effectiveness of the coordinated services model would be enhanced if domestic violence service agencies coordinated with substance abuse agencies using gender-specific treatment methods (rather than traditional substance abuse treatment approaches) given the congruency in service philosophy between gender-specific treatment and the empowerment-based interventions used in domestic violence services.</p>
<p>A second recommended service model, the integrated service model, stands in contrast to the coordinated service model. The integrated service model described by both Fazzone et al. (1997) and Zubretsky (2002) requires top-down reform, including structural- and administrative-level changes. For services to become integrated, collaborating agencies must address issues of separate funding streams and service delivery mechanisms. The integrated service model is also described as a “one-stop” center that coordinates with mental health, social services, and criminal justice service systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1524838012455874">Fazzone et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1524838012455874">Zubretsky, 2002</xref>). This model also promotes policies to facilitate blended services, such as requiring IPV training and knowledge as part of the licensing and credentialing of substance abuse treatment providers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1524838012455874">Fazzone et al., 1997</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section10-1524838012455874" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>Five documents assessed collaborative efforts between domestic violence service and substance abuse treatment agencies by surveying providers. One document included a literature review and qualitative interviews (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1524838012455874">Collins, Kroutil, Roland, &amp; Moore-Gurrera, 1997</xref>), whereas another used surveys (Collins &amp; Spencer, 1991). Three documents used both survey methods and qualitative interviews (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1524838012455874">Barron, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1524838012455874">Bennett &amp; Lawson, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1524838012455874">Humphreys, Thiara, &amp; Regan 2005</xref>). Two documents reported on studies that collected data from clients; both of these studies were based in the United Kingdom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1524838012455874">Barron, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1524838012455874">Humphreys, Thiara et al., 2005</xref>). All five documents collected some information from agency staff, directors, or both. Qualitative sample sizes ranged from 23 to 48 participants. Quantitative sample sizes ranged from 310 to 968, and included one nationwide sample (Collins &amp; Spencer, 1991). Several documents lacked information on study methods, which limited our ability to assess methodological rigor. Additional limitations included low response rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1524838012455874">Barron, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1524838012455874">Bennett &amp; Lawson, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1524838012455874">Humphreys, Thiara et al., 2005</xref>) and limited information regarding survey measures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1524838012455874">Barron, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1524838012455874">Bennett &amp; Lawson, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1524838012455874">Humphreys, Thiara et al., 2005</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section11-1524838012455874">
<title>Key findings</title>
<p>Two studies highlighted the shortage of connections between domestic violence and substance abuse treatment services, including infrequent collaboration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1524838012455874">Collins et al., 1997</xref>) and few cross-agency referrals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1524838012455874">Humphreys, Thiara et al., 2005</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1524838012455874">Collins and Spencer (1999)</xref> determined that programs with shelter and residential programs were more likely to have collaborative agreements. All five documents had findings showing that screening for IPV and substance abuse problems was occurring among participating agencies. However, the rates of and protocols used for these dual screenings varied.</p>
<p>The documents demonstrated consensus regarding the lack of shelter for women with co-occurring IPV and substance abuse problems. Findings confirmed that shelter admission is typically refused to women with substance abuse problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1524838012455874">Collins et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1524838012455874">Humphreys, Thiara, et al., 2005</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1524838012455874">Barron (2004)</xref> determined that shelters typically refuse to shelter women with co-occurring problems because of concerns about the severity of women’s needs, concerns that the agency would be unable to provide sufficient support to women with co-occurring problems, and concerns about how the woman’s substance problems might affect other shelter residents.</p>

<title>Research on Perceptions’ of Service Provider</title>
<sec id="section13-1524838012455874" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>Three documents explored the attitudes and responses of agency staff and practitioners that might influence the collaboration between domestic violence and substance abuse services. Two documents reflected findings from qualitative interviews, with one reporting findings from a sample of four providers (Chartas &amp; Culbreth, 2001) and the other reporting on a sample of 41 providers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1524838012455874">Kunins, Gilbert, Whyte-Etere, Meissner, &amp; Zachary, 2007</xref>). One document described findings from a survey questionnaire of 415 professionals from the fields of domestic violence, sexual assault, mental health, and substance abuse treatment services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1524838012455874">Herz, Stroshine, &amp; Houser, 2005</xref>). The three documents posed difficulty in assessing the qualitative rigor of the studies because of the scant information provided on study methods. Two groups of authors noted possible sample bias as a potential limitation of their studies (Chartas &amp; Culbreth, 2001; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1524838012455874">Kunins et al., 2007</xref>), in that participating individuals may have represented more supportive views toward service collaboration.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1524838012455874">
<title>Key findings and recommendations</title>
<p>Together the findings from the three documents highlighted varied levels of training, knowledge, and skills among substance abuse treatment providers regarding IPV. According to Herz and colleagues (2005), substance abuse treatment providers had the least amount of training regarding IPV and sexual assault as compared with victim advocates, mental health treatment providers, and providers whose professional backgrounds cross disciplines. Kunins and colleagues (2007) found most substance abuse treatment providers in their sample had basic IPV training. Studies also showed that substance abuse treatment providers typically had difficulty addressing clients’ IPV disclosures. The reasons for such difficulties included a lack of knowledge about how to appropriately intervene with IPV, as well as a lack of organizational support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1524838012455874">Kunins et al., 2007</xref>).</p>

<title>Evaluation of Services</title>
<p>Two documents reported on findings regarding a statewide evaluation of domestic violence and substance abuse treatment service coordination and integration in Illinois. These documents were included in this review because one document reported outcome findings from clients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1524838012455874">Bennett &amp; O’Brien, 2007</xref>) and the other reported findings based on staff interviews (Illinois Department of Health and Human Services [DHHS], 2003).</p>
<sec id="section16-1524838012455874" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>The program evaluation used a mixed-methods approach, including surveys to collect client data, focus groups with clients, and individual interviews with staff members. Evaluation strengths included: (a) use of valid and reliable measures; (b) use of a varied statewide sample; (c) use of in-depth sample demographics of clients; and (d) use of a clear rationale for procedures, methods, and analyses. Limitations included: (a) the lack of comparison group; (b) the low rate of follow-up participants; and (c) the lack of information regarding qualitative study methods and findings (e.g., interview structure, data analysis, and lack of staff sample demographics). In addition, findings for integrated and coordinated services were summarized rather than separated or compared (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1524838012455874">Bennett &amp; O’Brien, 2007</xref>; Illinois DHHS, 2003).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-1524838012455874">
<title>Key findings and recommendations</title>
<p>After receiving either coordinated or integrated services, women showed significant improvements in their self-reported drug and alcohol use, as well as their self-efficacy and ability to manage abuse-related difficulties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1524838012455874">Bennett &amp; O’Brien, 2007</xref>). One unanticipated finding was that at follow-up to receiving services women reported both increased IPV vulnerability and IPV experiences relative to baseline reports. The authors provided three possible explanations for this finding: (a) newfound sobriety increased awareness of IPV risks and experiences; (b) IPV perpetration increased in response to women’s sobriety; or (c) an unexpected and unknown factor created a relationship between survivors’ increased self-efficacy with their sobriety and IPV victimization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1524838012455874">Bennett &amp; O’Brien, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Providers reported overall satisfaction with their involvement in the novel service delivery approaches and the pilot program (Illinois DHHS, 2003). Based on service provider feedback, critically important components of the pilot program were: (a) ongoing IPV and substance abuse screening by providers rather than an initial, one-time screening to elicit information from clients about these co-occurring problems; (b) providing early intervention and education with clients about the basics of IPV and substance abuse; (c) co-locating staff from both domestic violence and substance abuse treatment agencies to facilitate service access for clients, increase staff buy-in, and foster staff relationships; (d) offering both individual and group-based services to clients; (e) using case management as a central strategy for collaboration; and (f) implementing case consultation across agencies and staff members. Staff members emphasized the importance of having a shared and unified mission, dedicated resources, and motivated and open-minded advocates to promote service collaboration. Findings also showed that collaborations were more effective when substance abuse treatment agencies used gender-specific treatment models rather than traditional treatment models (Illinois DHHS, 2003).</p>

<title>Evaluation of Training</title>
<sec id="section19-1524838012455874" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>Three documents summarized the development, implementation, and evaluation of training programs intended to enhance the capacity for collaboration between domestic violence and substance abuse treatment service providers. Two documents described the use of mixed methods in evaluating a specified training program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1524838012455874">Greater London Alcohol and Drug Alliance [GLADA], 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1524838012455874">Hartman, Fitzerald, &amp; Arndt, 2003</xref>). The other document described: (a) an integrated training curriculum developed by a committee; (b) a process evaluation of the curriculum; and (c) a training development and implementation of the curriculum at two sites in Washington State (Washington State Coalition on Women’s Substance Abuse Issues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1524838012455874">WSCWSAI], 1995</xref>). Sample sizes for the quantitative aspects of these studies ranged from 32 to 704 participants. Qualitative sample sizes were smaller, ranging from 7 to 21 participants. The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1524838012455874">GLADA (2006)</xref> evaluation primarily used survey data to assess satisfaction with trainings. Another training evaluation study described scale development and reliability for its survey methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1524838012455874">Hartman et al., 2003</xref>). However, the Hartman et al. study was limited by having only a small number of respondents and the use of different measures at baseline and posttraining evaluation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-1524838012455874">
<title>Key findings and recommendations</title>
<p>Overall, trainings were met with a relatively high degree of provider enthusiasm, and the evaluations demonstrated high satisfaction among training participants (GLADA, 2006; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1524838012455874">Hartman et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1524838012455874">WSCWSAI, 1995</xref>). Perceived benefits of trainings included individual participant gains, such as: (a) developing positive relationships with staff from other service sectors; (b) increasing awareness and understanding of the co-occurrence of IPV and substance abuse; and (c) enhancing capacity for addressing co-occurring IPV and substance abuse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1524838012455874">GLADA, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1524838012455874">Hartman et al., 2003</xref>). The documents showed that trainings played an important role in building organizational capacity and initiating coordination activities. Findings suggested that trainings led to the development of cross-agency referral systems, routine screening procedures and policies, the development of formal service linkage agreements, more effective working partnerships, and creation of specific committees or coalitions to enhance services for women with co-occurring IPV and substance abuse problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1524838012455874">GLADA, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1524838012455874">WSCWSAI, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>These articles also highlighted the multiple demands, limited resources, and challenges that arise for domestic violence services and substance abuse treatment agencies when they seek to collaborate. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1524838012455874">Hartman and colleagues (2003)</xref> found that service provider staff reported little understanding of the extent of time needed to develop and participate in trainings on co-occurring IPV and substance abuse. In addition, the articles highlighted controversial service issues, including mandatory treatment; confidentiality; assessment practices; concurrence of treatment, risk, and re-victimization; and substance abuse treatment options for victims’ family members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1524838012455874">Hartman et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1524838012455874">WSCWSAI, 1995</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Given the significant relationship between IPV victimization and substance abuse, service providers in both service settings are regularly encountering women with these co-occurring problems. A recommended best practice for both domestic violence services and substance abuse treatment services promotes collaborations between these two service sectors. The aim of this review was to assemble documents that offered information regarding collaboration between domestic violence and substance abuse services to help women affected by both issues. As readers consider these review findings, we encourage them to be mindful of the study’s limitations. Although we identified all relevant documents by using several wide-ranging search strategies and selected documents for review based on clearly defined inclusion criteria, we may have overlooked relevant documents. In addition, it is possible that we missed or misunderstood information in the reviewed documents. However, we sought to address this limitation by reviewing each of the 15 documents carefully and completely with a standardized review form.</p>
<sec id="section22-1524838012455874">
<title>Document Types and Methods</title>
<p>Our first research question was concerned with what types of documents had been developed regarding collaborations between domestic violence and substance abuse services. Specifically, our review determined five document types: (a) literature review and expert opinion; (b) surveys of current service delivery practices; (c) research on service provider perceptions of these co-occurring problems; (d) evaluation of services; and (e) evaluation of trainings. Second, we were concerned with what specific methods were used to develop each document type. The review showed that authors developed a variety of documents with different foci and using multiple methods. In addition to literature reviews, the reviewed documents included both qualitative and quantitative research methods. The primary qualitative methods used were in-depth interviews or focus groups with service providers or clients. Quantitative methods were mainly the administration of surveys to agency directors, service providers, and clients.</p>
<p>We note here that 7 of the 13 documents reporting research studies used a mixed-method design. Our finding that many of these documents report on mixed-methods research seems reasonable given the complexity of determining effective collaborative strategies for domestic violence and substance abuse treatment services. Effective interagency collaborations appear to require multidimensional strategies at various levels, including the provider, director, agency, and policy levels. Empirically based recommendations to promote such complex collaborative strategies are likely best determined through multiple types of research and methods. Thus, we find the use of mixed-method research strategies to be an overall strength of this literature.</p>
<p>Despite this noteworthy strength, this literature also has significant methodological limitations. Overall, the reviewed literature lacked rigor due to: (a) the low rates of response and participation; (b) the use of measures that have not been assessed for validity or reliability; (c) the potential for sample bias; and (d) the lack of comparison groups in research designs.</p>
<p>Further, with the notable exception of two documents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1524838012455874">Bennett &amp; O’Brien, 2007</xref>; Illinois DHHS, 2003), little attention has been paid to the investigation of service outcomes in the evaluation of domestic violence and substance abuse service collaborations. Moreover, a majority of the reviewed documents provided limited information about key aspects of their research methods. Thus, it is possible that some of the studies were conducted with less or more rigor than could be ascertained from a careful review of each document.</p>

<title>Key Strategies and Recommendations for Collaboration</title>
<p>Despite these limitations, the review findings determined several key strategies and recommendations regarding promoting successful collaborations between domestic violence and substance abuse treatment services; the third research question for this literature review. The review findings showed recommendations for different levels of the service system, including the provider, agency, and policy levels.</p>
<sec id="section24-1524838012455874">
<title>Provider</title>
<p>Recommendations for the treatment provider level included training in the co-occurrence of IPV and substance abuse. Universally, the reviewed documents recommended that providers in both services sectors should screen and assess clients for IPV and substance abuse. The reviewed documents also universally recommended that providers should be prepared to offer referral information regarding services for co-occurring problems.</p>

<p>To promote collaborative relationships, several documents suggested that agency should implement: (a) dedicated case management services at both agency types to facilitate service referral and coordination; (b) interagency case consultation to coordinate services and treatment planning for women using the services of both agencies; (c) colocation of providers from collaborating agencies’ offices to promote service accessibility for women and foster interagency staff relationships; (d) assigning one staff member to act as an interagency liaison to facilitate collaborative efforts; and (e) the development of positive, productive working relationships at all agency levels, including among the agencies’ board members, directors, and staff service providers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1524838012455874">Bennett &amp; Lawson, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1524838012455874">Collins et al. 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1524838012455874">Fazzone et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1524838012455874">Hartman et al., 2003</xref>; Illinois DHHS, 2003).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section26-1524838012455874">
<title>Policy</title>
<p>Several documents also recommended changes in state-level policies to promote collaboration among agencies at the community level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1524838012455874">Bennett &amp; O’Brien, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1524838012455874">GLADA, 2006</xref>; Illinois DHHS, 2003; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1524838012455874">WSCWSAI, 1995</xref>). One such recommendation proposed policy to require training and continuing education in the co-occurrence of IPV and substance abuse for professional credentialing and licensing. Another policy recommendation was attention to funding community-based services in a way that promotes interagency collaboration.</p>
<p>Notably, the review findings showed that it would be easiest for domestic violence service agencies to develop collaborative relationships with substance abuse treatment agencies that use gender-specific treatment approaches rather than agencies that use traditional substance abuse treatment approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1524838012455874">Barron, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1524838012455874">Zubretsky, 2002</xref>). Gender-specific treatment approaches build from the research showing that women have markedly different experiences relative to men in their initiation into substance use, their pathways to addiction, as well as markedly different substance abuse recovery needs (SAMHSA, 2011). To account for such differences, gender-specific treatments emphasize as examples: (a) an emphasis on empathy and respect for women in treatment; (b) treatment attention to the trauma and violence that women may have experienced in their lives; (c) treatment considerations of women’s family and intimate relationships; and (d) attention to the needs of women’s children in the context of treatment (SAMHSA, 2011). Such considerations are consistent with the empowerment philosophy on which domestic violence services are based and that emphasize: (a) service collaboration with women; (b) women’s strengths and resources; and (c) building women’s self-efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1524838012455874">Black, 2003</xref>; Busch &amp; Valentine, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1524838012455874">2000</xref>). Accordingly, another policy recommendation is the promotion and promulgation of gender-specific substance abuse treatment approaches. Information on core competencies for gender-specific substance abuse treatment approaches is available from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1524838012455874">SAMHSA (2011)</xref>. Notably, the trauma-informed substance abuse service framework described in the introduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1524838012455874">Covington, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1524838012455874">Elliott et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1524838012455874">Fallot &amp; Harris, 2002</xref>) could be considered consistent with gender-specific treatment approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1524838012455874">SAMHSA, 2011</xref>).</p>

<title>Collaboration challenges</title>
<p>Although not an aim specified at the outset of this research, this literature review also determined that considerable challenges exist to promote collaborative relationships between domestic violence and substance abuse treatment service sectors. The challenges noted most frequently in this review included: (a) a lack of sufficient, high-quality training among providers in both service sectors; (b) a difference in service and treatment philosophies between service sectors; (c) limited financial resources; and (d) fragmented governmental, legal, and policy systems. Importantly, some recommendations described above could help address these frequently cited challenges. The recommendations regarding training could help address providers’ need for high-quality training. The recommendation to promote gender-specific substance abuse treatment practices may address differences in service and treatment philosophies. In addition, attention to complementing and coordinating state-level funding streams for domestic violence services and substance abuse treatment services could help address the fragmented policy system.</p>
<p>However, this review also determined significant challenges to service coordination that were not answered by the literature’s recommendations. Examples of such challenges include</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>attending to the needs of women’s children in both domestic violence and substance abuse treatment services; providing interagency collaboration in the context of federal confidentiality policies regarding the provision of domestic violence service (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1524838012455874">Field &amp; National Network to End Domestic Violence, 2008</xref>) and substance abuse treatment services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1524838012455874">SAMHSA, 2004</xref>);</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>finding the considerable time and effort that interagency collaboration requires on the part of providers and agency directors; addressing high rates of staff turnover at both domestic violence service and substance abuse treatment agencies that leads to the need for retraining and undermines the stability of collaborative interagency relationships;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>overcoming the oppressive stigma that women struggling with both IPV and substance abuse face from others (e.g., family, friends, communities); and working with child protection services when issues of child maltreatment are present for women with these co-occurring problems.</p>
</list-item>

<sec id="section28-1524838012455874">
<title>Unanswered questions</title>
<p>The review also raised important questions but without offering clear answers. First, the review findings underscored the challenge of proving domestic violence shelter services for women with substance abuse problems without providing specific suggestions for ways in which shelter services could accommodate women with co-occurring problems. Second, the review identified two primary approaches to collaboration, the coordinated approach and the integrated approach, without providing clear evidence about the advantages or disadvantages of either. Thus, it remains unclear as to which model agencies should implement or whether agencies should seek another alternative. Third, two of the reviewed documents raised questions about potential unintended consequences of women’s substance abuse recovery, including the possibility of exacerbating women’s IPV victimization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1524838012455874">Bennett &amp; O’Brien, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1524838012455874">Herz et al., 2005</xref>). Fourth, three of the reviewed articles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1524838012455874">Barron, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1524838012455874">GLADA, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1524838012455874">Humphreys, Thiara et al., 2005</xref>) were concerned with domestic violence services and substance abuse treatment in the United Kingdom, while the other documents were concerned with treatment and services in the United States. Given the small number of documents concerned with the United Kingdom, we decided an investigation of differences in recommend practices based on country of origin would not likely be meaningful. Nonetheless, national differences in culture, policy, and social norms are likely relevant for understanding collaborations between domestic violence and substance abuse services. Thus, we urge future research to investigate national context, as well as the other three critically important questions described above.</p>
<p>Though the findings strongly point to the potential benefit of gender-specific substance abuse treatment practices generally, we note that the reviewed documents did not typically specify what types of domestic violence safety interventions, as well as what types of substance abuse treatments might be most beneficial for women with these co-occurring problems. This review was concerned with collaborations between domestic violence and substance abuse services. Thus, it is not surprising that the reviewed documents did not necessarily detail the service and treatment approaches used in their studies. Nonetheless, the findings from this review provide little guidance regarding what specific types of domestic violence safety interventions (e.g., advocacy, individual counseling, support groups, shelter), as well as what specific types of substance abuse treatment (e.g., cognitive behavioral therapy, motivational interviewing, multidimensional family therapy, or general substance abuse counseling) women are most likely to find beneficial and helpful. Accordingly, we encourage future research efforts to consider the issues of service and treatment specificity.</p>
<p>Finally, we note that our review efforts determined only 15 documents, all published between 1992 and 2010, concerned with collaboration between domestic violence and substance abuse treatment services. Given both the high prevalence of lifetime IPV for women in the United States and the strong connections between IPV and substance abuse, we find this level of scholarly focus on the topic disappointing. Therefore, we commend the authors of the documents reviewed here. Collectively, these authors’ efforts have produced important recommendations that can serve as preliminary guidelines to help inform the development of collaborations between the domestic violence service and substance abuse treatment sectors.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, we hope for increased research attention to this important area of service delivery collaboration. A primary goal for this research was to synthesize all recommendations regarding the promotion of collaborations between domestic violence and substance abuse treatment services. However, the recommendations discussed here cannot be considered evidence-based without empirical testing that includes comparison groups and measurement of service outcomes. Accordingly, we urge domestic violence service providers, substance abuse treatment providers, and researchers concerned with co-occurring IPV and substance use issues to collaborate on testing the strategies and recommendations identified by this review. In addition, we call on federal research agencies to consider dedicated funding to develop evidence-based practices and policies to promote domestic violence and substance abuse treatment service collaborations. Moreover, we hope the findings from this review offer agency directors, funders, policy makers, service and treatment providers, as well as researchers, helpful information for developing and evaluating novel, collaborative service strategies for this vulnerable group of women.</p>
