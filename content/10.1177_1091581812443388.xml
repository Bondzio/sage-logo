<abstract>
<p>In this study, an in vivo toxicological safety assessment of<italic> Bacillus licheniformis</italic> Me1, a native isolate from milk, was performed. An acute toxicity study in male albino Wistar rats demonstrated no treatment-related illness or mortality. A 90-day subchronic oral toxicity study using 2 doses (1.1 × 10<sup>10</sup> and 1.1 × 10<sup>11</sup> colony-forming unit [CFU]/kg body weight [BW], respectively) failed to show dose-dependent illness or mortality. Moreover, neither significant differences in serum biochemical and hematological analyses nor histopathological changes in organs or tissues were found when compared to the control groups. The no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) was found to be greater than 1.1 × 10<sup>11</sup> CFU/kg BW. The in vivo micronucleus assay in mice did not reveal any signs of genotoxic effect at any of the doses tested. Furthermore, dermal and acute eye irritation tests conducted in rabbits showed no edema or erythema and ocular lesions. These results suggest that <italic>B licheniformis</italic> Me1 can be considered safe for food industry applications.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Probiotics are “beneficial live microorganisms which, when administered in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit to the host.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1091581812443388">1</xref>
</sup> Within the last decade, the supplementation of probiotics to various food products and as therapeutic agents against several infectious diseases has increased tremendously.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1091581812443388">2</xref>
</sup> The health benefits of probiotics include inhibition of gastrointestinal pathogens; aid in digestion and nutrient absorption; prevention of infectious diarrhea, irritable bowel syndrome, constipation, gas, or lactose intolerance; and contribution to immune function. Furthermore, other clinical investigations document further benefits such as lowering cholesterol levels, preventing dental caries, delaying of allergies in children, and treatment and prevention of vaginal and urinary infections in women.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1091581812443388">3</xref>
</sup> Probiotics can also serve as an alternative to commonly used therapeutic and prophylactic avenues for increasing incidence of antibiotic resistance and a growing prevalence of cancer and allergic conditions in an aging population.</p>
<p>The majority of the probiotics studied and commercialized are lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and bifidobacteria.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1091581812443388">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1091581812443388">5</xref>
</sup> In contrast, only very few species of the spore-forming <italic>Bacillus</italic> genus are used<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1091581812443388">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1091581812443388">6</xref>
</sup>; although, there are several advantages of spore-forming <italic>Bacillus</italic> spp over LAB as probiotics. The underlying rationale for this perception is that <italic>Bacillus</italic> can survive in food products requiring harsh processing conditions such as high temperature and pressure, they survive better under gastrointestinal tract (GIT) conditions, possess a long shelf life, and remain viable throughout the shelf life at room temperature and refrigerated conditions.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1091581812443388">7</xref>
</sup> Due to its better survivability, the effective dose required for <italic>Bacillus</italic> as probiotic supplements is less, as compared to LAB.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1091581812443388">8</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>
<italic>Bacillus</italic> spp which are commonly available for human and animal consumption as probiotics include <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>, <italic>B. licheniformis</italic>, <italic>B. clausii</italic>, <italic>B. coagulans</italic>, <italic>B. cereus</italic>, <italic>B. pumilus</italic>, and <italic>B. laterosporus</italic>.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1091581812443388">9</xref>
</sup> In humans, <italic>Bacillus</italic> probiotics are used as health food supplements, for prophylaxis of gastrointestinal disorders,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1091581812443388">10</xref>
</sup> and as therapeutic agents for treatment of urinary tract infections.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1091581812443388">11</xref> </sup>
<italic>B. subtilis</italic> and <italic>B. licheniformis</italic> are probiotic components of Biosporin, which is licensed as a medicine in Ukraine and Russia for the treatment of GI disorders.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1091581812443388">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1091581812443388">13</xref>
</sup> Recently, GanedenBC30 (<italic>B. coagulans</italic>) received its generally recognized as safe (GRAS) status by an independent scientific panel.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1091581812443388">14</xref>
</sup> Presently, it is marketed in various food products and claims to have several health benefits.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1091581812443388">8</xref>
</sup> In animals, probiotics are being used as growth-promoting and prophylactic agents (eg, Toyerocin<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1091581812443388">15</xref>
</sup>) after antibiotic growth supplements were banned by the European Union (EU) in 2006.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1091581812443388">7</xref>
</sup> <italic>Bacillus</italic> probiotics are also broadly used in aquaculture, particularly in shellfish, to enhance growth and resistance to disease.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1091581812443388">16</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Some of the <italic>Bacillus</italic> spp, such as <italic>B. anthracis</italic>, <italic>B. cereus</italic>, <italic>B. thuringiensis</italic>, <italic>B. pseudomycoides</italic>, and<italic> B. weihenstephanesis</italic>, are known for their ability to produce toxins. <italic>B. cereus</italic> produces enterotoxins and emetic toxins and has been recognized as the major cause of food poisoning and other nongastrointestinal infections. However, not all strains of <italic>B. cereus </italic>are pathogenic and their pathogenicity varies with strains.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1091581812443388">17</xref>
</sup> In addition, <italic>B. thuriengiensis</italic>, commonly used as a biopesticide, produces enterotoxins and causes gastroenteritis.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1091581812443388">18</xref>
</sup> The <italic>B. subtilis</italic> group (including <italic>B. subtilis</italic>, <italic>B. licheniformis</italic>, <italic>B. pumilus</italic>, and<italic> B. amyloliquefaciens</italic>) is considered relatively safe but is also reported to be involved in food borne illness.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1091581812443388">19</xref>

</sup> Overall, the involvement of strains of the <italic>B. subtilis</italic> group has been considered of little significance in food poisoning incidents. Another concern about the application of <italic>Bacillus</italic> in food products is that certain strains of <italic>Bacillus</italic> can cause opportunistic infections. Oggioni et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1091581812443388">23</xref></sup> reported <italic>B. subtilis</italic>, used for probiotic preparations, caused septicemia in immunocompromised patients. The probability for the presence of transmissible antibiotic resistance genes in the probiotic candidates should also be considered in any probiotic applications. A recent report proved the presence of macrocide-resistant <italic>erm</italic> gene in a probiotic <italic>B. claussi</italic> strain.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1091581812443388">24</xref>
</sup> Therefore, the use of these spore-forming bacteria as dietary supplements, functional foods, and for incorporation in pharmaceutical products requires careful safety assessment using suitable models.</p>
<p>Only limited information is available about the in vivo as well as in vitro safety evaluation of <italic>Bacillus</italic> spp, viz, <italic>B. subtilis</italic>, <italic>B. coagulans</italic>, <italic>B. indicus</italic>, and <italic>B. licheniformis</italic>, and these cultures are described to be safe for use without having any adverse effects.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1091581812443388">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1091581812443388">25</xref>

</sup> Several health benefits of <italic>Bacillus</italic>, in addition to inherent resistance of its spores to environmental stress, emphasize the scope of exploring various <italic>Bacillus</italic> spp with respect to its use as commercial probiotics. Thus, in the present study, we have evaluated the safety of the bacterial culture, <italic>B. licheniformis</italic> Me1, a native isolate from milk, for its potential applications in food industry as a probiotic supplement.</p>

<title>Preparation of Test Article and Diet</title>
<p>The culture <italic>B. licheniformis</italic> Me1 isolated from milk was used as the test article in this study. This culture was initially screened based on its potent antibacterial activity and subsequently identified using several biochemical and molecular techniques. (Nithya and Halami, unpublished data). The test article was cultivated in Luria Bertani (LB) broth for 36 hours at 37°C under shaking (150 rpm) condition. Subsequently, cells were harvested by centrifugation. The test article was prepared at a concentration of 1.1 × 10<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1091581812443388">11</xref>
</sup> colony-forming unit (CFU)/g of cell pellet for experimental feed preparation. The diet was prepared according to Reeves et al.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1091581812443388">28</xref>
</sup> For acute and subchronic toxicity studies, AIN93M and AIN93G diets were used, respectively. For the subchronic study, diet was prepared once every 2 days with the test article. According to the body weight (BW) changes in the rat and feed intake changes, adjustments for the addition of test article in the diet were made. The experimental diet was stored at 4°C to ensure viability.</p>

<sec id="section5-1091581812443388">
<title>Experimental Rats</title>
<p>Animal care and handling conformed to the guidelines of the Committee for the purpose of control and supervision of experiments on animals (CPCSEA), Government of India, and the protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Ethical Committee (IAEC). The albino Wistar rats bred in the Central Food Technological Research Institute (CFTRI) animal house facility were housed in stainless steel cages (1 rat/cage) with a 12-hour light/dark cycle in a controlled atmosphere viz temperature 22°C ± 3°C and a relative humidity of 60% to 70%. The animals were fed ad libitum and had free access to drinking water during the experimental period. The drinking water was periodically analyzed and was determined to be free of contaminants. The animals were acclimatized to above experimental conditions for 5 days prior to the start of dosing for any toxicity study.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1091581812443388">
<title>Acute Toxicity Study</title>
<p>An acute toxicity study was performed in accordance with Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Guideline for the Testing of Chemicals No. 423; Acute Oral Toxicity—Acute Toxic Class Method, adopted December 17, 2001. Twelve healthy adult male albino Wistar rats (220 ± 10 g) were randomly assigned into 2 groups (6 per group), namely the control group which received the vehicle alone and the probiotic-treated group which received test article of 1000 mg/kg BW of rat, as a single dose. This dose level corresponds to 1.1 × 10<sup>11</sup> CFU/kg BW of rat and was selected based on previous references that have evaluated the in vivo safety of probiotic bacteria.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1091581812443388">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1091581812443388">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1091581812443388">29</xref>
</sup> No female rats were used for acute toxicity study. Following the initial dose, the animals were observed with respect to general behavior, signs of toxicity, and mortality for 4 continuous hours and then twice per day over a period of 14 consecutive days. The general behavior, signs of toxicity include changes in the skin and fur, eyes and mucous membranes, and also respiratory, circulatory, digestive, autonomic, and central nervous systems. Observations were also made on behavior patterns, such as tremors, convulsions, salivation, stool consistency, lethargy, sleep and changes in gait, posture, and response to handling. Daily feed and water intake was recorded throughout the experimental period and the BW of the rats were documented on days 0, 4, 7, 10, and 14. On the 15th day of the experiment, following an overnight fast, the animals were weighed and sacrificed with ether anesthesia. The blood samples were collected in sterile conditions by cardiac puncture in ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA-2K) containing tubes for hematological analysis and in nonanticoagulant tubes for serum biochemical investigations. The vital organs were weighed and relative organ weights (g/100 g BW) were calculated. A gross pathological organ examination was performed. Histopatholological analysis (if necessary) was done for any treatment-related abnormalities.</p>

<sec id="section7-1091581812443388">
<title>Subchronic Toxicity Study</title>
<p>Male and female albino Wistar rats bred in the CFTRI animal house facility were selected and randomly split into 3 groups, each comprising 6 males and 6 females, weighing 36 ± 1 g. The first group was kept as control and fed only the basal diet. Experimental diet consisting of basal diet supplemented with test article at 2 dose levels 100 and 1000 mg/kg BW/d (which corresponds to 1.1 × 10<sup>10</sup> and 1.1 × 10<sup>11</sup> CFU) was fed to groups 2 and 3, respectively, for 13 weeks. Test diet and uncontaminated water were available ad libitum throughout the experimental period. At the end of the experiment, all surviving animals were fasted overnight before anesthetization with diethyl ether and sacrificed. The results were analyzed according to the OECD Guideline for the Testing of Chemicals No. 408; Repeated Dose 90-Day Oral Toxicity Study in Rodents, adopted September 21, 1998.</p>
<sec id="section8-1091581812443388">
<title>Feed and water intake, clinical observations, and BW</title>
<p>The feed intake was recorded daily and from this, the mean daily feed intake for each week was calculated. The water intake by the rats was also noted. All the animals were examined for general behavior, signs of toxicity, and mortality, twice daily, as in the case of acute toxicity study. Body weights were measured at the initiation of the experiment and then at weekly intervals. Before sacrifice, the final BW of the rats was also recorded following overnight fasting.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1091581812443388">
<title>Viability of B licheniformis Me1</title>
<p>Fresh fecal samples were collected from each test group along with the control group on randomly selected days (10, 30, 50, and 80). This was done to confirm that the administered test article survived the stress within the GIT. The feces samples were homogenized in normal saline (0.85% NaCl) and serially diluted. The diluted homogenates (0.1 mL) were spread plated on LB agar plates for the enumeration of <italic>B. licheniformis </italic>Me1. After incubation at 37°C for 24 hours, the numbers of colonies were counted based on the colony appearance and recorded accordingly. A control group of untreated mice was also analyzed.</p>

<sec id="section10-1091581812443388">
<title>Hematology and biochemical studies</title>
<p>At the end of the experiment, all the surviving animals were fasted overnight before anesthetization and necropsy. Blood samples were collected in 2 centrifuge tubes: one pre-filled with EDTA-2K as an anticoagulant and other without any supplement. The hematological parameters determined with an automated hematology analyzer, K-4500 (Sysmex Corp, Japan), included white blood cells (WBCs), red blood cells (RBCs), hemoglobin (HGB), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), MCH concentration (MCHC), platelet count (PLT), and differential leukocyte count. For measuring the differential leukocyte count, blood samples were mixed with 1/4 volume of 5.0% EDTA-2K and analyzed with a Microx HEG-120A (Omron Tateishi Electronics Co, Ltd, Tokyo, Japan). The non-EDTA-2K-treated blood samples were used for a biochemical examination of the serum. These samples were used to determine the levels of glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol, urea, creatinine, and for the activity of ALP, SGPT, SGOT, and LDH by using standard kits. Blood biochemistry determinations were performed manually with a spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Japan).</p>

<sec id="section11-1091581812443388">
<title>Relative organ weights and histopathological analysis</title>
<p>Gross observations were made at necropsy and recorded. Before further histopathological examinations, the organ weights of liver, lungs, kidneys, heart, spleen, testis/ovary, epididymis/uterus, brain, and adrenals were weighed. The relative organ weights were calculated based on the final BW of the rats. At necropsy the vital organs were surgically removed from the rats, washed with normal saline, fixed, and preserved in 10% neutral phosphate-buffered formalin. Collected tissues were grossly and microscopically examined during histopathological examination according to OECD guidelines. All the major tissues were further processed and trimmed, embedded in paraffin, sectioned to a thickness of 4 µm and stained with hematoxylin and eosin,<sup>

<title>Micronucleus Assay in Mice</title>
<p>Adult male and female mice (Swiss Albino, <italic>Mus musculas</italic>, CFT strain) weighing 36 ± 2 g were obtained from our animal house facility. The study was conducted according to OECD Guideline for the Testing of Chemicals No. 474; Mammalian micronucleus test, Adopted July 21, 1997. Mice of each gender were randomly assigned into 4 groups and housed (5 animals in a single cage). The environmental condition in the experimental room was maintained viz temperature 22°C ± 3°C, relative humidity 60% to 70%, at a 12-hour light/dark cycle. The animals had free access to the standard diet<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1091581812443388">31</xref>
</sup> and water, which were available ad libitum. Animals were acclimatized to the experimental conditions for 5 days before the start of the study. The animals were weighed and observed for signs of illness or other abnormalities at the start of the study. Ethane methane sulfonate (EMS; 5 μg/mL) and water were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. The test article, <italic>B licheniformis</italic> Me1 was administrated to 2 different mice groups at concentrations, namely, 1.1 × 10<sup>10</sup> CFU/kg BW and 1.1 × 10<sup>11</sup> CFU/kg BW of mice, using water as a vehicle. The test article was given by oral route for 2 consecutive days at 24-hour interval. The positive and negative controls were given to the control groups mice only once by intraperitoneal injection on the last test article administration day. Thirty-six hours after the last day of the test article administration, blood samples from the mice were collected by tail trimming. Peripheral blood samples were smeared on acridine orange coded slides and observed under a fluorescent microscope. A minimum of 2000 reticulocytes were scored for the presence of micronuclei. The proportion of immature erythrocytes among total erythrocytes was determined for each test group and compared with control.</p>

<title>Acute Eye Irritation Study in Rabbits</title>
<p>Male albino rabbits weighing 2500 ± 250 g from our animal house facility were used for the study. Animals were housed individually in metal cages at 20°C ± 3°C, relative humidity of 40% to 70% and at a 12-h light/dark cycle. Animals were fed ad libitum with conventional laboratory diet. Tap water was routinely analyzed for contaminants and was also available ad libitum. Three healthy male albino rabbits were used for acute eye irritation study. Both eyes of the animals were examined 24 hours prior to the start of the study. Only animals not showing any ocular defects or preexisting corneal injury were used in the experiment. The dosage of test article (0.1 g of the undiluted <italic>B. licheniformis</italic> Me1 cell mass at a concentration of 1.1 × 10<sup>11</sup> CFU/g) was placed into the conjunctival sac of the left eye of each rabbit. The untreated right eye served as the control. Eyes were not washed after the application. Eyes were examined for any lesions at 1, 24, 48, and 72 hours after the test article application. Any clinical signs of toxicity or signs of ill health of the animals were recorded during the study. At the end of the experiment, the weight of animals was determined. The study was performed in accordance with the OECD Guidelines for Testing of Chemicals No. 405; Acute Eye Irritation/Corrosion, adopted April 24, 2002. Eye irritation scores were evaluated according to the Draize (1977) and the OECD 405 (April 24, 2002) scoring systems.</p>

<title>Acute Skin Irritation Study in Rabbits</title>
<p>The conditions for housing, feeding, and drinking of the rabbits were the same as described above. For the acute skin irritation experiment, 3 male albino rabbits were used. The fur was removed from a small area of the animal’s trunk, approximately 24 hours before the test. An undiluted dose of 0.5 g of the test article (corresponding to a concentration of 1.1 × 10<sup>13</sup> CFU/g) was moistened sufficiently with water to ensure good contact with the skin and applied to a small skin area (approximately 6 cm<sup>2</sup>) of 3 animals and covered with sterile gauze patches, held in place with nonirritating tape. Untreated skin areas of each animal served as the control. After 4 hours of exposure, the test article was removed from the animal’s skin by washing with water. Animals were examined for erythema and edema at 1, 24, 48, and 72 hours after the removal of the test article. The test article was evaluated according to the Draize (1959) method (OECD 404, 2002) for any skin irritant effect. The study was performed in accordance with the OECD Guidelines for Testing of Chemicals No. 404; Acute dermal irritation/Corrosion, adopted April 24, 2002.</p>

<title>Acute Oral Toxicity Study</title>
<p>A 14-day oral acute toxicity study in adult male albino Wistar rats was performed to investigate the short-term effect of the test article, <italic>B. licheniformis</italic> Me1 administration. The results of this study provide useful preliminary toxicity data to determine appropriate dose levels for repeated-dose toxicity studies as well as for determining possible target organs to be examined, more closely in toxicity studies of a longer duration. No clinically related signs or any mortality were observed during the 14 consecutive days in the treated male rats. A single dose of 1.1 × 10<sup>11</sup> CFU/kg BW produced no treatment-related signs in behavior or changes in locomotor activity, respiratory, digestive, and circulatory or central nervous system, and autonomic activity. No abnormality was observed in skin, fur, and eyes and also no obvious signs of toxicity or any changes in other physiological activities immediately after administration or during the posttreatment period in any of the animals. Feed and water uptake were normal and there was no loss or gain in BW when compared to the control group. At necropsy, neither significant difference in the relative organ’s weight nor gross pathological alternations in the internal organs were found in all the treated and the control rats and hence, according to the OECD Guideline No. 423, histopathological examinations of organs were not carried out.</p>

<title>Micronucleus Assay in Mice</title>
<p>The micronucleus test was conducted to investigate the formation of micronuclei containing chromosome fragments or whole chromosomes and is considered the most reliable assay for cytogenetic damage. In the micronucleus assay, neither any differences in BW between the treatment groups compared to the control group nor any signs of toxicity were noted in clinical observations following administration of the test article at doses of 1.1 × 10<sup>11</sup> and 1.1 × 10<sup>10</sup> CFU/kg BW. The ratio of reticulocytes to total erythrocytes was used an indicator for the evaluation of bone marrow toxicity. The results clearly demonstrate that the number of immature erythrocytes in each dose did not significantly increase above the concurrent negative (water) control frequencies. Additionally, it was always within the historical negative control range. As expected, animals in the EMS-treated positive control group showed a significant increase in the frequency of micronuclei compared to the negative controls. In contrast, no statistically significant induction of micronuclei in the test article fed groups was observed. The ratio of reticulocytes to total erythrocytes in the treated groups did not show any significant decrease as compared to the negative control group. For female mice, the average reticulocyte to total erythrocyte ratio in the negative control group was 2.17%. Also, the treated groups 1.1 × 10<sup>11</sup> and 1.1 × 10<sup>10</sup> CFU/kg BW per day showed 2.07% and 1.93% of reticulocyte to total erythrocyte ratio, respectively, a reduction of 25.9% from the positive control group. In male mice, the negative control group showed a ratio of 1.85% and the 2 dose groups 1.1 × 10<sup>11</sup> and 1.1 × 10<sup>10</sup> CFU/kg BW/d exhibited 1.51% and 1.10% reticulocytes to erythrocytes ratio. In the male group, the positive control showed 27.12% decrease in the ratio. These results clearly show that Me1 did not cause any signs of bone marrow cytotoxicity of mice in the range of the doses tested.</p>
<p>In the negative control groups, the incidence of micronucleated reticulocytes in the peripheral blood per 1000 reticulocytes was 1.18 ± 0.5 in males and 0.98 ± 1.1 in females. These results were within the historical reference range.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1091581812443388">27</xref>
</sup> The positive control group had a statistically increased mean frequency of 26.14 ± 3 in males and 23.2 ± 5 in females as compared to the negative control group. The micronucleated reticulocytes per 1000 reticulocytes were found to be 1.03 ± 0.7 and 0.89 ± 1.2 in males and 1.2 ± 1 and 1.03 ± 0.9 in females at the test article dose levels of 1.1 × 10<sup>11</sup> and 1.1 × 10<sup>10</sup> CFU/kg BW per day, respectively.

</sup> makes it as a suitable and potential candidate for application in probiotic food products. <italic>B. licheniformis</italic> Me1 used in this study was a native isolate from milk. The isolate is gram-positive, catalase-positive, nonhemolytic and nonphospholytic, and able to hydrolyse starch, phytate, casein, and produce exopolysaccharides. The isolate was identified as <italic>B. licheniformis</italic> by 16S rDNA sequencing in combination with morphological, physiological, and biochemical characteristics and phylogenetic studies (Nithya and Halami, unpublished data). The gene sequence has been deposited at GenBank under the accession number HM564028 (http:/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Genbank). <italic>B. licheniformis</italic> Me1 produces an antibacterial peptide that can inhibit various food-borne pathogens, including both gram-positive (<italic>Bacillus cereus</italic> F4433, <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> FR1722, <italic>Listeria innocua</italic> FB21, <italic>L monocytogenes</italic> Scott A, <italic>L murrayi</italic> FB69, and <italic>Micrococcus luteus</italic> ATCC9341) and gram-negative bacteria (<italic>Salmonella paratyphi</italic> FB254, <italic>S typhimurium</italic> MTCC1254, <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> CFR02, and <italic>Yersinia enterocolitica</italic> MTCC859). Furthermore, our previous study revealed prominent probiotic properties of the culture, such as acid and bile tolerance, sensitiveness to antibiotics, antioxidant property, and ability to grow under anaerobic conditions, and so on <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1091581812443388">37</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>To assess the safety of <italic>B. licheniformis</italic> Me1 strain, an in vivo acute and subchronic toxicity study was conducted. Studies, including acute (single administration) toxicity and a repeated administration (subchronic) toxicity assessment have been recommended for assessing the safety of probiotics.<sup>

</sup> To study the acute toxicity, a limit test was conducted with a maximum dose level of 1.1 × 10<sup>11</sup> CFU/kg BW of rat. Since, no treatment-related mortality, morbidity, or clinical symptoms resulted in this acute oral toxicity study, <italic>B. licheniformis</italic> Me1 can be considered nontoxic per the OECD guidelines. The result indicated that the oral LD<sub>50</sub> for the test article was ≥1.1 × 10<sup>11</sup> CFU/kg BW.

<p>Organ weight changes have long been accepted as a sensitive indicator of chemically induced changes to organs. Therefore, in toxicological experiments, the comparison of organ weights between control and treated groups have conventionally been used to predict the toxic effect of a test article.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1091581812443388">39</xref>
</sup> The absence of significant changes in the vital organs of the treated groups during the subchronic oral toxicity study shows that the ingestion of <italic>B. licheniformis</italic> Me1 did not induce any anomalous lesions or inflammation of these organs. Similar observations were found by Sorokulova et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1091581812443388">35</xref></sup> in a safety assessment of probiotic biosporin, but the administration of <italic>B. coagulans</italic> resulted in difference in organ weight of liver, brain, and hemorrhages in the lungs.<sup>

</p>
<p>Hematological values were not significantly affected by the administration of <italic>B. licheniformis</italic> Me1 between the control and the treated groups for all the parameters analyzed. These findings suggest that the test article <italic>B. licheniformis</italic> Me1 may not be toxic as they do not significantly affect the circulating RBC nor the haematopoiesis or leucopoiesis. Furthermore, the normal metabolism of the treated animals was not affected by the test article fortification. Hong et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1091581812443388">6</xref></sup> showed similar findings in in vivo toxicity studies of <italic>B. subtilis</italic> and <italic>B. indicus</italic> conducted in rabbits.

</sup> Acute eye and skin irritation tests conducted in rabbits failed to show any signs of eye irritation and skin erythema or edema. A similar result for skin irritation test was reported on application of <italic>B. licheniformis </italic>NCTC13123; while in eye irritation study, a diffuse corneal opacification and evidence of conjunctivitis were observed.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1091581812443388">44</xref>
</sup> Endres et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1091581812443388">27</xref></sup> also reported a slight conjunctiva irritation and erythema on the treated skin surface within 1 hour of <italic>B. coagulans</italic> application. However, they reported the reaction was fully reversible later and thus, it can be assumed that these reactions might be due to the technical manipulation of administration.</p>
<p>The concentration of <italic>B. licheniformis </italic>Me1 (1.1 × 10<sup>11</sup> CFUs/kg BW of rat) used in this study corresponds to 77 × 10<sup>11</sup> CFUs for an average 70 kg human being. Thus, the concentration used can be considered 2566 to 77 000 times safe for human consumption, as the suggested human dose is in the range of 1 × 10<sup>8</sup> to 3 × 10<sup>9</sup> CFUs.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The test article <italic>B. licheniformis</italic> Me1 administered to rats at a dose of 1.1 × 10<sup>11</sup> CFU/kg BW did not show any sign of toxicity or mortality using in vivo oral acute and subchronic assessments. Hence, the NOAEL for both males and females is considered to be higher than 1.1 × 10<sup>11</sup> CFU/kg BW per d, which was the highest dose tested. Furthermore, a micronucleus assay carried out in mice using<italic> B. licheniformis</italic> Me1 did not demonstrate any evidence for cytogenotoxicity. In addition, applications of <italic>B. licheniformis</italic> Me1 did not produce any signs of skin or eye irritation. Based on these results and according to the highest dose levels required by OECD guidelines for materials of low toxicity, it can be concluded that the test article <italic>B. licheniformis</italic> Me1 is safe in rodents and can be potentially considered a safe probiotic for future use.</p>
