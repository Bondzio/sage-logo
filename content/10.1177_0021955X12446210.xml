<sec id="sec1-0021955X12446210" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Nowadays, an intensive development of technologies, which are based on bio-components is observed including the application of vegetable oil derivatives in polyurethane (PUR) materials. Vegetable oils such as sunflower, linseed, palm, rapeseed, but mainly castor and soybean oils have been considered for the preparation of different PUR materials.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021955X12446210">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0021955X12446210">4</xref></sup> All of them, excluding castor oil, have to be converted in order to introduce hydroxyl groups, which are required to react with isocyanate component and to form PUR networks. There are some possible methods of the chemical modification of vegetable oils, such as: transesterification, hydroformylation or ozonolysis followed by hydrogenation, epoxidation with epoxy ring-opening, and halogen addition with nucleophilic substitution.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021955X12446210">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0021955X12446210">10</xref></sup> Some of these solutions or their combinations are used on a semi-industrial or industrial scale.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021955X12446210">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0021955X12446210">13</xref></sup> Life-cycle assessment of vegetable oil based polyols showed that such polyols have very good environmental impact when they are applied to prepare for example flexible PUR foams.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0021955X12446210">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>Efforts have been made during past few years to replace petrochemical polyols with vegetable oil derivatives in the production of PUR materials due to the limited resources of crude oil. Flexible foams have the largest market of all PUR products. They are used especially in automotive, furniture, and rehabilitation as a comfortable and well-supportive mattresses and cushions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021955X12446210">3</xref></sup> The apparent density of flexible foams can be varied in the range 10–100 kg/m<sup>3</sup>, due to the market requirements. Compression properties of flexible foams are one of the most important, taken into account their applicability. Generally, a partial replacement of petrochemical polyols with bio-polyols causes superior cell structure and can be beneficial for viscoelastic foams, shifting the glass transition up to room temperature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021955X12446210">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021955X12446210">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0021955X12446210">15</xref></sup> Obi et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0021955X12446210">15</xref></sup> have shown that the foams are characterized by a higher compression value but lower tensile strength and elongation at break. Zhang et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0021955X12446210">4</xref></sup> have shown more than double increase in compression pressure for foam modified with 30 wt% of soybean oil polyol that was achieved in comparison to the control foam. The increase in compression value was correlated with higher modulus of the foam polymer phase.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0021955X12446210">4</xref></sup> Flexible foams modified with palm oil based polyols have a prolonged tack-free time due to the lower reactivity of such bio-polyols.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0021955X12446210">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>In this study, two types of oil-based polyols were synthesized on a laboratory scale by epoxidation of the rapeseed and palm oils, followed by oxirane ring-opening.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0021955X12446210">17</xref></sup> The aim of this study was to obtain polyols of lower hydroxyl values (125 mg KOH/g for rapeseed and 110 mg KOH/g for palm oil based polyols), desired for flexible foam formulations. The rapeseed and palm oil based polyols were used to modify flexible PUR foam formulations. Obtained flexible porous materials with apparent densities ≈25 and 60 kg/m<sup>3</sup> were investigated. The effects of such modifications on the physical–mechanical properties of prepared foams are discussed.</p>

<sec id="sec4-0021955X12446210"><title>Preparation of foams</title>
<p>The flexible foams were prepared in our laboratory by mixing A and B components. First, the proper polyols were mixed with 1,4-butanediol, tertbutanol, catalysts, water, and surfactant (component A). TDI or modified MDI (Ongronat CL-27) as a component B were added to component A and the mixtures were stirred vigorously for 10 s using an overhead stirrer. Then the prepared mixture was poured into the mold (17 × 12 × 7 cm<sup>3</sup>). The reaction mixture was expanded in the open mold in a vertical direction. After expansion, the foam was placed in an oven preheated to 90°C over a period of an hour. The formulations used for the preparation of the foam samples are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0021955X12446210">Table 2</xref>. The amount of each additive was calculated on 100 parts by weight of total polyol components. The isocyanates indexes for PR and PP foams were 0.85 and 0.50, respectively.

<p>Tests were performed after the foam had aged at 23°C ± 2°C in 50% ± 5% relative humidity for a minimum of 3 days. The mechanical properties of the foams were measured using Zwick testing machines in accordance with ISO standard tests. Tensile strength and elongation at break were conducted according to EN ISO 1798:2008. Resilience by ball rebound was determined following EN ISO 8307:2007 and apparent density of foam samples was measured in accordance with EN ISO 845:2006 procedure. The hysteresis of the foams were measured in accordance with ASTM D 3574-08 standard test, according to the procedure B of X6 test method. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out by TG Netzsch thermogravimetric analyzer (TG 209) at the heating rate of 10°C/min in the air atmosphere from 20°C to 600°C.</p>

<p>The compression behavior of the foams is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0021955X12446210">Figure 1</xref>. The examples of loading and unloading curves are presented for each type of foams. The area under the loading curves and hysteresis loop were used to determine the ability of the foam to absorb energy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0021955X12446210">18</xref></sup> The hysteresis loss was calculated as the ratio of loop area and area below the loading curve. The results such as the apparent density of prepared foams, percentage of hysteresis loss for each foam as well as compression values at selected points of load and unload curves are given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0021955X12446210">Table 3</xref>. Much more energy is required during the loading of the foams that contain PR or PP polyols than in the case of reference materials, while the unloading curves represent similar shape and level. Hence, different energy is dissipated or lost as heat in the case of investigated materials. Moreover, the energy transformed into the heat causes the increase of foam temperature, which can decrease the compression forces additionally. The higher content of the vegetable oil based polyol is, the greater the hysteresis loss occurs, what means that these materials have better energy damping properties.

<p>The apparent density of foams modified with PR (≈25 kg/m<sup>3</sup>) was slightly lower than in the case of reference foam PR0 (27 kg/m<sup>3</sup>), while apparent density of foams modified with PP was slightly higher (59–63 kg/m<sup>3</sup>) when compared to reference material PP0 (57 kg/m<sup>3</sup>). The effects noticed for PP modified foams can be probably related to nearly two times higher viscosity of palm oil polyol, than of replaced polyol Alfapol M-12. The similar apparent densities of all foams of each type allow to compare their mechanical properties.</p>
<p>Compression value – CV<sub>40</sub> is a compression property reported as the pressure required to achieve 40% compression of material. The higher content of PR or PP polyol was, the higher value of CV<sub>40</sub> was observed (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0021955X12446210">Table 3</xref>, where CV<sub>40</sub> corresponds to loading at 40% compression). The foams modified with vegetable oil based polyols gave superior values of compression properties in comparison to unmodified foams.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0021955X12446210">10</xref></sup> The foams modified with PR or PP provided better compression support due to shorter soft segments, higher content of hard segments, and the occurrence of oil polyol dangling chains in the PUR matrix. Petrochemical polyol have hydroxyl groups at the ends of polymeric chains, while PR and PP polyols have the hydroxyls in the middle of the fatty acid chains. Therefore, they have shorter and less flexible soft segments. The distances between the two OH groups in the oil and petrochemical polyols are different and correspond to the hydrocarbon chain lengths of, respectively, 300 and 2000 g/mol molecular weight. Higher OH value of PR and PP (125 and 110 mg KOH/g) in comparison to Arcol 1108 and Alfapol M12 (48 and 32 mg KOH/g) caused the need to use more of isocyanate to prepare the foams with vegetable oil polyols at the same isocyanate index in the case of reference system (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0021955X12446210">Table 2</xref>). Higher hysteresis loss, which corresponds the foam energy absorption, can be caused also by the presence of free C9 and C18 chains.</p>
<p>These differences also have the important effect on foam resilience. The resilience of obtained porous materials is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0021955X12446210">Figure 2</xref>. In our investigation, the tendency to change the foam viscoelasticity reflected by the ball rebound results was observed. Reference foams had the highest values of resilience by ball rebound. The resilience of modified foams decreased in the case of both used polyols. The addition of rapeseed polyols lead to about 50% decrease of resilience (in the case of foam PR50), while the decrease of resilience foams modified with PP is rather negligible. Increased content of PR and PP in the polyol premix reduced the elasticity of the foam as the effect of shorter distance between OH groups and higher hard segment content in the PUR matrix. The addition of vegetable oil polyol decreased foam resilience and moderated return after foam deformation was observed.
<fig id="fig2-0021955X12446210" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>The resilience measured parallel and perpendicularly to the rise direction of the PUR foams modified with (a) rapeseed oil polyol and (b) palm oil polyol. PUR: polyurethane.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0021955X12446210-fig2.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The decrease of resilience values correspond to the increase of the hysteresis loss for each modified foam. In the case of petrochemical and vegetable oil polyol mixture, probably the interpenetration of different soft segments results in an extended response of material and better energy absorption.</p>
<p>The replacement of petrochemical polyol with vegetable oil polyols significantly affects the foam’s behavior during stretching as shown in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0021955X12446210">Figure 3</xref>. The tensile strengths of the reference foam and foams modified up to 50 wt% with PR are on a similar level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0021955X12446210">Figure 3(a)</xref>), while the tensile strength of foams modified with palm oil polyol is higher by ≈10% in comparison to reference material (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0021955X12446210">Figure 3(b)</xref>). Increased content of PR and PP in the polyol premix affects the tensile strength of the foams as the effect of higher hard segment content in the PUR matrix.
<fig id="fig3-0021955X12446210" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>Tensile strength and elongation at break of foams modified with (a) rapeseed oil polyol and (b) palm oil polyol.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0021955X12446210-fig3.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>In the case of foams, which contain PR or PP polyols, the decrease of elongation at break is observed. The substitution of Arcol with 10 wt% of PR polyol has caused a slight increase only in elongation at break but higher PR contents caused gradual, disadvantageous lowering of this parameter. The decrease of elongation at break is associated with the shortening of soft segment length as the result of PR or PP polyol content increasing in the foam formulation.</p>
<p>The thermal decomposition of PUR matrix occurs in the random places by one or more of the following three mechanisms: depolymerisation (dissociation to the isocyanate and polyol precursors), dissociation (to a primary amine, an olefin, and CO<sub>2</sub>), and elimination of CO<sub>2</sub> leading to the replacement of the urethane bond by secondary amine groups.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0021955X12446210">19</xref></sup> The TGA profiles of thermal decomposition progresses under air atmosphere for foams modified with different content of PR and PP polyols are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0021955X12446210">Figure 4</xref>.

<p>Detailed and more exact thermal decomposition progresses, derivative thermogravimetry (DTG) curves, are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0021955X12446210">Figure 5</xref>. The DTG plots are characterized by a multi-stage decomposition process. The decomposition of the reference foam and foams modified up to 50 wt% with PR started at a similar temperature of ≈225°C.
<fig id="fig5-0021955X12446210" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>The set of DTG curves of foams modified with (a) rapeseed oil polyol and (b) palm oil polyol. DTG: derivative thermogravimetry.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0021955X12446210-fig5.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>In the case of the foams modified with palm oil polyol, the decomposition of reference foam has started at slightly higher temperature (≈241°C) while for samples PP10, PP20, and PP30 the start of decomposition at the slightly lower temperature was observed (≈227–232°C). At a temperature of ≈570°C, decomposition for all foams can be considered as being complete. The obtained results indicate that the thermal stabilities of PR foams series is slightly lower than PP foams series. Moreover, the set of thermograms shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0021955X12446210">Figure 4</xref> indicates a decrease in the rate of weight loss with the increase of PR and PP polyol content in the foam formulations.</p>

<sec id="sec7-0021955X12446210" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The modifications of PUR formulations with rapeseed or palm oil derivatives allow to improve selected properties of final products. The foams modified with both oil-based polyols show higher ability for absorption of energy and are more stable in comparison to the respective reference materials, especially in the range of decomposition temperature between 300°C and 500°C.</p>
<p>The replacement up to 50 wt% of the petrochemical polyol with low functionality of rapeseed oil based polyol in the PUR system makes possible to obtain the products with similar apparent density and tensile strength. It was confirmed that the modification of flexible foam systems with oil polyols significantly increases the compressive strength and decreases the elongation at break.</p>
<p>The analysis of selected properties of higher density foams modified with palm oil based polyol shows similar effects. The replacement of the petrochemical polyol up to 30 wt% with the palm oil based polyol causes the significant increase of compressive strength. It should be taken into account that increasing the content of palm oil based polyol affects apparent density, which also have an impact on the mechanical properties of the investigated foams. The foams modified with this polyol are characterized by similar softness, lower resilience and are more pleasant to touch in comparison to the reference material.</p>
<p>The natural oil polyols have a price comparable to the petrochemical ones, but their use in low density foam systems allows to obtain porous materials with higher support compression. As a result, the lower density, oil modified foams can be used instead of higher density petrochemical material, reducing the raw materials usage and the price of the end product.</p>
<p>However, in the case of furniture and automotive industries, the greater ability to absorb energy can be utilized, which is an important parameter for these applications.</p>
