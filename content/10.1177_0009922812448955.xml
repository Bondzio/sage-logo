<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Ring-enhancing lesions of the brain in children with no comorbid conditions are quite unusual and have rarely been addressed in the pediatric literature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922812448955">1</xref></sup> Etiologies may be infectious, neoplastic, inflammatory, or vascular. Newer imaging capabilities have greatly increased our ability to predict the etiologies of these illnesses and to direct early diagnostic confirmation and management.</p>
<p>A recent case is presented to put the subsequent discussion into clinical perspective. Emphasis is placed on newer observations, most of which have been published in the radiology, neurology, and internal medicine literature.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0009922812448955">
<title>Patient Report</title>
<p>A 14-year-old girl presented to her ophthalmologist with an acute loss of vision in her left eye.</p>
<p>Two weeks prior to this visit she had been seen by her primary care physician with decreased vision in her right eye. She was prescribed eye drops and outpatient follow-up was planned. Over the course of the intervening 2 weeks, she developed persistent headaches, intermittent seizures, voice changes, and left facial nerve paralysis. On examination, she was noted to have bilaterally dilated and nonreactive pupils and was referred to the local emergency room. A computed tomography scan of her head showed a right frontoparietal mass lesion with surrounding edema and minimal midline shift. The patient was then transferred to our tertiary care facility for further management.</p>
<p>A month prior to the current admission, the patient had been hospitalized with 4 generalized seizures unresponsive to lorazepam, phenytoin, and phenobarbital, and she was subsequently intubated for control. Brain imaging with contrast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed bitemporal meningeal enhancement most consistent with prolonged seizures or meningitis. Thorough evaluation, including blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cultures revealed no infectious etiology. Her seizures were subsequently controlled with propofol. She was discharged 10 days later on levetiracetam and phenytoin.</p>
<p>On the current admission, the patient was afebrile with 5 mm, nonreactive pupils. She did not respond to visual challenge. She exhibited left facial nerve paralysis and tongue deviation indicating left hypoglossal nerve paralysis, but all other cranial nerves were intact. Strength was 5/5 in all extremities. The rest of her exam was unremarkable. Neurosurgery was consulted and an MRI ordered. The MRI showed 3 incompletely enhancing ring lesions within the right posterior frontal/parietal lobes with enhancement in the posterior corpus callosum as well as the optic chiasm and proximal intracranial optic nerves. The largest lesion was in the right posterior frontal lobe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0009922812448955">Figure 1</xref>) and measured 1.4 × 2.4 cm. Two other lesion in the right parietal lobe measured 1.4 × 1.4 cm and 1.0 × 0.9 cm. There was an additional enhancing lesion along the inferior aspect of the spinal corpus callosum measuring approximately 4 mm as well as abnormal enhancement along the optic chiasm and the proximal intracranial optic nerves. There was mass effect associated with each of these foci along with surrounding edema. Slight generalized cerebellar volume loss advanced for the patient’s age was evident.</p>

<p>A lumbar puncture revealed an opening pressure of 21 cm of water, within normal limits. CSF contained 2 white blood cells, 0 red blood cells, and no organisms on Gram stain or culture. A CSF multiple sclerosis screening panel was negative.</p>
<p>She was started on dexamethasone as well as empiric coverage for intracranial abscesses with meropenem, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, and amphotericin B.</p>
<p>The largest of the lesions was biopsied on the second day of admission. The results were remarkable for the absence of inflammatory cells and microbial pathogens but rather demonstrated evidence both of neoplastic and demyelinating processes. Tissue was sent for additional expert analysis.</p>
<p>The patient remained afebrile over the course of admission, and her condition remained largely unchanged with modest improvement in vision, resolution of facial nerve and hypoglossal nerve palsies, but no change in mental status.</p>

<title>Pathologic Diagnosis</title>
<p>Pathological review of the biopsy at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester was felt to be diagnostic for fast active demyelination, as opposed to a neoplasm. To this end, special staining was done for confirmation, and the results are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0009922812448955">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<p>The histopathologic features of demyelinating lesions include preservation of axons with loss of myelin, presence of macrophages, and astrocytic proliferation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0009922812448955">2</xref></sup> The microscopic sections in our patient demonstrated fragments of white matter with sharply circumscribed areas of myelin loss (as highlighted on the Luxol fast blue–per acid-Schiff preparation) and relative axonal preservation (as highlighted on the neurofilament preparation) in which an intimate admixture of macrophages and reactive astrocytes predominated. Special stains performed for microorganisms (giemsa and acid-fast bacillus) were negative.</p>
<p>Diagnosis: Active tumefactive demyelinating disease.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0009922812448955">
<title>Differential Diagnoses</title>
<p>Multiple ring-enhancing lesions of the brain in children with no comorbidities are quite rare and create a major challenge in clinical correlation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922812448955">1</xref></sup> Etiologies may be infectious, neoplastic, inflammatory, or vascular. Schwartz et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0009922812448955">3</xref></sup> reviewed 221 ring-enhancing lesions in adults seen on MRI and reported that 40% were gliomas, 30% metastases, 8% abscesses, and 6% demyelinating disease.</p>
<sec id="section5-0009922812448955">
<title>Infectious</title>
<p>Pyogenic brain abscesses are usually located at the gray–white matter junction with ring enhancement that is thin and smooth, thinner along the medial margin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922812448955">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Infection is most often secondary to spread from sinus or ear infections or occur secondarily to hematogenous seeding from a primary infectious process such as endocarditis, suppurative lung disease, extensive skin and soft tissue infection, and abdominal and pelvic infections.</p>
<p>The list of potential microbial pathogens is quite lengthy but may be modified by the primary focus of infection and the patient’s risk factors, especially premorbid immunosuppression such as is seen with HIV disease. For example, although toxoplasmosis is a common cause of intracranial mass lesions in patients with AIDS (3% to 10% of patients with AIDS in the United States and 50% of AIDS patients in Europe and Africa),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922812448955">1</xref></sup> this etiology is quite rare in immunocompetent individuals.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0009922812448955">
<title>Neoplastic</title>
<p>Primary and metastatic tumors are rounded, well circumscribed, ring-enhancing, and surrounded by a variable amount of perifocal edema on MRI. Metastatic lesions are at or near the gray–white junction and are usually associated with significant perilesional edema, whereas most primary tumors, such as glioblastoma multiforme, are large in size and are located deep in the white matter.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922812448955">1</xref></sup> Neoplastic lesions tend to have a characteristic thick rim demonstrating necrosis or fluid within the rim, particularly seen with fluid-secreting tumors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0009922812448955">4</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0009922812448955">
<title>Inflammatory and Demyelinating</title>
<p>Although most demyelinating disorders demonstrate a nodular pattern, some produce ring-enhancing lesions. Open or incomplete ring lesions help to differentiate a demyelinating lesion from a tumor or abscess.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922812448955">1</xref></sup> Potential categories of demyelinating diseases with ring enhancement include both classic multiple sclerosis and tumefactive demyelination. Although the appearance of multiple sclerosis in the pediatric population is rare, it is significant. Approximately 4.4% of patients with multiple sclerosis present with their first episode of demyelination before their 16th birthday.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0009922812448955">5</xref></sup> Pediatric multiple sclerosis tends to present with acute onset and a polysymptomatic form of the disease, possibly with encephalopathy and large tumefactive lesions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0009922812448955">6</xref></sup> Multiple sclerosis lesions are characteristically oval, oriented perpendicular to the lateral ventricles, and do not demonstrate neovascularity, angiogenesis, or necrosis. Although an open ring sign may be seen in abscesses and neoplasms, it is more strongly suggestive of demyelination.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0009922812448955">4</xref></sup> International consensus definitions require 2 or more non–acute disseminated encephalomyelitis demyelinating events for diagnosis of multiple sclerosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0009922812448955">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Tumefactive demyelinating lesions are defined as solitary lesions greater than 2 cm.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0009922812448955">2</xref></sup> The lesions have ill-defined borders, mass effect, perilesional edema, central necrosis, cystic degeneration, contrast enhancement, and variable involvement of gray matter.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0009922812448955">2</xref></sup> These lesions may be responsive to corticosteroid therapy, demonstrating a reduction in size on MRI following treatment. Tumefactive demyelinating lesions are quite rare with an estimated overall incidence around 0.3 cases per 100,000 per year and are even less frequent in the pediatric population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0009922812448955">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>Neurosarcoidosis may be clinically and radiographically indistinguishable from multiple sclerosis,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0009922812448955">8</xref></sup> affecting any part of the nervous system and presenting with cranial nerve palsies, seizures, meningitis, and/or peripheral neuropathy. The overall disease prevalence in the United States is estimated at 40 per 100,000 with the greatest disease burden in African Americans. Sarcoidosis solely of the nervous system, however, is far more rare (&lt;0.2 per 100,000 among whites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0009922812448955">9</xref></sup>). Thus, it is prudent to look for more classic systemic signs and symptoms of sarcoidosis to support a diagnosis of neurosarcoidosis. Lymphocytic pleocytosis, elevated protein levels, decreased glucose concentrations, and high opening pressures are nonspecific CSF abnormalities that have been observed in association with neurosarcoidosis. CSF may also show an elevation in oligoclonal bands or elevated IgG as in multiple sclerosis. Elevated angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) often associated with neurosarcoidosis when found in the CSF is a nonspecific marker as ACE concentrations may also be high with infections and malignant tumors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0009922812448955">9</xref></sup></p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>A careful evaluation in the context of a patient’s presentation is extremely important, especially to distinguish between neoplastic and nonneoplastic etiologies. Incorrect diagnosis may lead to a potentially life-threatening delay in therapy or to unnecessary surgery.</p>
<p>For the differential of ring-enhancing central nervous system lesions a practical approach has been suggested in an algorithm previously published.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922812448955">1</xref></sup> The first step is separating HIV-positive from HIV-negative patients. Opportunistic infections as well as certain central nervous system neoplasms are far more common in AIDS patients than in the general population. In a patient with HIV, a ring-enhancing lesion may be presumed toxoplasma until proven otherwise. The relationship is so strong, that a course of therapy may even be tried in a seronegative patient before further steps are undertaken.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922812448955">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>In our present case, a young HIV-negative patient, the lesions should be evaluated in accordance with size. The large size and characteristic radiographic features (open ring sign) of the lesion are already suspicious for demyelinating disease. Biopsy, however, was still necessary to confirm the diagnosis. A lack of neutrophils, organisms, or predisposing conditions (no history of sinusitis, no intravenous drug use, no indwelling hardware or catheters) strongly argued against the likelihood of an infectious etiology.</p>
<p>Appearance on initial pathology was concerning for grade III astrocytoma due to the reactive astrocytes and hypercellularity. A metastatic malignancy was also a consideration. However, the lack of evidence of primary tumor anywhere on computed tomography, MRI, or chest X-ray decreased the likelihood of metastasis. The large number of macrophages consistent with granuloma formation as well as demyelinating disease narrowed the differential diagnosis.</p>
<p>Neurosarcoidosis was considered given the patient’s elevated ACE serology. However, the normal chest X-ray and spinal MRI argued against systemic disease with CNS sarcoidosis.</p>
<p>This patient most likely suffers from a tumefactive demyelinating lesion, a rare manifestation in the spectrum of demyelinating diseases. Other clues on MRI could include a central dilated vascular structure within the lesion on T2-echoplanar images, representing venous drainage toward the distended subependymal veins.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0009922812448955">2</xref></sup> In patients with no past clinical or MRI features of definite multiple sclerosis, but in whom the diagnosis of tumefactive demyelination is entertained, repeat fast fluid-attenuated inversion-recovery sequences may be performed during or shortly after completion of corticosteroid therapy. Fast fluid-attenuated inversion-recovery sequences, rather than a lengthy complete protocol, may be preferred in pediatrics because they obviate the need for sedation in young patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0009922812448955">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Magnetic resonance perfusion is another noninvasive imaging method that could have helped to distinguish between neoplasm and abscess, wherein high regional cerebral blood volumes in the peripheral areas indicate the possibility of a necrotic brain tumor whereas low values indicate an abscess. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy can help differentiate tumors versus infection versus demyelinating disorders, as well. Certain brain metabolites correlate with lesional findings, choline peaks with tumors, amino acid peaks with abscesses, and glutamate/glutamine peaks with demyelination.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922812448955">1</xref></sup> To confirm the diagnosis, these adjunct evaluations may be supportive in the interpretation of the histopathology.</p>
<p>Response to therapy can also be used as a diagnostic tool. Our patient showed improvement with a regimen of Decadron. This is the appropriate therapy of choice in tumefactive demyelination and has been shown to decrease the size of the lesions with variable resolution of corresponding neurologic symptoms.</p>
<p>A literature review by McAdam et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0009922812448955">5</xref></sup> in 2002 listed 12 cases of pediatric tumefactive demyelination reported in the English language literature. Riva et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0009922812448955">7</xref></sup> wrote of another 7 cases encountered through 2008. Again, this is a very rare disease that must nonetheless be present on the differential diagnosis of a ring-enhancing lesion in a pediatric patient to avoid unnecessary invasive or toxic therapies.</p>
