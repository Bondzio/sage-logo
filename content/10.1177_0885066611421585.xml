<abstract>
<p>A 38-year-old man was found unresponsive with hypoglycemia by emergency medical service (EMS) personnel. He was intubated in the emergency department after reports of seizure activity. With supportive care and empiric steroids, the patient was extubated the next day. He reported a diagnosis of Addison disease and noncompliance with his steroid replacement therapy. Within 12 hours, respiratory failure and altered mental status required reintubation. Laboratory studies revealed rhabdomyolysis and hypophosphatemia. The replacement of glucose likely stimulated glycolysis, formation of phosphorylated glucose compounds, and an intracellular shift of phosphorus. This patient required phosphate replacement and was extubated on hospital day 5. We report a unique case of hypoglycemia due to Addison disease, leading to hypophosphatemic respiratory failure.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Respiratory failure, including prolonged intubation, is a well-known sequela of hypophosphatemia. Often, this is described in patients receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) in an intensive care unit setting. We describe a case of a patient with severe hypoglycemia due to Addisonian crisis, wherein the restoration of glucticocorticoid treatment provoked severe hypophosphatemia and associated respiratory failure and intubation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0885066611421585">
<title>Case Report</title>
<p>A 38-year-old male presented to the emergency department (ED) after being found on the side of the road by emergency medical service (EMS) personnel. The patient was hypoglycemic in the field with a fingerstick of 29 (mg/dL). Intravenous dextrose was immediately administered. In addition, the EMS staff witnessed seizure activity. The patient was intubated in the ED for airway protection. No antihyperglycemics were found in patient’s system and a toxicology screen was positive for cocaine. In the ED, vital signs were stable and the patient had no focal neurologic deficits. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for severe hypoglycemia and seizure. He was placed on a thiamine replacement, 10% dextrose intravenous fluid in addition to his maintenance fluids, and was loaded with intravenous phenytoin. A head computed tomography (CT) and lumbar puncture were completed which ruled out acute intracerebral processes. The patient’s admission laboratory findings were significant for a serum lactate of 12.0 mmol/L (normal range, 0.5-1.5 mmol/L). The serum lactate normalized within 7 hours with intravenous (IV) hydration to 1.3 mmol/L. Given the profound nature of the patient’s hypoglycemia, a random cortisol level was sent, and the patient was started on empiric stress dose steroids (hydrocortisone 50 mg IV every 6 hours [q6]) on the morning before extubation. The patient’s random cortisol level was found to be low (1.3 ug/dL; normal range, 4.5-23.0 ug/dL).</p>
<p>The patient’s hypoglycemia improved, D10 was stopped, ventilator support was weaned, and the patient was extubated on ICU day 2. After extubation, the patient explained that he had been diagnosed with Addison disease prior to 4 years at a nearby hospital, and he was taking hydrocortisone 10 mg once daily. He admitted to running out of his medication prior to about 2 weeks. After hydrocortisone replacement, the patient developed hypotension, respiratory distress, and a change in mental status. He was reintubated less than 12 hours after extubation, with no acute changes noted on a repeat head CT. Aspiration pneumonia was initially suspected. Initial sputum cultures revealed <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> and <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic>. The patient was started on empiric antibiotics. On ICU day 5, the patient was extubated and was found to have rhabdomyolysis. His creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) level was elevated at 4500 U/L (normal range, 55-325 U/L; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0885066611421585">Figure 1</xref>). The patient’s phosphate level was low (1.5 g/dL; normal range, 2.5-4.5 g/dL) particularly considering the of degree rhabdomyolysis. The patient’s initial admission phosphorus level was normal (2.6 mg/dL). After glucose and steroid replacement, the patient’s phosphorus level dropped to 1.5 mg/dL on day 4. Replacement was initiated and phosphorous normalized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0885066611421585">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

<p>Upon further investigation, he was found to have low insulinlike growth factor 1 (IGF-1) at 80 ng/ml (normal range, 106-255 ng/mL), ACTH was low at &lt;5 pg/mL (normal range, 7-50 pg/mL), testosterone was low at 178 ng/dL (normal range, 241-827 ng/dL), prolactin was high at 23.1 ng/mL (normal range 2-18 ng/mL). The endocrinology service was following the patient and felt this was all consistent with pan-hypopituitarism. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the pituitary was performed revealing a small 2 mm microadenoma. The patient was placed on topical testosterone and instructed to follow-up in the outpatient endocrinology clinic 1 week after discharge. On hospital day 9, hypoglycemia, hypotension, and altered mental status had all resolved. The patient was being treated with ceftriaxone for suspected aspiration pneumonia. He was discharged in good condition on an oral dosage of hydrocortisone 15 mg in the morning and 5 mg at night and on topical testosterone.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Adrenal cortex glucocorticoids exert gluconeogenic action during fasting by numerous pathways. One of these pathways is the conversion of oxaloacetate into phosphopyruvate and increasing hepatic glucose 6-phosphatase activity, releasing more glucose into circulation. In this patient with Addison disease, the lack of these glucocorticoid effects led to hypoglycemia, causing our patient’s initial presentation.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0885066611421585">1</xref>
</sup> Another factor that facilitated hypoglycemia in this patient was his cocaine use. Prolonged use of sympathomimetics, such as in a cocaine binge, can also result in hypoglycemia.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0885066611421585">2</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>After the replacement of glucose, we believe that this patient then developed a physiologic process similar to a refeeding syndrome. The serum phosphate level of the patient was normal initially and dropped later despite rhabdomyolysis (usually associated with elevated CPK and hyperphosphatemia). The release of glucose in the circulation stimulates glycolysis, which then leads to the formation of phosphorylated glucose compounds and intracellular shift of phosphorus. In patients whose total body is depleted of phosphorus, this shift leads to serum hypophosphatemia.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0885066611421585">3</xref>
</sup> This intracellular shift is the most frequent cause of hypophosphatemia.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0885066611421585">3</xref>
</sup> Although the patient did not appear to be have severe malnutrition based on physical examination and the fact that the patient’s serum albumin was not depressed (4.6 g/dL; normal range, 3.5-5.0 g/dL), we speculate that the patient was in fact relatively hypophosphatemic. In addition, the 10% dextrose infusion that was initiated in order to treat the patient’s hypoglycemia likely accelerated the consumption of inorganic phosphate into adenosine triphosphate (ATP). In our patient, severe hypophosphatemia ensued and the associated electrolyte and physiologic sequela likely resulted in rhabdomyolysis and respiratory failure.</p>
<p>This presentation of Addison disease leading to hypophosphatemia is rare. An extensive literature search revealed 1 case report of a child with acute adrenal crisis leading to reversible cardiomyopathy.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0885066611421585">4</xref>
</sup> In this case, the serum phosphorus decreased by over 50% (1.29-0.61 mmol/L). The authors concluded the myocardial dysfunction was due to adrenal insufficiency because the serum phosphorus level was not profoundly low (&lt;0.32 mmol/L). However, the case does demonstrate the ability for the serum phosphate level to drop precipitously. From the above case and our experience, we believe that for patients who are in Addisonian crisis, the serum phosphate should be monitored closely for the first 48 hours of glucocorticoid replacement particularly if the patient requires dextrose supplementation for hypoglycemia.</p>
<p>The refeeding syndrome was first described after World War II in prisoners of war (POWs) who had cardiac and neurologic defects when refeeding was initiated.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0885066611421585">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0885066611421585">6</xref>
</sup> This syndrome is characterized by cardiac and respiratory failure, arrhythmias, rhabdomyolysis, leukocyte dysfunction, weakness, seizures, coma, and sudden death.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0885066611421585">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0885066611421585">8</xref>
</sup> The metabolic complications associated with refeeding syndrome are hypophosphatemia, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, thiamine deficiency, and fluid overload.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0885066611421585">9</xref>
</sup> Thiamine is a cofactor for pyruvate dehydrogenase. Thiamine deficiency can manifest as Wernicke encephalopathy, beriberi, and/or lactic acidosis. The hallmark of refeeding syndrome is the development of severe hypophosphatemia and is often unrecognized.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0885066611421585">10</xref>
</sup> This is caused by the cellular uptake of phosphate during the first week of starting to refeed.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0885066611421585">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0885066611421585">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0885066611421585">11</xref>
</sup> Hypophosphatemia is defined as mild (plasma phosphate level 2-2.5 mg/dL or 0.65-0.81 mmol/L), moderate (1-2 mg/dL or 0.32-0.65 mmol/L), or severe (&lt;1 mg/dL or 0.32 mmol/L). Significant clinical sequelae are usually associated with severe hypophosphatemia.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0885066611421585">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0885066611421585">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0885066611421585">11</xref>
</sup> We believe that the intracellular shift of phosphorus led to respiratory failure in our patient, requiring reintubation.</p>
<p>Respiratory failure is a known consequence of hypophosphatemia.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0885066611421585">12</xref>
</sup> A study done over 20 years ago demonstrated the effect of hypophosphatemia on respiratory muscles. The investigators electrically stimulated the phrenic nerves in 8 mechanically ventilated patients before and after phosphate repletion. Diaphragmatic function was evaluated by the transdiaphragmatic pressure (the difference between esophogeal and gastric pressure). The increase in transdiaphragmatic pressure was statistically significant and was well correlated with the increase in serum phosphorus level.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0885066611421585">13</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Patient populations in which hypophosphatemia has been reported include alcoholics, diabetics, patients treated with phosphate-binding antacids, the severely malnourished, and patients with respiratory alkalosis.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0885066611421585">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0885066611421585">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0885066611421585">15</xref>
</sup> It has been reported, though, that some patients will demonstrate a refeeding syndrome and the subsequent hypophosphatemia only after 48 hours of starvation in the ICU setting. Often because of the postoperative course or small bowel hypomotility, enteral feeding is delayed in the ICU. In a study that included all ICU patients not receiving nutrition for at least 48 hours, 34% experienced refeeding hypophosphatemia.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0885066611421585">5</xref>
</sup> The only significant predictor of refeeding syndrome was a low serum prealbumin concentration, alluding to a poor nutritional state. Although the severity of illness scores were the same between the 2 groups, the refeeding group experienced longer mechanical ventilation time and longer hospital stay.<sup>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Patients with Addisonian crisis may experience significant decrease in serum phosphate during glucocorticoid replacement. Patients who are receiving glucocorticoid replacement therapy should have their serum phosphate monitored. For some patients, the preemptive replacement of phosphate may be warranted.</p>
