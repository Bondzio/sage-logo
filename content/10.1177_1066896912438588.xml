<abstract>
<p>Renal cell carcinoma of chromophobe type is a malignant neoplasm with characteristic large cells that exhibit prominent cell membranes. Primary renal carcinoid tumors are rare tumors with the histological appearance similar to well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors at other sites. Chromophobe renal cell carcinoma with neuroendocrine differentiation is exceedingly rare. The authors describe a case of a chromophobe renal cell carcinoma and carcinoid tumor of the kidney presenting as distinct masses in the same kidney in a 34-year-old male. The histologic and immunohistochemical features of both the tumors were characteristic with no overlapping features. The carcinoid tumor presented at a higher stage with nodal metastasis. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first case of 2 morphologically distinct tumors, one chromophobe renal cell carcinoma and the other primary carcinoid tumor in the same kidney.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Chromophobe renal cell carcinoma (chRCC) is a malignant renal neoplasm that comprises 4% to 5% of all renal tumors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1066896912438588">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1066896912438588">2</xref></sup> chRCC has been described in association with other renal tumors, including collecting duct carcinoma and conventional and sarcomatoid renal cell carcinoma (RCC).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1066896912438588">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1066896912438588"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1066896912438588">5</xref></sup> chRCC with neuroendocrine differentiation is exceptionally rare.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1066896912438588">6</xref></sup> Primary carcinoid tumor (PCT) of the kidney is a very rare entity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1066896912438588">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1066896912438588"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1066896912438588">9</xref></sup> In the kidney, although rare, composite tumors of various combinations have been reported, for example, chRCC and collecting duct carcinoma,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1066896912438588">10</xref></sup> RCC with neuroendocrine tumor,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1066896912438588">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1066896912438588">11</xref></sup> and RCC with angiomyolipoma.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1066896912438588">12</xref></sup> To the best of our knowledge, there are no reports in the literature describing the concurrent PCT and chRCC in the same kidney.

<sec id="section2-1066896912438588">
<title>Case Report</title>
<p>A 34-year-old man presented with a 2-week history of epigastric discomfort, early satiety, and upper abdominal fullness. He also reported a 40-pound weight loss during this period. He denied hematuria and colicky pain. Past medical history was significant for constipation, low back pain, and depression. There was no pertinent past surgical history. He was a nonsmoker and consumed alcohol occasionally. An abdominal exam revealed a soft, nontender abdomen with left epigastric and left flank fullness, indicative of a large mass in that region, which was clinically suspicious of a renal malignancy. The remainder of his urogenital system examination was unremarkable.</p>
<p>Computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis demonstrated a 5.8 × 5.5 cm lobulated mass in the upper pole of the left kidney with subtle enhancement and areas of calcification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1066896912438588">Figure 1A</xref>). In addition, within the lower pole of the left kidney, an irregularly marginated 9.5 × 7.3 cm mass with subtle enhancement was identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1066896912438588">Figure 1B</xref>). The left renal vein was patent, and left paraaortic lymph nodes were found to be enlarged. The aforementioned findings were for an RCC with nodal metastasis. The right kidney and bilateral adrenals were unremarkable. No additional intra-abdominal or retroperitoneal mass was documented. A metastatic workup including a CT scan of the chest, and liver enzymes were negative. Additional laboratory findings were within normal limits. The patient underwent a left radical nephrectomy with extended retroperitoneal node dissection, and the resected specimen was sent for pathologic examination. Intraoperatively, 2 distinct masses were identified at each pole of the left kidney with markedly enlarged para-aortic lymph nodes.</p>

<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<p>Representative tissue sections from the specimen were fixed in 10% buffered formalin, dehydrated in graded ethanol, cleared in xylene, and embedded in paraffin. Corresponding hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E)–stained slides were reviewed. Based on the morphology of both tumors, a panel of immunohistochemical stains was ordered on the matching paraffin blocks with tumor tissue (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1066896912438588">Table 1</xref>). Standard avidin–biotin complex technique was used for signal detection. The immunohistochemical panel performed on both tumors included CD56, synaptophysin, chromogranin A, CA9, parvalbumin, and Ki-67. Fresh tissue samples from both tumors were processed for conventional karyotyping also.</p>

<title>Gross Pathology</title>
<p>Gross examination of the resected left kidney revealed 2 distinct nodular tumors situated in the upper and lower poles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1066896912438588">Figure 1C</xref>). The upper pole chRCC, measuring 5.5 × 5.5 × 4.0 cm, was nodular with a firm, tan-brown cut surface demonstrating multiple punctate hemorrhagic spots. Foci of minute calcifications were noted. There were no areas of hemorrhage or necrosis. The lower pole carcinoid tumor, measuring 9.5 × 7.5 × 5.0 cm, was nodular with a firm, yellow-white cut surface. Both tumors were grossly confined within the renal capsule, and although both tumors abutted the hilar region, none of them extended into the renal vein or renal pelvis. The intervening renal parenchyma was grossly unremarkable with preserved corticomedullary junction.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1066896912438588">
<title>Histopathology</title>
<p>On microscopic examination, the larger, lower pole carcinoid tumor was composed of cells arranged predominantly in sheets, ribbons, trabeculae, and focally in an acinar pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1066896912438588">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1066896912438588">E</xref>). Prominent fibrovascular septae were noted along with focal lymphocytic infiltrate and calcification. The individual tumor cells were round to cuboidal in shape with abundant amphophilic to pink, finely granular cytoplasm and contained enlarged nuclei with “salt and pepper”–like speckled chromatin. Nucleoli were inconspicuous. Focally, the mitotic activity ranged up to 1 mitosis per 10 high power fields (HPF). No areas of necrosis were documented in this tumor. There was microscopic extension of tumor into the perinephric and perihilar soft tissue, and angiolymphatic invasion with macrometastasis to para-aortic lymph nodes. The tumor was staged as pT3a pN1 M0.</p>
<p>Microscopic examination of the smaller, upper pole chRCC mass revealed a cellular tumor composed of cells arranged in vague nodules and sheets interspersed by broad fibrous septae containing medium-caliber blood vessels. Two distinct cell populations were identified: large cells with abundant pale pink, flocculent cytoplasm, and “plant-like” prominent cell borders (chromophobe cells) as well as smaller cells with relatively less abundant, pink, finely granular cytoplasm and prominent cell borders. The nuclei of these cells were enlarged, hyperchromatic, and round to slightly elongated, with a distinct perinuclear halo (Fuhrman nuclear grade 2/4). Some of the nuclei appeared raisinoid with wrinkled nuclear contours, and some others demonstrated grooves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1066896912438588">Figure 1H</xref>). The tumor did not harbor any areas of necrosis or other unusual histologic features. There was no extrarenal extension, and this tumor was staged as pT1b pN0 M0. The nonneoplastic kidney demonstrated mild chronic interstitial inflammation and focal glomerulosclerosis, especially near the tumor.</p>

<sec id="section7-1066896912438588">
<title>Immunohistochemical Findings</title>
<p>Immunohistochemically, the tumor cells of the carcinoid neoplasm expressed CD56 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1066896912438588">Figure 1F</xref>), synaptophysin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1066896912438588">Figure 1G</xref>), and chromogranin A and were negative for CA9 and parvalbumin. The proliferation index, based on Ki-67 immunostain, of this tumor was 5%. The overall features were diagnostic of a primary renal neuroendocrine tumor.</p>
<p>The chRCC tumor cells expressed parvalbumin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1066896912438588">Figure 1I</xref>) and were negative for CD56, synaptophysin, chromogranin A, and CA9. The overall features were diagnostic of a chRCC.</p>
<p>A repeat staging CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis, soon after diagnosis, did not reveal any evidence of residual disease, and a surveillance CT scan did not document any other tumors or masses, excluding the possibility of metastatic carcinoid tumor to the kidney.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Carcinoid tumor, most frequently encountered in respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts, is rare in the kidney and has been documented in the literature mostly as case reports and more recently as few, still relatively small case series.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1066896912438588">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1066896912438588">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1066896912438588">13</xref></sup> The mean age of presentation for PTC is similar to chRCC, namely 52 years with a wide age range of 27 to 78 years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1066896912438588">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1066896912438588">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1066896912438588">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1066896912438588">8</xref></sup> Like chRCC, there is no sex predilection for this tumor.

<p>Although, the overall disease course of PCT is less aggressive than conventional RCC, the former tend to present at a higher TNM stage at initial diagnosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1066896912438588">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1066896912438588">9</xref></sup> Romero et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1066896912438588">9</xref></sup> reported the following parameters as poor prognostic factors for PCT: age above 40 years, tumor size more than 4 cm, and extrarenal extension. However, Hansel et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1066896912438588">8</xref></sup> reported a prolonged clinical course despite nodal and distant metastasis in their series of 21 cases. The 5-year survival of chRCC is 86.7% and present at an early stage of disease with low-grade histologic features. About 4% of the tumors have metastases at diagnosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1066896912438588">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1066896912438588">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1066896912438588">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>The clinical and radiological findings in our case were similar to the –cases reported earlier. There were no symptoms attributable to carcinoid or other neuroendocrine syndromes. CT scans did not document other primary sites of neuroendocrine tumor, essentially ruling out the possibility of a metastasis to this patient’s kidney. No congenital renal abnormalities, especially a horseshoe kidney or polycystic disease, were observed. The most impressive finding was the presence of 2 distinctly separate, enhancing tumor masses at either poles of the left kidney. The carcinoid tumor manifested with a more advanced stage than the chRCC counterpart. Adjuvant therapy with octreotide was one of the possible alternatives to watchful follow-up in this case; however, the patient opted for the latter. On follow-up, after 7 months from radical nephrectomy, there was no evidence of residual disease on clinical examination and imaging studies.</p>
<p>The histomorphologic findings in the chRCC and carcinoid tumors were characteristic. Carcinoid tumors at other sites, especially the respiratory tract, have special prognostic implications associated with mitotic count. In PCT of the kidney, Romero et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1066896912438588">9</xref></sup> reported a mitotic rate greater than 1/10 HPF to be associated with a higher incidence of metastasis and residual disease at final follow-up. Hansel et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1066896912438588">8</xref></sup> documented PCT of the kidney with a variable mitotic rate from 0 to 4/10 HPF. In their series, 1 case demonstrated mitoses of 4/10 HPF, and this patient died of disease at 8 months. chRCC are immunoreactive for CD117, cytokeratin (CK) 7, and parvalbumin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1066896912438588">2</xref></sup> If done well, Hale’s colloidal iron demonstrates diffuse cytoplasmic staining in the tumor cells. Carcinoid tumors are frequently positive for synaptophysin followed by chromogranin, Cam5.2, neurone-specific enolase, prostatic acid phosphatase, and S-100. Expression of CK7 and CK20 is rare. In this current case, the immunohistochemical features of both tumors were diagnostic.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Parada and Pena<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1066896912438588">6</xref></sup> reported a case of chRCC with neuroendocrine differentiation in a 56-year-old man with an 8.5-cm nonhomogenous mass of the right kidney. The authors described a single large tumor mass that demonstrated histological features of characteristic chRCC admixed with neuroendocrine morphology. Immunohistochemically, the neuroendocrine areas in this published case were reactive for C-kit, epithelial membrane antigen, AE1/AE3, CK7, chromogranin A, neurone-specific enolase, CD56, and S-100 protein. Our case, unlike this report, had 2 distinct tumor masses with different morphology and immunohistochemistry. Both tumors were extensively sampled, and there was no evidence of hybrid features in either tumor.</p>
<p>Diagnosis of PCT was straightforward in this case with classic histologic and immunohistochemical features. However, renal tumors with a more solid pattern of growth of small round cells may raise the possibility of similar neoplasms in the differential diagnosis. These include primitive neuroectodermal tumors, neuroblastoma, and small cell carcinoma. Primitive neuroectodermal tumors can demonstrate overlapping morphological features, albeit they have more of a monotonous proliferation of small rounds in sheets. They are characteristically positive for CD99 and EWS-FLI1 fusion transcript, and are usually negative for synaptophysin and chromogranin, unlike renal carcinoid tumors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1066896912438588">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1066896912438588">13</xref></sup> Intrarenal neuroblastomas are very rare, usually occur in children, and many demonstrate a fibrillary background with Homer-Wright rosettes. Small cell carcinomas are poorly differentiated tumors with marked nuclear atypia, numerous mitoses, and prominent areas of tumor necrosis and/or apoptosis.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we describe the clinical, histomorphological, immunohistochemical, and genetic features of a previously undescribed case of concurrent chRCC and primary renal carcinoid tumors. The cell of origin for chRCC is the intercalated cells of the distal collecting ducts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1066896912438588">2</xref></sup> and that of renal carcinoids is still unclear; proposed theories of cell of origin for PCT of kidney include origin from (<italic>a</italic>) focus of neural crest cells entrapped in the metanephros, (<italic>b</italic>) hyperplasia of preexisting neuroendocrine cells within a teratomatous epithelium, and (<italic>c</italic>) neuroendocrine differentiation of a totipotent cell.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1066896912438588">13</xref></sup> Since metastatic tumors to the kidney are relatively more common, it is important to rule out this possibility before considering a primary renal carcinoid. Also, it is important to be aware of the fact that despite large tumor size and tendency for metastasis of renal carcinoids, patients with PCT have a relatively less aggressive clinical course than expected from the stage of disease.</p>
