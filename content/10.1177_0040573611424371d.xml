<p><italic>Let the Bones Dance: Embodiment and the Body of Christ</italic></p>
<p>Marcia W. Mount Shoop</p>
<p>Louisville: Westminster John Knox, 2011. 189 pp. $30.00</p>
<p>This is a bold and beautiful book, offering a creative constructive theology, a pointed critique of the mainline Protestant church and its practices, and a loving call for the church to embody Christ more fully. Marcia Mount Shoop, theologian-in-residence at University Presbyterian Church in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, locates in the contemporary Protestant church a profound discomfort with and suspicion of the body that “forms practitioners of this faith in dis-ease” (2). This “disease” alienates us from our true nature and from the incarnate God and is evident in the Church’s disembodied worship practices. In light of these distortions, Mount Shoop asks and answers the question, “What if we brought our bodies with us to church?” (162).</p>
<p>Chapter 1 grounds the book as a whole through a discussion of feeling and embodiment. Using Schleiermacher and Whitehead as starting-points, Mount Shoop develops a two fold understanding of feeling. First, feeling is “a physical mode of experience that grounds, conditions, and gives life to all of our experience” (12). Feeling is prior to consciousness, as the “primal” mode of human experience, and it is beyond consciousness, as an immediate prehension of experience that exists beyond our abilities to bring it into conscious thought. As such, feeling “speaks” through our bodies (bodily memory and hysterical symptoms are two modes of “body language” that Mount Shoop considers). Second, feeling is the means of redemption, especially the redemption of bodies, in three ways. (1) Feeling liberates us from a narrow view of independent, isolated subjectivity, replacing it with a robust sense of our “cellular” relationality with all that is. (2) Feeling enables healing, “re-membering” bodies that are harmed. (3) Finally, feeling restores the worth and promise of the body by decentering consciousness and embracing the body’s wisdom. This explicitly philosophical chapter may be the least accessible, especially for readers who are unfamiliar with Mount Shoop’s sources.</p>
<p>In chapters 2–4, Mount Shoop considers particular embodied experiences that give expression to our general embodied condition. Chapter 2 considers the tragic nature of bodily reality through the trauma of rape, which tears at the fragile tissues of body, subjectivity, and consciousness. This tearing reveals the tragedy inherent in existence and enables a closer attention to loss and harm. In Chapter 3, Mount Shoop considers pregnancy as an embodied experience that reveals that “relationality is the poetics of our cellular heritage” (90). Chapter 4 explores motherhood as an embodied experience of ambiguity. Maternal bodies, relationships, and subjectivity reveal various levels of ambiguity in the bodily reality of motherhood, enabling us to accept and even embrace uncertainty and flux as inherent features of embodied life.</p>
<p>The final section of the book considers the “dispositions of redeemed bodies” (10), which attention to tragedy, relationality, and ambiguity can enable, and how embodied worship can give expression to and form these dispositions. Compassion, interdependence, and adventure (particularly as they are embodied in physical practices) are considered in chapter 5. Chapter 6 addresses how the “wounds” of fear and intellectualism inhibit the mainline Church’s embodiment of these dispositions. The final chapter commends embodied practices of confession, Eucharist, and music by which the “re-membered” body of Christ is formed. Here Mount Shoop offers suggestions of ways in which these ecclesial practices may stretch further into embodiment. These suggestions are helpful, but sustained attention to one of these would have helped to enflesh Mount Shoop’s proposals even further.</p>
<p>This is a profound book that reflects a deep scholarly and pastoral wisdom. The rooting of our humanity and our relatedness to God in a capacity that is beyond reason places Mount Shoop fruitfully in the company of central figures in classical Christianity. Insisting on the embodied nature of that capacity is a refreshing and inspired constructive theological move in its redemption of the body from ecclesial denigration and in its straightforward acknowledgement of the body’s centrality to all human experience. Her categories of feeling and embodiment enable Mount Shoop to make what she calls “modestly universal” (9) claims about human existence; the inherent fluidity of those categories allows a real commonality that eschews any notion of fixed essence. Finally, Mount Shoop is a gifted writer, whose very prose is immersed in a delighted bodiliness. Weaving Scripture, journal entries, and poetry with the theological argument, her writing is itself a healing balm to the wounded spaces we all carry as individuals and as churches, and an exuberant invitation to join redemption’s dance. This is a groundbreaking book that is indispensable reading for theologians, students, and pastors alike.</p>
