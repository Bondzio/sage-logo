<abstract>
<p>Education is a lifelong adventure that is ever-changing and active. Educators continually adapt their practices to meet the needs of an ever-changing population of children flowing through the schools. It is advantageous for teachers to be committed to lifelong learning for their own professional and personal development. As a novice teacher becomes more adept in the profession, new reflections and new perspectives can bring into focus additional ways to improve one’s teaching, classroom demeanor, and the like. Professional interactions with other teachers are important for the music teacher to facilitate a dialogue for growth for the music teacher. Teachers who are learners throughout their careers realize that they are not the source of all knowledge pertaining to music. Good teaching practices are defined according to current educational thought, especially when the educator incorporates learner analysis and reflection into teaching and not only the acquisition of knowledge and imitation.</p>

<p>The marks on the hall closet door recorded the height of the children from kindergarten through their senior year of high school. Visiting grandparents were often heard exclaiming through the years, “Oh, how you have grown!” The visible marks on the door were records of the children’s growth, and the visual observations by grandparents were a recognition that the children had changed in appearance since the grandparents’ last visit. Growth as a professional music educator is not recorded by marks on a door, nor can the casual observer look at a music educator after a particular professional growth experience and exclaim, “Oh, how you have grown!” Growth in a professional music educator is usually measured in the results brought forth in the classroom with the students. This article will show various ways that music educators can experience professional growth activities that feed their professional selves and benefit their students.</p>
<sec id="section1-1048371311435274">
<title>Preservice Teachers and the Undergraduate Program</title>
<p>Preservice teachers experience growth through their college methods courses, various practicum experiences, and student teaching. As new teachers establish themselves in their careers and schools, they develop into more mature educators. It might seem unrealistic for new teachers to take advantage of professional growth opportunities, since they have recently completed 4 or 5 years of undergraduate education. Just as a young child does not stop growing in the early years, novice teachers will find that professional growth is possible and necessary.</p>
<p>Experienced teachers play an important role in modeling how a person grows as a professional music educator. At one time, these veteran teachers were themselves the preservice teachers and the new teachers. How did these veteran teachers become the master teachers they are today? They grew through the years, integrating ideas into their teaching that they learned along the way. Growth prevents stagnation and opens doors of renewal and opportunity throughout a teacher’s career.</p>
<p>It would be naive to assume that all experienced teachers are master teachers and that all mentors are good mentors. Although there are those who believe master teacher awards and years of service make an educator a master teacher, I would propose that the definition of a master teacher is based on intangible qualities. Among those intangible qualities would be mastery of classroom management, exceptional communication skills, putting students first, and holding high expectations of themselves and their students. True master teachers incessantly pursue opportunities to improve themselves as professional educators.</p>
<p>As undergraduate music education majors plot a route through courses in music, education, and teaching methods, they might wonder what connection this program will have with the professional person that they will become in a few short years. Undergraduate music education programs seek to relate the content of the courses offered to the so-called real world of the classroom, not only preparing preservice educators for the day-to-day activities of a teaching job but also imparting intangible understandings of life as an educator.</p>
<p>Collegiate music teacher education programs attempt to provide students with a variety of experiences from which they can formulate their own understandings of music, education, and music education. With appropriate guidance, prospective teachers learn how practice arises from theory, belief, and educational philosophy. An underlying connection should exist among the undergraduate music education courses in the best-case scenario, so that there is a focus on authentic musical practice and authentic music learning process and on the understandings that underlie and facilitate the practice and process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1048371311435274">Wiggins, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Jean Lave, a social anthropologist and social learning theorist, along with Etienne Wenger, an educational theorist and practitioner, developed the principle of legitimate peripheral participation, which is the key principle behind a learning theory titled <italic>situated learning</italic>. Lave and Wenger based their theory on case studies of how novices gain knowledge in various occupational groups that are not customarily set apart by formal instruction. Lave and Wenger propose that legitimate peripheral participation is the key. The case studies included traditional midwives in Yucatan, tailors in Liberia, butchers in supermarkets, and quartermasters in the U.S. Marine Corps.</p>
<p>Using the theory of situated learning, the idea of apprenticeship for preservice music teachers takes on a new appearance. Such an apprenticeship could be in the form of a practicum experience or student teaching. Teacher preparation that includes a significant amount of field-based experiences, especially in the early stages of learning how to teach, can pay great dividends for the undergraduate student. It should be noted, however, that there is no magical formula that can guarantee success for every undergraduate student. Situated learning consists of access to exemplars of music-teaching practice, engagement in productive music-teaching activities, and collaborative reflection. The idea is not that the preservice teachers are to perfectly replicate the teaching style and practices of the experienced teachers; rather, preservice teachers are to take what they have learned and transform it for use in their own classrooms. Each preservice teacher is unique in personality and teacher traits. As a result, preservice teachers’ success will depend on their ability to incorporate and adapt the experiences of situated learning into their own teaching.</p>
<p>By maintaining the status quo of music education and the education of future music educators, a connection with the changes that are occurring in education will not be preserved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1048371311435274">Conkling, 2007</xref>). To teach in the manner we were taught does not achieve adequate results because our teachers taught us according to what worked for that time and place in history. It takes effort to change the status quo, even as it takes determination to advance oneself toward becoming a master educator.</p>
<p>Imagine this scenario: Tom, a freshman music education major, wishes to teach high school choir because he had a charismatic high school choral director. Julie, another undergraduate student, sees herself teaching middle school band, inspired by the teacher she had at that level. A third student, Noah, has a knack for working with young children, and he desires to be an elementary music teacher. Do these students and others like them have what it takes to be a professional educator? To be effective as professionals, future music educators should examine their beliefs about why they wish to become music teachers. Do they only want to be like the music teacher they had in elementary school, middle school, or high school? Most often, prospective teachers had a model teacher in their earlier years who encouraged them to become music educators some day, growing into a profession and perhaps becoming model teachers themselves.</p>
<p>For Tom and Julie, modeling themselves after the teachers they revered is not inherently bad. Noah’s ability to work with young children is laudable, and he is aware that there is more that he must learn to be an elementary general music teacher. Tom and Julie are individuals and bring their own abilities to their undergraduate teacher programs. For Tom and Julie to think that they will be exactly like their exemplars is not practical. Tom and Julie will develop their own individual styles of teaching, flourishing in their respective fields.</p>
<p>During the undergraduate years, these individuals will discover the reasons why they want to become music teachers and whether or not they have the abilities to perform as a professional educator. Through undergraduate classes, various teaching practices, and student teaching, these future educators will have opportunities to uncover their beliefs, examine them, reflect on them, and refine them. Venturing further into their learning and challenging what they have done to evaluate its worthiness for continued practice will assist undergraduate students and experienced teachers in keeping their teaching fresh and current (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1048371311435274">Thompson, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Music educators are not shaped simply in the undergraduate institution. The successful music educator will be consistent in his or her execution of excellence. Since knowledge is the cornerstone of excellence and, ultimately, success, it is befitting that the music educator be in search of new knowledge at all times. Education for the music educator does not end when the undergraduate degree is granted; rather, lifelong learning should be a major building block in constructing the educator’s career.</p>
<p>Lifelong learning can be fostered through involvement in organizations that exist for undergraduate music students, such as the collegiate branch of the National Association for Music Education (NAfME) and the American Choral Directors Association, and involvement in music societies such as Sigma Alpha Iota, Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia, Kappa Kappa Psi, and Tau Beta Sigma. Involvement in professional organizations at the collegiate level sets a standard to be followed by undergraduate students that can carry over into their professional careers. Additionally, colleges and universities are finding new ways to meet the development of preservice music educators through new course offerings that are prototypical and yet malleable, shaping future educators for lifelong learning.</p>

<title>Moving Into the Profession</title>
<p>Kayla, a young teacher in her first year as a high school choral director, must deal with school district “red tape” so that she can order new music for her choirs. Rob, a new middle school band director, does not know what to do with his unruly seventh-grade trumpet players. Melissa, an elementary music teacher, does not know how much money she should really spend for new Orff instruments for her classroom. As these individuals move from the safe boundaries of their undergraduate institutions into the field as professionals, they are often overwhelmed by the numerous tasks and requirements of being professional educators. Faced with budgets, classroom management, selecting repertoire, writing lesson plans, designing classroom procedures and routines, and a plethora of other tasks, a question that might come to mind in many new teachers is, “Was I supposed to learn this in college?”</p>
<p>Given that teaching can have a steep learning curve, new music educators might feel that they were not served well by their college education. Although faulting the undergraduate institution for their lack of confidence and feelings of unpreparedness might be a natural response, these novice educators will learn quickly that the first year of teaching can be the most intense year of all. Music has its own peculiar nuances in education. Teacher education programs cannot adequately prepare an individual for every situation that will be encountered during a career in education. The preparation that music teachers receive during their undergraduate years provides the future educators with a basic set of teacher tools that serve as a foundation on which the teacher’s career may be built. Teaching is an art, and a new teacher will learn the finer details in time through experience. New teachers customarily have a time of adjustment while they learn what is necessary to perform as a professional educator.</p>
<p>Some teachers new to the profession discover that they are not well matched for teaching and subsequently leave the profession within the first few years. Leaving the profession or changing school districts are the two most common ways in which new educators choose to deal with the adjustment to life in the professional world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1048371311435274">Rivkin, Hanushek, &amp; Kain, 2005</xref>). For some, the adjustment to professional life is easier than for others.</p>
<p>Although it might be beneficial to have a checklist of characteristics that are to be developed in order to be a successful music educator, such a list does not exist. The true character of the teacher is discovered through observing him or her in action in the classroom and through conversations wherein the accurate nature of the individual can be disclosed. Administrators and those who are charged with evaluating teachers, student teachers, and students in practicum experiences will realize that dialogue is a valuable tool in appraising the individual.</p>
<p>What kind of abilities should be seen in a new or prospective educator? Several desirable qualities that should be seen in a new or prospective music educator include knowledge of curriculum areas and the learning context, the ability to plan for students’ learning, classroom management, assessment and evaluation of students’ learning, evaluation of one’s own teaching, and professional relationships and qualities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1048371311435274">Moore, 1996</xref>). Teaching characteristics such as these cannot be adequately developed solely in music education methods courses because of time constraints. Growth in these areas takes place not only through music education methods courses but also through life experiences that an individual teacher accumulates. The efforts put forth by the new teacher toward improving their teaching characteristics and teaching skills will accrue dividends toward becoming a more established music educator on their way toward becoming a master teacher. A few infrequent deposits into the teacher’s bank of tools and repertory of skills will not accrue the dividends that could occur with systematic work in the journey toward mastery.</p>
<p>Attending conferences sponsored by professional organizations is a good starting point and can provide necessary networking opportunities for the novice teacher. Engaging in reflective practice along with connecting with an informed mentor can prove helpful in refining teaching skills, classroom management, and lesson preparation and delivery, among others. When teachers mentor one another, the mentor and the mentee benefit from the exchange of ideas and information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1048371311435274">Haack, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1048371311435274">Tillman, 2003</xref>). Connecting with other teachers, especially other music teachers, is mutually beneficial. For those music teachers separated by distance from other music teachers, the use of various social networking tools, including Skype and Facebook, can develop virtual networks for professional interaction.</p>

<title>The Definition of a Music Educator</title>
<p>The impact of self-efficacy on teaching style plays a definitive role in the shaping of a music educator. Self-efficacy deals with educators’ concept of their own competence rather than how truly competent they are at teaching. It refers to people’s beliefs about their abilities to achieve in a specific domain. It can be explained this way:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Self-efficacy has to do with self-perception of competence rather than actual level of competence. This is an important distinction, because people regularly overestimate or underestimate their actual abilities, and these estimations may have consequences for the courses of action they choose to pursue or the effort they exert in those pursuits. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1048371311435274">Tschannen-Moran, Hoy, &amp; Hoy, 1998</xref>, p. 211)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Self-perceptions of teacher efficacy will ultimately influence student performance and the school’s impact to serve its students. These self-perceptions, either high or low, will yield either positive or negative long-term results, depending on the individual teacher’s self-perception.</p>
<p>James, a first-year choir director in a moderate-sized school district, always thought of himself as the embodiment of good choral pedagogy—fully versed in choral methodology, possessing a great baritone voice, and able to control any classroom situation. James’s confident presence in front of his choral ensembles provided stability and control for his students. Although he was a first-year teacher, many of his students felt that he was more experienced because of the way James presented himself. Although James would be the first to acknowledge he had much to learn during his first year of teaching, his determination to be an exceptional choral teacher charted his course for success.</p>
<p>Individuals occasionally have ambivalent conceptions of themselves as teachers because of lack of feedback, reinforcement, constructive criticism, and correction from cooperating teachers, administrators, and mentors. Some individuals hesitate to deviate from their ingrained teacher behaviors because of previous experiences, fearing that departure from what they see as “normal” might be too far afield. As educators become more discerning in their choices of external models, they will learn to differentiate themselves from the external models that they have absorbed but do not wish to follow any further. Teaching, and the effort to improve it, involves the whole person (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1048371311435274">Andrews, 1978</xref>). When teachers are able to appropriately identify their strengths and weaknesses, they can maximize their effectiveness through their strengths, while taking proper measures to improve their weaknesses. Growth is a key to flourishing.</p>
<p>Teachers who are also learners realize that they are not the source of all knowledge pertaining to music. Good teaching practices are defined according to current educational thought, especially when the educator incorporates learner analysis and reflection into teaching and not only acquisition of knowledge and imitation. John Dewey, an American philosopher, psychologist, and educational reformer, proposed the idea of <italic>flexible purposing</italic> that still has implications for today’s music educators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1048371311435274">Dewey, 1938/1963</xref>). Flexible purposing allows the teacher to know when to explore new interactions and when to shift strategies that will still accomplish the overall goal. Elliot <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1048371311435274">Eisner (2004)</xref> explained flexible purposing this way:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Flexible purposing is opportunistic; it capitalizes on the emergent features appearing within a field of relationships. It is not rigidly attached to predefined aims when the possibilities of better ones emerge. The kind of thinking that flexible purposing requires thrives best in an environment in which the rigid adherence to a plan is not a necessity. (p. 6)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Rigid adherence to a preconceived plan or to a prejudicial view of what a teacher is and does is not healthy for the profession. Teaching with the assistance of record players and filmstrip projectors worked in the past, while teaching with mp3 players, YouTube videos, and interactive video is currently more commonplace. Our educational practices change in relation to the fluctuations in our culture and society. Master teachers will desire to stay current with cultural and societal fluctuations and adapt their teaching style and presentation accordingly. Specific kinds of professional growth opportunities that could be beneficial would include training in Orff Schulwerk and the Kodály method for general music specialists, choral music techniques for band teachers who find themselves teaching choral music, and instrumental music techniques for choral teachers who find themselves teaching band, in addition to education in current technology for use in the music classroom.</p>
<p>Beyond simply attending state music educators annual conferences, experienced music educators may well share their expertise by presenting at a music educators conference or by leading a workshop at the local level. Preparing for a conference or workshop presentation can be a significant professional boost. Involvement with specialty-specific organizations, such as the American Orff Schulwerk Association and the Organization of American Kodály Educators, can bring new insights to the music educator. When music teachers are able to observe clinicians or other music teachers, ideas may be gleaned for use with students back home. The sharing of “things that work” is helpful for conference and workshop presenters and attendees alike. Numerous teachers attend workshops or conferences looking for ways to improve their instructional techniques.</p>
<p>Music specialists are usually isolated in what they do, and they are often unable to have a constant conversation with the teacher next door about what they are doing. Networking with colleagues at conferences and workshops and at the local level remains an important element for music educators beyond their novice years. Involvement in the profession is key to staying invigorated in teaching. It is necessary to make connections with other people in order to have resources beyond oneself. As mentioned earlier, social media have made it easier for people to connect across the miles. Connecting with nonmusic educators is also helpful in alleviating the isolation felt by many music educators in rural areas.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1048371311435274">
<title>The Distinct Role of Veteran Educators</title>
<p>Experienced teachers are often asked to serve as mentors for new teachers in their building or district or as supervisors of student teachers and music education practicum students. In a best-case scenario, using the talents and skills of experienced master teachers for the good of others is necessary for teacher retention and to promote the continuance of the profession of music education. Regrettably, there are mentor teachers who assume the title of mentor only because they are expected to fulfill that role in their school and not because they are gifted master teachers. Healthy mentoring is a process whereby an experienced master teacher is able to assist preservice and new teachers toward professional growth. Although preservice teachers and teachers new to the field oftentimes think that their undergraduate degree is (or will be) the final seal of approval on their profession, these novice educators ought to be challenged to think about expanded ways of engaging in music and in pedagogy beyond the undergraduate degree.</p>
<p>By encouraging preservice teachers to go beyond their initial ideas about teaching and learning in music, mentors will not only transmit their knowledge to the mentee, they will also challenge the prospective teacher to challenge what has been done in music education and to find better ways of teaching and learning. It takes a great deal of courage for a teacher to work at the edge of their comfort zone. The educational theorist and arts philosopher Elliot <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1048371311435274">Eisner (2005)</xref> describes this as seeing one’s work “as temporary experimental accomplishments, tentative resting places subject to further change.” (p. 6) Working in this manner exposes teachers and demonstrates their vulnerability as they stretch for a deeper way of engaging in teaching. The prospective or new teacher is encouraged to strive to improve the teaching profession via various professional growth opportunities and to take the initiative in seeking such opportunities as an attendee or as a presenter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1048371311435274">Campbell &amp; Brummett, 2007</xref>). The astute veteran teacher-mentor will be active in attending conferences and serving as a presenter, thereby giving a positive example for the mentee to follow.</p>
<p>The perceptive music educator keeps up with the changing musical culture in society to make teaching and learning relevant to today’s culture. Music education has faced challenges from various factors, including budget cuts and the emphasis placed on reading and mathematics testing through various legislation and government actions. Music educators also perform the role of their programs’ advocates as they promote their programs and demonstrate the relevancy of their programs to the public.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there are teachers who continue to teach in the manner they were taught. Since music is experienced and made in somewhat different ways than in the past, some teachers feel threatened because they and their curricula have not kept pace with the changing times. Professional growth and development for music educators can be employed to assist teachers in the field so that they may keep current with trends in music education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1048371311435274">Kratus, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Although teaching will be difficult from time to time, the well-informed music educator will assume responsibility for his or her own success. Although the music educator might be the only music educator in the district, there are other educators in the school and in the district who play significant roles in the educational endeavors of the schools. Assistance can be sought from veteran teachers in all disciplines. Mentoring a novice teacher or a student teacher requires veteran teachers to know what works in a classroom, thereby requiring the mentor to reexamine the reasoning behind what is taught or done. Reading research-based articles regarding current practices in music education can be helpful in shaping the music educator’s knowledge of best practices.</p>
<p>Keeping current with best practices can assist music specialists in staying invigorated in their teaching. Specifically in the Midwest, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1048371311435274">Burrack and Bazan (2010)</xref> noted comments from 46 Nebraska music teachers regarding the areas of professional development they most desired, providing ideas for future examination on professional development. Topics suggested for professional development included activities for singing in tune for young children, arranging, assessment, band techniques, classroom methodology, current trends and practices, discipline (classroom management), elementary rhythm and note-naming games, history training, instrumental conducting, movement within the vocal rehearsal, orchestral conducting, physiology of the voice, preparing music without an accompanist, private voice instruction techniques, repertoire suggestions, string pedagogy, student engagement, student recruitment and retention, swing choir ideas, teaching the current curriculum in less time, technology, vocal development at various levels, vocal warm-up activities, vocal pedagogy, woodwinds pedagogy, and working with beginners in instrumental music. Practicing music educators could develop professional development topics such as these for local school district workshops or music education conferences. It would be fitting for organizers of workshop and conference organizers to offer sessions aligned with areas of professional development most desired by music educators in order to enrich these areas.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1048371311435274">
<title>The Value of Experience</title>
<p>There is no “easy” button that can be pressed at the onset of the teaching career that will make for smooth sailing throughout a person’s years of teaching. Effective teaching, curriculum writing, and program development are not accidental. Having 25 years of experience is a great milestone, especially when the 25 years are years of varied experiences and determined efforts accomplished through planning, creativity, and motivation of self and students. Conversely, there are teachers who have been teaching 25 years, but, in effect, they have repeated the same year 25 times. This lack of growth is unfortunate for them but certainly more so for their students.</p>
<p>Veteran teachers, new teachers, and preservice teachers who persistently seek to grow as educators will reap many benefits, as will their students. Positive attitudes and a willingness to embrace new ideas and methods will afford great dividends in professional growth to teachers of all ages. Teachers who aspire to be the kind of teacher they would want to emulate will evolve into exemplars. Preservice teachers who see college graduation as a true commencement, the beginning of a challenging yet rewarding career as a music educator. They will be the teachers of the future who will continue to grow with their students and will make a lasting impact on their students, on their communities, and on the honorable profession of education.</p>
