<title>Objective</title>
<p>As skin cancer incidence increases, research has focused on novel chemopreventive agents that inhibit tumor formation. In prior experimentation, curcumin, a naturally occurring food substance and anticarcinogenic agent, inhibited cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma xenograft growth. We hypothesize curcumin will inhibit UVB radiation–induced skin cancer growth in mice, approximating a human chemopreventive model.</p>

<title>Subjects and Methods</title>
<p>SKH-1 mice were pretreated with oral or topical curcumin or oral or topical control (n = 11/group) for 14 days. Mice received UVB radiation 3 times weekly for 24 weeks or were not radiated. Number of tumors formed and time to tumor onset for each mouse were recorded through tumor harvest after week 24. Tumor multiplicity and time to tumor onset were compared.</p>

<sec id="section5-0194599813476845">
<title>Results</title>
<p>Time to tumor onset was significantly shorter in control mice compared to mice receiving either oral (<italic>P</italic> = .025) or topical (<italic>P</italic> = .015) curcumin. A significant difference in the average number of tumors formed per mouse was seen, as fewer tumors were formed in the oral curcumin (<italic>P</italic> = .01) and topical curcumin (<italic>P</italic> = .01) groups, compared with respective controls. No significant difference in average number of tumors per mouse was seen between oral and topical curcumin (<italic>P</italic> = .56), suggesting that both routes were equally effective.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Curcumin appears to inhibit skin cancer formation and prolong time to tumor onset when administered by either an oral or topical route. These data suggest that curcumin may have chemopreventive potential against skin cancer, necessitating future experimentation with human subjects.</p>

<p>Nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC) is the most common human malignancy, affecting nearly 1 in 5 Americans in a lifetime.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599813476845">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599813476845">2</xref></sup> Despite aggressive public awareness campaigns to protect against sun damage, incidence has doubled since previous estimates in 1994, and the cost burden for treatment of NMSC approaches $1 billion annually.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599813476845">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599813476845">4</xref></sup> Although there are several known risk factors that contribute to the development of NMSC, the cumulative effect of chronic exposure to UV radiation remains the most important etiologic factor.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599813476845">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0194599813476845">6</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Although a number of medical and surgical therapies exist, formal surgical excision of nonmelanoma skin cancers is considered the most effective treatment modality.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599813476845">1</xref></sup> Given the increasing morbidity, incidence, and cost, research has been focused on exploring novel chemopreventive agents that inhibit nonmelanoma skin cancer formation and progression. A number of agents have been explored, including oral and topical retinoids,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0194599813476845">7</xref></sup> lycopene, selenium, myricetin, beta-carotenes, and ginger. However, clinical trials have been limited and have shown mixed results.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0194599813476845">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0194599813476845"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0194599813476845">9</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Curcumin, a naturally occurring bioactive food substance, has gained particular attention as a promising anticarcinogenic agent in a variety of malignancies including gastrointestinal, hematologic, pancreatic, and oral cancer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0194599813476845">10</xref></sup> The pharmacologically active constituent of turmeric, curcumin has been widely investigated as a potent antiinflammatory, antibacterial, antioxidant, and cardioprotective agent.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0194599813476845">10</xref></sup> Phase I clinical trials have demonstrated its safety and nontoxicity in humans at biologically effective doses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0194599813476845">11</xref></sup> More recently, curcumin has been studied as a chemopreventive agent in skin carcinogenesis. In our prior experimentation, we subcutaneously injected SCID mice with xenografts composed of SRB12-p9 skin SCCa cells and demonstrated that curcumin administered by oral gavage significantly inhibited tumor growth compared to mice receiving an oral control.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0194599813476845">12</xref></sup> Despite these findings, many researchers have questioned its clinical efficacy due to its poor bioavailability attributable to reduced gastrointestinal absorption and rapid elimination from the body.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0194599813476845">13</xref></sup> Therefore, topical application of curcumin has been investigated, using various skin preparations, to promote prolonged contact and bioavailability at the target site.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0194599813476845">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0194599813476845">15</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>While the anticarcinogenic effects of curcumin in our xenograft tumor model are significant, little data exist on curcumin’s effect on skin cancer arising de novo from exposure to chronic UV radiation. As UV radiation exposure is the most well-established etiologic factor in development of nonmelanoma skin cancer in humans, exploring curcumin’s effect on skin tumorigenesis arising from UV exposure would more closely approximate a human chemopreventive model. A variety of naturally occurring bioactive agents have been studied in their ability to inhibit skin carcinogenesis using well-established protocols that expose SKH-1 hairless mice to UV radiation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0194599813476845">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0194599813476845"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0194599813476845"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0194599813476845">19</xref></sup> Therefore, we wanted to determine if curcumin has inhibitory effects on formation of skin cancers arising de novo from chronic exposure to UV radiation using a similar in vivo murine model. We hypothesized that both oral and topical curcumin will inhibit UVB radiation–induced skin cancer growth in SKH-1 mice, more closely approximating a human chemopreventive model.</p>

<title>Curcumin</title>
<p>Curcumin paste was prepared by suspending 15 mg Curcumin (C3) Complex powder (Sabinsa Corp, East Windsor, New Jersey) in 100 μl corn oil (vehicle) at a dose of 15 mg/100 μl for daily oral gavage feeding. For topical delivery, curcumin was prepared as a 15 mg/100 μL vanishing cream (containing vanishing cream base, xanthum gum powder, distilled water, sorbic acid, glycerin, and curcumin) provided by Doug Boudreaux’s Compounding Pharmacy (Shreveport, Louisiana). The control vehicle cream (containing vanishing cream base, xanthum gum powder, distilled water, sorbic acid, and glycerin) was also provided by the same pharmacy.</p>

<title>UV Phototherapy</title>
<p>The F72T12 100W/12 Phillips UVB Broadband TL (Philips Electronics, Andover, Massachusetts) was used to administer selective broadband UVB radiation to the mice. The UVB Broadband TL lamp emits radiation in the “B” bandwidth of the UV spectrum (290-315 nm) and was therefore suitable for selective UVB phototherapy in our photocarcinogenesis model. Light intensity was verified with a UV meter (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.grlabs.com">www.grlabs.com</ext-link>, Model 100) with UVB narrow band filter.</p>

<title>UV Radiation–Induced Skin Carcinogenesis Study</title>
<p>Eighty-eight SKH-1 hairless mice used in the study were housed in a barrier facility, given a normal diet ad lib, and maintained as formally approved by Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center-Shreveport (LSUHSC) Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee in accordance with NIH guidelines. SKH-1 mice used in the experiment were divided into 8 groups of 11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0194599813476845"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref>).</p>

<p>All UVB-radiated mice (groups 2, 4, 6, and 8) were irradiated daily (days 1-10) with UVB (180 mJ/cm<sup>2</sup>) for a 1-hour period for a total of 10 days, representing the tumor initiation stage. A 1-week “rest” period was then implemented, when mice in the UVB-radiated group did not receive UVB irradiation (days 11-17). Following the rest period, these mice were irradiated with the same dose of UVB radiation 3 times/week for 1 hour each period, representing the tumor promotion stage, for a total of 24 weeks (day 17-week 24) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0194599813476845"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref>). This SKH-1 mouse skin UV radiation–induced carcinogenesis model is well established in prior experimentation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0194599813476845">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0194599813476845"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0194599813476845"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0194599813476845">19</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Mice in the control group (group 1) received the oral control vehicle and did not receive any UVB radiation. Group 2 mice received the oral control vehicle and received UVB irradiation. Group 3 mice received a daily topical control vehicle cream applied to the back and flanks and did not receive UVB irradiation. Mice in group 4 received the topical control cream in addition to UVB irradiation. Curcumin (15 mg) was administered by daily oral gavage to mice in group 5, however these mice were not exposed to UVB radiation. Mice in group 6 received oral curcumin (15 mg) and underwent UVB irradiation. Curcumin paste (15 mg/100 μL) was administered to mice back and flanks in group 7 but received no UVB radiation. Mice in group 8 received topical curcumin and received UVB irradiation. Mice receiving oral curcumin (groups 5 and 6) and topical curcumin (groups 7 and 8) began receiving their curcumin treatments 14 days prior to initiation of the UVB irradiation (days –14 to 0) and continued receiving daily oral or topical curcumin through the completion of the experiment (day 0-week 24).</p>
<p>Time to first tumor onset for each mouse was measured, and the number of tumors formed on each mouse was recorded at the end of the experiment (week 24), at which time tumors were harvested.

<title>Curcumin Significantly Decreases Tumor Multiplicity in UV-Radiated Mice</title>
<p>The number of tumors formed on each mouse back and flank was noted daily throughout the experiment. At the end of week 24, prior to tumor harvest, the total number of tumors formed on each mouse was recorded. A significant difference in the average number of tumors formed per mouse was seen, as fewer tumors were formed in the oral curcumin (<italic>P</italic> = .01) and topical curcumin (<italic>P</italic> = .01) groups, compared with their respective controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0194599813476845"><bold>Figure 3</bold></xref>). Weights remained stable in both control and curcumin-treated mice that survived through tumor harvesting at the end of week 24, suggesting no toxicity from curcumin treatment. Upon tumor harvest, oral control mice had markedly irregular and invasive flank and back tumors, while curcumin-treated mice had smaller and well-confined tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0194599813476845"><bold>Figure 4A</bold></xref>). Similarly, topical control mice had numerous bulky and irregular tumors compared to the topical curcumin-treated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0194599813476845"><bold>Figure 4B</bold></xref>). We observed that topical control mice appeared to have significantly more widespread tumor formation than the oral control mice. The actual number of tumors formed was similar between oral and topical control groups. Despite the significant difference between control and curcumin treatment groups, no significant difference in average number of tumors formed per mouse was seen between oral and topical curcumin (<italic>P</italic> = .56), suggesting that both routes were equally effective at inhibiting tumor formation.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Given the increasing incidence of nonmelanoma skin cancer, the National Cancer Institute has sponsored a number of clinical trials that focus on research and development of chemopreventive agents that inhibit formation and progression of skin malignancy after exposure to UV radiation has already occurred.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0194599813476845">8</xref></sup> Both nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs and oral retinoids have been explored in their ability to decrease the risk of actinic keratosis and SCCa with positive results. However, regular use of these agents is required, and chronic use has been associated with hepatotoxicity, renal toxicity, teratogenicity, hyperlipidemia, and acute pancreatitis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0194599813476845">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0194599813476845">20</xref></sup> More recently, efforts have been focused on naturally occurring phytochemical agents, including flavanoids and polyphenols. The green tea polyphenol (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) has been shown to protect against UVB-induced carcinogenesis in an animal model, however results have been limited.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0194599813476845">16</xref></sup> Grape seed extract, pomegranate, and silymarin have also demonstrated chemopreventive effects in murine models using both oral and topical formulations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0194599813476845">8</xref></sup> Curcumin has also been explored as a chemopreventive agent and is widely known for its antioxidant, antiinflammatory, and cardioprotective effects. As a potential anticarcinogenic agent, it has shown chemopreventive effects in gastrointestinal, hepatic, endocrine, and head and neck malignancies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0194599813476845">10</xref></sup> Phase I trials have demonstrated its safety to humans at therapeutic doses that would be administered when used as a preventive agent.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0194599813476845">11</xref></sup> Curcumin’s effect on the skin has also been studied in its ability to promote collagen deposition, improve wound healing, and treat chronic skin disorders.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0194599813476845">10</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Curcumin’s potential as a chemopreventive agent in skin carcinogenesis has been investigated, demonstrating promising results in animal models. Huang et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0194599813476845">21</xref></sup> described curcumin’s ability to inhibit 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-induced skin cancers in mice and alter arachadonic acid metabolism in skin. Similarly, Limtrakul et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0194599813476845">22</xref></sup> demonstrated inhibition of tumor volume and multiplicity in Swiss albino mice that had curcumin added to their daily diet, when tumors were induced by DMBA. In our prior experimentation, we treated immunodeficient (SCID) mice with 15 mg oral curcumin daily after injecting xenografts of cutaneous SCCa into mouse flank skin and found significantly decreased tumor volume and growth rate in mice treated with curcumin compared to controls.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0194599813476845">12</xref></sup> Dujic et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0194599813476845">23</xref></sup> also studied curcumin’s effect on human epithelial carcinoma xenograft tumor growth in nude mice and demonstrated significant inhibition of tumor formation in mice treated with curcumin and visible light. These studies support curcumin as a promising chemopreventive in cutaneous malignancy; however, many researchers question curcumin’s bioavailability at target tissues when administered orally, given its rapid degradation in the gut, rate of metabolism, and subsequent elimination from the body.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0194599813476845">13</xref></sup> Therefore, several investigators have experimented with topical curcumin formulations, hoping to prolong contact of curcumin with the skin. Recently, Lin et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0194599813476845">14</xref></sup> applied a topical formulation of dibenzoylmethane (DBM), a curcumin structural analogue, to TPA-induced skin tumors in mice and found inhibition of tumor promotion and inflammation using this model. Agrawal et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0194599813476845">15</xref></sup> explored an encapsulated preparation of topical curcumin applied daily to mouse skin and found this formulation was effective at preventing skin lesion development and inflammatory changes.</p>
<p>While these studies demonstrate curcumin’s inhibitory effect on cutaneous tumor xenografts and chemically induced skin lesions, little data exist on curcumin’s ability to inhibit skin cancer formation and progression when tumors arise de novo through chronic exposure to UV radiation alone. As cumulative exposure to UV radiation is the most well-established and important etiologic factor in the development of nonmelanoma skin cancer in humans, we wished to more closely approximate human skin cancer development by using a photocarcinogenesis model.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0194599813476845">17</xref></sup> In this study, we sought to explore curcumin’s effect on tumor formation and multiplicity in mice exposed to chronic UVB radiation. In order to address bioavailability concerns, we treated mice with either oral or topical curcumin and hypothesized that both routes of administration would inhibit tumorigenesis similar to our prior SCCa xenograft study. Single daily exposure of SKH-1 hairless mice to UVB radiation is a well-accepted photocarcinogenesis model that has been employed in a number of studies that have sought to examine the chemopreventive potential of a variety of polyphenolic, botanical, and flavinoid compounds. Mittal et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0194599813476845">16</xref></sup> demonstrated that SKH-1 mice treated with topical EGCG, the polyphenolic component of green tea, had delayed tumor onset, decreased tumor multiplicity, and a reduced transformation rate of papillomas to carcinomas. Using a similar photocarcinogenesis model, Katiyar et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0194599813476845">17</xref></sup> treated SKH-1 mice with silymarin, a flavinoid substance derived from milk thistle, and exposed mice to UVB radiation, noting a significant decrease in tumor incidence, multiplicity, and volume in the treatment group. Other bioactive substances, including pomegranate extract, <italic>Calluna vulgaris</italic>, and grape seed extracts, have been tested using a similar protocol.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0194599813476845">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0194599813476845">19</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>In this study, we demonstrate significant inhibition of UVB radiation–induced tumor multiplicity and significantly delayed tumor onset in mice treated with either oral curcumin or topical curcumin compared with their respective controls (UVB-radiated mice receiving either the oral or topical control vehicle). As we hypothesized, there was no significant difference in tumor multiplicity or time to tumor onset between mice treated with oral curcumin and mice receiving topical curcumin, suggesting that both routes are equally effective in inhibiting tumorigenesis. As mice were treated with oral or topical curcumin for 2 weeks prior to UVB exposure, our results suggest that curcumin may have chemopreventive potential in skin carcinogenesis. Curcumin’s inhibitory effect on UVB-induced skin cancer was also recently explored by Tsai et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0194599813476845">24</xref></sup> who observed a significant delay in tumor onset and decreased tumor volume and multiplicity in mice treated with topical curcumin. In contrast to our experiment, however, mice in this study were treated with topical curcumin and exposed to UV radiation only twice weekly with much shorter exposure to UVB radiation (2 min, 40 seconds) over a 20-week period. Additionally, our study varies UVB exposure to mice, beginning with 10 days of daily UVB exposure (tumor initiation phase), followed by chronic exposure to UVB radiation 3 times weekly through week 24 (tumor promotion phase), which is a well-established model for photocarcinogenesis that has been used to test several potential chemopreventive agents.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0194599813476845">17</xref></sup> Tsai et al used curcumin that was solubilized in acetone and applied as a “wet dress.” In our study, a topical curcumin paste was developed by a compounding pharmacy and applied to mouse skin directly. Unlike topical filter application, the curcumin paste we used is suitable for clinical trials and provides for prolonged contact of curcumin with skin, which more realistically models topical application in a human clinical trial. Furthermore, mice in our experiment were pretreated for 2 weeks prior to UVB exposure, thus inhibitory results may reflect a chemopreventive model, whereas mice in the Tsai et al experiment were treated only after UVB exposure had already begun.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0194599813476845">24</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>The intracellular signaling mechanism in which curcumin acts to inhibit carcinogenesis has been studied extensively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0194599813476845">25</xref></sup> A number of key downstream biomarkers in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling have been implicated as potential targets for curcumin. The transcription factor NF-κB and transcription activator AP-1 are both active in promoting tumorigenesis and appear to be suppressed by curcumin in a number of studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0194599813476845">25</xref></sup> Curcumin also blocks tyrosine kinase phosphorylation in the MEK/ERK signaling cascade, an essential mechanism in UV-induced signal transduction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0194599813476845">25</xref></sup> The AKT/MTOR intracellular signaling pathway also appears to play a critical role in the initiation and progression of skin carcinogenesis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0194599813476845">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0194599813476845">27</xref></sup> Although curcumin appears to inhibit a number of signaling moieties, no widely accepted biomarker exists. In the future, we hope to further analyze tumor specimens from this experiment to elucidate curcumin’s intracellular mechanism of action, using immunohistochemistry and western blot analysis. Additionally, given the safety of curcumin in phase I trials, we aim to conduct human clinical trials with oral and topical curcumin formulations in patients who are at particular risk for developing nonmelanoma skin cancer. Immunosuppressed patients are at high risk for multiple facial lesions, aggressive disease, and recurrence, and curcumin may play an important role in helping to prevent and control cutaneous malignancy in these individuals.</p>
<p>This is one of the first studies to demonstrate curcumin’s inhibition of UVB radiation–induced skin cancer in vivo. Although these results are limited to objective measurement of tumor multiplicity and time to tumor onset and do not include an immunohistopathologic analysis of biomarker expression, we believe these data will serve to promote future studies that explore curcumin’s chemopreventive potential in skin carcinogenesis.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Chronic exposure to UV radiation has been implicated as the most important etiologic factor in the development of nonmelanoma skin cancer. Therefore, research has been focused on potential chemopreventive agents that inhibit photocarcinogenesis. Curcumin appears to delay tumor onset and decrease tumor multiplicity, suggesting inhibition of UV radiation–induced skin cancer in vivo. This is one of the first studies to demonstrate curcumin’s inhibitory activity in a purely photocarcinogenesis model. Future studies that explore intracellular signaling mechanisms at which curcumin may act to inhibit skin carcinogenesis are warranted.</p>
