<sec id="sec1-1460408611418766" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Polytrauma can be defined as an injury to two ormore organ systems leading potentially to a life-threatening condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1460408611418766">Edwards et al., 2007</xref>); however, a prospectively validated or consensus definition is lacking within the international trauma community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1460408611418766">Butcher and Balogh, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The management of polytrauma has evolved considerably in the last century, even though itsrational involving a number of steps based on priorities, prompt decisions and consequent actions remains unaltered. Recent developments made in all the disciplines involved in trauma carehave helped to improve the management of thesepatients, with remarkable advances being achieved in pre-hospital care, diagnostics, interventional radiology, surgical and fracture fixation techniques and ventilation strategies as well as rehabilitation and late reconstruction procedures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1460408611418766">Giannoudis, 2009</xref>). Additionally, understanding of the altered physiology and the induced immune-inflammatory response at the molecular level that occur after major trauma is continuously increasing, thus offering potentials for novel pharmacological interventions and minimising the risk of development of post-traumatic complications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1460408611418766">Giannoudis, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The management of multiple injured patients must be initiated at the scene of the accident, since immediate support of vital organ functions is offundamental importance. Prompt and safe transfer of these patients utilising land ambulances and helicopters to a well-organised trauma care system is essential with on-going treatment of haemorrhagic shock and hypoxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1460408611418766">Kauvar et al., 2006</xref>). Even though standardised resuscitation protocols are a key component of any trauma system, the ideal early resuscitation strategy for polytrauma remains a topic of considerable discussion. The concept of ‘permissive hypotension’ for bleeding trauma patients and particularly for patients with blunt trauma or associated head injuries contributes further tothe existing controversy in the field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1460408611418766">Stahel et al., 2009</xref>). New resuscitation strategies havebeen developed, mainly based on experience during military conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan, from which the concept of damage control resuscitation has been derived and evolved. This resuscitation strategy combines the concepts of permissive hypotension and haemostatic resuscitation in association with damage control surgery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1460408611418766">Duchesne and Holcomb, 2009</xref>). Intravenous fluid administration at the scene of the accident is restricted to sufficient small aliquots to maintain a radial pulse with prompt administration of blood products as primary resuscitation fluids in order to treat intrinsic acute traumatic coagulopathy and to prevent dilutional coagulopathy. Increasing evidence has shown that acute early coagulopathy can be triggered by the injury itself and the subsequent release of trauma-associated mediators occurring even prior to emergency room (ER) admission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1460408611418766">Duchesne and Holcomb, 2009</xref>). A retrospective analysis of 8724 patients from the German Trauma Registry revealed that coagulopathy upon ER admission was present in 34.2% of patients, the incidence increasing to more than 70% when more than 4000 mL of i.v. fluids were administered during early resuscitation and the preclinical phase of care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1460408611418766">Maegele et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>It has been suggested that artificial blood substitutes as alternative to red blood cells may be of value in resuscitation in pre-hospital trauma care, military trauma care, prolonged transport times or in the developing world where there are high rates of HIV carriage and blood donation is not widely taken up (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1460408611418766">Goosen et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1460408611418766">Shirley, 2008</xref>). Advocates supporting their usage believe that they overcome the disadvantages of blood transfusion such as the safety issues relating to transmission of infections, theinduction of immunological reactions, the limited donated blood quantity and the need for screening.</p>
<p>In addition, the administration of novel systemic haemostatic agents such as tranexamic acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1460408611418766">CRASH-2 trial collaborators, 2010</xref>) and recombinant factor VIIa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1460408611418766">Felfernig, 2007</xref>) have also been shown to reduce the risk of death in bleeding trauma patients. Although proven to be efficacious in military trauma care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1460408611418766">Felfernig, 2007</xref>), the use of such agents has not been widely adopted in everyday trauma care in civilian practice. Administration of other agents can also be beneficial in the initial management of polytrauma patients. For example, tris-(hydroxymethyl) aminomethane (THAM), an alkalising agent, has been shown to be an effective alternative to sodium bicarbonate for treating acidosis and tosignificantly improve arterial pH and base deficitduring acute lung injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1460408611418766">Kallet et al., 2000</xref>) and renal acidosis ((<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1460408611418766">Nahas et al., 1998</xref>). Moreover, it can also be a potent cerebro-protective agent in cases of brain injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1460408611418766">Nahas et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1460408611418766">Okauchi et al., 2002</xref>). However, its potential application in the clinical setting as can adjunct to polytrauma management requires further investigation.</p>
<p>The advances made in diagnostics have been extremely beneficial since they allowed early recognition of life-threatening injuries and prompt, efficacious management. The recent evolution of the multi-slice CT allows accurate diagnosis to be made within 2–4 minutes when integrated into the early diagnostic protocol, which is of enormous benefit for early initiation of appropriate treatment strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1460408611418766">Berne et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1460408611418766">Hilbert et al., 2007</xref>). Although the exposure of these patients to radiation remains a concern, future research should assess the actual risk of carcinogenesis. A recent study on the impact on trauma patient management of installing a CT scanner in the emergency department reported that more trauma patients had diagnostic CT scanning before definitive care with a decreased time required for CT, without a significant increase in the number of unnecessary scans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1460408611418766">Lee et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Advanced or novel therapeutic methods applied either simultaneously or in a priority oriented way with the multidisciplinary cooperation of different specialists, have also contributed in the improved quality of the provided polytrauma care. In addition to standard life saving surgery such as laparotomy, thoracotomy or application of a pelvic C-clamp and concomitant pelvic packing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1460408611418766">Probst et al., 2009</xref>), advances made in interventional radiology have improved the management of patients with solid organ trauma or pelvic ring injuries by angio-embolisation without the need for immediate surgical intervention or as adjunct to damage-control surgery in complex injury patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1460408611418766">Shaftan, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1460408611418766">Durai and Ng, 2010</xref>). However, such interventions are not without risks and, although less invasive, patients should be followed up carefully (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1460408611418766">Durai and Ng, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>With regard to the strategy of fracture fixation, the realisation that early total care may not be beneficial to all groups of patients (‘second hit’ insult) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1460408611418766">Giannoudis et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1460408611418766">Pape et al., 2000</xref>) has resulted in a shift towards the ‘damage control’ approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1460408611418766">Giannoudis, 2003</xref>). A recent study has shown that definitive intramedullary fixation of femoral shaft fractures in the setting of hypo-perfusion defined by serum bicarbonate is predictive of pulmonary organ dysfunctionandincreases morbidity among multi-systemtrauma patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1460408611418766">Morshed et al., 2010</xref>). Advanced minimal invasive surgical techniques and the development of appropriate surgical instrumentation for systems with distinct biomechanical advantages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1460408611418766">Perren, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1460408611418766">Egol et al., 2004</xref>) may have an impact in terms of reducing the ‘second hit’ (surgeon induced trauma) on the overall physiological state of these patients. Also, novel systems that simultaneously ream, irrigate and aspirate, reduce the elevated intra-medullary pressures and generated heat and systemic and inflammatory effects of reaming, like the Reamer/Irrigator/Aspirator (RIA) system (Synthes, Inc., West Chester, PA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1460408611418766">Higgins et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1460408611418766">Giannoudis et al., 2009</xref>), could be beneficial in polytrauma patients with long bone fractures and concomitant lung injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1460408611418766">Giannoudis et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1460408611418766">Pape et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Furthermore, with better understanding of the biology of fracture healing and novel methods of biological stimulation for bone regeneration, early intervention in cases where fracture delayed union or non-union is foreseen (open fractures, critical sized bone defects) by means of administration of pharmacological agents (BMPs, other growth factors and hormones) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1460408611418766">Nauth et al., 2010</xref>) could accelerate the normal bone healing process to hasten the rehabilitation period.</p>
<p>In cases of polytrauma with concomitant spinal cord and non-cord injuries, early surgical stabilisation may be beneficial. A recent review ofthe timing of spinal stabilisation and the impact on morbidity and mortality in such patients reported that early surgical stabilisation consistently seems to lead to shorter hospital stays, shorter intensive care unit stays, less days on mechanical ventilation and fewer pulmonary complications. This was more evident in patients with more severe injuries, without increased complication rates compared to late surgery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1460408611418766">Dimar et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The key advances which have opened new horizons in the management of polytrauma patients mainly involve improvements in our understanding of the events regulating the immediate physiological reaction and subsequent events following trauma. At the molecular level, anumber of molecules (mediators), such as pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) as well as cells, termed as antigen-presenting cells (lymphocytes, neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages and natural killer cells) interact whilst the patient enters a state of physiological crisis with the up-regulation of various complex mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1460408611418766">Giannoudis and Pape, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1460408611418766">Tsukamoto et al., 2010</xref>). An immuno-inflammatory response is initiated not only by the injury itself, but also by the additional stress, induced by the events that may be encountered during the management of multiply injured patients, like surgical procedures or subsequent complications. This state of hyper-inflammation represents the early phase of the immunological dysfunction following trauma in an effort to maintain homeostasis, and is followed by a phase of immunosuppression with increased susceptibility to infection, sepsis and multiple organ failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1460408611418766">Stahel et al., 2007</xref>). In addition to the immune response, a variety of endocrinological and haematological phenomena evolve concurrently and proportionally to the severity of trauma sustained until normalisation of all the physiological processes takes place (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1460408611418766">Giannoudis and Pape, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1460408611418766">Giannoudis et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Research is ongoing in an effort to identify mediators with the best specificity and sensitivity for both diagnostic and prognostic purposes. At present, the knowledge acquired from the developing field of clinical genomics and proteomics has not been applied extensively in trauma management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1460408611418766">Alpantaki et al., 2007</xref>). The elucidationof cellular and molecular events occurring in trauma patients, in terms of gene expression and protein synthesis may allow the screening of candidate genes and assist clinicians in accurate diagnosis and the selection of appropriate and ‘accordingly modified’ treatment options for each patient. Endothelial injury markers could be used to quantify the magnitude of the immuno-inflammatory response and detect early the potential development of post-traumatic complications such as adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1460408611418766">Giannoudis et al., 2007</xref>). Further elucidation of the pathophysiology of injury at the molecular level would allow the selection of an appropriate management strategy at the appropriate time to augment or at the leastnot ‘interfere’ with the normal homeostatic processes. Therapeutic strategies in the terms of biological response modifiers designed to temper or modulate the post-traumatic innate and adaptive immune response would be of benefit, but their translation from ‘bench to bedside’ is difficult and still subject to extensive research. Various pharmacological strategies including anti-inflammatory (steroids) and immune-stimulatory (interferon) agents and other unconventional immune-modulatory approaches, such as immuno-nutrition are being investigated with the aim of restoring immune homeostasis after traumatic injuries and preventing the development of lethal complications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1460408611418766">Stahel et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>All this extensive research and monitoring of the immune response is of great interest to all disciplines involved in the management of polytrauma, but particularly for intensive care physicians, who often deal with an uncontrollableimmuno-inflammatory response, immuno-paralysis and sepsis when treating trauma patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). With improved resuscitation protocols, the rapid transfer of polytrauma patients, and early diagnosis and treatment in combination with the damage control strategy, the survival of multiple injured patients has increased, making the role of the ICU pivotal in the interval between emergency and definitive surgery, during which evidence-based intensive care treatment tailored to the patient’s individual injuries, must be provided (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1460408611418766">Mann et al., 2010</xref>). Management should be performed in dedicated trauma ICUs, in close cooperation with all the surgical disciplines involved. Up-to-date diagnostic, monitoring and treatment tools, suchas extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1460408611418766">Campione et al., 2007</xref>) as well as thorough monitoring of the immunological status of the patient with Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and procalcitonine measurements (in addition to the ‘traditional’inflammatory markers WBC and CRP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1460408611418766">Giannoudis et al., 2008</xref>) represent an effort to initially stabilise and then optimise the patient’s condition for further interventions and ultimately rehabilitation.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, the management of patients with multiple injuries continues to be a challenging process. However, prevention with increased and efficacious safety measures remains the key to reducing the incidence of trauma in general, which remains one of the main causes of death and disability worldwide mostly affecting young adults as well as the elderly population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1460408611418766">WHO, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1460408611418766">Aldrian et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1460408611418766">Giannoudis et al., 2009</xref>). Besides prevention, well-organised health systems should provide all the components of an efficient and high quality management system for polytrauma patients. Ongoing improvements in this field are anticipated as a result of the continuous efforts of all those involved in trauma care to further reduce mortality, improve functional outcome and quality of life for these patients, and to reduce the economic implications in health care and society.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1460408611418766" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>So, are there new horizons for polytrauma management? The answer is yes! These include advances in all aspects and disciplines involved in trauma care, aiming to provide the most prompt and efficient care. Even faster rescue and transfer times are being strived for, whilst providing optimal resuscitation strategies by means of the administration of novel agents to lessen the induced immune response and supplement the homeostatic processes or artificial blood products to overcome the limitations and risks of blood transfusion. Moreover, rapid accurate diagnosis by the provision of multi-slice CT scanners across all trauma centres, would allow prompt treatment with minimal invasive surgical techniques which will minimise further trauma, and early supportive care in the ICU with better monitoring methods and pharmacological support. Further elucidation of how genetic variation among patients could influence physiological processes, such as the magnitude of immune response after trauma, the response to sepsis or to the administration of various pharmacological agents and the normal healing responses including fracture healing, may offer novel treatment strategies and genetic tests to allow ‘modified’ treatments to be provided or to early identify patients at risk for potential complications. Advanced therapies in terms of injectable formulations ofgrowth factors or systemic administration of biological response modifiers could also be of benefit in trauma patients as well as the establishment of early and efficacious rehabilitation based on the individual demands of each patient and the planning of late reconstructive procedures when required.</p>
<p>For all these new horizons for the management of polytrauma patients to be expanded and novel strategies to be added and improve the trauma practice in the years to come, extensive research must continue in all related fields.</p>
