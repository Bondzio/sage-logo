<p>Change (especially relatively recent change) plays a significant role in all three contributions in this issue. The first article, by Mercedes Durham et al., revisits the development of the quotative marker <italic>be like</italic> over the past three decades. Their real-time study compares its use among undergraduate students from the United Kingdom in 1996 and 2006 and reveals striking contrasts with previous research. The authors find that while the extralinguistic factor of speaker sex shows decreasing influence over the period studied, the effect of linguistic factors, such as grammatical person and tense, remains unchanged. Complementing this usage study is an experiment gathering acceptability judgments of <italic>be like</italic> sentences from 121 speakers representing a broad age range. Again their results challenge prior claims as they find little correlation between age and quoting content (whether reported thought or direct speech). They convincingly argue that the consistency of influence from linguistic factors is in line with theories of language change, and that earlier claims of universal trends in the grammaticalization of <italic>be like</italic> may require reconsideration.</p>
<p>The second article covers the slightly longer time span of fifty years. Following the procedure of Labov’s famous 1962 study of the pronunciation of /r/ in New York City department stores, Patrick-André Mather points to the continuation of trends evident in Labov’s research. Mather’s study (conducted in 2009) highlights effects of situational, social, and phonological factors on the realization of /r/ that are similar to those reported by Labov. However, there are also clear changes: the use of /r/ has increased substantially since the 1960s, and younger speakers across the board use the /r/-full variant much more commonly than do older speakers (while Labov’s study found this only among upper-middle-class New Yorkers). Interestingly, Mather also shows that “African Americans in New York City are taking part in the shift toward [r]-fullness, although they are also more successful than white speakers at maintaining a distinct linguistic identity and avoiding dialect leveling pressures from mainstream American English.”</p>
<p>Finally, we are very pleased to be able to present an interview with Geneva Smitherman conducted by H. Samy Alim. Change, or the call for change, features prominently throughout their broad-ranging discussion of the past, present, and future. Reflecting on issues of language and race, gender, and politics, Smitherman provides fascinating insights into her professional life that will interest scholars and students of English linguistics alike.</p>
