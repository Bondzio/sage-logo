<abstract>
<p>The study of the construction of an ethnic identity is the central theme in the research carried out by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1354067X11434842">Haan and Leander (2011)</xref>. They analyze the dialogical relationships that occur in social spaces, which serve as mediators for forging the identity of children and young people. Analysis allows them to characterize the social representations and patterns, which provide information on the personal positions (and counter-positions) constructed among different ethnic groups. However, we, being situated in the systemic perspective of development, offer a route which does not oppose the proposals of the authors, but on the contrary, we consider that it could be complementary for the understanding of this phenomenon, since we assume that the development of each person is open by nature and that it is in constant interaction with other systems (family, academic, social and cultural). This interaction generated its own dynamics which makes new forms of organization possible and contributes to the construction of identity. We support our reflections with cases of Latin American students who recount situations related to the construction of identity. Our conclusions are directed towards recognizing that this phenomenon is complex and requires analysis from different points of view, which contributes to its understanding.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1354067X11434842">Haan and Leander (2011)</xref> use a comparative, trans-national analysis to look at how spaces are socially constituted and how these are used in the practices of identity construction, the way in which young people belonging to two ethnic groups build and relate social spaces as a social practice of identity. The importance of space is clear here: “Social spaces are not static but allow the construction of different representations at different moments of life; it is a constant in which representations change or interact in the spaces of life . . .” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1354067X11434842">Haan &amp; Leander, 2011</xref>, p. 3)</p>
<p>This proposal is very interesting because people develop through their participation in different scenarios and our developmental perspective aims to identify the heterogeneous nature of the persons, which emerges in their interaction with others and the world in general (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1354067X11434842">Rodríguez, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1354067X11434842">Vygotsky &amp; Luria, 1994</xref>). Human development does not take place in a laboratory but through different scenarios of everyday life, which, at the same time, form part of the culture which facilitates the transmission and construction of knowledge and experiences. This interaction favors unity of development and learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1354067X11434842">Cristancho-Vining, 2009</xref>). This includes players (grandparents, parents, brothers and sisters, friends and teachers), scenarios (home, neighborhood, school, parks and streets), and everyday activities or situations which require the children to use their skills which at the same time contribute to the development of observation, understanding, analysis, inquiry processes and the construction of new knowledge.</p>
<p>Secondly, it is interesting to note that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1354067X11434842">Haan et al.’s (2011)</xref> is a comparative study in which students from different cultural backgrounds take part. The focus of their analysis are the spatial representations of others and of self, captured in the spaces experienced in school or university classrooms in the Netherlands or the United States. Haan and Leander’s intention is to carry out a meta-analysis which will enable them to understand the general characteristics of the ethnic minorities of the otherness (the others identity) and the way in which this can vary according to the different stories of contact of the ethnic groups or the contacts of the institution. It is therefore a question of two researchers studying a phenomenon to contribute to the construction of new understandings, which is extremely interesting because it does not go along with the traditional inductivist position. We can add that—from the epistemological point of view—a number of authors from different standpoints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1354067X11434842">Gillièron, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1354067X11434842">Popper, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1354067X11434842">Valsiner, 2009b</xref>) point out the limitations of conceiving an induction as a method of accessing the construction of scientific knowledge.</p>
<sec id="sec1-1354067X11434842"><title>Pathways to analysis</title>
<p>Interaction sequences of young people in classroom scenario are very interesting. The object is to analyze two things, namely, the “otherness” defined as a creation of discursive frontiers of the participants, making a distinction between self and the other person, or we and they, and the creation of a social space which could be a representation of a place or configurations of space expressed in the discourse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1354067X11434842">Haan &amp; Leander, 2011</xref>, p. 320). Why is this type of analysis important? From an idiographic perspective such micro-analysis addresses the same function as a process related to the construction of ethnic boundaries. It is important to point out that the phenomena of development of one of these—the construction of identity—occur in scenarios and different time scales—seconds, minutes, hours, days, and years. Consequently, the phenomenon to be studied can be traced or captured if we undertake a profound analysis of the process; each segment reveals forms of interaction, movements, positions of the participants, characteristics of the spaces constructed, or evoked for the “<italic>otherness</italic>,” or <italic>the way in which these spaces can be used by each ethnic group</italic>. It is therefore very enriching to use micro-analysis since this will enable a profound analysis to be made of the process. The benefits of this method will enables researchers to identify spatial Ethno-patterns which show the complexity of the phenomenon, making a great contribution in determining the way that some groups build their ethnic identity, and at the same time manage to identify specific practices in schools.</p>

<sec id="sec2-1354067X11434842"><title>New understandings from the systemic perspective</title>
<p>Human development can be understood from the perspective of dynamic systems. This implies recognizing that development is a <italic>complex</italic> process because it has to be recognized that a number of qualitative components are in constant interaction to make it possible for new forms to emerge. Development is dynamic—the developing organism changes through time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1354067X11434842">Lewis, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1354067X11434842">Lyra, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1354067X11434842">Molenaar, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1354067X11434842">Molenaar &amp; Valsiner 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1354067X11434842">Puche-Navarro, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1354067X11434842">Rodríguez, 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1354067X11434842">2011a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1354067X11434842">2011b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1354067X11434842">Thelen &amp; Smith, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1354067X11434842">Valsiner, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1354067X11434842">2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1354067X11434842">2009b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1354067X11434842">van Geert, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1354067X11434842">2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Furthermore, it can be assumed that development can take <italic>multiple</italic> forms and that each system that develops is unique. The self is always in a constant process of transformation through time; it is nurtured by diverse experiences, and can take many directions as each person constructs his own path. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1354067X11434842">Molenaar and Valsiner (2009)</xref> state:
<disp-quote>
<p>Each person is unique in all respects—genetically<italic>, </italic>physiologically and psychologically. Moreover<italic>, </italic>each person follows his/her own unique path in life in that s/he matures<italic>, </italic>develops<italic>, </italic>learns<italic>, </italic>adapts<italic>, </italic>behaves and experiences in idiosyncratic ways. Yet<italic>,</italic> at the same time<italic>, </italic>within the range of inter-individual and intra-individual (temporal) variability<italic>, </italic>generic processes of life organization are in operation. It can be said that these generic processes make the high variability possible. As the livelihood of all species depends upon their flexibility of adaptation to ever-unpredictable conditions of the environment<italic>, </italic>it is not surprising that variability is the “name of the game” in biological and psychological research. (p. 23)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>People do not develop in isolation, that we are part of various systems, and that the interaction among systems makes the emergence of ideas, concepts, values and social representations possible. One of the main systems is that of family which is made up of other subsystems such as parental, fraternal and conjugal, which are in constant interaction between themselves and other systems such as academic, social and cultural. For this reason, it is relevant to consider the construction of ethnic identity in the light of a systemic perspective, to analyze the forms of interaction between systems and subsystems which will enable the emergence of new forms related to the construction of ethnic identity to take place. Besides, this systemic perspective serves to determine possible paths which become organized over time and which can be grouped into patterns.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-1354067X11434842"><title>Two systems for the construction of ethnic identity: Family and school</title>
<p>The construction of ethnic identity in a person is brought about by his/her interaction with different systems, one of which is the family. Our family viewpoint registers a systemic perspective, given that we consider the family as an open system composed of three large subsystems (conjugal, parental, and paternal), which are in constant interaction and in internal and external interchange. As in every system, the family is characterized by possessing a structure of hierarchies (power relationships), rules (coexistence relationships), roles (function relationships), limits (connection relationships), and boundaries (environmental relationships). The family is a:
<disp-quote>
<p>Group of people connected emotionally and/or by blood, who have lived together for enough time to have developed patterns of interaction and histories that justify and explain those patterns. In their modeled interactions with one and other, the family members build amongst themselves. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1354067X11434842">Minuchin, 1986</xref>, p. 86)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The family is a system which is made up of a network of internal and external relationships, and given its open nature it is in a state of constant interchange and interaction, and organizes itself to allow the emergence of new forms or processes.</p>
<p>Coherent with the above, emergence is a basic principle in understanding the change in systems, in which reference is made to “the appearance of new forms or properties through the transformation of properties which are intrinsic to the system itself” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1354067X11434842">Lewis, 2000</xref>, p. 38). According to this principle, it is assumed that in natural systems, one of which is the family, the spontaneous emergence of high order forms is produced through interaction among the different parts which make up the same system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1354067X11434842">Lewis, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1354067X11434842">Thelen &amp; Smith, 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1354067X11434842">1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1354067X11434842">van Geert 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1354067X11434842">van Geert &amp; van Dijk, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>The person—in this case every young person who took part in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1354067X11434842">Haan and Leander’s (2011)</xref> study—is an active participant in the family system, carrying out roles, forming part of intra-systemic and inter-systemic relationships, and taking part in some family, academic social and cultural dynamics. The family is a system with history, marked by events, traditions, rites, and practices related to upbringing, education, care, recreation, food, the way of relating to others, etc. Consequently, the emergence of behaviors, abilities, thoughts, and social representations is not coincidental, and adheres to the system’s own dynamic. Let us analyze an example cited by Haan and Leander (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1354067X11434842">2011</xref>, p. 7), when one of the young people makes the following statement, “You Moroccans are dirty, especially those from this neighborhood.”</p>
<p>From a systemic point of view, this phrase demonstrates a cultural construction which has a particular meaning. The word “dirty” is charged with a host of meanings which, when used as a metaphor, possibly in stories of Dutch families, could be extremely representative. The young man who used the phrase makes a clear distinction: Who are you?—Another person, a person different from me, I am Dutch, you are Moroccan, I am a man, you are a woman, and you have something which makes you different from me. You are “dirty.” In a self-referential process the opposite of dirty is “clean,” perhaps he perceives himself as clean and the dirtiness of others reaffirms the socio-cultural imaginations which make sense in the family stories which contain people who are pure, dignified, better, etc.</p>
<sec id="sec4-1354067X11434842"><title>Let us see what happens in the school system</title>
<p>The school forms part of a whole—where learning takes place—but it also forms part of a frontier where there are limits with the outside. School constantly moves between an individual process and an interpersonal process, and apart from this interconnects contextual and cultural aspects which imply social norms, beliefs, and values, in which there is constant interaction between the child and the adult, and among the children themselves. Each one of these players is immersed in different social systems (house, school, religious organizations, etc.). In summary, this is an unmistakable social space where interactions and contexts come together (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1354067X11434842">Marsico &amp; Iannaccone, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>School is the meeting place for different cultures, and different social practices, academic contexts. In other words, a place where the individual develops in constant interaction with others, and where, apart from the internal and external environment which defines it, a series of dynamics begins to form with respect to the limits that surround the school, those cultural limits which start to be constructed are based on the negotiation of realities among the individuals. In this respect, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1354067X11434842">Carretero (2007)</xref> considers how contemporary societies value and use history in a different way, that is to say, each social space has specific ways of managing historical and collective memory. The most outstanding spaces for socialization are in education and the family.
<disp-quote>
<p>The academic space, especially from the end of the 1980s is being affected by the phenomena of globalization and multiculturalism. In this scenario it must assume the challenge of re-defining objectives related to the present reality, which on the one hand come together and on the other diversify, while stories and identities are constructed. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1354067X11434842">Carretero, 2007</xref>, p. 17)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Having said that, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1354067X11434842">Haan and Leander (2011)</xref> show us that globalization and multiculturalism must be taken into account in the study and understanding of the construction of ethnic limits in interaction in the classroom.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1354067X11434842"><title>Voices from Latin America</title>
<p>The phenomenon of ethnic construction can be seen from different scenarios. We wish to provide a view of this phenomenon that may be complementary. The construction of ethnic identity in Latin America has significant characteristics because even with a common language—Spanish—within this great Latin American cultural area, we do find differences. Let us cite the account of university students from Venezuela who have had to move to Colombia, and their feelings with respect to their situation within the group. María (fictitious name), age 22:
<disp-quote>
<p>The political situation in my country (Venezuela) obliged my family to move to this country 2 years ago. In my classroom there are people who are by warmer by nature, and others who don’t talk to me or notice me. This seems to depend on the region they come from, for example people who come from here, from Bogotá (in the center of the country), rarely speak, they are very reserved, but on the other hand people from the Atlantic Coast are much more cheerful and talkative, and for this reason they have great affinity with the Venezuelans, not only because we are very close geographically but we have a common border, the Atlantic coast which gives us our personality, warmth, music, food, and dancing. [she smiles]</p>
<p>I also think that those who stay away from me do so because of political or ideological prejudices. As soon as they know I’m from Venezuela the first thing they ask is about my country’s president (Chávez), and sometimes the political thing gets a bit tedious and exhausting. . . . sometimes without even asking they assume a position and criticize you, just because they are not in favor of my country’s government, and they make disrespectful comments because they think you support those ideas, and really you don’t!</p>
<p>I decided not to let this worry me—sometimes it isn’t where you were born, it’s where you have to live. I am not going to lose my roots or my culture because these are in my heart, but I am going to adapt to life here because I’m happy here.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In her account Maria describes her way of relating to the academic system (classmates), which is sometimes close and other times distant. She feels that her relationship with others depends on a place of birth (central or Atlantic zone) because people who belong to a particular zone have certain characteristics: reserved or cheerful.</p>
<p>There are also aspects in common which identify us with one of the sub-groups which make up the system, so an interactive experience from the past is brought into the present to create a new story which is characterized by the resilient aspects of the most significant events.</p>
<p>There is one very important aspect of Maria’s account and that is a new re-signification of the term “frontier,” which has traditionally been defined as an imaginary line which divides spaces or territories. When talking about Colombians who live on the Coast, she says, “. . . not only because we are very close geographically but we have a common border, the Atlantic coast which gives us our personality, warmth, music, food, and dancing”.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1354067X11434842"><title>The frontier is not a dividing line</title>
<p>On the contrary, it is a point of union or meeting place of two cultures; the frontier defines an “inside” and an “outside,” that is, a difference in contexts shows a difference, but in certain circumstances marks similarities.</p>
<p>We also find the strategies that Maria has constructed to adapt herself to a new dynamic of her interactive style of communication. First, she says that there are situations which bother her and she defines these as “political prejudices” and she uses the strategy “face” to explain. Secondly, with regard to the change of country, she assumes a rather resigned attitude, with the noteworthy phrase,
<disp-quote>
<p>it isn’t where you were born, it’s where you have to live. I am not going to lose my roots or my culture because these are in my heart, but I am going to adapt to life here because I’m happy here.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This phrase is revealing because it shows that cultural significance and identities are no longer connected with a particular origin in the space, in the sense that a determined territory has been “cultivated,” and therefore presents a personal vision of the world. On the other hand, globalization leads to forms of diverse cultural groups removed from one place of origin, or among themselves or others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1354067X11434842">Valsiner, 2009a</xref>). The memory of personal identity and that of one’s homeland are configured in one and the same, be it person or country, they form one unit. Peter (fictitious name), age 24:
<disp-quote>
<p>OK, I came here a year ago because of the uncertain situation in my country. Here everyone is very kind, and the difference between the regions is clear. People from Bogotá are more reserved, and those from the coast more open. I have a lot of friends, I’ve learned how to drink coffee; here the coffee is delicious. I’ve also learned lots of sayings, proverbs and jokes. The curious thing is that even though we all speak the same language you find different pronunciations, for example between the Atlantic and Pacific coasts. People say that the pronunciation of Venezuelans is similar to that of people from the coast, so sometimes I say that I am a “costeño.”</p>
<p>Nevertheless I miss my country very much. There my life was more comfortable. I had two cars and my own apartment near the sea. Here I haven’t got a car and I have to come by bus.</p>
<p>Regarding politics, people are very curious. They try to ask questions and make jokes about the president of my country. I tell them that I don’t want questions and the reason that I’m here is because I have had a painful experience in the past, and pretend to be annoyed, so they understood. Now we’re OK and very relaxed about it. I’m happy to be here but I’m thinking of going back for patriotic reasons and because my family is there.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In his account, Peter describes his way of relating to the system. He recognizes that there are two sub-groups (the interior and the coast), and identifies other language-related differences and the pronunciation of each group. He also assumes a more centered position, that of <italic>integration</italic>, and uses as resources learning to drink coffee, learning jokes and sometimes imitating pronunciation to pass himself off as a member of another sub-group of people from the coast. This personal exercise of Peter is a simple act of adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1354067X11434842">Bateson, 1998</xref>). It is given in the first order, a change to second order is not configured. It is useful in terms of adjusting but is not able to be configured in relationships in the form of a relational adaptation (change of meanings and understandings).</p>
<p>There is one very important aspect, which is that he evokes the past by saying “I miss my country very much. There my life was more comfortable. I had two cars and my own apartment near the sea.” This feeling is similar to that reported by Haan &amp; Leander in relation to Fahd, a Turkish-Dutch student, when talking to the girl from Ghana, and Ilham, a Dutch-Moroccan girl. Let’s remember that Fahd begins by saying that his father used two cars “here” in the Netherlands, once only, but he has many more in Turkey. In his accounts, sketches of his need for recognition and power are reflected. It is also significant because it enables us to identify a process which could be common for two cultural groups. From this standpoint, it is relevant to comment that in the study of the development of ethnic identity construction it is possible to determine universal patterns and personal patterns. The reconfiguration of identity is influenced by personal experiences of similarity and difference, and this process of characterization is understood as a search for an interactive connection which occurs on defining oneself as an “I” in a relationship.</p>
<p>Finally, it is important to mention that Peter, in order to come to terms with a new dynamic has carried out a series of movements and developed some strategies. One of these is to deal with, in order not to explain “people are very curious. They try to ask questions and make jokes about the president of my country. I tell them that I don’t want questions and the reason that I’m here is because I have had a painful experience in the past, and pretend to be annoyed”. The phrase expresses his feelings, he imposes a limit which is successful “. . . so they understood. Now we’re OK and very relaxed about it.” This shows us that Peter, through communicative exchanges and interaction with his companions, manages to give meaning to his reality and circumstances, which at the same time contributes to the construction of identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1354067X11434842">Carretero &amp; Castorina, 2010</xref>). He protects his identity by imposing contextual limits, defining a relational guideline of “victim” with which the others become protectors.</p>
<p>The two previously mentioned cases provide a preliminary analysis, which shows us, among other things, that the process of ethnic identity construction can be understood from a dynamic perspective. The accounts show us that the process is dynamic, it moves through time and in this process there are players, systems, sub-systems, roles, scenarios, resources, guidelines, and patterns, and it is possible, when studying the same process, to find different routes because each system self-organizes depending on its interactions and dynamics.</p>

We consider that the dialogue between different points of view enables advances to be made in the social sciences. It is important to continue to put forward theoretical and empirical contributions which go beyond the traditional proposals. The study carried out by Haan and Leander is fascinating and innovative and represents an advance in this direction.</p>
