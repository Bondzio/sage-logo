<abstract>
<p>This study examined two areas. First, the authors looked at whether secondary individualized education program (IEP) teams who used the <italic>Transition Planning Inventory</italic> (TPI) in conjunction with a structured IEP meeting that based discussions and decisions on TPI data as a planning intervention generated significantly more transition-related IEP goals. Second, the authors examined (a) whether parents reported after IEP meetings that they felt they had been heard and valued in their structured IEP process and (b) if all legally required transition-related IEP components had been discussed. From a convenience sample of three high schools in one large Midwestern suburban special education cooperative, 56 students and their families were randomly assigned to a control or an experimental (TPI and structured IEP process) group. Results indicated significantly more transition-related goals for the experimental group. In addition, parents of students in the experimental group were likely to report more satisfaction with the IEP process.</p>

<p>Transition assessment and planning are arguably two of the most important components of federal special education law for students in secondary schools. Because we live in a society that prizes independent and successful adult functioning, it is a school’s responsibility, in concert with family and community networks, to ensure that students with disabilities enjoy a seamless and goal-directed transition from secondary school to the assumption of adult roles and lifestyle. For students with disabilities, the educational services considered necessary to achieve those outcomes are mandated through the transition service provisions of the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0741932510366038">Individuals With Disabilities Education Act of 1990</xref> (IDEA) and its <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0741932510366038">2004</xref> reauthorization, the Individuals With Disabilities Education Improvement Act.</p>
<p>The law is clear that the development of meaningful transition plans rests on the underlying assumption that individual student strengths, needs, preferences, and interests are assessed and ultimately used as primary factors for guiding the development of such a plan for each student (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0741932510366038">Cameto, Levine, &amp; Wagner, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0741932510366038">Clark, 2007</xref>). The keystone of a student’s individualized education program (IEP) at age 16 (or earlier as needed or required by state guidelines) is the transition services component. The successful development and execution of this plan relies on appropriate, psychometrically sound transition assessment and planning. Quality transition planning, derived from reliable age-appropriate transition assessment, consists of the following four components: (a) student involvement and empowerment (eventually enhancing self-determination through the planning process), (b) student self-evaluation; (c) student identification of postschool transition goals consistent with self-evaluation outcomes, and (d) student selection of appropriate school- and community-based educational experiences matched with IEP goals and self-evaluation results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0741932510366038">Halpern, 1994</xref>). The IEP meeting is also the culminating event of the IEP planning process and is important in reaching closure for annual transition planning.</p>
<p>Active participation by the student and parents throughout the entire transition planning process is critical to the development of an individualized, results-oriented, and comprehensive transition plan. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0741932510366038">Test et al. (2004)</xref> reviewed 16 studies related to interventions designed to increase student participation in their IEP process and concluded that students with widely varying disabilities can be actively involved in the IEP process in some way. Moreover, there is research evidence that documents a direct, positive correlation between student and parent participation and the outcomes of the transition plan (and goals and objectives contained therein) realizing fruition after graduation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0741932510366038">Cameto, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0741932510366038">Newman, 2004</xref>). Research also supports the idea that positive outcomes occur when the student has occupied a more prominent, active, and involved role throughout the transition planning process. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0741932510366038">Van Reusen, Bos, Schumaker, and Deshler (1994)</xref> found that student-initiated goals increased substantially when the student was expected to plan for and participate in the IEP process.</p>
<p>The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0741932510366038">Test et al. (2004)</xref> literature review of the impact of interventions designed to increase students’ involvement in IEP planning and the IEP meeting presented impressive evidence regarding the positive effects of specialized curricula and person-centered planning on students’ participation in the IEP process. Based on the results of her longitudinal study project, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0741932510366038">Cameto (2005)</xref> concluded, “Effective transition planning is characterized by the consistent involvement and participation of appropriate individuals, including parents and students, together with regular and special education personnel and others from agencies outside the school” (p. 2).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there is a critical lack of evidence as to whether transition goals and objectives are developed and incorporated into students’ IEPs as a function of having the student, family, and school representatives use specifically targeted transition assessments as an intervention and then systematically using the results in students’ IEP meetings. We conducted this study to investigate such effects on IEP meeting outcomes through the use of the <italic>Transition Planning Inventory</italic> (TPI; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0741932510366038">Clark &amp; Patton, 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0741932510366038">2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0741932510366038">2006</xref>) and a structured IEP meeting process for transition planning. Specifically, we wanted to know if using the TPI as a formative assessment tool in conjunction with a structured IEP resulted in more positive IEP transition planning outcomes. Second, we wanted to know if parents reported any differences concerning whether (a) they felt prepared regarding the purpose of the annual IEP meeting, (b) they felt valued at the meeting and that their input was incorporated into the final IEP product, (c) all legally required transition-related IEP components were discussed during the meeting, and (d) they assumed an active, participatory role in the transition planning process.</p>

<title>Families</title>
<p>Letters were sent to 432 families of secondary children with disabilities who were receiving special education services in three consenting high schools (from four high schools participating in a special education cooperative) in a suburban area near a large, Midwestern city. Two specialized instruction groups were represented within the three participating high schools. One specialized instruction unit served students who had been classified as having mental retardation as a primary exceptionality. The second specialized instruction group served students who had been classified as having a severe emotional disturbance. Demographic data (school, ethnic status, income, and language proficiency) and contextual information (student age, sex, primary exceptionality, and school or instructional setting), organized by participant groups, are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0741932510366038">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0741932510366038">2</xref>, respectively.</p>

<p>Only 56 student and family units met the criteria for a complete case and thus inclusion in the study. For the purposes of this study, a complete case (i.e., required study data per IEP team or group) was dependent on group assignment. For the control group, only informed consent was required. For the experimental group, the following were necessary: (a) informed consent, (b) completion of their respective TPI forms by the student, parents, and school personnel prior to the meeting, (c) school personnel (i.e., the individual who completed the TPI School Form) attendance at the meeting, and (d) Items 1 through 8 checked <italic>yes</italic> on the <italic>TPI Treatment Integrity Checklist</italic> (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0741932510366038">Figure 1</xref>) by the meeting recorder.</p>

<p>The IEP teams participating in this study, regardless of school or instructional setting location, were alternately assigned to a control or experimental (TPI) group pool as informed consent forms were received. Knowledgeable school personnel assigned to the experimental group completed their respective School Forms of the TPI prior to the annually scheduled IEP meeting for each student. After doing so, each experimental IEP team received the TPI Profile and Further Assessment Recommendations Form, a computer-generated document containing each rater’s ratings of student proficiency in the nine planning areas addressed by the TPI. Control group participants did not complete the TPI and participated in the annual IEP planning process as it typically occurred for their program or school. We did not collect data on what instruments control group students might have experienced prior to their IEP meetings. All students in both groups did complete an adapted locus of control assessment, <italic>How I Feel About Myself</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0741932510366038">Rehfeldt, 2007</xref>), before and after their IEP meetings as part of another component of this investigation, which is not reported here.</p>

<sec id="section4-0741932510366038">
<title>School personnel</title>
<p>Each high school district had its own administration and board of education and functioned autonomously within the special education cooperative. From the three high schools and two special instructional setting groups, 26 school personnel participated in the study as the IEP case manager for their students in the study. Each of these participants cooperated by completing the School Form of the TPI and/or serving as the case manager at the IEP meeting. Some case managers for control group students were also case managers for students in the TPI group. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0741932510366038">Clark and Patton (1997)</xref> recommended that school personnel who know the student best complete the TPI School Form. The IEP case managers or special education teachers served in this capacity in the three high schools, whereas the school social worker completed the TPI School Form for students with emotional disturbance who were enrolled in the separate instructional setting specifically for that disability. School personnel were told they could consult with other staff members when completing the form as necessary, as specified in the <italic>TPI Administration and Resource Guide</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0741932510366038">Clark &amp; Patton, 2006</xref>). We did not collect data on whether other staff members were ever consulted or used.</p>

<sec id="section5-0741932510366038">
<title>Meeting recorders</title>
<p>The intent of our study design with regard to integrity in implementing TPI and the structured IEP meeting as a planning intervention led us to designate a small cadre of five trained meeting recorders who were not personally involved in regular transition services in secondary schools, were not necessarily familiar with or engaged in regular transition assessment with the TPI or any other transition assessment instrument, and were not likely to know many students in the sample. School administrators (i.e., high school special education directors or supervisors) served as the IEP meeting recorders for the study. The IEP meeting recorders were not blind to the purpose of the study.</p>

<p>The independent variable contained two components that were separate activities but were combined as a sequential transition planning process. The TPI was used as a transition planning assessment. A structured planning procedure prior to and during the structured IEP meeting process followed the assessment to serve as the culminating activities of the structured planning intervention.</p>

The printed TPI<italic>-</italic>CV profile is formatted differently from the print version and generates two profile options for reporting the results: a strengths-based option (i.e., a rank-ordering presentation in which items responded to most positively across the three raters appear first) and a numerical option (i.e., items are listed in numerical order with raters’ responses; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0741932510366038">Clark &amp; Patton, 2004</xref>). Both options provide a mean rating. We used only the strengths profile option in presenting results to students and parents.</p>

Reliability estimates were reported in the forms of both internal consistency and temporal stability. Coefficient alphas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0741932510366038">Cronbach, 1951</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0741932510366038">Thompson, 2003</xref>) were calculated for all raters—teachers, parents, and students—and for three groups of examinees—the total group, individuals identified as having specific learning disabilities, and individuals identified as having mental retardation. The instrument developers reported that 18% of the coefficient alphas were .90 or above, 52% ranged from .80 to .89, and 30% fell into the .70 to .79 range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0741932510366038">Clark &amp; Patton, 1997</xref>). Time sampling reliability coefficients averaged across the three TPI forms and for all nine planning domains ranged from .78 to .92. Seven of the domain coefficients ranged from .84 to .89. Both internal reliability and time sampling coefficient alphas were indicative of good reliability for all planning areas for all raters and all groups rated. (Please refer to the original manual of the <italic>TPI Administration and Resource Guide</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0741932510366038">Clark &amp; Patton, 1997</xref>] for a complete description of the procedures for item development and content validity.)</p>
<p>The three primary instruments used as dependent variables for the two research questions were the <italic>IEP Meeting Analysis Rubric</italic>, the <italic>TPI Treatment Integrity Checklist</italic>, and the <italic>Parent’s View of IEP Meeting Questionnaire</italic>.

<title>IEP Meeting Analysis Rubric</title>
<p>The <italic>IEP Meeting Analysis Rubric</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0741932510366038">Rehfeldt, 2007</xref>) is a condensed version of the <italic>IEP Meeting Process Observation</italic> procedure designed and used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0741932510366038">Martin, Van Dycke, Greene, et al. (2006)</xref>. They found each subscale composing their measure to have adequate reliability, with coefficient alphas ranging from .79 (Perceptions of Meeting) to .84 (Transition Issues) and the complete Adult Participant Survey having a coefficient alpha of .88. Trained IEP meeting recorders completed this rubric (see Appendix online at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://rse.sagepub.com/supplemental">http://rse.sagepub.com/supplemental</ext-link>) at the conclusion of each student’s IEP meeting for both experimental and control students.</p>
<p>The meeting recorder was responsible for indicating in experimental group IEP meetings whether and how many transition-related IEP goals were developed that matched or had clearly related language linking them with our criteria for what constituted a transition-related goal. The criteria for a goal were a written IEP goal statement in the IEP document that included a focus on (a) any one of the five postsecondary functioning area identified by federal special education law (i.e., postsecondary education or training, integrated employment, adult services, independent living, and community participation; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0741932510366038">IDEA, 2004</xref>) or (b) one or more of the previously mentioned nine planning domains directly assessed by the TPI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0741932510366038">Clark &amp; Patton, 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0741932510366038">2006</xref>). Checking an IEP form box in the transition component (e.g., employment) was not sufficient to be counted as a goal. We did not conduct a reliability check on meeting recorders’ accuracy in this procedure other than to verify that transition-related goals were discussed, orally accepted by the parents and school, and documented on the IEP during the meeting.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0741932510366038">
<title>TPI Treatment Integrity Checklist</title>
<p>The meeting recorders also completed the researcher-developed <italic>TPI Treatment Integrity Checklist</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0741932510366038">Rehfeldt, 2007</xref>; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0741932510366038">Figure 1</xref>) for those IEP meetings in which the TPI was involved. The purpose of this checklist was to ensure that the steps and procedures required by the TPI manual for results interpretation were followed. A related purpose was to ensure that certain events occurred before the meeting and/or important criteria were orally addressed during the meeting. More specifically, the meeting recorder documented whether (a) the student, parent, and special education teacher or case manager completed the TPI prior to the meeting, (b) the case manager gave the TPI Profile and Further Assessment Recommendations Form to the meeting recorder prior to the IEP meeting, (c) the meeting recorder presented an oral interpretation of the TPI results, (d) the IEP team discussed student strengths and weaknesses as they related to the knowledge, skills, and behavior in the nine TPI assessment and planning areas, and (e) the IEP team discussed, orally accepted, and documented transition-related goals on the IEP form during the meeting. This checklist was not an indicator of any level of integrity in the administration of the TPI itself.</p>

<title>Parent’s View of IEP Meeting Questionnaire</title>
<p>The <italic>Parent’s View of IEP Meeting Questionnaire</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0741932510366038">Rehfeldt, 2007</xref>; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0741932510366038">Figure 3</xref>) was a slightly modified version of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0741932510366038">Martin, Van Dycke, Christensen, et al.’s (2006)</xref> <italic>Participant’s View of IEP Meeting Questionnaire</italic>. Parents completed this questionnaire no later than 1 week after their student’s IEP meeting. Similar to the Martin et al. survey, items represented a set of first-person (e.g., “I helped . . .” “I talked . . .” “I believe . . .”) and group (e.g., “We discussed . . .”) statements. For parents randomly assigned to the experimental group, a question was also added concerning their perceptions of the TPI Home Form. In addition to identifying their names, child’s school, relationship to child, and child’s primary exceptionality, parents indicated their level of agreement on a Likert-type scale to a series of statements across four IEP meeting domains: prior knowledge regarding the meeting (e.g., “I knew the reason[s] for the meeting”), transition issues (e.g., “We discussed supports that my child will need in the future”), participant’s meeting behavior (e.g., “I thought my child actively participated during the meeting”), and general perceptions of the meeting (e.g., “I am satisfied with the outcome of this meeting”). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0741932510366038">Figure 3</xref> shows the domains and questions included in the questionnaire.</p>

<title>School personnel responsibilities</title>
<p>The senior author met with all school personnel and reviewed their roles throughout the study. Each meeting or in-service lasted approximately 60 minutes. In addition to providing oral guidelines for how and when to distribute study materials, each person also received an individual packet (containing his or her copy of the informed consent and study questionnaires) for each student participating in the study. School personnel with students assigned to the experimental group also received a copy of chapter 2 from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0741932510366038">Clark and Patton’s (1997)</xref> <italic>TPI Administration and Resource Guide</italic> to provide them with further direction for completing the TPI School Form and administering the TPI Student Form, if necessary.</p>
<p>The students, the parents or guardians, and each student’s case manager for the experimental group completed their respective TPI School Forms and were responsible for securing the completed Student and Home forms. All forms were due 1 month prior to the IEP meeting to ensure timely data collection and permit completion of the TPI Profile and Further Assessment Recommendations Form. After we received all three TPI forms (School, Home, and Student), we entered them into the TPI-CV and printed the Profile and Further Assessment Recommendations Form from the software. We then mailed them to the appropriate meeting recorders prior to each student’s IEP meeting so all three raters’ ratings could be compared, interpreted, and orally discussed during the IEP meetings.</p>
<p>The meeting recorders completed the <italic>IEP Meeting Analysis Rubric</italic> during the meeting or immediately after its conclusion for both experimental and control groups in their school or instructional setting. The lead author trained each of the five meeting recorders in how to present, interpret, and discuss profile results for the TPI group and complete the rubric. Training sessions lasted approximately 60 minutes, and we provided each recorder with a copy of chapter 3 from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0741932510366038">Clark and Patton’s (1997)</xref> <italic>TPI Administration and Resource Guide</italic> to provide them with further direction for interpreting the Profile and Further Assessments Recommendation Form. In addition to containing written directions for how to interpret the profile, the chapter contains three case studies that offer various examples of how to use the form in diverse circumstances. Meeting recorders were also responsible for completing and returning the <italic>TPI Treatment Integrity Checklist</italic> for those students and families assigned to the experimental group to document the fidelity of the TPI results interpretation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0741932510366038">
<title>Family and student responsibilities</title>
<p>Students randomly assigned to the control group did not have any exposure to the TPI or a structured interpretation process of assessment results. For the purposes of this study, they experienced whatever IEP assessment and planning procedures that were used in the past or that occurred naturally in their schools during the period of this study. All students in both groups were invited to attend and participate during their IEP meeting as part of this study. All 28 students in the TPI experimental group attended their own IEP meetings, and 26 (93%) of the control group attended their respective meetings.</p>
<p>Parents participated in the study by attending their child’s IEP meetings and completing relevant questionnaires. Similar to students and teachers, parents of children assigned to the experimental group received a mailing containing the TPI Home Form 6 weeks in advance of their child’s IEP meeting. Parents were requested to complete this form and return it in a self-addressed, stamped envelope. Within 1 week following meeting attendance, all parents of both groups received and were requested to complete the <italic>Parent’s View of IEP Meeting Questionnaire</italic>. Parents were assured that opinions or viewpoints expressed through this questionnaire would not be shared with school personnel.</p>

<title>Research Questions and Analyses of Data</title>
<sec id="section16-0741932510366038">
<title>Question 1</title>
<p>Did IEP teams who used the TPI and a structured IEP meeting procedure develop significantly more transition-related goals relative to IEP teams who did not use the TPI and did not have a uniquely structured IEP meeting? Data from the <italic>IEP Meeting Analysis Rubric</italic> were used to address this question. As previously mentioned, the meeting recorder indicated the number of transition-related goals developed during the meeting on the <italic>IEP Meeting Analysis Rubric</italic> in one or more of the federally mandated planning areas or any one or more of the nine TPI domains. We used an independent-samples <italic>t</italic> test between groups to evaluate the relationship between the TPI transition planning intervention and the number of goals generated.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-0741932510366038">
<title>Question 2</title>
<p>Did parents indicate that (a) they felt prepared regarding the purpose of the IEP meeting (prior preparation and knowledge), (b) they felt valued at the meeting and that their input was incorporated into the final IEP product (meeting perceptions), (c) all legally required transition-related IEP components were discussed during the meeting (transition issues), and (d) they assumed an active, participatory role in the transition planning process (parents meeting behaviors)? Frequencies, means, and standard deviations for each question, per subscale, appearing on the <italic>Parent’s View of IEP Meeting Questionnaire</italic> were computed. An independent-samples <italic>t</italic> test was conducted to evaluate the relationship between group assignment and general or overall meeting experience.</p>

<sec id="section18-0741932510366038" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>Data from 56 IEP meetings were used as part of this study. Of those 56 meetings, 47 (83.9%) were annual high school reviews and 9 (16.1%) were high school transition meetings involving graduating students or students who had reached the maximum age of service delivery (21 years) under <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0741932510366038">IDEA (2004)</xref>. Integrity of implementation of the TPI results interpretation was checked by the meeting recorders, who found that all 10 elements of the TPI results interpretation checklist were addressed in all meetings of the experimental group with 100% integrity.</p>
<p>Question 1 examined whether IEP teams who used the TPI and a structured IEP meeting process developed significantly more transition-related goals relative to IEP teams who did not use the TPI and a structured process. We conducted an independent-samples <italic>t</italic> test to evaluate the relationship between TPI administration or structured IEP meeting process and the number of goals generated. The test was significant, <italic>t</italic>(49) = −8.167, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, indicating that IEP teams assigned to the experimental group developed significantly more transition-related goals relative to control group IEP teams who did not use the TPI and structured IEP meeting process. More specifically, experimental group IEP teams developed a mean of 3.58 (<italic>SD</italic> = 0.64) goals, whereas control group IEP teams developed a mean of 1.76 (<italic>SD</italic> = 0.93) goals. The η<sup>2</sup> index indicated that 57% of the variance related to the number of transition goals the teams developed was accounted for by whether an IEP team was assigned to the control or experimental group.</p>
<p>Question 2 examined whether parents indicated that (a) they felt prepared regarding the purpose for the IEP meeting (prior preparation and knowledge), (b) they felt valued at the meeting and that the IEP team incorporated their input into the final IEP product (meeting perceptions), (c) the IEP team discussed all legally required transition-related IEP components during the meeting (transition issues), and (d) parents assumed an active, participatory role in the transition planning process (parents meeting behaviors). Through completion of the <italic>Parent’s View of the IEP Meeting</italic> questionnaire, parents indicated their level of agreement to a set of declarative statements via a Likert-type scale (1 = <italic>strongly disagree</italic>, 4 = <italic>strongly agree</italic>). Of the 56 parents, 45 returned a completed questionnaire, for a return rate of 80%. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0741932510366038">Table 3</xref> presents the frequency of completion, means, and standard deviations for both groups per question.</p>

Exceptions to this occurred only for transition issue statements, with parents in both groups predominately choosing <italic>disagree</italic> or <italic>agree</italic> for the following three statements: “We discussed recreation and leisure activities for my child,” “We discussed assistive technology for my child,” and “We discussed services from agencies outside the school.” Control parents alone also predominately chose <italic>disagree</italic> or <italic>agree</italic> in response to the following three statements: “I helped identify classes for my child to take,” “I helped identify school activities for my child to be involved in,” and “We discussed opportunities for education after high school.” These results are similar to those reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0741932510366038">Martin, Marshall, and Sale (2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0741932510366038">Martin, Van Dycke, Christensen, et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Five independent-samples <italic>t</italic> tests were conducted to evaluate the relationship between groups on subscales (Prior Preparation and Knowledge, Meeting Perceptions, Transition Issues, Parents’ Meeting Behaviors) and general or overall meeting experience (all subscales combined). As measured by the mean, only the test comparing the difference between groups on their general or overall meeting experience achieved significance.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0741932510366038">Halpern (1994)</xref> took a position early on that effective transition planning is reliant on such features as student involvement, self-evaluation, and identification of postschool transition goals consistent with self-evaluation outcomes. This study provides initial evidence that IEP teams who employ (a) the TPI, which is based on student involvement, self-evaluation, and participating in the identification of transition-related goals for postschool outcomes, and (b) a structured IEP meeting process drawing on TPI results are likely to develop significantly more transition-related goals than IEP teams who do not use the TPI in any way. The results of this exploratory study provide enough evidence to support the idea that employing the TPI (or probably any other transition assessment that yields information on student preferences, interests, strengths, and needs relative to their postschool outcomes goals) and a follow-through IEP meeting using those assessment results can be an effective intervention for focusing pre-IEP meeting planning and the actual meeting on appropriate goals. Using appropriate transition assessment and collaborative planning not only puts a school in compliance with the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0741932510366038">IDEA (2004)</xref> provisions for age-appropriate assessment related to postschool outcomes but also positions the school in a much more defensible position with regard to possible due process risks or litigation.</p>
<p>Although earlier studies found a host of problems related to executing the IEP process legally and with integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0741932510366038">Baer, Simmons, &amp; Flexer, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0741932510366038">Collet-Klingenberg, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0741932510366038">Dudley-Marling, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0741932510366038">Grigal, Test, Beattie, &amp; Wood, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0741932510366038">Krom &amp; Prater, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0741932510366038">Lynch &amp; Beare, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0741932510366038">Say, McCollum, &amp; Brightman, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0741932510366038">Smith, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0741932510366038">Smith &amp; Simpson, 1989</xref>), newer investigations have revealed more promising findings. For example, studies conducted as part of National Longitudinal Transition Study–2 (NLTS2; e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0741932510366038">Cameto, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0741932510366038">Cameto et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0741932510366038">Newman, 2004</xref>) revealed that (a) parents are assuming a qualitatively more active role throughout the transition planning process, (b) students are attending and leading their IEP meetings with increased frequency (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0741932510366038">Martin, Marshall, Maxson, &amp; Jerman, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0741932510366038">Martin, Van Dycke, Christensen, et al., 2006</xref>), (c) families are more directly involved with IEP goal and objective development, and (d) comprehensive transition planning requirements are being addressed for the large majority of students with disabilities. Although this study examined the transition-related content of 56 IEP meetings as a primary research question, the parent response results are consistent with the encouraging results of other investigations. For example, the context of a post-IEP meeting survey revealed that parents provided generally positive ratings about their prior knowledge before and experiences during the meeting (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0741932510366038">Martin et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0741932510366038">Martin, Van Dycke, Christensen, et al., 2006</xref>). In fact, almost every parent answered <italic>strongly agree</italic> in response to prior preparation and knowledge and meeting perception questions.</p>
<p>Overall, parents in both groups were generally very pleased with both what took place during the meeting as well as the outcomes of their child’s meeting. These findings support the conclusions drawn by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0741932510366038">Newman (2004)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0741932510366038">Cameto (2005)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0741932510366038">Cameto et al. (2004)</xref>. Still, parents in the TPI group were more likely to rate items higher with regard to their evaluations of the IEP process. One potential reason for this outcome may have been the increased or more thorough dialogue about the importance of transition planning based on assessment information from the TPI results’ interpretations provided by meeting recorders. As mentioned earlier, these results are very similar to those reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0741932510366038">Martin et al. (2004)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0741932510366038">Martin, Van Dycke, Christensen, et al. (2006)</xref>. They also provide further corroboration of the hypothesis that when parents assume active, participatory roles throughout their child’s transition assessment, planning, and IEP meeting process, they are more likely to be pleased with doing so and are more satisfied with the overall outcomes.</p>
<sec id="section20-0741932510366038">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>This study has its limitations. First, the generalizability of this study’s results is limited because of using a convenience sample of three high schools and two specialized instruction groups within one cooperative special education district and using only families who consented to participate. Although there were only 56 participants (28 IEP teams per study group), they were randomly assigned from the five organizational units to a control or experimental group.</p>
<p>Second, this study did not involve any students (or their families) with other various exceptionalities, such as traumatic brain injury, hearing or vision impairment, orthopedic impairment, and the like. This may be important because NLTS2 results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0741932510366038">Newman, 2004</xref>) documented that parents of children with a traumatic brain injury or vision impairment, for example, are among those most likely to attend IEP meetings and be involved with school-based activities. Our results thus might have been different if students (and their families) with these exceptionalities had participated.</p>
<p>A third limitation is that we did not collect information on student race and/or ethnic background nor on the number of students participating in this study who were receiving free or reduced-price lunches. Consistent with exceptionality, NLTS2 results revealed that transition planning participation rates and outcomes vary by race and/or ethnicity and socioeconomic status. For example, students in the lowest household income group were less likely than those from the highest income households to have parents who actively participated in transition planning, and African American students were less likely than European American students to have parents who participated in transition planning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0741932510366038">Cameto et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>A fourth limitation could be that we did not determine which data were collected relative to transition assessment for the students in the control group in preparation for the IEP process. Our decision to make a blind comparison of the assessment practice of the control group to that of the experimental group was based on our attempt to compare a specific assessment and planning intervention with the current approach in these schools by individual case managers responsible for IEP planning, whatever that might be. Not having this information limited us from describing the control group conditions more specifically.</p>
<p>Fifth, although most educational or psychological research involves some amount of control to ensure difference between or among groups, IEP meeting recorders (none of whom had any previous experience with the TPI) had a unique role. They had specific demands placed on their communication and behavior as a result of obligating themselves to complete relevant items on the <italic>TPI Treatment Integrity Checklist</italic>, including reporting and interpreting results of the TPI. These latter demands do not differ, however, from those appearing in the <italic>TPI Administration and Resource Guide</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0741932510366038">Clark &amp; Patton, 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0741932510366038">2006</xref>) with regard to interpreting TPI results and representing what TPI users should be doing before and during a transition-focused IEP meeting. It seemed more prudent to use administrators as meeting recorders and give them the responsibility of reporting and interpreting the TPI results rather than students’ case managers. It is possible, however, that meeting recorders (special education directors or program coordinators) may have had some bias in favor of the TPI as a result of their training on it. Because they were not unaware of the purpose of the study, their status, their attention to detail, their oral presentation, and their TPI results interpretation might have influenced IEP meeting decisions.</p>
<p>Finally, the quantity of transition-related goals without consideration of quality or outcomes of goals is a limitation. Our results, which reported on the number of transition-related IEP goals, do not imply that quality of IEP goals is not important. Quality of goals may be evaluated in a variety of ways, such as proper format, measurable behaviors, descriptions of goal performance characteristics, and postsecondary goals based on age-appropriate assessment of strengths, preferences, interests, and needs. Quality may also be evaluated in terms of IEP team decisions related to target goals, priorities among goals based on present levels of performance, and the like. In general, schools are not yet collecting such data to meet IDEA State Performance Plan (SPP) Indicator 13 compliance standards because submission of these data are not required until February 2011. The most current guidance on this and all Annual Performance Report (APR) indicators are available online (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.rrfcnetwork.org">www.rrfcnetwork.org</ext-link>) at the SPP/APR calendar link. Outcomes, although ultimately the most important issue of all, were not a part of the design of this initial study of transition-related goals.</p>

<title>Implications for Practice</title>
<p>The educational implications of this investigation raise two important considerations. First, the results provide evidence that using TPI transition planning assessment and a structured process of interpreting and discussing assessment results is effective in increasing the development of transition-related goals. Second, using the key steps of age-appropriate transition assessment, communicating the results of that assessment to students and parents, and ensuring that the IEP team is informed and considers the transition assessment results are all necessary for obtaining the kinds of results we found with regard to parent satisfaction with the IEP process. For school personnel to complete these key steps, they must be trained to conduct age-appropriate transition planning assessments and be committed to following through with providing interpretations to students and parents during the IEP development process. Structuring the feedback process before and during the IEP meeting to focus on student strengths, preferences, interests, and needs is a necessary and critical culminating process.</p>
<p>The results of this study provide documentation for schools that systematic assessment of strengths, preferences, interests, and needs directly contributes to the IDEA mandates that students have appropriate, measurable goals based on age-appropriate academic and functional assessments. Compliance issues related to transition planning invariably stem from lack of available assessment, inadequate assessment, or questionable assessment instruments or from little or no interpretation of existing assessment data. Options for proactive involvement in this process are available to schools, and they should use them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0741932510366038">Clark, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0741932510366038">Miller, Corbey, &amp; Lombard, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0741932510366038">Sitlington, Neubert, Begun, Lombard, &amp; Leconte, 2007</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section22-0741932510366038">
<title>Future Research</title>
<p>This study should be replicated with a wider range of ethnic participants and with students (and their families) who represent more diverse disabilities than those included here. Second, future research should take the next step in IEP goal evaluation by looking at the nature of needed transition-related IEP goals—quality, quantity, and outcomes. Third, a rewarding finding of this study was the greater overall satisfaction level reported by experimental group parents at the conclusion of their IEP meeting via a postmeeting survey. Further research should be conducted to determine the relative effectiveness of school contextual variables in this satisfaction, in addition to IEP preparation and meeting variables. Fourth, it would be important to know the effects of using the TPI in transition planning when case managers are responsible for all steps in the assessment, interpretation, and planning process. Finally, additional psychological constructs should be investigated concurrent with students assuming an active, participatory role throughout their transition planning (including transition assessment) and the IEP meeting process to determine any relationship to student self-determination and family empowerment. Examples include, but should not be limited to, optimism, self-efficacy, locus of control, and willingness to change.</p>
