<p>Miroslav Volf, a leading post-liberal theologian (or “near-classical” as he calls himself), offers here an outstanding demonstration of ways in which to engage the Bible that produce theologically- (and indeed socially- and politically-) fruitful reflection. Originally from Croatia, Volf has been teaching at Yale Divinity School for several years and is director of the Yale Center for Faith and Culture, which exists “to critically examine and promote practices of faith which advance authentic human flourishing and the global common good.” Although affiliated with the Pentecostal movement, his analysis is surprisingly effective in appealing to Christians across a number of denominational traditions, including Reformed, Evangelical, Roman Catholic, and Orthodox.</p>
<p>Although the title of this volume generates the expectation that it will be concerned with <italic>how</italic> to read the Bible, Volf says little about this directly. Rather, he makes use of the Bible as the primary resource for his theological and political commentary. <italic>Captive to the Word of God</italic> is not a unified book in terms of subject matter, nor does it have a sustained single argument. This is not unexpected, given that it was developed over a period of 16 years. Rather, it is a series of instantiations of the effectiveness of reclaiming extended Biblical reflection and analysis in theological work. Volf is erudite, but not obscurantist, and he writes for an intelligent, engaged non-specialist.</p>
<p>Volf’s overarching interest in these essays is ancient Christian communities (e.g. the Petrine and Johannine) and the ways in which they struggle with co-existence, accommodation, and resistance in the midst of an adversarial non-Christian context. The gospel’s claims on the lives of these community members shaped them in distinctive ways. Volf then deftly relates these ancient communities’ struggles to contemporary Christianity and its realities.</p>
<p>Chapter 1 is the shining star of this book: this is probably the best essay on the theological interpretation of Scripture that I have seen. Here Volf sketches the implications for theology when one takes the actual text of the Bible, as well as its context, into account in consistent and critical ways. The importance of this he sums up as follows: “In my judgement, the return of biblical scholars to the theological reading of the Scriptures, and the return of systematic theologians to sustained engagement with the scriptural texts … is<italic> the most significant theological development in the last two decades</italic>” [<italic>emph.</italic> in original] (14). It is the way in which Volf himself makes use of Scripture in each chapter’s explorations that is so noteworthy. Chapters 3 and 4, for example, reflect his commitment (some might say a stubborn commitment) to engage fulsomely with the historical-critical and social-scientific modes of Biblical scholarship as he proposes distinctively theological readings of the text. Others (some postliberals and some evangelicals, for example) have dismissed these modes; whereas some Biblical scholars have rejected theologized readings of the Bible. Volf manages to keep both “camps” in critical and fruitful dialogue. In this respect he is much like Jürgen Moltmann, his doctoral supervisor. Chapter 4 in particular is a fascinating argument that the surprisingly (given most scholarly views of the last half-century) <italic>non-</italic>sectarian nature of the ancient Johannine community is reflected in the Gospel according to John. The dynamics of insiders, outsiders, pluralism, exclusivism, and particularism each play their role, but Volf advances a view of these realities that correlates them very closely with present-day Christian communities’ experiences.</p>
<p>Chapter 2 (on hospitality, the Lord’s Supper, and Christian practices), Chapter 5 (on the claim that “God is love”), and Chapter 6 (on the meaning of work in the midst of the endless consumption–production cycle) fill out the balance of the book, and each chapter offers a substantial argument with much to consider and digest.</p>
<p>This is one of the most satisfying works of theology I have read in some time, and I recommend it to scholars and students alike, and indeed to anyone who is eager for a good theological chew.</p>
