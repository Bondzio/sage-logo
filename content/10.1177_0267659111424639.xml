<p><bold>Background</bold>: We aimed to investigate the effects of off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting, pulsatile cardiopulmonary bypass, and non-pulsatile cardiopulmonary bypass techniques on the inflammatory response and the central nervous system in the current study.</p>
<p><bold>Methods</bold>: A total of 32 patients who were scheduled for elective coronary artery bypass graft surgery were included in the study. The patients were allocated into three different groups according to the perfusion techniques used during the cardiopulmonary bypass procedure as follows: off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting group (n=10); pulsatile cardiopulmonary bypass group (n=11); and non-pulsatile cardiopulmonary bypass group (n=11). Serum interleukin-6, interleukin-8, tumor necrosis factor-alpha and S-100beta levels were measured preoperatively, and at 0, 6, and 24 hours postoperatively.</p>
<p><bold>Results</bold>: The postoperative increase in the levels of interleukin-6 and interleukin-8 was significantly lower in the off-pump group compared to the other two groups (p&lt;0.05), while there was no significant difference in tumor necrosis factor-alpha levels between the groups. Postoperative S-100β levels, an indicator of cerebral injury, was significantly lower in the off-pump CABG group compared to the other two groups (p&lt;0.05).</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Despite the great advance in cardiac surgery with the development of novel methods and equipment in the last 4 decades, extracorporeal circulation and pulmonary and myocardial reperfusion during the procedure may still lead to postoperative complications by inducing alterations in the immune system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0267659111424639">1</xref></sup>. Complications following classical cardiac surgery, mainly caused by extracorporeal circulation and reperfusion, beginning with inflammatory system activation and followed by respiratory failure, pulmonary damage, cognitive dysfunction and brain damage, have prompted cardiovascular surgeons to search for different techniques</p>
<p>Perfusion is conventionally performed by the on-pump, non-pulsatile cardiopulmonary bypass (NPCPB) technique, using a pump which provides a linear blood pressure value. Another technique considered to be more physiological is the on-pump, pulsatile CPB (PCPB) technique in which a pump which produces a pulsatile blood pressure is used. An off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting (OPCABG) technique which can be performed without the need for extracorporeal circulation has also been developed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0267659111424639">2</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Systemic inflammatory response syndrome, inflammatory system activation, brain and lung damage can occur in all three surgical procedures. However, the significance and extent of the damage has not been clarified in any of these techniques<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0267659111424639">3</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The activation of the inflammatory system begins with the interaction of blood and its cellular elements with the artificial surfaces. As a result of the activation of circulating neutrophils, an increase has been noted in interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-8 (IL-8), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) cytokine levels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0267659111424639">4</xref></sup>. Because of the microemboli, macroemboli, increased inflammation and the low blood pressure within the cardiopulmonary bypass pump, ischemic brain damage may occur<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0267659111424639">5</xref></sup>. An increase in S-100beta (S-100β) proteins has been noted in ischemic brain damage and a specific increase in S-100β proteins due to cerebral injury has been demonstrated in patients following cardiac surgery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0267659111424639">6</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>We aimed to investigate the effects of classical on-pump, non-pulsatile CPB, on-pump, pulsatile CPB and off-pump CABG techniques on the inflammatory system (preoperative and postoperative serum IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α levels) and the central nervous system (preoperative and postoperative serum S-100β protein levels) in the current study.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>This clinical study was approved by the Local Ethics Committee (approval no: 353, signed date: December 19, 2005) and was supported by the Scientific Research Projects Unit (project no: 01/2006-24).</p>
<sec id="section3-0267659111424639">
<title>Patients</title>
<p>All eligible patients older than 18 years of age who had coronary artery disease and were scheduled for coronary bypass surgery were included in the study. Patients were excluded from the study for the following reasons: the need for emergency coronary revascularization, the occurrence of an acute myocardial infarction within the last month, an ejection fraction (EF) &lt;30%, a creatinine level &gt;2 mg/dL and/or the presence of acute renal failure, the presence of an active infectious disease, the presence of a systemic inflammatory disease, the presence of a collagen tissue disease, the presence of a metastatic disease and/or receiving immunosuppressive treatment, a history of cerebrovascular disease within the last 6 months, and a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).</p>
<p>Patients were allocated into three groups according to the perfusion techniques used during the CPB procedure as follows: (1) off-pump CABG group (n=10); (2) pulsatile CPB group (n=11); and (3) non-pulsatile CPB group (n=11).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0267659111424639">
<title>Premedication and anesthesia</title>
<p>All patients were premedicated with 10 mg oral diazepam 12 hours before the operation, 0.1 mg/kg subcutaneous morphine sulfate and 20-50 mg/kg intravenous cefazolin sodium 30 minutes before the operation. Lead II standard recordings were used for monitoring patients in the operating room. Then, a pulse oximeter probe was placed on the left index finger for monitoring arterial oxygen saturation. Venous catheterization of the left cephalic or brachial vein was performed using a 16-gauge cannula, and arterial catheterization of the right radial artery was performed using an 18-gauge cannula. Under sterile conditions, a central venous line was inserted into the right internal jugular or subclavian vein using the Seldinger technique, after induction of local anesthesia. Anesthesia was induced with sodium thiopental 5-7 mg/kg. For the maintenance of anesthesia, a muscle relaxant, pancuronium, was administered at a dose of 0.1 mg/kg, and an analgesic, remifentanil, was administered at a dose of 0.1-0.5 mcg/kg by continuous infusion. If required, an inhalation anesthetic, isoflurane, was used. A rectal temperature probe was placed for monitoring the core temperature of the patient.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0267659111424639">
<title>Off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting technique</title>
<p>Immediately after median sternotomy, all patients were anticoagulated with 100-200 U/kg of heparin to maintain an activated clotting time (ACT) greater than 250 seconds. An Octopus IV tissue stabilizer (Medtronic Inc., Minneapolis, MN, USA) was used for partial immobilization of the myocardial surface during the construction of distal anastomoses. An intracoronary shunt was used for the vessel to be anastomosed. The heart was positioned using deep pericardial traction sutures and the Starfish heart positioner (Medtronic, Inc.), an apical suction device. Revascularization of the right coronary artery (RCA) was performed first, followed by the construction of distal anastomoses of the circumflex (Cx) artery territory, and the left anterior descending artery (LAD) territory. The left internal mammary artery (LIMA) was anastomosed to the LAD in all patients. Following the construction of distal anastomoses, the saphenous vein was anastomosed to the aorta.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0267659111424639">
<title>Pulsatile cardiopulmonary bypass technique</title>
<p>The patients were anticoagulated with 300-400 U/kg of heparin to maintain an ACT greater than 400 seconds. CPB was initiated following cannulation of the aorta and the right atrium. A Stockert SIII pulsatile roller pump (Stockert Instrumente GmbH, Munich, Germany) and a membrane type oxygenator (Dideco Compact Flo Evo, Sorin Group, Milan, Italy) were used. The pump prime solution contained 1000-1500 mL of lactated Ringer’s solution to maintain a hematocrit level of 26±2. Pump flow was set at 2.2-2.4 L/m<sup>2</sup>/minute to maintain the mean pulsatile arterial pressure between 50-70 mmHg. Pulsation was achieved by creating temporary changes on the roles of the arms’ rates in roller-type pumps for using pulsatile flow. The body temperatures of the patients were cooled down to 30°C. For myocardial protection, potassium/blood cardioplegic solution was administered every 20 minutes and, additionally, cold (4°C) Isolyte S solution was applied topically to the surface of the heart at the same intervals. Cross-clamp time (minutes) and CPB time (minutes) were recorded.</p>

<title>Non-pulsatile cardiopulmonary bypass technique</title>
<p>The patients were anticoagulated with 300-400 U/kg of heparin to achieve an ACT greater than 400 seconds. CPB was initiated following cannulation of the aorta and the right atrium. A Stockert SIII non-pulsatile roller pump (Stockert Instrumente GmbH) and a membrane type oxygenator (Dideco Compact Flo Evo, Sorin Group, Mirandola, Italy) were used. The pump prime solution contained 1000-1500 mL of lactated Ringer’s solution to maintain a hematocrit level of 26±2 %. Pump flow was set at 2.2-2.4 L/m<sup>2</sup>/minute to maintain the mean non-pulsatile arterial pressure between 50-70 mmHg. The body temperatures of the patients were cooled down to 30°C. For myocardial protection, potassium blood cardioplegic solution was administered every 20 minutes and, additionally, cold (4°C) Isolyte S solution was applied topically to the surface of the heart at the same intervals. Cross-clamp time (minutes) and CPB time (minutes) were recorded.</p>

<sec id="section8-0267659111424639">
<title>Collection of blood samples</title>
<p>The study procedures were initiated after obtaining informed consent from the patients. The blood samples were drawn from the central venous catheter. The first blood sample was drawn just prior to the operation, following induction of anesthesia, the second sample was drawn following the construction of proximal anastomoses and termination of the extracorporeal circulation via administration of protamine sulfate 0 hours postoperatively, the third sample was drawn 6 hours postoperatively and the fourth sample was drawn at 24 hours postoperatively. The blood samples, drawn into plain tubes, were transferred to the Central Biochemistry Laboratory. Serum samples were prepared by centrifugation of the blood samples and then stored at -80°C until analysis. Laboratory analyses were performed in the Central Biochemistry Laboratory at the end of the study.</p>
<p>Serum IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-α levels were measured in serum samples obtained 0 hours postoperatively, 6 hours postoperatively and 24 hours postoperatively, using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit (BioSource, Camarrilo, CA, USA). S-100β levels were measured in serum samples obtained preoperatively, 0 hours postoperatively, 6 hours postoperatively and 24 hours postoperatively, using an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit (BioVendor, Brno, Czech Republic).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0267659111424639">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>The Shapiro-Wilk test was used to determine whether the data were normally distributed. For normally distributed variables, the analysis of variance (ANOVA), and for non-normally distributed variables the Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of variance, was used in the comparison of more than two independent groups. The comparison of time-dependent changes in more than two independent groups was performed by the repeated measures ANOVA for normally distributed variables and by the Friedman test for non-normally distributed variables. The Bonferroni correction was used since intra-group comparisons at different time points and inter-group comparisons at each time point were performed. The Wilcoxon test was used for the comparison of two dependent groups. A Chi-square test was used for the comparison of rates in two independent groups.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>The mean age of 32 patients [25 men (78.1%) and 7 women (21.9%)] was 61.3±9.9 years, and the mean body mass index (BMI) was 27.8±3.4 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. The patients were allocated into three groups according to perfusion techniques used during the CPB procedure as follows: (1) off-pump CABG group (Group I, n=10); (2) pulsatile CPB group (Group II, n=11); and (3) non-pulsatile CPB group (Group III, n=11). There were no significant differences among the three groups with respect to baseline characteristics (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0267659111424639">Table 1</xref>). The mean CPB time was 131.0±67.7 and 100.9±47.3 minutes in the pulsatile and non-pulsatile CPB groups, respectively. The mean cross-clamp time was 72.5±40.4 and 50.9±17.0 minutes in the pulsatile and non-pulsatile CPB groups, respectively. There were no significant differences between the two groups with respect to CPB time and cross-clamp time (p&gt;0.05).</p>

No significant difference was found among the three groups in terms of median IL-6 levels at 0, 6, and 24 hours, postoperatively. While the median IL-6 level at 24 hours after the operation was lowest in the off-pump CABG group (473 pg/ml; range: 361-559), median IL-6 level was 589 pg/ml (range: 536-645) in the pulsatile group and 604 pg/ml (range: 372-684) in the non-pulsatile CPB group. While there was no significant difference between pulsatile and non-pulsatile CPB groups in terms of IL-6 levels (p&gt;0.05 for both comparisons), IL-6 level in the off-pump CABG group was significantly lower compared to both pulsatile and non-pulsatile groups (p&lt;0.001).</p>

<p>The intra-group comparison of IL-8 levels (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0267659111424639">Table 3</xref>) revealed a significant increase at 0 hours, postoperatively, compared to baseline in the off-pump CABG group (p&lt;0.001), and the levels decreased again at 6 and 24 hours after the operation, revealing no significant difference compared to baseline (p&gt;0.05 for both comparisons). In the pulsatile CPB group, the highest IL-8 levels were also observed at 0 hours. While IL-8 levels at 0 and 6 hours postoperatively were significantly higher compared to baseline (p&lt;0.001 and p&lt;0.01, respectively), the difference was lost at 24 hours (p&gt;0.05). The time-dependent changes in IL-8 levels in the non-pulsatile CPB group were similar to other groups. While there was a significant increase in IL-8 levels at 0 and 6 hours postoperatively compared to baseline, the level at 24 hours was not significantly different compared to baseline (p&lt;0.001, p&lt;0.01 and p&gt;0.05, respectively).</p>

<p>In cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), the inflammatory response begins with the interaction of heparinized blood with artificial surfaces<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0267659111424639">7</xref></sup>. It has been previously shown that cardiopulmonary bypass stimulates an inflammatory response and increases postoperative morbidity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0267659111424639">8</xref></sup>. The best method to reduce the inflammatory response is to perform CABG without using CPB. Although the effects of pulsatile and non-pulsatile classical pump techniques and off-pump CABG technique on the inflammatory system have been investigated in a study by Onorati and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0267659111424639">9</xref></sup>, the effects of these techniques on S-100β levels in addition to inflammatory markers have not been previously evaluated in a clinical trial. To our knowledge, our study is the first study investigating the effects of these three techniques on both inflammatory and neurological responses simultaneously.</p>
<p>Off-pump coronary artery surgery without using cardiopulmonary bypass has been performed increasingly in recent years. The goal is to avoid the unwanted effects of cardiopulmonary bypass and body cooling methods on physiological systems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0267659111424639">10</xref></sup>. Cardiac surgery performed using cardiopulmonary bypass is associated with the activation of systemic inflammation and leads to increased postoperative morbidity and mortality. Blood and its elements are continuously in contact with foreign substances and surfaces during extracorporeal circulation. Inflammation begins with the interaction of heparinized blood with artificial surfaces in extracorporeal circulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0267659111424639">7</xref></sup>. The number of leukocytes reduced in response to hemodilution in CPB increases moderately after the operation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0267659111424639">11</xref></sup>. Neutrophils attach to synthetic surfaces, to each other or to platelets and monocytes, leading to cell activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0267659111424639">11</xref></sup>. Interleukin-1 (IL-1), TNF-α, IL-6, IL-8, Interleukin-10 (IL-10), complement 5b-9 (C5b-9), factor XIIa, heparin, histamine, hypochlorous acid and arachidonic acid metabolites, including leukotriene B4 (LTB4), platelet activating factor (PAF) and thromboxane A2, prostaglandins and vasoactive cytotoxic substances are released by these activated cells and mediate most of the findings of “systemic inflammatory response syndrome” (SIRS) associated with CPB and cardiac surgery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0267659111424639">12</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>The mechanism of the inflammatory response observed in cardiac surgeries using CPB has not been clearly understood<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0267659111424639">13</xref></sup>. In order to avoid the unwanted effects of CPB, off-pump coronary artery surgery without using cardiopulmonary bypass has been increasingly performed in the recent years. However, there are also reports indicating that the inflammatory response may be observed with the other surgical techniques as well. Matata et al. compared the effects of on-pump CABG and off-pump CABG techniques on oxidative stress and inflammation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0267659111424639">14</xref></sup>. The TNF-α level was significantly higher in the on-pump CABG group compared to the off-pump CABG group, with the increase starting at 8 hours and reaching a significant difference at 24 and 48 hours. We found that the TNF-α levels in all three groups were similar at baseline and reached their peak at 0 hours postoperatively. While the increases in TNF-α levels in the off-pump CABG and non-pulsatile CPB groups were not significant, the increase in the pulsatile group was statistically significant. There was no significant differences among the three groups in terms of TNF-α level at 0, 6 and 24 hours after the surgery.</p>
<p>Matata et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0267659111424639">14</xref></sup> investigated the effects of on-pump CABG and off-pump CABG techniques on IL-8 levels and found that there was a significant increase in IL-8 levels in the on-pump CABG group between 1 and 4 hours after surgery compared to baseline, reaching a peak at 2 hours, while there was no significant increase in the off-pump CABG group compared to baseline. Okubo et al. investigated the effects of on-pump CABG and off-pump CABG techniques on IL-1, IL-8, IL-10 and TNF-α levels and found that there was a significant increase in inflammatory markers in the on-pump CABG group compared to baseline, while there was no significant change in the off-pump CABG group<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0267659111424639">15</xref></sup>. Orime et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0267659111424639">16</xref></sup> reported that pulsatile perfusion was less frequently associated with SIRS and the increase in IL-8 and endothelin-1 levels was lower with pulsatile perfusion compared to non-pulsatile perfusion in CPB. Baseline IL-8 levels were similar in all three groups in our study. Significant increase was noted at 0, 6 and 24 hours postoperatively in all three groups. The increase in IL-8 levels at 24 hours was significantly lower in the off-pump group compared to the other two groups.</p>
<p>IL-6 is released from neutrophils and mononuclear phagocytic cells in response to infection, major surgery and thermal injury. IL-6 stimulates the adhesive interaction between neutrophils and cardiac myocytes. It is highly sensitive in predicting the inflammatory response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0267659111424639">17</xref></sup>. CPB has been demonstrated to increase the release of IL-6, and anti-IL-6 treatment has been shown to prevent myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury developed after CPB<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0267659111424639">17</xref></sup>. In a study evaluating the effects of CABG performed with or without CPB on systemic inflammation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0267659111424639">18</xref></sup>, IL-6 levels were found to be similar in both groups at baseline. While the values peaked at 4 hours after the operation, and the increase was maintained until 24 hours in the CPB group, IL-6 levels reached peak 8 hours after reperfusion in the off-pump CABG group. Moreover, the levels were found to be significantly lower at 0.5 and 4 hours after the surgery compared to the CPB group. Baseline IL-6 levels were similar in all three groups in our study. A significant increase in IL-6 levels was noted at 0, 6 and 24 hours postoperatively compared to baseline in all three groups. The increase observed at 24 hours in the off-pump CABG group was lower compared to the other two groups.</p>
<p>Similar to our study, the effects of off-pump CABG, non-pulsatile and pulsatile CABG on endothelial activation and inflammatory response were investigated in another study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0267659111424639">9</xref></sup> and the increase in inflammatory markers and cytokine response following bypass was found to be lowest in the off-pump CABG group. Rimmele et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0267659111424639">19</xref></sup> compared the effects of off-pump CABG and on-pump CABG on inflammatory response (TNF-α, IL-6, IL-10, procalcitonin) and found that all of these four mediators were increased during surgery and returned to normal levels postoperatively. No significant difference was found between these two groups in terms of mediator levels at any time point.</p>
<p>S-100 protein is an acidic calcium-binding protein which is present in high concentrations in Schwann and glial cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0267659111424639">20</xref></sup>. Being an intracellular protein, S-100 protein functions as an intracellular calcium receptor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0267659111424639">21</xref></sup>. Some of its functions include intercellular communication, cell structure, growth, energy metabolism, contraction, intracellular conduction, progression of axonal growth, glial proliferation, and neuronal differentiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0267659111424639">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0267659111424639">21</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>S-100β protein cannot be detected in serum in normal circumstances. Several studies have shown that it can be detected in serum following head injury, subarachnoidal hemorrhage, CPB, and stroke<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0267659111424639">22</xref></sup>. S-100β protein is thermostable. Its serum levels are not affected by protamine, heparin and hemolysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0267659111424639">20</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Serum S-100β protein level is increased in patients who have undergone CPB, due to impairment of the blood-brain barrier and, in parallel, to the direct and embolic effects of the pump<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0267659111424639">23</xref></sup>. Moddy et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0267659111424639">24</xref></sup> have shown that CPB disrupts the blood-brain barrier and leads to the dilatation of small capillaries and arterioles in the brain.</p>
<p>S-100β protein is released at two different time points in patients undergoing CPB. Early S-100β protein release is observed at the termination of CPB, and it indicates perioperative brain damage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0267659111424639">20</xref></sup>. The second peak of S-100β protein release occurs between postoperative 15 and 48 hours and indicates the presence of a cerebral complication. Iriz et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0267659111424639">6</xref></sup> investigated the effects of using pump prime solutions containing hydroxyethyl starch (HES) or crystalloid Ringer lactate (RL) in CPB on S-100β protein level and cognitive tests. They noted that the increase in S-100β protein level was less and there was no significant change in cognitive tests in the HES group while there was an increase in S-100β protein level between 5 and 24 hours and a significant change in cognitive tests in the RL group<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0267659111424639">6</xref></sup>. In our study, the most significant increase in S-100β protein level was noted at 0 hours postoperatively in all three groups and the increase in S-100β protein level at 6 and 24 hours after surgery was lower in the off-pump CABG group compared to both pulsatile and non-pulsatile on-pump CABG groups. S-100β protein level, which peaks immediately after CPB, is decreased at 24 hours postoperatively in 11-87% of the patients without any neurological damage. Early mild cognitive impairment associated with the increase in S-100β protein level following CPB is observed in 70% of the patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0267659111424639">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0267659111424639">25</xref></sup>. The increase in S-100β protein level is caused by the increased permeability and diffuse microembolism and leads to subclinical damage in the patients. Irreversible neural damage has not been reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0267659111424639">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0267659111424639">25</xref></sup>. We also found that the increase in S-100β protein level was most prominent in the early postoperative period in all three groups and showed a tendency to decrease within 24 hours. The decrease was more prominent in the off-pump CABG group compared to the pulsatile and non-pulsatile CABG groups. No neurological deficits were observed in any of the patients in our study.</p>
