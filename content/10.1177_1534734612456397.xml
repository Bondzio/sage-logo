<abstract>
<p>Three cases of skull osteomyelitis due to electrical burn and delayed wound closure are presented. For better estimating skull damage before operation, 3-dimensional reconstruction of computed tomography scan images were used. Three-dimensional computed tomography could provide superior and visible stereoscopic images and help clinicians “see” the damage before operation and make more detailed therapeutic planning.</p>

<p>High-tension or low-tension electrical injury can cause full-thickness scalp burn, and in some cases, the energy even causes severe damage to the skull. Many reports have proved the priority of early debridement of necrotic tissues, followed immediately by grafting of flaps.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1534734612456397">1</xref></sup> But the debridement of affected skull tends to be relatively conservative,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1534734612456397">2</xref></sup> because many doctors consider nonviable bone as good scaffolds for new bone regeneration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1534734612456397">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1534734612456397">4</xref></sup> and believe that too aggressive debridement of skull may lead to detrimental consequence after exposure of brain tissue.</p>
<p>However, when the damage to the scalp is not dealt with properly early after injury, infection of the scalp and the underlying skull can occur. Chronic skull osteomyelitis under the flap and sinus is formed. Spontaneous separation of necrotic skull is slow and mostly takes several months or even longer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1534734612456397">5</xref></sup> In these cases, the necrotic bone is no longer suitable for bone regeneration and the debridement of necrotic bone should be carried out so as to control the infection and promote wound recovery.</p>
<p>When wound healing is delayed and a sinus is formed under the flap, it is easily concluded that there is sequestration under the flap, but it is difficult to predict the condition before operation. Traditional skull damage evaluation relies on the interpretation of 2-dimensional (2D) data obtained from radiographs and conventional computed tomography (CT) scans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1534734612456397">5</xref></sup> in combination with clinical examinations, which is not adequate enough to provide an accurate view about wound position and appearances pertaining to anatomical structures.</p>
<p>If the damage could be “seen” before an operation, we could make a detailed plan for surgery and better predict the related risks, and also we could give the patient a more direct-viewing image so as to promote doctor–patient communication.</p>
<p>The introduction of 3D CT reconstruction provides clinicians with more accurate 3D images of the skull without an increase in X-ray exposure. This technique has already been successfully used in many clinical fields for years<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1534734612456397">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1534734612456397"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1534734612456397">8</xref></sup>; it makes a superior and visible stereoscopic image and help doctors make more precise operation plans.</p>
<p>In our burn center, doctors usually preserve the nonviable skull and cover the defect with flaps, which always achieves good healing. For cases that failed to heal, we use 3D reconstruction images of CT scans to evaluate the skull damage, and we find it useful to determine bone damage and predict surgical risk before an operation (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1534734612456397">Figures 1</xref><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1534734612456397"/>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1534734612456397">3</xref>).</p>

<caption><p>An 11-year-old boy suffered from an electrical contact burn of 1000 V on the head</p>
<p>On postburn day 13, after excision of the necrotic scalp, an adjacent flap was used to cover the defect. But the flap failed to cover the wound and resulted in skull exposure a month later. The central area of the exposed skull gradually separated and was removed gradually. When the boy was admitted to our center 5 months postburn, an 8 cm × 12 cm occipital bone was exposed with a 4 cm × 4 cm skull defect in the central area. Granulation tissue was observed on cerebral dura mater. The wound culture showed a mixed bacterial infection of <italic>Escherichia coli, Acinetobacter baumannii</italic>, and <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>. After a short time of wound preparation, the debridement of necrotic skull (only the necrotic bone around the exposed cerebral dura mater was removed) was performed, followed by a superficial temporal artery flap grafting to fully cover the defect. After operation, a sinus was formed with moderate excretion. Two months later, 3D CT scanning indicated sequestration of skull bone, then the debridement of necrotic bones was carried out and the wound healed finally. During operation, it was found that the shape of the spontaneously separated skull was very identical to the reconstructed image of 3D CT. (A) Wound appearance on admission: an 8 cm × 12 cm occipital bone is exposed with a skull defect of size 4 cm × 4 cm in the central area; granulation tissue is observed on the cerebral dura mater; wound culture shows a mixed bacterial infection. (B) Wound healing after 2 operations. (C, D) The 3D CT images of the cranium show sequestration. (E) The necrotic bones were removed in the operation.</p></caption>

<caption><p>A 46-year-old male had cranial burn injury due to electrical contact of 380 V</p>
<p>On postburn day 25, the full-thickness burned scalp was removed and the exposed cranium was covered with a local scalp flap. After operation, the wound healed evenly and the patient was discharged from hospital. Two months later, an empyema was formed under the flap. A reconstruction of 3D CT images showed a necrotic cranium separated from the adjacent bone, which was confirmed in the operation. A 6 cm × 8 cm necrotic skull was removed and wound closure achieved.

<caption><p>A 22-year-old male suffered from electric burn of 10 000 V on the head, combined with intracranial hematoma</p>
<p>Hematoma evacuation and decompressive craniectomy were performed on postburn day 1. One month later, he was transferred to our center. On admission, the physical examination found that a 17 cm × 12 cm full-thickness scalp defect presented, with 7 cm × 6.5 cm skull and cerebral dura mater defect; the exposed brain tissue was protruded for 3.5 cm; the pus culture confirmed a mixed infection of MRSA and <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>. During the following 2 months, 2 operations were carried out to cover the exposed skull and brain tissue with local scalp flaps. In the operation, the debridement of skull was relatively conservative and only the necrotic bone near the exposed brain tissue was removed. Although the skull and brain tissue were covered, the suture edge near the exposed brain tissue did not heal and a sinus formed. The reconstruction image of 3D CT revealed skull osteomyelitis with worm-bite appearance. During operation, it was found that the necrotic bones scattered piece by piece and could be easily removed. (A) Wound appearance on admission. Scalp flap appears dry and necrotic, and the suture edge is split. (B) After the debridement of necrotic tissues, a 17 cm × 12 cm full-thickness scalp defect was present, with 7 cm × 6.5 cm skull and cerebral dura mater defect; the exposed brain tissue (white arrow) was protruded. (C) Drill holes on calvarium for granulation tissue growth but no improvement was observed. (D) The skull and brain tissue were covered with scalp flaps, but the suture edge near the exposed brain tissue does not heal and a sinus was formed. (E) The 3D CT image of the cranium shows sequestration and bone defect. White arrow indicates skull defect.</p></caption>

<p>In case 3, the necrotic bone is distributed over the bony suture area, and it is relatively dangerous to remove the necrotic bone because it may disrupt venous sinus below. So the operation should be prepared and conducted with more caution.</p>
<p>It is demonstrated that this method is helpful and useful in diagnosing potential problems that cannot be definitely diagnosed based on conventional radiology and clinical symptoms. However, 3D CT images only show the anatomic structure of skull, and the bone viability cannot be determined accordingly, thus bone scintigraphy should be employed in this condition.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1534734612456397">3</xref></sup></p>
