<p>Given modern scholarship’s notoriety in historical criticism of the New Testament as an agent of uncovering ‘true’, raw material behind the faith proclaimed in the Christian tradition, a study of ‘keys’ to Jerusalem from an authoritative Roman Catholic scholar with clear Christian commitment could face formidable rhetorical obstacles. Yet, once we consider the genre of his writing in supplementing biblical studies with archaeological and other sources, another picture emerges. And that is the one that Jerome Murphy O’Conner presents to us, supplying a rich historical context to give flesh to what Kenneth Cragg calls ‘theological geography’ (Cragg, ‘Muslim Christian Relationships at Large and the Focus of the Holy Land’, in D. M. A. Jaeger (ed.), <italic>Christianity in the Holy Land</italic> (Jerusalem: Franciscan Printing Press Jerusalem, 1981), p. 302). This is most apparent in discussing the site of what became known as the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, for which there seems to be hardly any doubt of authenticity (chapters 9, 10 and 11). O’Conner implicitly provides an argument for how Christians identify the mystery of God in the sheer fact of history and geography, in events, not in language or mystical speculation.</p>
<p>The book is a collocation of previously published essays, together with two newly published chapters and a helpful bibliography of sources for the study of Jerusalem. O’Conner focuses on ‘locations’ in Jerusalem as they relate to the origins and development of Christianity, its relation to the Jewish cult (chapters 1 and 2) and its future encounter with Islam (pp. 223–6). In doing so, he offers to us ‘keys’ that open up the landscape in which early communication about Jesus, his death and resurrection was the basis for the later evolution of a normative Christianity, and which still comprises a rich pluriformity of worship, tradition and perspective. Despite its roots in Hebrew Scripture, the Christian community was seen from very early on as distinct from the Jewish cult, in all its diversity, while the roots of the later Gentile Church ‘went back without interruption to the period of the ministry of Jesus’ (p. 174), though there might have been an absence of three years at the most after the Roman destruction of Jerusalem in <sc>ad</sc> 70 (p. 172). Belonging and commitment to Jesus was debated in the second-century writing of Justin Martyr (p. 23) and reflected in different references to ‘Jerusalem’ in Greek in the letter to the Galatians (Chapter 3). Against some scepticism about the ‘authenticity’ of John’s Gospel, archaeology affirms aspects of John’s narrative as trustworthy (pp. 19, 22) even on its timescale (Chapter 4). The unity of early Christians seems to have been based on its complex relation to the Jewish cult and Law, and focusing on the words, acts and death of Jesus (p. 23; chapters 5 and 6), making up a body seen as being a counter-temple, clearly stressed in the Pauline letters, the book of Revelation and foreshadowed in the Qumran literature (pp. 30–1). There is evidence for a New Testament Christianity of mutual dependence, care and interchange (Chapter 7) revealing the first historical reference to a church as a meeting place from very early on (pp. 123–4). The later descriptions of the development of the Christian Quarter and the extraordinary work of St John’s hospital reveal a more positive aspect of the Crusader period, where the ministry to the sick did not differentiate between Jews, Muslims and Christians (p. 266).</p>
<p>There is nothing dull in this book, and it is occasionally interrupted with O’Conner’s scholarly sense of humour. Sadly, many references in German and French are quoted in the original while occasionally Latin and Greek references are translated. Average readers may not relate to this easily.</p>
