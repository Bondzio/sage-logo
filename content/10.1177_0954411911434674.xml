<abstract>
<p>A significant amount of research has been undertaken to evaluate the function of implanted joint replacement components. Many of these studies require the acquisition of an accurate three-dimensional geometric model of the various implant components, using methods such as micro-computed tomography or laser scanning. The purpose of this study was to compare micro-computed tomography and laser scanning for obtaining component geometries. Five never-implanted polyethylene tibial inserts of one type were scanned with both micro-computed tomography and laser scanning to determine the repeatability of each method and measured for any deviations between the geometries acquired from the different scans. Overall, good agreement was found between the micro-computed tomography and laser scans, to within 71 µm on average. Micro-computed tomography was found to have superior repeatability to laser scanning (mean of 1 µm for micro-computed tomography versus 19 µm for laser scans). Micro-computed tomography may be preferred for visualizing small surface features, whereas laser scanning may be preferred for acquiring the geometry of metal objects to avoid computed tomography artifacts. In conclusion, the choice of micro-computed tomography versus laser scanning for acquiring orthopaedic component geometries will likely involve considerations of user preference, the specific application the scan will be used for, and the availability of each system.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Total joint replacement is considered the gold standard approach for treating end-stage osteoarthritis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954411911434674">1</xref></sup> A significant amount of research has been undertaken in the laboratory and the clinic to evaluate the function of implanted joint replacement components. Many of these studies require the acquisition of an accurate three-dimensional (3D) geometric model of the various implant components.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954411911434674">2</xref></sup> For example, in studies of implants retrieved from patients during revision surgery, using a reference geometry with an error of 50 µm in geometry, or 50 mm<sup>3</sup> in volume, could add or subtract a year’s worth of linear penetration or wear volume to the results.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0954411911434674">8</xref></sup> Recently, both micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) and laser scanning have been used to obtain orthopaedic component geometries for studying joint kinematics,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954411911434674">3</xref></sup> evaluating the manufacturing variability between components,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954411911434674">2</xref></sup> and measuring polyethylene wear.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954411911434674">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954411911434674">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>The purpose of this study was to compare micro-CT and laser scanning for obtaining component geometries. We evaluate the repeatability of each method, and measure the deviations between geometries of the same component acquired with each method. We hypothesized that the two methods would agree to within 100 µm.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>Five new, never-implanted cruciate retaining Genesis II polyethylene tibial inserts (Smith &amp; Nephew, Memphis, TN) were obtained, size 3–4 and 11 mm thickness. In addition, a posterior stabilized Genesis II tibial insert, size 5–6 and 11 mm, was obtained from a revision surgery after being implanted in a patient for seven years. A matching new, never implanted tibial insert of the same size and type as the retrieved tibial insert was also obtained for use in quantifying the surface damage owing to wear on the retrieved insert.</p>
<p>All of the inserts were scanned with a laboratory micro-CT scanner (eXplore Vision 120, GE Healthcare, London, ON). The five cruciate retaining inserts were each scanned three times, while the retrieved insert and its unworn reference were scanned once. The inserts were scanned at 50 µm isotropic voxel spacing, with an x-ray tube voltage of 90 kVp and current of 40 mA. For each scan, 1200 views were obtained in 0.3°  increments, and 10 frames were averaged per view at an exposure time of 16 ms per frame. These scan parameters resulted in an acquisition duration of approximately 100 minutes. Each scan was reconstructed at the full 50 µm isotropic voxel spacing and analyzed with micro-CT analysis software (MicroView, GE Healthcare, London, ON). Isosurface rendering of the insert geometry was performed at the highest possible quality, using a threshold automatically determined by the software. The threshold was determined as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954411911434674">5</xref></sup> by using the method of Otsu et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954411911434674">6</xref></sup> in which the optimal threshold separating two classes (in this case the background air and the polyethylene tibial insert) is calculated to minimize their spreads. The resulting 3D geometry was saved as a stereolithography file format.</p>
<p>In preparation for laser scanning, the components were coated with SKD-S2 developing powder (Spotcheck Developer, Magnaflux, Glenview, IL). The components were then clamped at each end and held vertically for scanning by a hand-held laser scanner (ScanWorks V4i, Perceptron, Plymouth, MI) attached to an articulating CMM arm (Romer 5024-SC Infinite Series, Hexagon Metrology, North Kingstown, RI). As with the micro-CT scans, the five cruciate retaining inserts were each scanned three times, while the retrieved insert and its unworn reference were scanned once. Surface scans were completed using a maximum edge length of 2.5 mm, interpolation step of 0.25 mm, and maximum angle of 85°. Surface rendering of the insert geometry was performed using reverse engineering software (PolyWorks, InovMetric Software, Quebec, QC). Stitching of the individual laser scans was accomplished using the features of the PolyWorks software. Each alignment was initialized using three reference points, then a linear least-squares alignment technique was used to iteratively apply incremental transformation matrices to minimize the 3D differences between surface overlaps. The resulting 3D surface geometry was saved as a stereolithography file format.</p>
<p>A custom software application<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954411911434674">2</xref></sup> was used to average multiple scans of each insert and to quantify the deviations between the geometries acquired from micro-CT and laser scanning. The application co-aligns a source tibial insert surface to a target surface using an iterative closest points algorithm, with convergence set for when the root mean square average distance dropped below 0.1 µm for 1000 sample points. The 3D deviations between the two surfaces are calculated continuously across the entire geometry and mapped, and the geometries of the two surfaces are then averaged.</p>
<p>The repeatability of the two scanning methods was determined by loading the three scans of each tibial insert into the software program, for each of micro-CT and laser scanning. The calculated 3D surface deviations were then visualized in ParaView (Kitware Inc., Clifton Park, NY). A region of interest (ROI) was selected, in turn, on the left- and right-hand side of the articular surface and the backside surface of the geometry. The ROIs were approximately 15 × 25 mm in dimension and contained thousands of points of calculated deviations. From these points the mean and standard deviation (SD) of the deviations within the ROI were calculated.</p>
<p>The three scan geometries of each tibial insert were averaged together for both methods, producing a single-averaged geometry of each tibial insert from each of micro-CT and laser scanning. This minimized the contribution of between-scan variability for comparing the micro-CT and laser scan derived geometries. The micro-CT and laser scanned geometries for the five tibial inserts were loaded into the software program in pairs, and the 3D deviations between the two were calculated. The deviation maps were again visualized in ParaView and deviations were calculated in the same three ROIs.</p>
<p>A surface deviation map of the retrieved insert was created by loading the retrieved insert geometry and reference (never-implanted) insert geometry into the software program. Two deviation maps were created, one from micro-CT scans and one from laser scans.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Both the micro-CT and laser scans produced complete reconstructions of the tibial insert surfaces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954411911434674">Figure 1</xref>). The micro-CT geometries were constructed from a mean of 4 million polygons, while the laser scan geometries had a mean of 79 thousand polygons. The micro-CT scanner was significantly more repeatable than laser scanning (p &lt; 0.001; paired t-test). The mean variation across the surface of the tibial inserts between scans was 1 µm for micro-CT, and 19 µm for laser scanning. Laser scanning produced significantly greater volumes than micro-CT, with a mean volume difference of 424 mm<sup>3</sup> (p &lt; 0.001; paired t-test). The mean volume of the tibial insert geometries from micro-CT was 27,424 ± 54 mm<sup>3</sup>, versus 27,848 ± 55 mm<sup>3</sup> from laser scanning.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Overall, we found good agreement between the micro-CT and laser scans, to within 71 µm on average. Micro-CT was found to have superior repeatability to laser scanning. The variability between scans using laser scanning at 19 µm is comparable to the reported manufacturing variability for one type of tibial insert of 15 µm.<sup>2</sup> There appeares to be a consistently greater amount of deviation (between the two types of scans) on the left-hand side of the articular surface across all of the tibial inserts. For this study, a hand-held laser scanner was used, and a spray coating was applied to tibial inserts to reduce the specular reflectivity of the surfaces. Both are potential sources of error and could explain the deviations found between the two methods. In particular, the greater deviation found on the left-hand side of the articular surface could arise from the vertical scanning of the tibial inserts, during which the laser beam would deviate from a perpendicular angle, reducing the accuracy of its measurements. The dimensional increase created by the spray coating could also explain the slightly greater volume found from using the laser scanning when compared to micro-CT (i.e. 1.5% increase). Using an automated laser scanner rather than a hand-held model might reduce these small deviations in future studies.</p>
<p>The micro-CT scanning and reconstruction parameters can also affect the accuracy of the models. Setting the threshold for isosurface rendering too high would underestimate the volume of the geometry. This is an alternative explanation for the greater volumes found with laser scanning, however, the method used in this study for selecting the isosurface threshold has been found to be accurate when compared against gravimetric analysis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954411911434674">5</xref></sup> Scanning parameters can also have an affect on the rendered geometry, particularly in the discretization of the edges of the component, as well as damage features on the component surfaces. The most obvious parameter that can affect discretization of the geometry is the voxel spacing of both the scan and reconstructed volume, however, the number of views and number of frames per view are also important considerations, as they affect the amount of noise in the acquisition. Trade-offs do exist with these parameters, however. Scanners that offer a very high resolution (i.e. 10 µm) typically have small fields of view, and scans that combine a high resolution with a large field of view result in large volume sizes (i.e. multiple gigabytes). Increasing the number of views and/or number of frames averaged per view increases the scan duration, and offers limited improvement above a certain number of views and frames. Finally, the orientation of the component within the scanner field of view can also affect the accuracy of the resulting geometry.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954411911434674">5</xref></sup> It was previously determined that placing the components at a double-oblique angle resulted in the most accurate images;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954411911434674">5</xref></sup> such an orientation was used in this study. No obvious geometric distortion from the cone-beam reconstruction was observed.</p>
<p>An iterative closest points (ICP) algorithm was used to co-align the geometries derived from micro-CT and laser scanning, with this alignment serving as the basis for the measurements of the deviations between the two methods. Local convergence of mismatched or poorly matched regions can produce erroneous results. These situations typically arise from point-set outliers, sample-point clustering, too many or too few sample pairs, and poor positional initialization. Our implementation of the ICP algorithm has previously been validated for use in registering polyethylene tibial inserts,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954411911434674">2</xref></sup> achieving root-mean-square values of 0.1 µm from good positional initialization and optimization of the number and distribution of sample-point pairings. The rigid nature of the tibial inserts, similar geometries, and density of the points in the point-cloud data also served to reduce the potential for error with the ICP algorithm.</p>
<p>Although differences in the surface geometries created by the two methods were found, excellent agreement was observed between the deviation maps of the retrieved tibial insert derived from micro-CT and laser scanning. Any potential errors in geometry reconstruction when using a single acquisition method will be reproduced equally across all acquisitions and, therefore, may not have as great an impact as the differences seen when comparing the two methods.</p>
<p>Each method is associated with its own advantages and disadvantages. Micro-CT requires a long scan duration (100 min for this study) to acquire images and a further 60 min to reconstruct the images at full resolution. However, this time is automated and requires only a few minutes of user intervention to set up. Post-processing is also mostly automated and takes under 10 min to segment the object from the scan volume and generate a 3D surface. Laser scanning, in contrast, requires much less time to scan the object but significant post-processing time to generate a 3D surface. Stitching of multiple laser scans of a single object may also be required. Spray coating to reduce glare from specular objects may also be required, which might affect the accuracy of the obtained geometry or may even be prohibitive in some applications. Each method is also associated with certain capabilities the other lacks. For example, micro-CT can detect small features on the components (such as the pits seen on the deviation map of the retrieved insert in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954411911434674">Figure 3</xref>), and reconstructs the interior of the component, allowing its subsurface to be visualized and analysed for changes, such as fatigue cracking.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0954411911434674">7</xref></sup> The micro-CT technique performed well in this study of plastic components, but micro-CT of metal components can result in significant artifacts in image acquisitions, which do not occur with laser scanning. The size of the object to be scanned is also a consideration. Laser scanning may be utilized with relatively large objects, however the micro-CT scanner used for this study has a per-scan field of view of approximately 6 × 6 × 6 cm (although multiple acquisitions can be stitched axially). The size of a micro-CT scanner field of view is usually inversely proportional to the resolution that it can achieve.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we found micro-CT and laser scanning to produce comparable 3D surface geometries of polyethylene orthopaedic components. Micro-CT acquired geometries at a higher resolution with less variability between scans. Either technique can create surface deviation maps of wear and creep in a retrieved polyethylene tibial insert. For certain applications – such as examining small pits and scratches – micro-CT may be superior, whereas laser scanning may be superior for acquiring the geometry of metal objects. The choice of micro-CT versus laser scanning for acquiring orthopaedic component geometries will likely involve considerations of user preference, the specific application the scan will be used for, and the availability of each system.</p>
