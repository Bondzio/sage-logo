<abstract>
<p>Succession literature addressed factors affecting the development of successors’ leadership skills. Yet the role professional advisors play in this process is not well understood. This study contrasts the detailed descriptions of four advisor-directed leadership development processes, to suggest a grounded theory of how advisors can facilitate the construction of successors’ leadership. Adopting an insider–outsider approach to the collection and analysis of ethnographic data, the study revealed that the assumption of a transitional leadership role by advisors—an interim leadership held by the advisor while supporting the successor’s leadership development—was critical to moving the succession process forward.</p>

<p>Although one of the most central problems faced by family-owned businesses is developing an ability to ensure competent family leadership across generations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0894486513490796">Lansberg, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0894486513490796">Le Breton-Miller, Miller, &amp; Steier, 2004</xref>), there has been limited attention toward developing a systematic understanding of how successors’ leadership is best nurtured and developed. Focus in the literature on succession has been primarily on developing successors’ business knowledge and technical skills, typically through the acquisition of professional experience outside the family firm, or through on-the-job training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0894486513490796">Sardeshmukh &amp; Corbett, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0894486513490796">Stewart &amp; Hitt, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0894486513490796">Venter, Boshoff, &amp; Maas, 2005</xref>). In addition, the development of successors’ leadership has been primarily interpreted as resulting more from incumbents letting go and transferring their power and roles, than from successors developing their legitimacy within the family and the firm and constructing their own leadership profile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0894486513490796">Cadieux, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0894486513490796">Chlosta, Patzelt, Klein, &amp; Dormann, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0894486513490796">De Massis, Chua, &amp; Chrisman, 2008</xref>). As a result, we currently have a limited and relatively narrow understanding of how successors develop and establish their leadership within the complex web of relationships characterizing a family firm, including relationships with important actors external to both the controlling family and the family firm.</p>
<p>Recently, theorists have begun to conceptualize leadership as a broad process, involving multiple individuals engaged in activities of interpersonal and mutual influence embedded within a collective such as the organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0894486513490796">DeRue &amp; Ashford, 2010</xref>). Therefore, understanding how an individual’s leadership is arrived at requires integrating across three levels: individual, relational, and collective. Leadership development and the construction of a leadership profile are hence increasingly seen as resulting from a web of complex relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0894486513490796">Kouzes &amp; Posner, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Within this richer framework, the role played by outside, nonfamily professionals is essential in developing a fully blown understanding of how successors develop and establish their leadership. The limited literature on supporting next-generation leaders in family firms highlights the role of either senior family members, or senior nonfamily managers in mentoring successors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0894486513490796">Boyd, Upton, &amp; Wircenski, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0894486513490796">Cater &amp; Justis, 2009</xref>). In contrast, until recently leadership coaching professionals were almost totally unaware of the features differentiating between family firms and other businesses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0894486513490796">Strike, 2012</xref>). Traditional leadership coaching models were hence proposed to address the needs of family firms, without incorporating the presence of multiple systems and resulting diverse challenges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0894486513490796">Shams &amp; Lane, 2011</xref>). In this study, we hence address the research question of how advisors affect the knowledge, relational, and social processes through which successors develop a leadership profile and skills.</p>
<p>Given the unsatisfactory outcomes that may result from partial approaches to succession and leadership development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0894486513490796">Mitchell, Morse, &amp; Sharma, 2003</xref>), in this study we propose a grounded model of advisor-directed successors’ leadership development. We delimit our analysis by focusing on support provided by professional advisors to those next-generation members who were already singled-out by at least some members of the controlling family as potentially suitable to cover leading management (CEO) or governance (chairman or board director) positions within the family firm. We do so by means of four comparative case studies of leadership development processes characterized by different levels of leadership attainment.</p>
<p>The outcome of the analysis is a process model of advisor-supported leadership development offering both theoretical and practical insights into this highly relevant advisory role. In particular, our data reveal that advisors may offer a significant contribution to the development of a successor’s leadership by taking on a <italic>transitional leadership role</italic>. This role—which is a novel addition to both the leadership and succession literatures—implies the development of an interim shared leadership involving the incumbent leader, the successor, and the advisor. The transitional leadership role assumed by the advisor supports the successor in his or her individual internalization of leadership skills, provides relational recognition to the successor’s leadership, and facilitates the collective endorsement of the successor’s leadership by members of the controlling family and by nonfamily employees. The concept of transitional leadership that emerged from this study offers theoretical contributions to both the family business and organizational leadership literatures, along with important managerial implications.</p>
<sec id="section1-0894486513490796">
<title>Theoretical Background</title>
<p>Ensuring competent family leadership across generations is one of the main concerns that family firms face. Leadership transfer in family firms is difficult because of the usually limited pool of talented individuals on which even large controlling families can draw, and to the complex social ties and related emotional factors characterizing relationships within, and also outside, the controlling family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0894486513490796">Le Breton-Miller et al., 2004</xref>). Existing family business literature has tended to downplay this complexity by envisioning succession as transfer of the leadership role from the incumbent leader to a next-generation member. In contrast, recent literature on leadership offers a more nuanced view of succession as a social process through which leadership is gradually constructed through the contribution of a broad group of actors within and outside the organization. We separately discuss these two approaches highlighting the role that external actors, such as advisors, play in the construction of successors’ leadership.</p>
<sec id="section2-0894486513490796">
<title>Succession as Leadership Role Transfer in the Family Business Literature</title>
<p>Within current family business literature, the succession process is often interpreted as the set of actions, events, and organizational mechanisms by which leadership, ownership, and knowledge are transferred (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0894486513490796">Cater &amp; Justis, 2009</xref>). This view limits succession to the transfer of a set of tangible and intangible assets, including the leadership role, from the incumbent generation to the next. The nuanced and complex social interactions involving not only the incumbent leader and the chosen successor but also all family and nonfamily members, are hence often overlooked.</p>
<p>Succession in family firms is often interpreted as the replacement of the founder or the incumbent management with a member of the next generation of the controlling family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0894486513490796">De Massis et al., 2008</xref>). An established approach describes succession as a mutual role adjustment between the members of the incumbent and those of successor generations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0894486513490796">Handler, 1990</xref>). Therefore, development of the successor is modeled as a series of steps or milestones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0894486513490796">Cater &amp; Justis, 2009</xref>) through which formal power, ownership, and business knowledge are transferred from the incumbent to the next-generation leader.</p>
<p>These steps are premised on a strong commitment by the successor to become a successful leader (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0894486513490796">Barach &amp; Gantisky, 1995</xref>), hence assuming that leadership is something that is nearly automatically and uneventfully developed by the successor, by virtue of his or her position within the controlling family. On entering the family business, the successor gradually learns about the processes and people involved. He or she then moves into a lower management position and gradually reaches the upper echelons after winning the approval of the incumbent generation. Finally, full ownership and decision power are transferred to the successor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0894486513490796">Dyck, Mauws, Starke, &amp; Mischke, 2002</xref>). Although this focus on leadership and ownership transfer between the incumbent and the next generation captures an essential dimension of all succession processes, it falls short of describing how leadership is developed both in the mind of the next-generation leader, and in those of his or her followers, including former leaders of the senior generation. In particular, focusing mainly on the dyadic transfer between the incumbent management and next-generation leaders hampers an understanding of the subtle processes through which a large number of actors, including external advisors, contribute to the creation of a leadership that is accepted by all actors involved.</p>

<title>From Leadership Role Transfer to the Leadership Construction Process</title>
<p>Addressing succession as transfer of the leadership role has left a number of important issues unresolved. Transfer of a formal position from the incumbent to the successor clearly conveys some meaning with respect to leadership. However, it does not explain why some successors are not seen as leaders even after the formal transfer of ownership and decision power, or why some former incumbents are still seen as leaders despite having transferred their “leader-like” positions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0894486513490796">Cater &amp; Justis, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0894486513490796">De Massis et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0894486513490796">Le Breton-Miller et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Recently, scholars have developed an agreement about the fact that leadership is a mutual influence process independent of any formal role or hierarchical structure and often diffused among the members of an organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0894486513490796">Carson, Tesluk, &amp; Marrone, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0894486513490796">DeRue &amp; Ashford, 2010</xref>). If leadership is a state of being that organizational actors can take on irrespective of their formal role or position within an organization, and if it does not simply result from one’s position in an institutionalized hierarchy, the question of how leadership and leader–follower relationships develop in family firms becomes fundamental. A compelling answer to this question was recently offered within organizational theory through frameworks that explain the development of a leadership relationship—versus static leadership roles—composed of reciprocal and mutually reinforcing identities of organizational agents who see themselves as either leaders or followers. This relationship is endorsed and reinforced within a broader context that includes external actors, and is dynamic over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0894486513490796">DeRue &amp; Ashford, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Although these theories were not developed to target the specific case of leadership succession in family firms, they provide important insights. A leadership role is constructed along three levels: individual, relational, and collective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0894486513490796">Brewer &amp; Gardner, 1996</xref>). First, through <italic>individual internalization</italic>, an individual (e.g., a next-generation successor) comes to incorporate the leader role as part of his or her self-concept. This is not simply an intraindividual cognitive assessment, but the result of specific social interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0894486513490796">DeRue, Ashford, &amp; Cotton, 2009</xref>). Second, the leader role internalized by the individual must be strengthened by <italic>relational recognition</italic>, which means that somebody else within the organization recognizes the individual as a leader and takes on a reciprocal follower position. Finally, leader role is strengthened by <italic>collective endorsement</italic>, which implies being seen as a leader by the broader social environment. This endorsement may either come from other individuals (e.g., a member of the senior generation or a nonfamily manager addressing a next-generation member as the leader) or the social context (e.g., influential suppliers or customers recognizing the leadership role of a next-generation member; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0894486513490796">Brewer &amp; Gardner, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0894486513490796">DeRue &amp; Ashford, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Understanding how the leadership construction process unfolds is important since individual identities as next-generation leader, next-generation follower, or former-incumbent follower are significant drivers of these individuals’ thought, affect, motivation, and action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0894486513490796">Day &amp; Harrison, 2007</xref>). In particular, a deeper understanding of how leadership is constructed in next-generation members would help explain and predict whether individuals will actually relate with each other as leaders, followers, and former leaders turned into followers. For instance, the development of a strong leadership by the successor implies that there is greater acceptance of the right of the person constructed as next-generation leader to exert influence over the other family business members, including former senior-generation incumbents. On the opposite, when a strong leadership is not constructed, we expect increased conflicts and tensions in the relationship between the new leader and followers from both the previous and the next generation.</p>
<p>As the process of leadership construction is inherently social, it involves not only those members of the controlling family who are directly implicated in the succession process but also all family and nonfamily members of the firm, and a number of key external constituents. In this article, focus is on the advisors’ role in the three stages of a leader’s role construction: individual internalization, relational recognition, and collective endorsement.</p>

<title>Empirical Setting and Research Design</title>
<p>The empirical setting we selected for this study included four medium-to-large family firms. To minimize external variation beyond the phenomenon of interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0894486513490796">Eisenhardt, 1989</xref>), we selected four cases that were homogeneous under three theoretically relevant dimensions. First, all four family firms were headquartered within the same geographical area of one of the main European countries, due to the potentially relevant role of cultural issues in affecting leadership development, succession issues, and attitude toward external advisors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0894486513490796">Gaines, Gurung, Lin, &amp; Pouli, 2006</xref>). Second, we built a non–gender-neutral sample—all advisors and successors were males—because of the relevant role that gender plays in shaping succession and leadership attainment and outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0894486513490796">Ryan &amp; Haslam, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0894486513490796">Vera &amp; Dean, 2005</xref>). Third, we only selected leadership-development processes aimed at growing successors into top managerial (CEO) or governance (chairman) positions, as processes aimed at developing leaders in middle-management or nonmanagerial positions differ substantially in terms of both content and flow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0894486513490796">Boyd et al., 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>Besides these forced similarities, the four family firms were active in four different industries (energy, fashion, molding, and textile), and were characterized by different features in terms of family structure and relationships, previous job experience of the successor within and outside the family firm, duration of the advising process, and key critical incidents observed. In particular, Firm 1 was listed on the stock exchange and had a majority of nonfamily managers and directors, Firms 2 and 3 were entirely owned by a single family branch, whereas Firm 4 was entirely owned by three branches of the same family. In addition, key management positions were covered by family members in Firms 2 to 4, but the board of directors of Firm 4 had a significant presence of independent, nonfamily directors. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0894486513490796">Table 1</xref> provides a structured comparison of the four cases under relevant dimensions.</p>

<p>The Advisor in these two cases was the second author, hence providing an insider’s perspective to the analysis of processes characterized by both types of leadership outcomes (i.e., accomplished and developing).</p>
</fn>
</table-wrap-foot>
</table-wrap>
<p>Two of the firms (1 and 4 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0894486513490796">Table 1</xref>) were selected among those in which the second author had personally advised a successor-generation member. In these two cases, the second author played the role of the participant insider and was hence interviewed by the first author as an informant. The other two cases were selected through the first author’s personal network to maximize similarity and variance along selected variables. We hence adopted a discovery-oriented interpretive approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0894486513490796">Locke, 2011</xref>), emphasizing the “insider” perspective of informants and of the second author who experienced events, while accounting for the first author’s “outsider” perspective of researchers attempting to describe the experienced phenomena at a theoretical level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0894486513490796">Bartunek &amp; Louis, 1996</xref>). The strength of this explicit choice of methodological approach to case selection and to data collection and analysis results from the second author’s “insider” involvement in the process. This experience was invaluable in capturing subtle, often confidential relational and psychological issues informing the leadership development process, which could only be indirectly determined in the other two cases.</p>
<p>As it is apparent by contrasting cases in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0894486513490796">Table 1</xref>, the four firms were selected to form two matched pairs. Case 1 and Case 2 provide evidence of accomplished leadership in governance and management roles, respectively. In contrast, Case 3 and Case 4 provide evidence of leadership positions that are still developing, and even challenged in the latter case. This choice allowed us to contrast the four cases along the criterion variable—leadership development.</p>

<sec id="section6-0894486513490796">
<title>Data Collection</title>
<p>Before starting primary data gathering, secondary data were collected (books, company and industry reports, newspaper clips, company websites) to familiarize with the company history and activities through the development of an extensive case report for each firm. However, the key data source was represented by extensive ethnographic interviews (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0894486513490796">Spradley, 1979</xref>) aimed at capturing and contrasting the direct experience of the three key actors involved in each leadership development process: the advisor (in the remainder of the article indicated as Advisor or ADV), the successor-generation member (Junior or JUN), Junior’s father—or uncle, in the case in which the father was deceased (Senior or SEN). These retrospective interviews allowed us to cover the entire duration of the Advisor–Junior interaction. At the time interviews were performed, Advisors in Cases 1, 3, and 4 still had frequent contacts with Juniors, although in Cases 1 and 3 active coaching had just been interrupted and Junior’s leadership position established. A synthetic description of the key informants is reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0894486513490796">Table 2</xref>.</p>

<p>Ethnographic interviews were all performed by the first author, ranged between 2 and 5 hours, and were recorded and transcribed verbatim. Besides the notes taken during the interviews, an expanded account was made within 24 hours, to fill in details and to recall things that were not recorded on the spot. The expanded account took the form of an introspective record of field work, which enabled the interviewer to take into account personal biases and feelings, and to understand their influence on the research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0894486513490796">Emerson, Fretz, &amp; Shaw, 1995</xref>). Overall, we analyzed 242 pages of interview transcripts and 58 pages of interview notes and expanded accounts.</p>
<p>The interview guide (reported in the <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0894486513490796">appendix</xref>) included questions that could be compared across the three types of informants (ADV, JUN, SEN). A set of questions were hence identical, besides obvious adaptations, across informants. Interviews followed an episodic approach by focusing on specific <italic>mentoring episodes</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0894486513490796">Beal, Weiss, Barros, &amp; MacDermid, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0894486513490796">Ragins, 2012</xref>). Following an episodic approach in ethnographic interviewing implied that after a number of background and preliminary questions, the interview revolved around the identification and illustration of a specific behavioral episode, that is, a natural unit of activity that has recognizable thematic coherence, and that occurs at a specific point in time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0894486513490796">Beal et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0894486513490796">Ragins, 2012</xref>). Behavioral episodes in leadership coaching are usually nested within task and project episodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0894486513490796">Allen &amp; Poteet, 2011</xref>). For instance, a behavioral episode we observed within the CEO task was a specific meeting of the board of directors, whereas a behavioral episode within an acquisition project was a specific meeting with management of the target company.</p>
<p>In line with techniques for ethnographic interviewing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0894486513490796">Spradley, 1979</xref>), different types of questions were asked, such as “grand tour” questions (e.g., “Can you describe a specific episode in which you provided important support to [Name]?”), example questions (e.g., “Did you receive systematic support from other persons during the advising period? In what form? Can you provide a specific example?”), structural questions (e.g., “Can you describe all kinds of situations in which you have supported [Name]?”), and verification questions (e.g., “Can you think of other situations in which you provided support to [Name]?”).</p>

<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>As is typical in inductive multicase research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0894486513490796">Miles &amp; Huberman, 1994</xref>), we analyzed the data by first building individual case study summaries, synthesizing and comparing the interview transcripts and our field notes collected after the interviews. Throughout this process, the second author acted as a critical reviewer and interrogator of the first author to ensure the internal and external validity of the case summaries and emerging findings. When analyzing the cases, we first compared matched-pair polar types (e.g., Cases 1 and 2 characterized by accomplished leadership and Cases 3 and 4 characterized by developing—established or challenged—leadership; Cases 1 and 4 advised by the second author and Cases 2 and 3 advised by two different professional advisors). Subsequently, we used a replication logic to see whether the rest of the cases confirmed or refuted the emerging findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0894486513490796">Strauss &amp; Corbin, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>Extant literature was enfolded as insights were developed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0894486513490796">Eisenhardt, 1989</xref>). We looked for similar constructs emerging from the data, using tables and charts to facilitate comparison (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0894486513490796">Miles &amp; Huberman, 1994</xref>). We cycled through multiple readings of the data to develop a data structure. As such, we engaged in iterative coding (facilitated by the QSR-NVivo 8 qualitative software package) of recurring first-order categories, and crafting of emerging second-order categories and aggregate dimensions that helped us identify the unique features of the four advisors’ contribution to the development of successors’ leadership.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0894486513490796">Figure 1</xref> illustrates the structure and ordering of the data: from specific first-order categories used by informants, to more general researcher-induced second-order themes, and to aggregate second-order dimensions. Because of their direct relevance to next-generation leadership outcomes, the second-order themes and aggregate dimensions served as the basis for the subsequent grounded theory of advisor-directed leadership development in family firms.</p>

<title>Findings</title>
<p>The iterative process between data analysis, literature enfolding, and writing resulted in a grounded model of Junior’s leadership construction. Within this model, the Advisor plays a central role in balancing and harmonizing the contrasting forces affecting Junior’s leadership construction process. On one side (Dimension 1 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0894486513490796">Figure 1</xref>), the Advisor performs activities aimed at building the successor’s leadership role and at granting recognition to his or her leadership. On the other (Dimension 2 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0894486513490796">Figure 1</xref>), next-generation members—other than the selected successor, that is, siblings and cousins—pose threats to the successor’s role by both questioning his or her leadership, and by claiming a leadership role for themselves. By taking on a <italic>transitional leadership role</italic> (Dimension 3 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0894486513490796">Figure 1</xref>), shared with incumbent senior-generation leaders and the successor, the Advisor offers a role model to the Junior successor, endorses Junior’s leadership, and eventually withdraws from the transitional leadership role to further confirm Junior’s accomplished leadership.</p>
<p>In this section we separately illustrate selective evidence of each dimension of the grounded model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0894486513490796">Figure 2</xref>), displaying the emergence of Juniors’ clear and accepted leadership. To ground our findings in informants’ perspectives, besides evidence provided in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0894486513490796">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0894486513490796">Table 3</xref>, we include additional representative quotes from our ethnographic interviews.</p>

<title>Dimension 1: Advisor’s Support to Junior’s Leadership Construction</title>
<p>Advisors contributed to building the successor’s leadership role with two complementary activities. First, Advisors promoted, cultivated, and strengthened leadership abilities in Juniors (1a. <italic>Role building</italic>). Second, they performed activities aimed at making the successor’s leadership role explicit by claiming a role of followers for themselves and the other junior-generation members (1b. <italic>Leadership granting</italic>).</p>
<sec id="section10-0894486513490796">
<title>1a. Role Building</title>
<p>A key role of Advisors in the leadership development processes we observed consisted in eliciting the personal skills and abilities that were latent in successor-generation members. We labeled this task as <italic>role building</italic>. Role building did not imply direct involvement of the Advisor in any organizational task. On the opposite, these activities were often meant to prompt Junior to confront the hard facts and to learn directly from experience, hence eliciting his innate or learnt skills and abilities. As one advisor aptly phrased it,<disp-quote>
<p>If I were to explain it with a chemical analogy, I would define [my role] as “catalyzing”. A catalyst is an element that starts a chemical reaction without itself being involved in it. (ADV.3)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In the four cases we analyzed, role building consisted in helping Juniors develop their own problem-solving skills. Role-building interactions implied joint issue analysis by the Advisor and the Junior, followed by the Advisor prompting the Junior to develop alternative solutions and terminating with feedback from the Advisor. In one of the instances we observed (Case 4), the Advisor prompted Junior to autonomously develop alternative ways to evaluate an acquisition target, providing broad guidelines on how the task should be performed. As an alternative, the Advisor said, “we could do it together.” Junior felt challenged by the Advisor and decided to proceed autonomously. He sketched a number of alternatives and checked their validity through his network of friends active in investment banking. He later illustrated the two best alternatives to the Advisor, which were checked and successfully submitted to the board of directors. As the Advisor remarked at the end of the process,<disp-quote>
<p>We could have done it together, it was not difficult, but he would not have learnt. I didn’t give him a fish; I taught him to fish. (ADV.3)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Role building often included different possible dimensions of the focal problem: Junior’s knowledge and skills, his career and life development, interpersonal relationships with Advisor and with family and nonfamily members. All advisors we interviewed were quite systematic in covering all possible dimensions in each interaction with the successor:<disp-quote>
<p>With [Junior] there are always personal and firm issues that interact. There are personal issues related to his own development. Personal issues related to his relationship with the family and other persons. And firm-related issues in his role as CEO. I tend to talk about all three issues simultaneously each time we meet . . . At every meeting I also check his relationships mainly with his cousin, but also with the two other cousins he interacts with. I always make sure that we always consider these three dimensions jointly. (ADV.4)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This holistic approach to advising (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0894486513490796">Allen &amp; Poteet, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0894486513490796">Joseph, 2010</xref>), mirrored the multifaceted needs prompting Advisors’ intervention. As the Advisors we interviewed explicitly recognized, developing a successor’s leadership traits was only one dimension of their task. More important, helping a successor develop a leadership within the family firm was also meant as a way to fulfill his personal objectives and to contribute to the well-being of the whole family system. Under this respect, advisors recognized that their support may have provided a significant contribution to Junior’s development.</p>
<p>The outcomes of role-building processes were hence considered as positive when they triggered an overall enhancement of the person, rather than matching specific parameters:<disp-quote>
<p>[I value as positive] those changes that do not necessarily follow the direction I had theoretically indicated, but that simplify [Junior’s] life, that fulfill him in his relationships with others, in managing the firm, and hence not necessarily because [Junior] is matching what I originally had in mind. (ADV.1)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0894486513490796">
<title>1b. Leadership Granting</title>
<p>Leadership granting activities were aimed at securing Junior’s leadership role within the family and the firm by bestowing leadership features onto him. Leadership granting usually took the form of a set of communication activities and organizational or governance solutions aimed at supporting, affirming, and sanctioning the attained leadership level. The Advisors’ leadership granting role was essential to establishing leadership outcomes, because advisors often took on active leadership roles throughout the process, either in governance (chairman, vice-chairman, director), or as consultants in specific deals, hence sharing part of the leadership task with their protégées. Therefore, before leaving the stage, advisors had to make sure that the successor’s leadership was established and recognized through the following complementary activities. First, leadership granting often took the form of recognizing Junior’s accomplishments, especially when contrasting the Advisor’s advice:<disp-quote>
<p>Last year I suggested [Junior] to reduce production volumes. Luckily he did the contrary, because this allowed us to serve our customers better. (ADV.2)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Second, the importance of leadership granting is confirmed by the only case in which Junior’s developing leadership was challenged (Case 4). Here, leadership granting activities were paralleled by signals of a leadership role that had not matured yet:<disp-quote>
<p>As our Advisor clearly noticed, [Junior] should improve his speech abilities, he should learn to better express his thoughts. (SEN.4)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Third, these needs for improvement were paralleled by both self-awareness of a less-than-fully accomplished leadership (“I still have a problem of legitimization”; JUN.4), and by a preponderant role of the Advisor in shared leadership situations, such as when the Advisor and Junior interacted in executive committees, meetings with external partners, or board meetings:<disp-quote>
<p>In my opinion, [Advisor] outshines [Junior] in the Board of directors; it is [Junior’s] task to emerge and to establish his leadership. (SEN.4)</p>
</disp-quote></p>

<sec id="section12-0894486513490796">
<title>Dimension 2: Threats to Junior’s Leadership Construction Posed by Family Members</title>
<p>The positive support to Junior’s leadership construction was opposed by threats posed by junior-generation members who were not selected as successors and, in some instances, by senior-generation members who did not agree with the choice of successor. These conflicting family members enacted two types of threats to Junior’s leadership: They questioned Junior’s leadership role (2a), and they claimed leadership positions for themselves (2b).</p>
<sec id="section13-0894486513490796">
<title>2a. Role Questioning</title>
<p>A clear form of role questioning became apparent when we analyzed our evidence related to the reasons why the Advisor was called in by the family. Hiring an advisor for a relevant task within family firms is usually an activity requiring consensus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0894486513490796">Strike, 2012</xref>). Key family members must agree on the Advisor’s task and the targets he or she should accomplish. In contrast, in the four family business cases we observed, the Advisor did not initially receive a straightforward mandate expressing the clearly demarcated need to grow successor leadership. Although supporting a successor was always mentioned, family members of both the senior and successor generations always interweaved a number of related needs in describing the advisor’s task. This resulted in a deconstruction of the central need for advice—that is, leadership development—characterized by significant degrees of uncertainty on all sides.</p>
<p>The family members’ descriptions of the need for professional advice that we collected clearly showed that a number of tightly related needs revolved around the leadership-development issue. Taking on governance roles, clarifying family members’ roles, addressing family conflicts were often mentioned as the key drivers of the request for advice. Even when successor’s leadership development was explicitly placed at center stage in negotiating the advisor’s task (e.g., in Case 4), additional related issues—such as favoring a dialogue among cousins and chairing the company board—always emerged. This deconstruction of the core need made clear to us that both senior and junior family members were not explicit and focused in spelling the need for leadership development of a clearly identified successor, because of the opposition to the development of the successor’s leadership role. Some family members in Cases 1 and 4 even denied that successor’s leadership development was the key task of the advisor, even when a written contract formalizing that task had been signed.</p>
<p>This reluctance to explicitly frame the successor’s leadership development task supports the claim that “problems for which advisors are sought are rarely the true issue. Many of the issues and disputes have deep and emotional historical roots” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0894486513490796">Strike, 2012</xref>, p. 161). Advisors realized that their clients were not straightforward families “that would tell you: this is what we need” (ADV.2). Besides not receiving specific directions on the task to be performed, at times advisors found it difficult to grasp the meaning of some family requests, as they could not immediately see the relation with successor development. One of the advisors, for instance, said,<disp-quote>
<p>After the death of Junior’s father, they asked me to join their board. I cannot say why. I never really understood the reason. (ADV.1)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Despite this uncertainty, advisors realized that avoiding to be explicit about the successor’s development role was a way for the controlling family to preserve the delicate mechanisms and balances underpinning succession. As one advisor told us,<disp-quote>
<p>There was no specific target related to a future leadership role of [Junior] . . . The issue was: what is the best possible way to introduce [Junior] within the firm, while at the same time preserving company values and siblings’ autonomy? (ADV.3)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The underlying reason for the lack of clarity we observed in defining and formalizing the advisor’s task clearly emerged from our interviews as the result of the opposition of some family members to Junior’s leadership role, as the following comparative quotes suggest:<disp-quote>
<p>It gradually became clear that the family did not intend to explicitly formalize my task as “developing [Junior’s] leadership”, as this would have automatically implied that he had been already appointed as the next CEO, which is something some of them were deeply questioning. (ADV.2)</p>
<p>When you see it written on a formal contract–“the advisor’s task will be to develop the leadership skills of [Junior] as our next CEO”–well, that sounds somewhat final, but this was something that a number of our family members were not ready to take; there was still significant opposition to this choice, because this type of choices require time to be gradually accepted by everyone. (SEN.4)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0894486513490796">
<title>2b. Leadership Claiming</title>
<p>Leadership claiming behaviors complemented role questioning as threats to Junior’s leadership posed by other junior-generation family members and, at times, other senior family members. Questioning Junior’s role and attitudes to leadership was, in most of the instances we observed, the result of more or less explicit claims to becoming a family business leader, or to keeping an existing leadership position.</p>
<p>In Case 1, a listed company with no other junior family member who could claim leadership positions, independent board members representing powerful external shareholders highlighted in a number of instances their greater experience and significant decision power vis-à-vis the young Junior successor, who was also sitting in the family firm’s board of directors. As Junior’s uncle, the company chairman, reported,<disp-quote>
<p>[Junior] had to devote significant time and energies to be recognized as a leader within the Board. He has an important position, the link between company managers and the board. In several instances I observed both board members and some of our executives challenging his leadership on account of their influential position or greater experience. But eventually [Junior] won their support. The role of [Advisor] was essential in helping him understand how to interact with these more senior guys. (SEN.1)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In Cases 2 and 3 the successor’s role was not significantly challenged by other junior-generation members. Yet some of them claimed areas of decisional autonomy on account of historical division of roles within the family and of their tenure and track record:<disp-quote>
<p>My sister wants to be autonomous in her [design] area; I understand this is based on her significant skills in that area. Yet it is difficult to lead a company when you cannot claim full control on a crucial function of the business. (JUN.2)</p>
<p>I know I have to be careful whenever some of my decisions, or even strategic analyses, have an impact on the divisions where my sisters claim full responsibility. (JUN.3)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In Case 4, leadership claiming by juniors who were not selected as next company leaders was even more explicit and resulted in pressures from both the Juniors themselves, or two seniors who claimed a possible leadership role of other next-generation family members:<disp-quote>
<p>My cousin has always been convinced, and he still is, that he should have been the CEO. This is the main reason why I still was not granted a permanent CEO position. (JUN.4)</p>
<p>My brother was probably convinced that in this way his son would have been selected as next CEO by the family; as this did not eventually happen, their relationship significantly deteriorated. (SEN.4)</p>

<title>Dimension 3: Advisor’s Transitional Leadership</title>
<p>The support (role building and leadership granting) and the threats (role questioning and leadership claiming) to Juniors’ leadership development determined contrasting effects on the process of Juniors’ leadership construction. In the four cases we analyzed, Advisors played an essential role in balancing these opposing forces toward accomplishing a clear and accepted leadership role of Junior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0894486513490796">Figure 2</xref>). Our data reveal that by taking on an explicitly transient leadership role, the Advisor could balance these opposing forces by acting as a role model to the successor (3a), by endorsing Junior’s leadership (3b), and by eventually withdrawing the advisor’s task to confirm Junior’s accomplished leadership (3c).</p>
<sec id="section16-0894486513490796">
<title>3a. The Advisor as Role Model</title>
<p>In all four cases, we clearly observed that a significant contribution to building Juniors’ roles as next-generation leaders resulted from their opportunity to closely observe their Advisor’s leadership behavior. Role modeling is seldom used in formal leadership-building interventions, which usually favor types of relationships characterized by a more formal relationship initiation, higher relational closeness, and some interaction—such as in the mentor–protégé and coach–client relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0894486513490796">Haggard, Dougherty, Turban, &amp; Wilbanks, 2011</xref>). However, the high trust and close relationships we observed in all four cases between advisors and family members allowed this relatively detached form of leadership building to coexist with the closer and warmer interactions characterizing “Role building.”</p>
<p>Role modeling took two separate, although often coexisting forms. First, as in the two following examples from the same case, advisors offered instructive examples of leadership behavior in governance roles (<italic>chairman in Case 4, vice-chairman in Case 1, informal member of the board in Case 3</italic>), from which both junior and senior family members learnt:<disp-quote>
<p>What I really admire in [Advisor] is when I see him in action. I learn a lot when I see him interacting with my cousin, or when during a board meeting, even when he’s at a disadvantage on a specific topic, he’s able to convince or curb the other director, or to see that issues that would have divided the family or the board are later accepted. (JUN.4)</p>
<p>That was a situation in which [Junior] understood how a CEO should relate to the Chairman of the Board. [Advisor] is a factual person, able to build consensus and to simultaneously listen to minority shareholders . . . hence [Junior] learned from him how a Board should function . . . I learned it myself! (SEN.4)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Second, Advisors often acted as consultants in specific deals (e.g., a key organizational decision in Case 1, financial consulting in Case 2, two acquisitions in Case 3). In these instances, learning was not confined to relationship skills but extended to methodological issues:<disp-quote>
<p>When I and [Junior] met these canny managers of the target company, who were proposing to evaluate their company with inadequate techniques to keep the price high, I showed [Junior] that he needed to strengthen some aspects; lack of experience, naivety. (ADV.3)</p>
<p>Recently we were discussing about an important divestment decision. We had a meeting in which I and [Senior] casually jotted down a number of alternatives that [Advisor] more systematically summarized and put together. In terms of methods [Advisor] provided a significant help. He did not find a magic formula, but I took note and later replicated exactly what [Advisor] had suggested. (JUN.1)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Interestingly, the close, continued relationships between Advisor and Junior we observed in the four family firms also allowed the Advisor to closely observe Junior in action, hence providing invaluable material to provide factual feedback and advice:<disp-quote>
<p>There is both my work as director, and personal work. I always met with [Junior], however my involvement in their board allowed me to see him in action. (ADV.1)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-0894486513490796">
<title>3b. The Advisor as Provider of Surrogate Leadership Endorsing</title>
<p>Within leadership succession processes in nonfamily firms, leadership of the selected successor is typically endorsed by incumbent leaders. Once a new CEO is selected, incumbent leaders and stakeholders grant him or her leadership rights through both formal and symbolic actions, therefore endorsing his or her leadership position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0894486513490796">Finkelstein &amp; Hambrick, 1996</xref>). The family firms we observed, however, displayed some peculiar traits at this stage. Leadership granting activities (1b) were evident. Yet they were not sufficient to establish a clear and widely accepted leadership role of the selected successor. Unlike in nonfamily firms, in which the power to select the new CEO is premised on voting rights, leadership claims (2b) of other family members who felt entitled to the top leadership position, or even of powerful nonfamily members questioning the successor’s leadership attitudes, were sufficiently strong to prevent an endorsement of the incoming CEO.</p>
<p>As our data revealed, an essential role in buttressing leadership granting activities to contrast leadership claiming by other family members was played by the advisor through what we labeled as “surrogate leadership endorsing” (3b). Endorsing a new leader is mainly the task of incumbent leaders, or of the shareholders who selected the successor. When a third-party individual actively engages in impression management behavior that facilitates a positive image of the leader, he or she is taking on a surrogate role by serving as a substitute, or complement, for the leadership endorsing task that others should play or are playing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0894486513490796">Bolino, Kacmar, Turnley, &amp; Gilstrap, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0894486513490796">Galvin, Balkundi, &amp; Waldman, 2010</xref>). Surrogate leadership endorsing performed by the Advisor took three different forms that we observed in almost all four cases: junior leadership promotion, junior leadership defense, modeling family members’ followership.</p>
<p>First, leveraging their transitional leadership role, Advisors had several opportunities for <italic>Junior leadership promotion</italic>. As we could observe, promotion very often consisted of making positive direct statements about Junior’s personality and ability, his accomplishments, and his leadership skills. Leadership promotion took the form of explicit statements such as “I believe [Junior] should keep the CEO position” (ADV.4), or “I believe [Junior] is ready; he does have talent” (ADV.1), addressing key senior family members. Different statements were usually addressed to the successor’s peers, such as<disp-quote>
<p>[Junior] has an helicopter view of the firm that you guys lack; he has a commitment to the firm that you lack; would you be willing to work 14 hours a day as [Junior] does, and to come to the office on all Saturdays as he does? (ADV.4)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Second, Advisors were active in <italic>Junior leadership defense</italic>. Our analysis of multiple critical incidents that emerged from interviews showed that defense behaviors represented attempts by the Advisor to buffer Junior from open conflicts with family members, and to mitigate the negative feelings that emerged among the family members who were still claiming leadership from themselves, as the successor made his first leadership decisions. In this phase, advisors enacted behaviors aimed at buffering possible conflicts triggered by successor’s raising power. Although in most of the observed instances contenders were members of the successor generation—siblings or cousins—at times we also observed behaviors aimed at temporarily disconnecting Junior from senior-generation members, typically from different family branches (e.g., Case 4). The need for temporary disconnection was often made explicit by a member of the senior generation, as it is evident in the following comparative statements, in which Advisors report conversations they had with Seniors:<disp-quote>
<p>You know I really want to avoid any interference among active family members; each one has his or her autonomy; it is ok if a family member wants to discuss with a brother or sister, but autonomy must be preserved. (SEN.3 reported by ADV.3)</p>
<p>Listen, I would really appreciate . . . please, help us avoid interactions, interference, obstacles in the organization we’re trying to set up. (SEN.2 reported by ADV.2)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Directions like these were in some instances given to advisors to preserve the role and competence of active family members who were already covering managerial positions, hence reducing potential conflicts with the successor. Meeting with family members separately, to learn about emerging organizational problems related to Junior’s growing leadership, and family members’ related anxieties, was a common form of Junior’s leadership defense:<disp-quote>
<p>I met with [Junior’s cousin] who was complaining about [Junior’s] interference in his job; a job he had been performing autonomously for a number of years. (ADV.4)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Another form of defense behavior performed by Advisors was the definition of Junior’s early tasks in a way that would minimize his interference with same-generation members:<disp-quote>
<p>It was straightforward to get him started with the “Business Developer” role, which means: you have no reports, no [profit] responsibility and, more importantly, you do not take on responsibilities from the businesses that are already running well, that are managed well by [your sisters]. (ADV.3)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Third, Advisors played an active role in <italic>modeling family members’ followership</italic>, by explicitly representing what an appropriate response to or interaction with the new leader should look like. The disconnecting phase was always followed by activities aimed at creating, or recreating relationships among family members in which leadership of Junior could gradually emerge and be recognized. Before the advising process started, the successor had been considered as a peer by siblings or cousins active in the family business. Therefore, leader promotion activities performed by Advisors were aimed both at creating an organizational context allowing Junior’s leadership to emerge, and at preserving part of the organizational autonomy of peers. Informally meeting family members together, to clarify their mutual roles and expectations, was probably the most common form of modeling followership:<disp-quote>
<p>At that meeting [Advisor] tried to set some limits: my cousin should have referred to me on a number of issues; I should have not controlled him on a number of other issues; . . . I remember [Advisor’s] aim was to establish: ok, we decided that this is how you will proceed, these are the general rules you will follow when relating to [Junior]. (JUN.4)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>A further approach we observed consisted in the Advisor modeling family members’ followership by facilitating dyadic relationships between Junior and key family members on specific company issues. In these cases, the Advisor provided a direct intervention on the contents addressed, in line with what a consultant would do, but with a clear focus on facilitating the acceptance of Junior’s role, as the following comparative statements suggest:<disp-quote>
<p>A significant help I received from [Advisor] was when we changed our [non-family] CEO. [Advisor] helped me think about the issue in a structured way, hence strengthening my position in relation to [Senior]. (JUN.1)</p>
<p>Although [Junior] substantially agreed on what had to be done, he wanted the decision be shared by [Senior]. We hence had a meeting in which I illustrated my opinion. I believe I took an open yet resolute position, which I believe helped [Senior] to accept and share [Junior’s] decision. (ADV.1)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In synthesis, surrogate leadership endorsing was essential in balancing <italic>leadership granting</italic> provided by the Advisor (1b) and <italic>leadership claiming</italic> by other junior-generation members (1b) contrasting forces. The leadership granting activities performed by advisors were not sufficient, alone, to counterbalance the claiming of leadership by junior-generation members who felt entitled in the leadership role assigned to the successor. The additional—or surrogate—endorsing activities performed by a highly trusted advisor who was also playing an important, though only temporary, leadership role added the missing arguments to convince junior-generation members to accept the successor’s role.</p>
<p>The leadership position covered by Advisor was essential in triggering an emotional state in family members that was conducive of crediting and acting in accordance with the Advisor’s leadership endorsing actions. In one case, for instance, we noticed systematic traces of some kind of “reverential fear” of family members toward the Advisor, who was covering a significant governance role in the company, as the following comparative statements suggest:<disp-quote>
<p>It is maybe [the Advisor’s] formal role, or his reputation, but our directors feel some kind of trepidation, or slight reverential fear if you prefer. (JUN.4)</p>
<p>I think my son is at times even overshadowed by [Advisor] during some board meetings; the other family members recognize that [Junior] and the Advisor are somewhat sharing, though only temporarily, the leadership role. (SEN.4)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-0894486513490796">
<title>3c. Advisor’s Task Withdrawing</title>
<p>In the family firms we investigated, the termination of the Advisor’s engagement was a negotiated practice involving the Advisor and the Junior. Under this respect, letting the advisory task go and leaving the stage entirely to the successor showed some similarities with the generational succession process. First, the decision to withdraw resulted from a mutual adaptation between Advisor and successor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0894486513490796">Handler, 1990</xref>). The successor at times perceived a decreased need to interact with the advisor:<disp-quote>
<p>As time goes by, I feel a reduced need [of interaction with Advisor] in that form. (JUN.3)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Similarly, Advisors often perceived that their help was less or not needed anymore, and spontaneously withdrew their contract. Affect played a significant role in the advisor’s task-withdrawing stage. In particular, the feeling of pride toward Junior’s accomplishments facilitated the advisor’s decision to withdraw the task and hence to seal Junior’s leadership role:<disp-quote>
<p>A sense of pride, as if one of my sons had reached those results. (ADV.3)</p>
<p>A feeling, I would say, of pride and satisfaction, when I saw he had changed, when I saw there had been some visible improvements. (ADV.4)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>However, affect also had a contrasting effect on Advisors’ task withdrawing. We were somewhat surprised to observe feelings of <italic>paternal affect</italic> of the Advisor toward the advised successor, as these two comparative quotes highlight:<disp-quote>
<p>Sometimes I see [Junior] . . . I see my role not as a coach but . . . paternal. (ADV.3)</p>
<p>I hence felt highly involved [in the advising process]; it was almost as if I was helping my own son. (ADV.1)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Although these feelings positively affected how role building (1a) was performed, as they significantly increased the Advisor’s commitment and dedication to the task, they may have hampered or retarded task withdrawing (3c), given the nearly paternal need of the Advisors to preserve their supporting role to Juniors in difficult times.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we addressed the question of how Advisors affect the relational processes through which successors come to see themselves, and be seen by others, as family business leaders. Our focus was hence on the Advisor’s role in the successors’ leadership construction process. Our inductive analysis of four leadership development processes in generational family firms revealed that Advisors play a crucial role in balancing the facilitating and contrasting forces affecting juniors’ leadership. In particular, by taking on a <italic>transitional leadership role</italic> shared with incumbent senior leaders and the selected successor, Advisors facilitate the process through which Juniors’ leadership gradually becomes clear and accepted by all actors involved. The emergent grounded model of advisor-supported leadership construction is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0894486513490796">Figure 2</xref>. The concept of Advisor’s transitional leadership is a novel addition to both the literature on family business succession, and to knowledge on leadership construction processes.</p>
<sec id="section20-0894486513490796">
<title>Transitional Advisors’ Leadership in Family Business Succession Processes</title>
<p>What we observed in our four ethnographic case studies is a form of <italic>temporary shared leadership</italic> that is not reported in either family business succession, or leadership literatures. In the four cases, Advisors could effectively balance the forces facilitating and opposing the construction of successors’ leadership because they had taken on a leadership role themselves, although only a temporary one. In Cases 1 and 4, the Advisor was an influential member of the family firm’s board of directors—vice-chairman and chairman, respectively. In Cases 2 and 3, the Advisor had no formal leadership role, but he was seen as a trusted Advisor who could significantly influence the strategic decisions in which the selected successor involved him. In all four cases, these formal or informal roles were explicitly meant to be temporary, and targeted to supporting Junior’s growth as the incoming company CEO.</p>
<p>This transitional leadership role served as a bridge between the old and the new leadership setups in family firms. It was hence intentionally temporary and unlikely to be adopted as permanent. As such, the Advisors’ temporary leadership that we discovered differs from other forms of individual-level identity such as possible selves and provisional selves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0894486513490796">Clark, Gioia, Ketchen, &amp; Thomas, 2010</xref>). Possible and provisional selves are not intended to be temporary, but they are experiments that will likely become permanent if deemed successful by the individual experiencing them, or by the organization around her. The leadership of the selected successors we observed, in Case 4 in particular, are an example: Successors were appointed as incoming family business leaders, with the intention of the controlling family to make the appointment permanent, unless extraordinary events suggested the opposite. In contrast, the Advisors’ transitional leadership we observed was explicitly attributed to Advisors to facilitate an intentionally discontinuous bridging process. This bridging role of advisors may become an addition to existing models of the family business succession process (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0894486513490796">De Massis et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0894486513490796">Le Breton-Miller et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0894486513490796">Venter, Boshoff, &amp; Maas, 2005</xref>) and of successors’ leadership development (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0894486513490796">Cater &amp; Justis, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0894486513490796">Salvato, Minichilli, &amp; Piccarreta, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0894486513490796">Sardeshmukh &amp; Corbett, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Besides being temporary, or transitional, Advisors’ leadership role was also shared with both senior family members and the selected successors. Shared leadership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0894486513490796">Carson et al., 2007</xref>) has not received significant attention in family business research. The underlying assumption of family business leadership and succession literature is that leadership positions are transferred to individual family or nonfamily members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0894486513490796">Salvato et al., 2012</xref>). In contrast with this standpoint, in none of the four cases we investigated the Advisor was the sole, or even the key decision maker. Even in Case 1, in which the Advisor was chairman of the board, key strategic decisions were driven by the two incumbent senior leaders—Junior’s father and uncle, respectively—and by the newly appointed CEO.</p>
<p>Although shared leadership is a well-studied phenomenon in organization theory, the transitional component we observed is a novel addition to this literature. Shared leadership is usually defined as “an emergent team property that results from the distribution of leadership influence across multiple team members” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0894486513490796">Carson et al., 2007</xref>, p. 1218). As we could observe in the four cases, it is a relational phenomenon, because it implies strong interactions and mutual influence between two or more organizational agents as they work toward team objectives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0894486513490796">Carson et al., 2007</xref>). As in the case of our Advisors, leaders in shared leadership arrangements do not have to be officially or formally appointed. Indeed shared leadership is a mutual influence process within a team that is characterized by “serial emergence” of official as well as unofficial leaders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0894486513490796">Pearce, Yoo, &amp; Alavi, 2004</xref>). Within teams characterized by shared leadership there can hence be several formally appointed and/or emergent leaders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0894486513490796">Mehra, Smith, Dixon, &amp; Robertson, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Emergent leadership refers to organizational agents—advisors, in the cases we investigated—exerting significant influence over other members of their group—seniors, next-generation members, and nonfamily executives and directors—although no formal authority was vested in them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0894486513490796">Schneier &amp; Goktepe, 1983</xref>). In the four family firms we observed, temporary shared leadership originated when advisors engaged in activities that influenced both family and nonfamily employees in areas related to direction, motivation, and support and through interactions that involved the negotiation and sharing of leadership responsibilities. The resulting collective structure we observed can hence be considered to be a <italic>temporary leadership network</italic> that influences and shapes both the family firm’s and individual activities and outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0894486513490796">Carson et al., 2007</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section21-0894486513490796">
<title>The Holistic Relationship Between Advisors, Successors, and Family Firms</title>
<p>A further contribution of our study to the literature on family business succession emerges from the uniquely intense approach to successors’ leadership development we could observe in all four cases. This was driven by the relevant, though transitional, leadership role assumed by the advisor in relation to both the individual successor, and the overall family business system. First, our study suggests a holistic or person-centric view of successors’ development, in contrast to the prevailing approach focused on developing specific traits of the successor, such as technical skills, industry knowledge, tacit firm-specific knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0894486513490796">Boyd et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0894486513490796">Turner Foster, 1995</xref>). A person-centric approach to growing successors implies the simultaneous development of all dimensions of the successor as a person—a rich and complex amalgamation of rationality, behavior, and emotions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0894486513490796">Rogers, 1961</xref>). This means that explaining why and how some succession processes work, whereas others do not, requires a broader and deeper investigation of the rational, behavioral, and emotional dimensions involved than is currently displayed in the succession literature. In particular, our data reveal that succession processes seem to function better when—besides training specific individual traits—family interpersonal relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0894486513490796">Shams &amp; Lane, 2011</xref>), together with affect and emotions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0894486513490796">Baker &amp; Wiseman, 1998</xref>), are simultaneously addressed by external advisors.</p>
<p>Second, we provide an explanation of how the relation between the family firm and the advisor evolves over time. Understanding this relationship and how it affects an advisor’s effectiveness has proved elusive due to a lack of tailored inductive studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0894486513490796">Strike, 2012</xref>). As our data reveal, the family–advisor interaction does not develop in the direction of emerging mutual trustworthiness; trust is often there since the inception, although subject to an evolution. Similarly, knowledge of the family and its business are also prerequisites of the advising relationship. Rather, the most significant evolution is observed in the affect-related dimension of the advisor–family relationship. Here, the initial feeling of obligation that is often present because of the previous history of interaction is gradually substituted by a nearly paternal feeling of personal responsibility toward the successor, which is eventually replaced by a feeling of pride in the successor’s accomplishments.</p>
<p>Finally, we offer insights in the advice-leaving process in family firms—an overlooked yet potentially generative dimension of the literature on family firm advising (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0894486513490796">Strike, 2012</xref>). As our data reveal, a significant component of the advisor’s successor-development task takes the form of role modeling in governance and management activities. The exemplary behavior offered by the Advisor—who often temporarily performs leadership activities that should gradually pass on to the successor-generation member—is a significant determinant of successor’s leadership growth. What we also observed is that for leadership development to be effective, advisors need to “let go” of their roles within the family firm in a way which is not dissimilar from the “phasing out” and “transition to new roles” of family incumbents described by integrative models of succession (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0894486513490796">Le Breton-Miller et al., 2004</xref>). Advice seeking, giving/taking, and leaving “are related and reciprocal activities” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0894486513490796">Strike, 2012</xref>) that involve advisors as well as senior and junior family members. Therefore, successful leadership development results from careful scrutiny of the delicate balance between management and leadership roles performed by the Advisor, and the empowerment and growth in credibility of the next-generation member.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section22-0894486513490796">
<title>Limitations and Future Research</title>
<p>Two limitations of this study merit discussion. First, we explicitly selected family firms in which both juniors and advisors belonged to the same gender. This choice allowed us to control for the significant role of gender in shaping succession processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0894486513490796">Vera &amp; Dean, 2005</xref>), leadership outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0894486513490796">Ryan &amp; Haslam, 2007</xref>), and coaching/mentoring relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0894486513490796">Allen, Eby, O’Brien, &amp; Lentz, 2008</xref>). However, it has clearly limited the richness that could be elicited by investigating a gender-varied sample. Future research may be explicitly directed to understanding both the different needs of female versus male successors, and the possibly different approaches followed by advisors to develop their leadership skills.</p>
<p>Second, we explicitly selected family firms from one single country, to control for the significant influence of cultural variables in shaping leadership development processes (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0894486513490796">Allen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0894486513490796">Gaines, Gurung, Lin, &amp; Pouli, 2006</xref>). This choice limited opportunities to illuminate the highly relevant impact of national factors on the leadership development process. Future studies may explicitly compare juniors’ leadership development patterns across countries. A reasonable expectation is that such patterns will vary depending on the different attitudes toward leadership characterizing different national cultures, and the different pervasiveness of the executive coaching profession across countries.</p>
<p>A further line of future inquiry may address the role of senior-generation members and incumbent leaders in developing juniors’ leadership positions, which was not a focus of this study. As incumbent leaders are often close relatives of incoming junior-generation members, we can expect significantly different patterns of leadership construction. In particular, senior-generation members may tend to have significantly higher levels of emotional involvement in the leadership development process, and more frequent and intense role-modeling opportunities. Furthermore, the interaction between the leadership development role of advisors and seniors may also merit focused research attention, to understand how their different motivations, experiences, and cognitions jointly shape junior generation’s leadership.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In this article, we investigated the role of external advisors in developing the leadership profile of next-generation members, an important yet overlooked phenomenon in family business generational succession. Our analysis of four comparative cases of successors’ leadership construction confirmed the received wisdom of junior leadership as resulting, in part, from external experiences and knowledge transferred by incumbent family leaders. Yet close observation of advisor–junior interactions also revealed the essential role played by advisors in co-creating a strong leadership profile in collaboration with senior family members and juniors themselves. This role is not confined to formal training and to consulting on specific challenges faced by the next-generation leader. In developing and strengthening juniors’ leadership, Advisors themselves temporarily took a leadership role within the family firm as chairman or member of the board, or as strategic consultants in relevant firm initiatives. This transitional leadership role allowed Advisors to act as role models that juniors could directly observe and closely interact with. This insight expands the scope of relationships that need to be observed when addressing processes of leadership development and generational succession in family firms.</p>
