<abstract>
<p>This article explores why apparent political indifference coincides with nationalist passion in Chinese cyberspace. Drawing on interviews with university students and the notion of ‘new politics’, this article argues that online nationalism constitutes an important extension of the political being in the Chinese context, or a form of ‘new politics’ among contemporary youth in certain societies. The ‘dual’ political identity emerging from Chinese youth’s uses of the internet is reflective of, and reinforces, their offline self. Both their apparent lack of interest in engaging with the government and their strong nationalism are products of the same changing subjectivities in post-Mao China.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>A number of incidents in relation to the 2008 Olympic Games, such as the anti-government protests in Tibet, the disturbances during the international leg of the Olympic torch relay, CNN commentator Jack Cafferty’s remarks against the Chinese and the alleged ‘anti-Chinese’ tendency of CNN and some other western media, sparked a sharp surge of nationalism among Chinese both at home and abroad. Inside China, where political passions are usually kept in check by government control, much of the outrage was vented in cyberspace, to which 210 million Chinese (mostly educated, young people under 35) had access then (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1367549411424950">China Internet Network Information Centre, 2008</xref>). ‘Netizens’ set up nationalistic websites such as <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.anti-cnn.com">www.anti-cnn.com</ext-link> (with a thematic song entitled ‘China’s Return to Prosperity Cannot Be Prevented’) and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.dalai-liar.com">www.dalai-liar.com</ext-link>. A lyric entitled ‘Do not be too CNN’ sung by a young man in a rap style accompanied by a video was circulating in cyberspace. The phrase ‘Do not be too CNN’ became one of the most popular online expressions in China in 2008. By mid-April 2008, a Google search in Chinese for boycott of ‘Carrefour’, a French chain store, which it was alleged was giving financial assistance to the Dalai Lama, yielded more than 2.4 million hits, mostly created within the previous week. Some 2.3 million MSN users had attached ‘I love China’ icons to their online profiles and many users put a ‘red heart China’ on their screen names as an expression of their solidarity against the ‘Tibetan separatists’ and the West. By 1 July, a petition calling on Chinese people from all over the world to oppose ‘splittism’ had been supported by more than 8.16 million people on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.sina.com">www.sina.com</ext-link>. There were many other websites with similar petitions.</p>
<p>Flaring nationalism in Chinese cyberspace is not new (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1367549411424950">Wu, 2007</xref>). There have been outbursts both online and offline over issues such as the Japanese occupation of the Diaoyu Islands and the NATO bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade in 1999. China also has a breed of ‘red’ hackers who pride themselves for sabotaging and defacing websites in countries perceived as anti-China (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1367549411424950">Wu, 2007</xref>). However, what is interesting about this surging cyber-nationalism is that it constitutes a striking contrast with the normally apolitical nature of Chinese netizens’ use of the internet, which is focused on entertainment, lifestyle and private issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1367549411424950">Damm, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1367549411424950">Liu, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1367549411424950">Qiu, 2003</xref>). Although the internet has created a public space previously not possible despite government control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1367549411424950">Yang, 2003</xref>), there still seems to be a general lack of interest in employing the internet for engaging with the government for civic and democratic purposes.</p>
<p>Apparent political indifference and nationalistic passion among Chinese netizens are both well-known by now. However, they have been largely treated as isolated phenomena, and rarely examined side-by-side within a continuum of changing subjectivities in post-Mao China. What makes Chinese netizens indifferent to other forms of political involvement but enthusiastic about nationalism? What does this say about young people’s negotiation of a political self in a reform-era China undergoing dramatic sociocultural changes? This article explores these questions from netizens’ own perspectives by focusing on their perceptions and experiences of the internet as a political tool, and their understanding of political participation and nationalism.</p>
<p>The article draws on individual interviews with 38 university students in China in 2008 and is part of a larger project on Chinese youth’s identity construction in the internet age. The participants were recruited by a snowballing procedure, starting with the author’s former students at a Chinese university at the time. The interviews lasted 1 to 1.5 hours. They were all recorded with permission from the participants. In order to ensure confidentiality, the names of the students and universities are not mentioned in this article. Information about any individual’s identity is kept to the minimum.</p>
<p>In addition to the interviews, valuable information comes from browsing Chinese websites from mid-March to the end of May 2008. I paid special attention to postings that had to do with the incidents related to the 2008 Olympics.</p>
<p>In the rest of the article, first, I shall provide a review of the changing notion of politics, taking into account young people’s nationalistic sentiment and behaviour in China. I shall then present the main themes from the participants’ narratives, followed by a conclusion.</p>

<title>From ‘traditional politics’ to ‘new politics’: political participation in the internet age</title>
<p>A consistent theme of social analysis over the past decades has been the gradual disengagement of citizenry from public life, coinciding with the arrival of the internet generation: a trend found in many countries such as Canada, Germany, Sweden, the UK and USA (for review and discussion, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1367549411424950">Bennett, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1367549411424950">Dahlgren, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1367549411424950">Loader, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1367549411424950">Milner, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1367549411424950">Zukin et al., 2006</xref>). A generational decline in levels of participation in elections, political parties and traditional social organizations, general civic involvement and political knowledge is seen as evidence of this. While some lament this trend, worrying that it will harm the health of democracy (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1367549411424950">Milner, 2010</xref>), others argue that a transformation of politics is taking place concomitant to the individualization of society, resulting in a generational shift away from traditional (or institutional) forms of participation to cause-based, or issue-based participation (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1367549411424950">Bang, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1367549411424950">Inglehart, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1367549411424950">Norris, 2002</xref>; for a review of these competing views, see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1367549411424950">Calenda and Meijer, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1367549411424950">Loader, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1367549411424950">Zukin et al., 2006</xref>). From this latter perspective, young people are still interested in politics, but in a different way to previous generations. Various labels have been used to describe this general trend, such as ‘politics of choice’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1367549411424950">Norris, 2002</xref>), ‘lifestyle politics’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1367549411424950">Bennett, 1998</xref>), ‘sub-politics’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1367549411424950">Beck and Beck-Gernsheim, 2002</xref>) or simply ‘new politics’ (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1367549411424950">Calenda and Meijer, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1367549411424950">Dahlgren, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Frequent reference to the internet has been made in the ongoing debate about young people and political participation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1367549411424950">Echoing Putnam (1995)</xref>, who blames TV as the main culprit for the decline in civic engagement in the USA, some claim that recent technological advancements, in particular computers and the internet, have led to young people losing interest in civic and political participation (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1367549411424950">Kraut et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1367549411424950">Wilhelm, 2000</xref>). However, many others have looked to the internet either as a means of increasing participation of the digital generation (particularly in conventional forms of politics) and/or as spaces where evidence of young people’s new modes of expression and participation can be found (e.g. see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1367549411424950">Bennett, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1367549411424950">Collin, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1367549411424950">Dahlgren, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1367549411424950">Loader, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1367549411424950">Olsson, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1367549411424950">Vromen, 2008</xref>). A streak of technological determinism is often inherent in such discussions. Notwithstanding this problem, there has been an increasing awareness that while the internet makes creative expression and representation possible, it is not enough in itself to ensure engagement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1367549411424950">Calenda and Meijer, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1367549411424950">Livingstone, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1367549411424950">Yang, 2009a</xref>). Rather, the online political world forms a natural extension of the offline world, reflecting and sometimes reinforcing existing patterns of participation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1367549411424950">Calenda and Meijer, 2009</xref>). This is also supported by the findings in this study.</p>
<p>Debate is still continuing as to what constitutes the ‘political’ and whether contemporary young people are political dropouts or are engaged, but in different ways. However, there seems to be a growing recognition that in studying young people’s political participation, it is no longer sufficient to focus on ‘traditional politics’ such as membership of political parties and voting in elections; it is equally important, if not more so, to pay attention to ‘new politics’, such as membership of single issue movements, cause-based movements and involvement in non-partisan networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1367549411424950">Calenda and Meijer, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Broadening the concept of political participation to include ‘new politics’ is not only necessary for gaining an understanding of the emerging political identities among young people in liberal democratic societies, but also applies to youth in non-democratic societies such as China, where a similar pattern of ‘depoliticalization’ has taken place over the past three decades. The individualization of post-Mao Chinese society has led to the shifting focus of self-development among young people, from public life in the Maoist era to private life in the reform era (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1367549411424950">Damm, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1367549411424950">Rosen, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1367549411424950">Yan, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1367549411424950">2009</xref>). A strong interest in consumerism, individual lifestyles and identity politics has replaced the type of political enthusiasm of the pre-1989 generations, many of whom gathered in Tiananmen Square demanding democracy in 1989. Chinese youth today seem to be indifferent toward both official ideology and the prospect of political reforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1367549411424950">Damm, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1367549411424950">Rosen, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1367549411424950">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1367549411424950">Yan, 2006</xref>). Nevertheless, they can be active in civic activities related to events such as the Sichuan earthquake and occasional protests (mostly online) about social injustice, environment-related issues and identity issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1367549411424950">Lagerkvist, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1367549411424950">Liu, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1367549411424950">Yang, 2009b</xref>). This phenomenon bears much similarity to the trend in many democratic countries that has warranted a broader concept of political participation.</p>
<p>However, what seems to distinguish Chinese youth from their western counterparts is that alongside their apparent indifference to governmental politics, the current generation is known as passionately nationalist. This forms a contrast with youth in many western societies where, according to some authors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1367549411424950">Bennett, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1367549411424950">Smith and Jarkko, 2001</xref>), there has been a general diminished pride in nationality over the past decades. Largely based on observations about western democratic societies, talk about evolving notions of the political has downplayed nationalistic behaviour as an important form of ‘new politics’ among contemporary youth. This also may have to do with a tendency to overlook the political nature of nationalism, as noted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1367549411424950">Breuilly (1993[1982]</xref>). Such an omission prevents us from gaining a more comprehensive understanding of the emerging political self in China, which has seen a new surge of nationalism among young people in the past two to three decades at the same time that society is undergoing individualization.</p>
<p>Chinese nationalism in the reform era is multifaceted, although it is heavily sponsored by the party state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1367549411424950">Chan, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1367549411424950">He and Guo, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1367549411424950">Townsend, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1367549411424950">Zhao, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1367549411424950">Zheng, 1999</xref>). This is not least evidenced by the coexistence of popular nationalism and official nationalism. Popular nationalism – that is, bottom-up national sentiments from the masses – has been flourishing since the mid-1990s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1367549411424950">Xu, 2001</xref>). It has to do with both the government-led ‘patriotic education’ campaign (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1367549411424950">Zhao, 2005</xref>) and the fact that since the beginning of the 1990s, in its attempt to promote nationalism, the regime has allowed the rise of pluralistic nationalistic voices among the masses, despite its control over other aspects of political discussions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1367549411424950">Xu, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1367549411424950">Zheng, 1999</xref>). Furthermore, this has been reinforced by the internet, which has served as a hotbed for popular nationalism over the past two decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1367549411424950">Qiu, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1367549411424950">Wu, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Although often overlapping and sharing interests with official nationalism, popular nationalism constantly challenges official nationalism by sometimes running against official state policies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1367549411424950">Liu, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1367549411424950">Zhao, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1367549411424950">Zheng, 1999</xref>). Moreover, allowing the common people to join with each other in forming ideals of equality and dignity in the national environment, popular nationalism has become in a sense the incarnation of democratic processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1367549411424950">Xu, 2001</xref>). This contradicts official nationalism, which emphasizes maintenance of the political status quo. Thus, popular nationalism adds another dimension to the political nature of nationalism in the Chinese context.</p>

<title>‘The internet is a space for recreation and a platform for communication’</title>
<p>Similar to university students in some other countries (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1367549411424950">McMillan and Morrison, 2006</xref>), the participants viewed the internet as an integral part of their lives. Most of them had a personal computer and could access the internet at the dormitory or at a nearby home. Going online everyday at least for two hours was common among most of them. The few who did not own a personal computer visited an internet cafe at least once a week for a few hours each time. Some mentioned that they could borrow their classmates’ computers in the dormitory as well.</p>
<p>When asked to define the internet, a shared perception was that ‘the internet is a space for recreation and a platform for communication’, to use their words. How, then, did they personally make use of this ‘space’ and ‘platform’? The participants indicated that for them the internet was mainly a tool for entertainment, although they did occasionally look up things related to their studies. Or as a young man put it: ‘Even for us university students, the internet is mainly for recreation, just as it is for other Chinese users.’ This is in line with the general trend among Chinese users (as of 2010). In addition, scanning the front pages of major websites, such as MSN, Tencent and Sina was a common practice. They spent much time reading headlines and topics about lifestyles, pop stars and other celebrities as well as national and international news. However, they tended to see such activities as a pastime as it was not related to their studies. Their online communication was limited predominantly to their own circles of friends, acquaintances and families, which is in agreement with the research findings on youth and the internet in some other societies (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1367549411424950">Boyd, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1367549411424950">Ellison et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1367549411424950">Livingstone and Bober, 2005</xref>). They argued that communicative activities, especially chatting with friends, were a form of pastime, as they were usually not about ‘serious’ topics. Thus for these young people, the boundary between online recreation and communication was blurred.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, this does not mean that they overlooked the communicative functions of the internet. Many of the participants emphasized that the internet offers, in their words, ‘a quick and easy way to exchange information and to connect people’. This phrase captures the main reasons underlying many people’s expectations about the internet’s implications for democracy in China. Nonetheless, how and the extent to which the internet’s potential is exploited depends on citizens’ and governments’ attitudes towards it, which can be different in different societies, particularly in terms of political participation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1367549411424950">Chase and Mulvenon, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1367549411424950">Taubman, 1998</xref>). As we shall see in the following, the participants’ perceptions and experiences of the internet as a political tool are specific to the technology’s ‘receiving context’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1367549411424950">Zhou, 2006</xref>: 232) of present-day China.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1367549411424950">
<title>‘No effect on me’</title>
<p>In discussing the internet’s impact upon Chinese society, the participants differentiated between the personal and national internet. They saw the internet, first, as a space for recreation and second, a platform for communication, often with the overtone that it is not essential, albeit important, for individuals. However, they argued that the internet is playing an irreplaceable role in China’s national development. Typical remarks include: ‘It is crucial for China’s development’, ‘It allows China to enter the world and the world to enter China’ and ‘It is the Information Age now. Without the internet and other high technologies, it would be impossible for China to compete with other countries’. Such views reflect the official discourse on the internet inside China, where agents ranging from the government to the mass media, companies and mainstream academics strongly share the view that the internet is the driver for China’s economic development and its overall modernization project (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1367549411424950">Damm, 2007</xref>). Promoting democratic participation with internet has not been the government’s intention.</p>
<p>The participants’ agreement with the official internet discourse lends support to the observation that China’s netizens, who belong to the newly-emerging middle class, generally show affiliation with the government, as they are the beneficiary of reform and opening up (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1367549411424950">Damm, 2007</xref>). The participants showed pride in the achievement that China has made in information technology which, according to them, is indicative of the country’s growing power – like its success in launching rockets into space. This focus forms a contrast with the western ‘freedom versus control’ discourse on the Chinese internet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1367549411424950">Damm, 2007</xref>), which focuses on the internet’s political implications for China. Reflecting the general trend among Chinese citizens, these university students largely saw the internet as a means of national economic modernization and personal recreation, rather than political modernization.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, then, when asked ‘How has the internet, as a more open medium of information and communication, influenced your political views and participation?’, a predominant reply was ‘No effect on me’. Talking about their online communication, the participants predominantly indicated that they seldom or never participated in online discussion forums (such as bulletin boards). The few exceptions show that if one regularly visited a certain online forum, it was mainly for game-related topics and/or maintaining ‘real life’ hobbies. A young man mentioned that the only online forum he had participated in was about online car-driving contests, because he was fascinated with the game. For another young man interested in fishing, a fishing forum proved helpful in maintaining his hobby.</p>
<p>In talking about their experiences of the internet, no one mentioned governmental control. When asked ‘What do you think of China’s internet censorship and how does it affect your use of the internet?’, the majority of the participants indicated that they had not heard about censorship. Some of them asked instead: ‘What is the censorship about, please?’ Among the few who did show some knowledge about it, only one mentioned, ‘It appears a bit authoritarian’. The others insisted that it had not affected them because ‘The things we do, such as playing games, are not related to censorship’. Another participant explained, ‘The censorship is against pornography. We just play games. So it is not relevant to us.’ Moreover, according to some of the participants, the internet ‘is already a platform for people to say whatever they like to say’ (<italic>changsuo yuyan</italic>), implying that they did not feel there was anything limiting or lacking. However, not everyone liked this ‘freedom’. Rather than wishing for a freer internet, some of them expressed a wish for a ‘real name’ system, not only to protect people more from harm due to anonymity, but also to exert a stronger control over what people can say in cyberspace. Whereas it may be a good intention for people to be responsible for what they say in cyberspace, such views legitimize governmental control. Thus it is ironic that what the young people perceived as problematic in relation to the internet seems to be quite different to some western observers’ concern about the Chinese internet.</p>

<title>‘I am not very concerned about politics’</title>
<p>The participants’ lack of interest in employing the internet to engage with the government not only has to do with their perceptions of the internet itself. More importantly, it is related to their political self in the offline context, especially how they perceived political participation.</p>
<p>Reflecting upon the internet and political participation, the majority of the participants indicated that they were not interested in politics. Or as some put it, ‘I am not very concerned about politics’. To understand this indifference to politics from their perspective, I asked them how they conceived political participation. In response to this question, most of them replied ‘I do not know’, ‘Have no idea’ or ‘Have no such concept in my mind’, although a few did name some examples such as voting, joining the party and participating in a rally. A probe of whether they had participated in politics or planned to do so in the future yielded a predominant reply: ‘No. I don’t think so.’ Nevertheless, from the reasons they offered for this negative reply, one can see that they did have their own opinions of what political participation means in the Chinese context, as reflected in the following remarks:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>It is no use even though you make a suggestion or criticism. They will not adopt it. So it is better not to bother about that. People would say you are interfering in things that do not concern you [<italic>duo guan xianshi</italic>], or you are not observing the ‘proper’ norm [<italic>bu shou benfen</italic>].</p>
<p>Chinese people are all relatively selfish [<italic>zisi</italic>]. For the Chinese, it is not necessary to do something if it is not beneficial to yourself. Nowadays, people are pragmatic.</p>
<p>Politics is not practical. It is very hypocritical and full of corruption. I feel it is distanced from me.</p>
<p>I do not vote. Only party members vote. As long as I live well, I do not care who the president is.</p>
<p>I do not want to be influenced by the <italic>Falungong</italic> people. I trust the Chinese Communist Party much more than the <italic>Falungong</italic> people.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>One can see that these young people had a rather narrow notion of political participation. It is limited largely to engagement with the government, especially anti-government activities, such as criticizing and making suggestions to the government and making attempts at subverting party rule, much in agreement with the opinions of the elderly internet users in a study conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1367549411424950">Xie and Jaeger (2008)</xref>. It is understandable that people just choose not to participate, given that one will not be able to make a difference anyway, and worse still, one may cause trouble for oneself. Or as a young man emphasized: ‘Participating is one thing, participating effectively is quite another. When one cannot make a difference, why bother?’ Moreover, if politics is seen as a complex and ‘dirty’ game, as it is ‘hypocritical’ and ‘corrupted’, not getting involved may represent one’s declaration not to mix with the ‘bad’. In addition, in the case of present-day China, where economic success has generated much confidence among Chinese people in the party leadership for a bright collective future (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1367549411424950">Zhang, 2004</xref>), engaging with the government may be viewed as disturbing the hard-earned social stability by both the government and society at large. The wish to retain the status quo is reflected in another shared understanding that, as a young man put it: ‘It takes time to develop. The leaders are doing a good job. China has its own characteristics. China cannot copy the West, and vice versa.’</p>

<title>Angry nationalists going online</title>
<p>Although they professed lack of interest in what they perceived as ‘politics’, the participants did employ the internet for nationalistic expression. Talking about the Beijing Olympics-related incidents, each of them said, ‘I was enraged and disgusted!’ Many of them reported having signed some online petitions calling on Chinese all over the world to support the Olympics against the ‘separatists’. Nearly all of them took part in similar activities organized by their university and/or online communities. All indicated that they kept a close watch on relevant information via the internet and TV. Many of them were among the millions of Chinese netizens who attached a ‘red heart China’ or ‘I love China’ icon to their online profiles. Some changed their online names into expressions such as ‘I Love China’ ‘Powerful China’. A few of them posted comments on bulletin boards to let out their anger and encourage Chinese people to unite and make the country powerful. A young woman said:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I was so angry. The national dignity was insulted by CNN, Dalai and the West. The West represented by the US is always afraid of China becoming strong. They would grasp every chance to disturb us …We Chinese people have suffered too much in the past. It is high time that China became powerful. I sent out many postings in the bulletin boards to cheer up the Chinese people.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The participants recalled that one frequently got and sent out messages such as: ‘If you are a Chinese, you ought to read this, and/or sign this.’ Some of the participants saw internet-organized ‘political consumerism’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1367549411424950">Stolle et al., 2005</xref>) in the form of boycott as an effective way to teach anti-China individuals and organizations a good lesson. A young woman who had signed up for boycotting both Dior and Carrefour told a story about how the American celebrity Sharon Stone was heavily condemned by Chinese netizens when she indicated that the 12 May earthquake was karma for ‘wrong deeds’ by the Chinese people. She said that she and many of her female friends had stopped buying Dior, which has Stone as a spokesperson, in response to an online petition by another internet user. ‘We cannot affect her power directly, the only thing we can do is to make her lose economically,’ she added.</p>
<p>The young people experienced online nationalism as a powerful means to unite people for a common goal. Some of them reported experiencing an unprecedented sense of belonging and collective power these days, which was much celebrated in their online communication. One of them remarked:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Chinese people have not been so united [<italic>tuanjie</italic>] for many years. People have been divided since the reform started. All have been bent on their private interests in the competitive market economy … We should thank the anti-China forces for making us so united. The more they are against us, the more united we are. This has greatly encouraged us Chinese. They should study Chinese history before claiming that Tibet is a country. How ridiculous!</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>I came across similar opinions on many other Chinese websites both inside and outside of the country, where there were many postings in praise of the re-found solidarity among Chinese people. It is not hard to discern the delight and pride that the young people had found in their ‘regained’ collective identity as Chinese. What has made them so nationalistic and yearn so much for assertion of a collective Chinese identity? A good start for understanding this question is to explore how they understand nationalism, or the Chinese term ‘<italic>aiguo zhuyi</italic>’ (patriotism), which they used to refer to one’s love for one’s country (<italic>guojia</italic>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1367549411424950">
<title><italic>‘Aiguo zhuyi</italic> is of great significance’</title>
<p>The participants were articulate about <italic>aiguo zhuyi</italic>: all emphasized that it is of great significance. They provided explanations that are at the same time primordialist and instrumentalist. They strongly shared an understanding that their love for the country is natural, or as some of them argued, ‘I love China because I am a Chinese. It is in our nature [<italic>tianxing</italic>].’ With this primordialist assumption, they argued that to love one’s country is a most basic quality (<italic>suzhi</italic>) as a human being and that this moral-normative dimension of ‘<italic>aiguo zhuyi’</italic> is comparable to one’s devotion to one’s family. Indeed, they see the country as a family and the people who live in it as family members, echoing the official concept of a pan-Chinese nation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1367549411424950">Chan, 2005</xref>) with 56 ethnic groups who are brothers and sisters within a big family. They argued that it is only natural for one to love and be loyal to the family, even if the family is not perfect. Furthermore, just as its members’ interests are closely tied to the family flourishing, one’s own fate will be definitely affected by the nation’s development. This kind of loyalty to one’s country constitutes what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1367549411424950">Fong (2004)</xref> refers to as ‘filial nationalism’ found among Chinese young people.</p>
<p>Some carried the primordialist explanation of their <italic>aiguo zhuyi</italic> even further, arguing that such a strong kinship bond is a unique characteristic of the Chinese people, and of which one should be proud. A young man claimed:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>It is Chinese people’s nature to unite themselves against outsiders once there is a common enemy, although there may be serious conflicts among themselves. This is in our blood. That is what Chinese people are like, quite different from westerners.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>For these youth, then, the nation is not constructed for instrumental purposes, neither is it felt to be a ‘imagined’ community, about which <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1367549411424950">Anderson (1991[1983])</xref> wrote. Rather, it is real and tangible, embedded in common roots and kinship bonds.</p>
<p>However, at the same time as they emphasized this natural givenness of their love and loyalty, some of them also alluded to the acquired aspect of their <italic>aiguo zhuyi</italic>, pointing to ‘patriotic education’ since 1990. A young man said: ‘This has to do with the education we have been through. From the beginning of our schooling, we have been exposed to <italic>aiguo zhuyi</italic> education. It is hard not to be influenced.’ Furthermore, they claimed that <italic>aiguo zhuyi</italic> should be the most basic quality (<italic>suzhi</italic>) of a citizen too, not only that of a human being. In other words, it is a consciousness which can and should be cultivated in every member of the nation-state. With this acquired consciousness, many of them uttered a declaration-like remark: ‘Of course, I love my country. As a Chinese citizen, I will definitely not cower when my country needs me. This is fundamental.’ They emphasized that such loyalty to the nation-state, and obeying the law and maintaining social order, are the most important indications of a qualified Chinese citizen.</p>
<p>Both in China and the West, patriotism is expected to play a role in sustaining a higher ideal of citizenship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1367549411424950">Stapleton, 2005</xref>). Yet the Chinese understanding of citizenship, as reflected in the participants’ narratives, seems to have quite different connotations from the western concept of citizenship. In the latter case, citizenship has much to do with demanding individuals or groups’ rights in decision-making and challenging the political status quo. With the emphasis upon ‘obedience’ and loyalty, hence on duties rather than rights, the Chinese understanding reminds one of the ‘subject’ rather than the ‘citizen’, thus begging the question whether or not the Chinese young people, even the educated elite, have deserted their status as ‘subjects’ and assumed the role of citizens in the true sense of the word.</p>
<p>In short, although scholars on nationalism tend to see primordialist and instrumentalist approaches as contradictory, it seems that these Chinese young people used them complementarily. Such understandings echo post-Mao leaders’ construction of patriotism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1367549411424950">Liu, 2011</xref>). However, it would be misleading to believe that the young people’s notion of nationalism is totally identical to governmental discourse of patriotism. As we shall see in the following, even though they used the same term as the leaders, their perception of <italic>aiguo zhuyi</italic> goes beyond that of the official nationalistic discourse.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1367549411424950">
<title>‘The nation is higher and greater than the party-government’</title>
<p>Chinese official nationalism identifies China closely with the Communist Party and equates the goals of the state with those of the nation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1367549411424950">He and Guo, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1367549411424950">Zhao, 2005</xref>). In contrast, although their understanding of <italic>aiguo zhuyi</italic> reflects very much the patriotic socialization to which they have been exposed, many of the participants deliberately emphasized that one must distinguish the party (<italic>zhengdang</italic>) from the nation (<italic>guojia</italic>) in talking about <italic>aiguo zhuyi</italic>. A young woman expressed a shared view:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Loving the country and loving the party are two different things. I’d like to give just one illustration. The country is over 5000 years old now. However, the current government is only several decades old.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Another student put it: ‘The nation is higher and greater than the party-government. They may not represent the same things, although they do not need to contradict each other.’ Precisely because what the nation represents transcends what the party stands for, as one student put it, ‘The country’s honor (<italic>rongru</italic>) is considered higher than the interests of the party’. For the same reason, <italic>aiguo zhuyi</italic>, the participants argued, should not only be outward-directed, but also inward-directed. This means, some of them explained, that action may be taken against party leaders if they are harming national interests through, for example, corruption or stupid foreign policy. This echoes the claims made by participants in the 1989 pro-democratic protest, who claimed that their action was patriotic. It follows that now that these same young people are showing little interest in engaging with the government, they may be basically content with the current government. However, it is worth noting that the effect of political control also may have played a role in shaping the Chinese political habitus.</p>
<p>The kind of nationalist enthusiasm exemplified by the participants may have an important bearing on Chinese youth’s collective identity, China’s relationship with other countries and individuals’ relationship with the current government. In this sense, their nationalistic expression, be it online or offline, is political in nature. However, the participants contended that <italic>aiguo zhuyi</italic> has little to do with politics. Some argued that <italic>aiguo zhuyi</italic> is morally superior to political participation – or as a young woman put it: ‘<italic>Aiguo zhuyi</italic> is a noble and commendable thing, whereas participating in politics may not be so.’ This reflects their understanding of political participation in the Chinese context, with a series of negative connotations: for example, getting involved in subversive activities and/or participating in corrupt and dirty gameplaying, as mentioned earlier.</p>
<p>Despite their view that <italic>aiguo zhuyi</italic> is apolitical, they did see online nationalism as a demonstration of democracy because, they claimed, it is participatory in nature and everyone (with internet access) has an equal chance to have a voice. This power of mass participation, according to the participants, lay behind CNN’s final apology to China – it was the power of Chinese netizens, who were connected by the internet, that had made the difference. This echoes an article posted in the Strong Nation Forum (<italic>Qiangguo Luntan</italic>) on 25 April 2008 entitled ‘Not Afraid of the Mainstream Media, but Afraid of Chinese Netizens’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1367549411424950">Xiangyun, 2008</xref>). The author makes the point that the internet has had such power precisely because it is a mass-participatory medium, in sharp contrast with the other forms of media tightly controlled by the government. Thus, according to the author, the apology from CNN was a result of the confrontation between Chinese netizens, rather than China’s official media (or government), and the West. The author calls on the government and the whole of society to reflect upon the role that mass participation can play in defending the country’s interests and supporting the government. This role, the author argues, should form the grounds for the government to treat the netizens, who represent the people, well.</p>
<p>Taken together, the young people’s creative and active use of the internet for nationalistic actions was not only an expression of their patriotic sentiments, but also their wish to exert influence upon national affairs. Thus, the Chinese case has added another dimension to the political character of nationalism.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>It is observed that Chinese young people’s use of the internet is apolitical, with a focus on entertainment, lifestyles and private issues. Yet such a depiction neglects another theme in Chinese cyberspace, namely nationalism. Nationalism constitutes the ‘most viable political discourse among Chinese netizens’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1367549411424950">Qiu, 2003</xref>: 15), forming a contrast with their otherwise apolitical uses, which was especially striking in the wake of the incidents surrounding the 2008 Olympics. In this article I have explored such a contrast from the perspectives of a number of university students. Given the qualitative nature of the study, it is not my intention to generalize about Chinese university students, or youth in general. However, the main themes that have emerged do shed light on how young people negotiate a political self in a reform-era China undergoing dramatic sociocultural changes.</p>
<p>The internet holds the potential to affect understandings and activities of political participation. However, the ways in which users appropriate it for political purposes are closely related to the contexts in which their lives are embedded. As reflected by the participants’ narratives, the ‘dual’ political identity emerging from Chinese youth’s uses of the internet is reflective of their offline self. Their apparent lack of interest in engaging with the government and strong nationalism are two interrelated products of the same process of changing subjectivities in post-Mao China.</p>
<p>The account offered by the participants for their apparent indifference to the government, like the generally ‘apolitical’ uses among Chinese netizens, reflects what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1367549411424950">Sheldon Lu (2000</xref>: 146), in talking about post-Mao Chinese society, refers to as ‘consumerist postmodernity’ characterized by consumerism, fragmentation and individualism. This has been reinforced by the post-1989 ‘pragmatism’ widely found among Chinese young people. The lesson from the Tiananmen Square bloodshed, along with rampant consumerism, has taught people to be more concerned about their own well-being and private life rather than to get involved in government politics. This coincides with a tendency among the Chinese to take comfort in conformity and to leave state-related matters to the leaders, which has been nurtured by the Confucian tradition as well as Mao’s regime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1367549411424950">Farquhar and Zhang, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1367549411424950">Xie and Jaeger, 2008</xref>). Such a mentality has been further encouraged by the post-Mao leaders’ emphasis on social stability, which is reflected in more recent discourse on the ‘harmonious society’.</p>
<p>‘Political inaction’ is also an effect of the high levels of acceptance that the regime as a whole has been enjoying since the early 1990s (for an analysis of the Chinese government’s authoritarian resilience, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1367549411424950">Nathan, 2003</xref>). This is not only thanks to rapid economic growth and China’s growing power in the world, which lends legitimacy to the post-Mao leadership, but also has to do with the fact that a ‘cultural turn’ has taken place over the years, whereby the kind of ‘naïve, pro-western outlook’ among late-1980s youth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1367549411424950">Rosen, 2009</xref>: 361) has been replaced by a common understanding that the western model of democracy may not suit China’s development after all. Research shows that even as they embrace western liberalism and popular culture, Chinese youth, especially the well-educated and well-informed such as the participants in this study, tend to view the western concept of democracy sceptically and see the West as having an ‘anti-China’ agenda (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1367549411424950">Damm, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1367549411424950">Rosen, 2009</xref>). They sympathize with the government’s fear of political disorder as exemplified by post-communist Russia.</p>
<p>Of course, one should not overlook the effect of political control, which contributes to a perceived political inefficacy and fear for causing trouble for oneself, hence passivity in engaging with the government. Governmental control of the internet, as an extension of post-Mao leaders’ overall attempt to maintain social order, does counteract the liberal potential of the internet.</p>
<p>Due to the combined effect of these factors, Chinese netizens generally do not seem to be interested in subversive activities against the government. Although there have been occasional cases of online activism, Chinese netizens rarely demand radical political change. Rather, the struggles are about social justice, cultural values and personal and collective identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1367549411424950">Yang, 2009b</xref>).</p>
<p>However, the apparently apolitical self takes on quite another appearance when viewed together with nationalistic expression. In line with the coexistence of these two contrasting themes in Chinese cyberspace, although they had rarely used the internet to engage with the government, the participants reported having taken an active part in the online nationalist activities related to the 2008 Olympics. Just as we need to associate their lack of interest in engaging with the government with changing subjectivities in reform-era China, we need to do the same with their nationalism.</p>
<p>Flourishing nationalism represents Chinese youth’s solidarity with the party-state as a result of a range of factors: for example, the common wish to build a strong nation and to reinvigorate China as a world power, the understanding that western democracy may not suit China, that the West has its own anti-China agenda, and confidence in party leadership’s ability to lead China on its way to be a world power based on the country’s economic achievement since the late 1970s. These same sociocultural conditions, as mentioned earlier, have led to a lack of interest in engaging in subversive action. China’s growing influence in the world has resulted in increased national pride among today’s youth in contrast with the pre-1989 generation, who often demonstrated shame of their own nation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1367549411424950">Rosen, 2009</xref>). Thus, the participants’ deliberate distinction between the party-government and the nation does not contradict the fact that as long as the former serves the interests of the latter, they are seen as one unity. It can be argued that compared with other groups of young people, university students such as those in this study may identify more with the party-state’s blueprint of modernization with Chinese characteristics because they are among the main beneficiaries of this project. After all, despite the harsh employment situation for university graduates in recent years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1367549411424950">Liu, 2011</xref>), they are the group from which the future national elite will emerge. Meanwhile, their nationalism also reflects a general trend among China’s younger generation.</p>
<p>However, Chinese youth’s ‘dual’ political self is not solely attributable to those factors that have resulted in a kind of ideological consensus with the government. As is clear from the participants’ narratives, it also has to do with the individualization of Chinese society, which partly underlies young people’s apparent political indifference. Nationalism grows not despite of, but due to, this same process, serving as a complement to the social and political ‘lacks’ due to China’s social transformation since the late 1970s. It constitutes a kind of idealism as a counterforce to the extreme rationalization and widespread materialism and pragmatism underlying the depoliticalization of Chinese society. Moreover, whereas politics is viewed as ‘unpractical, dirty and hypocritical’, as some of the participants said, nationalism stands for the noble and the laudable. Similarly, just as nationalism serves as a means for the government to rule the Chinese people in the face of the collapse of communism, it represents the common people’s longing for solidarity, community and recollectivization under the circumstances of social stratification, fragmentation and individualization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1367549411424950">Liu, 2011</xref>). In short, nationalism, like other forms of online community-building, represents ‘a critique of the present and a yearning for a better world’, which ‘originates in the social, cultural, and political displacements associated with the market transformation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1367549411424950">Yang, 2009b</xref>: 156). Last but not least, in the context of political control, nationalism serves as an enclave of participatory public life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1367549411424950">Xu, 2001</xref>). The liberal tendency inherent in the participants’ <italic>aiguo zhuyi</italic>, in line with China’s popular nationalism, is reflected in their distinction between the nation and the party-government, their understanding that <italic>aiguo zhuyi</italic> should be inward-directed as well as outward-directed, and their celebration of online nationalism as a platform for mass participation.</p>
<p>Thus, nationalism constitutes a form of ‘new politics’ among contemporary youth in societies such as China. It constitutes an important extension of the political self in the Chinese context. Viewed in this way, the widely shared claim about Chinese youth’s political apathy seems to be a rather simplified one.</p>
