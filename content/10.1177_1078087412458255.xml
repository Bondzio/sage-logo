<p>The policy actions of senior levels of government can often be important catalysts to collective action for metropolitan governance. This article compares the challenges that actors in metropolitan Detroit have faced in attempting to establish metropolitan transit governance in response to the promise of federal funding for regional transit in 1967 and the grants announced in the 2000s. How has the region responded differently to the challenge of regional transit in the most recent wave of funding? What accounts for governance failure even when, at various points in the historical debate, local actors have been in agreement on a metro transit agenda? What has changed since the 1960s and will these differences empower the metro region to finally establish metropolitan transit governance? Finally, what can the lessons of these two periods teach us about governing regional transit in fragmented political contexts?</p>

<title>Déjà vu?</title>
<p>A mayor, a governor, and various federal officials—periodically bathed in camera flashes—smile, shake hands, and acknowledge the celebratory applause. They have just announced a multimillion-dollar federal commitment to help fund the creation of a regional transportation network, complete with keystone light rail and modern bus route projects, in metropolitan Detroit. The smiles mean that they’ve done it. Against enormous odds these leaders have proposed a plan and secured the federal funding commitment to see it through. Finally, all the pieces are in place to create a world-class system of public transit.</p>
<p>You could be forgiven for supposing that the triumphant press conference and the hopeful announcement of a new day for public transit in metro Detroit was the February 2010 proclamation of Detroit’s share of the TIGER<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1078087412458255">1</xref></sup> grants or the August 2010 confirmation of New Start funding. But the scene described above heralded a different set of funding in a very different time. In 1976, Michigan Governor William Milliken and Detroit Mayor Coleman Young celebrated the formal commitment of $600M made years before by Gerald Ford during his presidential reelection campaign. This funding kicked off a reinvigorated process of regional transit planning that resulted, not in the efficient regional system that all parties sought, but in a single downtown rail line: The People Mover. The persistent failure of regional cooperation forced the federal government to renege on its commitment and the region was left with a fragmented and underdeveloped system. Four decades have passed without significant progress on regional transit governance in Detroit. However, a new infusion of stimulus funding may provide a second chance.</p>
<p>This article compares the challenges that actors in metropolitan Detroit have faced in attempting to establish metropolitan transit governance in response to the promise of federal funding for regional transit. How has the region responded differently to the challenge of regional transit in the most recent wave of funding? While all actors are convinced that some form of collective action is the only way to solve the region’s transit problems, such collective action proved repeatedly impossible to create. What are the conditions for failure and what conditions may enable actors to break with historical patterns of failure?</p>
<p>There are both theoretical and practical reasons to dig deeper into metro Detroit’s experience with regional governance and federal transit funding. At first, exploring these questions in the Detroit context might seem curious—the city has never been known (in a positive light) for its public transportation system. Yet regional transportation has been on the political agenda since the 1960s. Studying the failure of regional governance in this policy area—at least to date—can help shed light on the barriers to metropolitan cooperation and provide an important test of governance theory. For instance, recent scholarship has suggested that state and federal government policy and grants can stimulate metropolitan cooperation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1078087412458255">Otgaar et al. 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1078087412458255">Hulst and van Montfort 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1078087412458255">Hoornbeek and Beechey 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1078087412458255">Hawkins 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1078087412458255">Feiock 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1078087412458255">Weir, Rongerude, and Ansell 2009</xref>). The failure of regional governance through at least one round of funding incentives confirms that while external funding can be crucial to the success of metropolitan partnerships, it may not be a sufficient condition to stimulate cooperation. The Detroit case provides a similar test of the power of crisis to bring about collective action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1078087412458255">Nelles 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1078087412458255">Andersen and Pierre 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1078087412458255">Steiner 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1078087412458255">Hawkins 2009</xref>). The metropolitan region is in the throes of one of the worst declines in U.S. history having suffered recessionary conditions since 2001 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1078087412458255">Hill et al. 2011</xref>). The central city of Detroit has been the hardest hit by economic downturns but its suburban neighbors have not been immune (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1078087412458255">Brooks 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1078087412458255">Linebaugh 2009</xref>). In this context, leaders agree that regional cooperation will be crucial for economic recovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1078087412458255">Oosting 2011</xref>) and that regional transit should anchor collective efforts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1078087412458255">Helms and Hall 2011</xref>). Consequently, this case enables a comparison of the effect of increasing pressure on local officials due to the economic crisis and provides an opportunity to explore the value of public transit expansion and renewal to struggling regions.</p>
<p>Drawing on elite interviews<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1078087412458255">2</xref></sup> and secondary sources, this article finds grounds for cautious optimism regarding the prospects of regional transit in metropolitan Detroit. It finds that current debates over regional transit have closely followed historical patterns where initial local support for regionalism has been followed by fragmentation of interests and a failure to achieve consensus on metropolitan transit institutions. It also argues that the persistent failure of regional transit is related to a lack of both horizontal and vertical capacity in metropolitan transit governance. Contextual and structural divisions have entrenched conflicts between city and suburban actors, preventing the emergence of a strong and coherent horizontal coalition in support of metropolitan transit. When partnerships have formed, a lack of vertical influence has prevented the establishment and empowerment of key metropolitan governance institutions. But a lot has changed since 1967. Factors such as the relentless creep of crisis to suburban communities, the diminution (but not disappearance) of the importance of racial divisions between city and suburb, the involvement of the private sector, the intense fiscal pressures on urban and suburban transit providers, a federal preference for regional coordination, and increasing federal stewardship may contribute to the construction of a coherent coalition with the horizontal capacity to broker a deal on metropolitan transit and the vertical clout to defend itself within transit policy venues at the state and federal scales. Ultimately, this article seeks to outline and explain the curious parallelism in regional transit debates in order to shed light on the processes and challenges involved in establishing metropolitan governance in fragmented regions.</p>

<title>Horizontal and Vertical Capacity and Regional Transit Governance</title>
<p>In their study of the influence of federal transit policy on metropolitan governance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1078087412458255">Weir, Rongerude, and Ansell (2009)</xref> argued that effective regional transit governance results from the virtuous cycle created by the expansion of a regional network aligned around an empowered transit planning authority. They found that while the institutional incentives inherent in the 1991 Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA) stimulated the creation of broader metropolitan networks around the issue of regional public transit in both Los Angeles and Chicago, durable regional transit governance emerged only in the latter case. The authors concluded that the existence of horizontal governance networks is not enough but that the capacity of governance at the metropolitan scale requires vertical power to advance and defend interests in other (primarily state and local) policy venues.</p>
<p>Governance capacity, in this context, is defined as “the ability to enlist all actors involved and, with their help, generate new ideas and to develop and implement a policy designed to respond to fundamental developments and create conditions for sustainable development” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1078087412458255">van den Berg and Braun 1999</xref>, 995). It is the ability to “anticipate, respond to and cope with changing intra- and inter-metropolitan relations due to crucial internal and external processes of change” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1078087412458255">van den Berg and Braun 1999</xref>, 995). Accordingly, metropolitan governance capacity can be understood in terms of horizontal and vertical dimensions.</p>
<p>The horizontal dimension refers to the ability of regional governance networks to function to collectively structure and implement transformative metropolitan agendas. Much has been written about the factors that affect the emergence and strength of partnerships at the metropolitan scale, which underpins horizontal capacity (see extensive reviews of the theoretical literature in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1078087412458255">Nelles 2012</xref>). Briefly, the emergence of metropolitan coalitions is shaped by institutional and contextual factors that vary from case to case. These factors can include the autonomy of local executives; electoral cycles and partisan politics; the fiscal and jurisdictional autonomy of local authorities; power asymmetries between jurisdictions; external factors such as the intervention of senior levels of government (statutorily or financially, directly or indirectly) and catalytic crises (such as natural disasters of financial catastrophes); and patterns of civic engagement at the metropolitan scale. In the case of metropolitan Detroit, the intervention of senior levels of government though the mechanism of regional transit grants proved to be a powerful incentive for horizontal collective action. However, power asymmetries—and disagreements over how they should be resolved within the regional transit coalition—prevented the emergence of a stable coalition and undermined the partnerships that emerged periodically throughout the negotiation process. As this case will demonstrate, the weakness of vertical capacity of the partnerships that did emerge was at least as important in explaining the failure of regional transit as the lack of horizontal capacity.</p>
<p>The effectiveness of these partnerships at carrying out metropolitan policy is predicated on far more than the consensus and resources of its membership. It is also affected by the intergovernmental context in which these structures are embedded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1078087412458255">Hamilton 2004</xref>). To craft and implement policy, metropolitan organizations must be able to effectively insert the “regional voice into the competing venues responsible for making decisions” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1078087412458255">Weir, Rongerude, and Ansell 2009</xref>, 479) such as state and local governments.</p>
<p>Horizontal and vertical capacities are linked to the extent that the strength of horizontal network is among the most important determinants of the influence that the network will be able to exercise in policy spheres at other levels. The degree to which metropolitan arrangements can influence and partner with governments and actors in various policy venues is the vertical dimension of metropolitan capacity, which is largely predicated on the perceived legitimacy and effectiveness of the partnership. A metropolitan governance network is a prerequisite for vertical influence; however, not any network will do. The structure of the network and the influence, resources, and connectedness of its membership are all important in determining whether it is considered as an actor of consequence in other policy circles and what pressure it can bring to bear. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1078087412458255">Weir, Rongerude, and Ansell (2009)</xref> found that vertical capacity is particularly strengthened by the empowerment of regional governance organizations. In other words, the collective creation, recognition of, and support for a central metropolitan actor can create a virtuous cycle of participation that legitimizes metropolitan governance and strengthens both horizontal and vertical power. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1078087412458255">Perkmann (2007)</xref> invoked a similar idea in concept of the “appropriation” of policy space. He argued that network partnerships must assert themselves as the key players in the policy area they wish to influence and be regarded as the central and legitimate authority in that territorial space. The deference of other political actors—whether they are governments or other interest groups—to the dominance of the metropolitan partnership of a given policy space is a crucial test of the vertical potential of that partnership.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether there is a central metropolitan organization or simply a collaborative network, the <italic>coherence of the partnership and its agenda</italic> are vital to its vertical clout. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1078087412458255">Keating (2003)</xref> echoed this position and argued, “there are regions with a political system, a decision-making capacity, and the ability to define a legitimate ‘regional interest’. <italic>Others lack this unity of action and are reduced to simple linkages in other systems of action</italic>” (271, emphasis added). In other words, strong horizontal networks, forged by consensus and characterized by stability and consistency will increase influence across scales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1078087412458255">Nelles 2012</xref>, forthcoming). Fragmented or conflicted networks are unlikely to succeed even if they are united around a common agenda. Therefore, the <italic>character</italic> and <italic>quality</italic> of horizontal partnerships is crucial to the achievement and sustainability of regional governance.</p>
<p>Developing these capacities is especially important in policy areas like mass public transit where state and federal funding is necessary to develop and operate systems and where these jurisdictions govern important aspects of transit policy. In these situations, it is important that the metropolitan region be perceived as an effective and legitimate policy actor if it is to influence decisions taken at other levels of government.</p>
<p>The effectiveness of metropolitan transit governance can therefore be assessed with reference to its horizontal governance capacity—the supportive strength of the regional transit coalition—and its vertical governance capacity—to defend and advance regional interests in other policy forums. The persistent failure of regional transit governance in metropolitan Detroit described above can be traced to the deficiencies in both horizontal and vertical dimensions of governance capacity.</p>

<title>1967-1989: First Attempts</title>
<p>Prior to 1967, transit in metropolitan Detroit was a fragmented affair. The Detroit Department of Street Railways (DSR) operated bus lines in the city while eighteen privately owned coach companies dominated services in the suburbs. DSR was in financial difficulty beginning in the early 1960s and several times proposed a merger with suburban lines and the creation of a regional Rapid Transit Authority as a solution. Although these proposals failed the passage of the Urban Mass Transit Act of 1964, which favored a metropolitan approach prompted local and state officials to debate the implementation of regional transit authorities. In 1967, the Michigan State legislature passed Public Act 204, which modified previous legislation to allow for regional transit authorities across the state. The measure included a specific provision for the creation of the Southeastern Michigan Transportation Authority (SEMTA) to administer transportation funding and policy for the seven-county region of metropolitan Detroit<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1078087412458255">4</xref></sup> and included representation from the city on its governing board. Significantly, SEMTA was not created with any revenue-generating authority and relied on state and federal funding to raise the resources to acquire the bus companies it was meant to administer, including the DSR. Over time, SEMTA successfully integrated the suburban transit lines but was unable to negotiate the terms of the consolidation of city and suburban services. This negotiation has been one of the biggest hurdles to regionalizing transit in metro Detroit.</p>
<p>By 1973, SEMTA had been granted a steady revenue stream from state subsidies<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1078087412458255">5</xref></sup> and returns from suburban transit lines. Although SEMTA was integrated with the DSR, it was the official agency designated by the state to distribute public funding in the region. Under SEMTA’s formula, a majority of these subsidies flowed through to the city—61% in 1975 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1078087412458255">D’Anieri 2007</xref>, 135)—though the suburbs also got a share. Naturally, Detroit objected to the split, claiming that it was entitled to more. Another conflict emerged around the terms of the merger of DSR into the regional transit authority. The integration of DSR into SEMTA was always the goal of the 1967 legislation. However, negotiations over the creation of a genuinely regional SEMTA reached an impasse because of opposition from both sides. Detroit was reluctant to give up control to a regional body dominated by suburban interests and disputed the distribution of representation from each jurisdiction on the governing board. For its part, SEMTA was wary of taking over the DSR’s liabilities, which included a significantly underfunded pension fund. These two entrenched positions still shape discussions over a regional transportation authority in metro Detroit. The state governor, William Milliken, eager to advance the cause of regional transportation, proposed several successive plans to combine the two authorities, structure regional development and fund operations. Eventually, a Tri-Party Agreement was concluded in 1975 between the city, SEMTA, and the state government. Almost immediately, the partners began to oppose parts of the agreement and both the city and the suburbs took issue with the altered legislation and transit plan (Public Act 266) that was passed in 1976.</p>
<p>In 1976, Governor Milliken finally succeeded in formalizing the federal commitment of $600 million for public transit that had been promised during Ford’s reelection campaign. This windfall, to be administered by the Urban Mass Transit Administration (UMTA), was informally contingent on a metropolitan transportation plan administered by a regional transit authority. Detroit also qualified for a separate stream of funding to develop a proposed downtown subway/light rail system—the People Mover—that would link up with suburban routes as a demonstration project. While these two funding sources appeared to support the regional agenda for public transit in Detroit, they ultimately failed to overcome the fissures between city and suburban authorities.</p>
<p>To qualify for federal funding, SEMTA proposed three plans for regional transit in 1977, each of which included a different mix of underground subway, light rail, and configurations of radial bus routes. The debate over which plan to adopt lasted for two years. In December of 1979, the parties finally reached an agreement over a transit plan with an outline for a merger between SEMTA and DSR (which had changed its name to the Detroit Department of Transportation, D-DOT). This plan got rid of the aerial segment of the planned Woodward Avenue light rail system but also extended the line two miles north of the city limits into the southern Oakland county suburbs. The plan also provided for future light rail to Macomb County. In exchange for the agreement, Coleman Young (the mayor of Detroit) signed a document pledging the city to a merger with SEMTA on ten conditions<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1078087412458255">6</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1078087412458255"><italic>Detroit Free Press</italic> 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1078087412458255"><italic>Detroit News</italic> 1979</xref>). Unfortunately, the deal was undone by several intractable obstacles. In the first place, the proposed transit plan was expected to cost $1.5 billion, which vastly exceeded the federal commitment. Secondly, the plan required the state legislature to pass two measures, which it ultimately opposed. Legislative opposition was a response to vigorous lobbying by different parties to the plan, in particular Oakland County, against proceeding with the process. Despite the “agreement,” disagreements between the city and suburbs over the control that it afforded to Detroit over the timing of the process and other aspects of the merger simmered just beneath the surface. The plan quickly unraveled, leading observers to conclude that it was “less a viable plan than it was a papering over of differences, at best a fanciful opening position in negotiations with UMTA, and at worst evidence to the federal government that the region was still incapable of coming up with an actual regional plan” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1078087412458255">D’Anieri 2007</xref>, 158).</p>
<p>By the 1980s, regional transit planning was in tatters and the lack of progress meant federal funding was increasingly precarious. SEMTA compromised by moving forward with the People Mover rail plan that had eventually secured its share of federal funding. The project is now notorious for its mismanagement and record-breaking cost overruns (which totaled about $66 million). Administration of the project was transferred to D-DOT in 1985. The People Mover was the only part of the 1975-1979 regional transit plans that was accomplished in this period. The ambitious, multiaxis, multimodal regional transit system envisioned in the 1970s was ultimately reduced to a problem-plagued loop in an increasingly deserted downtown. The $600 million funding commitment, which had by then survived three presidencies, was withdrawn and SEMTA and D-DOT persisted largely independently until the end of the 1980s. In 1989, the state declared SEMTA a failure, dissolved it, and replaced it with the Regional Transit Coordinating Council (RTCC). This new council operated under the supervision of the Southeastern Michigan Council of Governments (SEMCOG) as a pass-through body for state and federal subsidies. The RTCC, in turn, created the Suburban Mobility Authority for Regional Transportation (SMART) to administer suburban routes, officially marking the dormancy of the regional transit project in metropolitan Detroit.</p>

<title>1989-2012: Second Chances</title>
<p>Throughout the 1990s, the establishment of a regional transit authority was decidedly off the policy agenda. D-DOT and SMART contemplated a merger to ease their respective financial woes but settled on an incremental approach based on coordination rather than consolidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1078087412458255">Bodwin 1994</xref>). The two authorities agreed to eliminate duplication by taking over each other’s routes and establish a common regional bus pass but never attempted to go further. The route exchange fell apart in 1995, a year after it was established, over a dispute about funding. As the millennium approached, focus returned to establishing a regional agenda in a wide variety of policy areas. The Detroit Regional Chamber of Commerce (DRCC) led the charge arguing, with the support of SEMCOG, that a regional approach to economic recovery was the best solution for the flagging metro region. In 2001, the DRCC brokered an agreement between the “Big Four”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1078087412458255">7</xref></sup> leaders in Detroit, which resulted in the introduction of a series of bills in the state legislature (HB 5467, 5468, and 5523) to reform regional transit and replace the RTCC with a new Detroit Area Regional Transportation Authority (DARTA). After a decade-long absence, transit regionalism had finally returned to public debate.</p>
<p>Its success was short-lived. Despite widespread enthusiasm for a regional transit authority of some configuration, a consensus on the details proved difficult to achieve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1078087412458255">Gray 2002</xref>). The legislation introduced in 2001 failed and was resurrected several times as the fight over regional transit moved to the state level. The first set of bills were passed but vetoed by the outgoing governor in his frustration over the unrelated issue of education reform. In his veto message, he declared that “because southeast Michigan couldn’t get its act together on education, it served no purpose to put resources into a regional public transportation system” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1078087412458255"><italic>The Michigan Daily</italic> 2003</xref>). The bill was reintroduced only to be vetoed by the next governor, Jennifer Granholm, who argued that it was too weak to accomplish anything (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1078087412458255">Gray 2003</xref>). Finally, the members of the RTCC decided to circumvent the state legislature and create DARTA through an intergovernmental compact that closely mirrored the original 2001 agreement. Things were finally looking up for regional transportation in metro Detroit. The Big Four leaders, represented on the RTCC board, had reached a consensus and taken bold action to create a regional transit authority and had even secured a small amount of funds from the Federal Transit Authority (FTA) to cover administrative costs. However, the legitimacy of the new DARTA was immediately challenged with a successful lawsuit tabled by American Federation of State County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME). Locals representing D-DOT mechanics and clerical employees worried that a single regional authority would reduce their generous benefits and working conditions.</p>
<p>In 2005, the federal government introduced and reauthorized the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU), which included $100 million in “New Starts” earmarks for the design and construction of the Ann Arbor to Detroit transit project and commuter rail, light rail, and bus rapid transit (BRT) links. This award was contingent on each project qualifying under New Starts criteria, which governed operating costs per rider and required a regional transportation authority to administer funding.</p>
<p>In the following three years, the RTCC and SEMCOG worked together to produce several studies of the prospective elements of a regional transit system. The Comprehensive Regional Transit Service Plan was introduced in 2008 and detailed light rail corridors, BRT lines, and commuter rail services. It was the first regional transit plan undertaken and approved in more than 30 years. However, like its 1979 predecessor, it made everybody happy but was vastly overpriced at $10.5 billion. Ultimately, the large price tag was a signal that consensus on the plan had to be achieved in exchange for another round of pet projects and that the political actors would not support the regionalization of transit without an infrastructure windfall for their own jurisdictions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1078087412458255">8</xref></sup> It also required legislative modification to permit the establishment of the keystone regional transportation authority. Both proved to be significant stumbling blocks as legislative debates wore on.</p>
<p>By 2010, the federal government was funneling stimulus money to state and local governments through a patchwork of ARRA programs. The Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery (TIGER), administered by the Federal Department of Transportation (FDOT), awarded $25 million to the proposed Detroit Woodward Avenue light rail line. The rail line, a feature resurrected from the 1979 plan, was slated to run from downtown Detroit into Oakland County and had been in the planning stages ever since. In 2010, it was resuscitated by a group of private sector actors, the M-1 coalition, who had become so frustrated with government inaction that it decided to take on and fund the project themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1078087412458255">Shea 2009b</xref>). The combination of decades of planning and the promise of private funding lead the FDOT to conclude that the project was “shovel ready” enough to merit funding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1078087412458255">Hurst and Shepardson 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>With a key part of the 2008 regional plan reliably funded, local officials turned their attention again to how the various parts of the system would be governed. Legislation (HB 5731-33) was again introduced to establish the legal transportation and revenue-raising authority required of both the regional plan and federal funders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1078087412458255">Shea 2010d</xref>). However, both the city and suburbs objected strenuously to the proposed legislation over the distribution of federal funding, labor regulations, the fear of hidden costs of a merger, and concerns over local autonomy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1078087412458255">Shea 2010c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1078087412458255">Crumm 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>In August 2010, the federal government announced that the Woodward Avenue project had been approved and cleared to proceed to the environmental study phase. The only problem was that the federally approved plan was not the plan proposed in 2008, which anticipated the extension of Woodward Avenue infrastructure into the northeastern suburbs along a route with 12 stops. Rather, the new Woodward proposal stopped at the limits of the city at 8-Mile Road. This development led some critics to question whether the Woodward project had turned into the People Mover all over again (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1078087412458255">Shea 2010b</xref>). They weren’t wrong.</p>
<p>In December 2011, U.S. Secretary of Transportation Ray LaHood announced the withdrawal of the federal funding promised for new transit projects in metropolitan Detroit citing concerns over the ability of the financially strapped municipality to uphold its own funding commitments,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1078087412458255">9</xref></sup> lack of progress on the creation of a regional transit authority,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1078087412458255">10</xref></sup> and the inadequacy of the most recent Woodward plans that stopped at the city limits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1078087412458255">Kaffer and Shea 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1078087412458255">Landon 2011</xref>). The announcement included the suggestion that funding may still be made available for a genuinely regional system based on cheaper and more quickly deployed BRT. The centerpiece of this proposal, first tabled by Michigan Governor Snyder in October 2011, is a novel approach to regional governance. Rather than relying on a merger deal between D-DOT and SMART, the proposed BRT system would be governed by a separate regional transit authority, which would operate independently from the existing transit authorities. Although support from city and suburban leadership seems to be coalescing behind this new proposal, no formal progress has been made on implementing the new project. For its part, the Woodward Avenue light rail line has not been completely derailed by the cancellation of federal funding or the shift to a regional BRT system. The M-1 coalition has vowed to privately build and operate its light rail project regardless of what happens with the public systems. However, this project is similarly stopped short of implementation.</p>
<p>Recent developments on regional transit suggest that the Detroit region has entered into another cycle of negotiations and planning spawned by the desire to access federal transit funding. For the second time an ambitious regional transit plan was reduced to a single keystone project located exclusively within the Detroit city limits—the Woodward Avenue light rail line—followed by the cancellation of funding.</p>

<title>Mirror, Mirror</title>
<p>These two accounts of the rise and fall of the regional governance of public transportation in metro Detroit reveal an interesting, and apparently cyclical, pattern. Optimistic attempts to (re)establish regional transportation authorities initially meet with success during a period of <italic>rosy regionalism</italic> or <italic>regionalism redux</italic>. As the practical difficulties of establishing a single regional transit authority mounted, enthusiasm for the project waned and excuses for inaction compounded in a period of <italic>regional realism</italic>. In the first period, the debate was primarily about how costs and benefits would be distributed between the actors within SEMTA. In the second, local authorities succeeded in creating DARTA only to be undone by legal challenges and legislative inertia. Federal largesse sparked a <italic>bonanza</italic> period in which actors gave regionalism another try. This enthusiasm, in a period of <italic>regionalism restarted</italic>, produced the comprehensive regional transit plans in 1979 and 2008, respectively. These outlined ambitious and ultimately unachievable systems and priorities. As the reality of these plans sunk in, <italic>regionalism</italic> is ultimately <italic>rejected</italic>. Infighting and the inability to compromise leads each set of actors, urban and suburban, to go it alone. The second period closed with the addition of the M-1 coalition and its decision to proceed without public support as well as the possible emergence of a third public transit authority to govern the proposed regional BRT system, resulting in even further fragmentation of the governance landscape.</p>
<p>What accounts for these cycles of regionalism and fragmentation? Why have attempts to establish consolidated governance of public transit in metropolitan Detroit come so close and failed so many times? The following sections consider these questions before outlining the reasons why a metropolitan transit partnership may be more likely than ever this time around.</p>

<sec id="section7-1078087412458255">
<title>Capacity and the Failure of Transit Governance in Metropolitan Detroit</title>
<p>Why has the construction of a regional public transit system consistently failed in metro Detroit despite the persistence of strong federal incentives and the consensus of local leaders about the advantages of such as system? Two sets of obstacles have been important. Constituents in the region have failed to coalesce around and empower a metropolitan transit organization because of the institutional polarization that resulted from Michigan’s creation of SEMTA. This coupled with the relatively unexceptional city–suburban tensions over the distribution of funding obligations, decision-making power, and infrastructure expenditures hindered the construction of a durable horizontal coalition of actors around the metropolitan transit agenda. At the rare moments when actors have been able to come together, most notably around the 2001 proposal for DARTA that was ultimately vetoed by the governor, the tenuous partnership lacked the vertical capacity to secure the necessary statutory changes at the state level or hold local conflicts at bay. So while the region has clearly been unable to muster sustainable horizontal capacity, neither have the actors been able to capitalize on the ephemeral partnerships that have formed in order to institutionalize vertical capacity.</p>
<sec id="section8-1078087412458255">
<title>Contextual and Structural Barriers to Horizontal Partnership and Capacity</title>
<p>In many respects, the most obvious issues that have dogged attempts at regional transit reform in metropolitan Detroit are not all that different from other metropolitan regions. In the case of metropolitan Detroit, the intervention of senior levels of government though the mechanism of regional transit grants proved to be a powerful incentive for horizontal collective action. However, power asymmetries—and disagreements over how they should be resolved within the regional transit coalition—prevented the emergence of a stable coalition and undermined the partnerships that emerged periodically throughout the negotiation process.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1078087412458255">11</xref></sup> Almost all of the challenges to the creation of a single regional transit system in metropolitan Detroit can be traced to power asymmetries that manifested in disagreements between the city and its suburbs over money, power, and routes.</p>
<p>It is not surprising that money tops the list of conflicts between the city and suburbs in the realm of public transportation. From the outset, Detroit and SEMTA clashed over the share of state and federal subsidies the city was entitled to. Transit subsidies are typically calculated based on ridership and miles of routes. SEMTA was awarded funding and meant to administer it for the entire region irrespective of where the bulk of routes and riders were located. In the 1970s, Detroit argued that the majority of SEMTA’s cash flow was as a result of city riders and city bus lines and that, therefore, the city should get a more equitable share. In 1975, Detroit had 91% of the passengers and 84% of regional miles upon which the subsidies were calculated but received only 61% of SEMTA’s funding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1078087412458255">D’Anieri 2007</xref>). To put this in perspective, based on these numbers the total subsidy per passenger for Detroit was 24¢ compared with $1.52 for SEMTA. As long as SEMTA was in charge of distributing public funds, Detroit argued that it would be shortchanged. In 1973, Detroit appealed to the state to determine what its subsidy would be if it were administered directly by the city and tried several times subsequently to escape SEMTA’s funding umbrella. The distribution of funds continues to be a problem in transit negotiations. For instance, the 2010 regional transit authority legislation (HB 5731-33) was publicly opposed by the city—even though the suburbs approved of the bulk of its measures—because the 65–35 division of federal transit funding negotiated in the 1980s would be replaced by traditional state and federal formulas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1078087412458255">Shea 2010d</xref>).</p>
<p>The distribution of benefits in any metropolitan partnership is always a prickly subject. However, in the case of metro Detroit, the distribution of <italic>costs</italic> has been arguably more contentious. Most proposals for a regional transit authority have included provisions for regional taxes and levies as dedicated local funding for operations. Milliken’s 1975 Tri-Party agreement included a $10 vehicle registration surcharge in the three metropolitan counties. This was naturally opposed by suburban representatives who argued that suburban voters were being forced to subsidize a system that would disproportionately benefit city transit riders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1078087412458255">D’Anieri 2007</xref>). Despite the expansion of suburban routes under SEMTA, and later SMART, this attitude has persisted. The 1994 route-sharing agreement between SMART and D-DOT fell apart not because of technical details but because tri-county voters approved a transit tax to help SMART out of its $20 million deficit and effectively precluded a metrowide tax proposed by D-DOT to help support both systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1078087412458255">Campbell and Schramm 2003</xref>). Without the potential for a regional funding source, D-DOT ceased any cooperation that could be construed as a prelude to a merger of the two systems. More recently, the city has stated that it would not support the creation of a regional transit authority without a dedicated funding source such as a regional transit tax (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1078087412458255">Detroit Free Press 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1078087412458255">Wattrick 2011a</xref>). Although all parties reportedly support the creation of a regional authority, suburban representatives oppose the idea of a regional tax without first seeking voter approval (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1078087412458255">Wattrick 2011b</xref>).</p>
<p>The suburban members of the metropolitan region are also concerned about the hidden costs of a city–suburban merger. Again, this debate springs from historical roots. One of the earliest disagreements between SEMTA and DSR in 1973 revolved around the terms of a potential merger. Detroit was focused on securing fair compensation for its fleet and service network but SEMTA was looking at the books. Absorbing DSR would be SEMTAs crown jewel, but it also meant assuming its liabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1078087412458255">D’Anieri 2007</xref>). These included its operating deficit as well as its already significant pension liabilities. The distribution of debt across partners has proven a significant barrier to a regional transit merger, and concerns of this nature still persist. In addition to unfunded liabilities, significant questions related to labor regulations remain undecided. What wages would prevail for workers in a merged system? Which union standards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1078087412458255">Shea 2010e</xref>)? In 2011, Oakland County executive L. Brooks Patterson was quoted as saying: “You’d have to show me how to merge the two systems without my taxpayers picking up a share of (DDOTs) debt. . . . You’re talking to a very reluctant groom” (quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1078087412458255">Helms and Hall 2011</xref>). He also opposed the 2010 regional transit authority legislation on the basis of labor costs saying: “It guarantees union jobs it guarantees jobs at higher wages, and it absolutely prohibits privatization. . . . This is the worst piece of legislation I’ve ever seen” (quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1078087412458255">Shea 2010c</xref>).</p>
<p>Any new regional transit authority would be responsible for distributing costs and benefits, managing debt, and determining labor regulations. How these are decided—in favor of the city or the suburbs—will depend on the balance of power on its new governing board. Power is also a perennial source of conflict in the Detroit region. Detroit consistently objected to the structure of the SEMTA board, which included more suburban representatives. Throughout successive negotiations, Mayor Coleman Young demanded a “one bus, one vote” distribution of power and demanded a 4 city, 4 suburban and 1 governor-appointed representative board structure throughout his tenure in order to obstruct merger attempts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1078087412458255">D’Anieri 2007</xref>). Young was forced to submit to a restructured board in 1976 in which he controlled only a third of the votes in order to gain access to the public funding to support his downtown light rail projects. Ultimately, the city objects to the idea of surrendering control over transit in the urban area to a collective body dominated by suburban representatives. Voting structure and representation also features in contemporary debates over the structure of a proposed regional transit authority (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1078087412458255">Shea 2010d</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, the city and suburbs have had difficulty agreeing on the transit routes of a consolidated system. While the distribution of federal subsidies is important, so is the distribution and configuration of infrastructure investment and services. The symbolic vote by suburban members to leave SEMTA in 1977 was in part a rejection of the radial form of proposed suburban bus routes that would mean that “all roads lead to Detroit” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1078087412458255">D’Anieri 2007</xref>). Suburban resistance to the proposed Woodward Avenue light rail/subway project was one of the factors that scuttled the 1979 transit plan as suburban officials claimed that digging a subway would require an inordinate and inequitable investment in the city at their expense. In fact, one of the downfalls of that regional plan was its prohibitive cost, which resulted from including pet projects from all of the players in order to ensure its approval. Proposed routes are still a point of contention and a barrier to regional transit. Although the Big Four approved the 2008 comprehensive regional transit plan suburban officials resented its focus on urban light rail. Macomb county officials argued that it would more effective to focus on a “golden triangle” of bus routes that would concentrate on bringing people into the city, rather than developing a system within the city limits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1078087412458255">Shea 2010a</xref>). The plan to extend the Woodward light rail route into the suburbs in contravention of the regional plan has also caused conflicts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1078087412458255">Shea 2010b</xref>). Detroit officials hoped that their investment in the city would incentivize the suburbs to build extensions beyond 8-Mile Road, but without federal funding and the private support that the city was going to use to build its portion of the planned route, such a feat was always unlikely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1078087412458255">Helms 2011b</xref>). The separation of suburban partners from the first phase of the Woodward project, and the subsequent decision to establish an independent regional transit authority rather than broker a merger between the two existing authorities, has done little to heal city–suburban divisions.</p>
<p>That the distribution of costs and benefits and the balance of decision-making power have led to conflicts between city and suburban actors is not at all surprising. These challenges are common in building coalitions across metropolitan regions in almost any policy area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1078087412458255">Nelles 2012</xref>). However, in the Detroit case, the urban–suburban divide has been exacerbated by the polarized development of public transit institutions in the metropolitan region, which has entrenched urban and suburban differences.</p>
<p>When the state created SEMTA in 1967, it was hoped that one day it would become the transit agency that consolidated urban and suburban systems. However, for reasons of political expediency, the Detroit system was initially excluded from SEMTA’s integrative mandate. SEMTA functioned for almost a decade consolidating all of the suburban systems before turning in earnest to the inclusion of the DSR. The (probably unintended) result of this approach was the creation of two opposing blocs of interests in metropolitan transit formalized in separate transit authorities (now D-DOT and SMART). A result of current regional transit proposals is the creation of two further actors (and sets of interests) in the transit policy space—the proposed independent regional transit authority and the private coalition that intends to pursue the Woodward project. The upshot is that the capacity of local and state actors to create a regional system has been undermined by structural divisions that have perpetuated a vicious rather than virtuous cycle and prevented the formalization of a regional network with horizontal capacity. Despite the occasional alignment of local leaders around a metropolitan transit plan, the persistent opposition of the two central actors, the transit agencies, has weakened regional efforts and capacity on both horizontal and vertical planes.</p>

<title>Vertical Capacity and Regional Transit Governance in Metropolitan Detroit</title>
<disp-quote>
<p>I have questioned both publicly and privately why, after more than six and a half years of hard work by me and my staff; a total of $6.5 million in appropriations for this project since 2005; and the strong support of the members of Michigan’s congressional delegation, Southeastern Michigan is still without even the genesis of a much needed commuter rail. (Rep. Carolyn Kilpatrick (Michigan) quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1078087412458255">Shea 2010f</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Vertical capacity is the ability to influence and participate in decision making in other political venues and is contingent on the perception of actors operating in those alternative venues of the legitimacy and effectiveness of the metropolitan partnership. The preceding quote is evidence of the diminishing confidence of senior politicians and legislators in the capacity of metropolitan Detroit and a signal of a waning interest in defending metro interests in state and federal forums; in other words, of weakening vertical capacity. When a senior federal official calls out the region’s “chronic inability to cooperate” and sends in a team of experts to help (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1078087412458255">Helms 2011c</xref>), it’s a sure sign that it is losing credibility. It also demonstrates the degree to which vertical power is tightly linked to the coherence of metropolitan partnerships—horizontal capacity.</p>
<p>This is a problem on a number of different levels. First and most obvious is the ability of the metropolitan region to secure state and federal funding. The UMTA’s assessment that Detroit’s dysfunctional transit system did not deserve federal funding is an attitude echoed across successive administrations and funding agencies. Secretary of Transportation Ray LaHood cautioned the region that it needed to cooperate to compete for the New Start funding. In other words, lack of cooperation has undermined the capacity of the region to access funding that has already been promised. This lack of horizontal capacity has resulted in the loss of funding opportunities in previous cycles, and will <italic>also undermine the competitiveness of the region for future grants</italic>. Actors in the region seem to know this. State Rep. Bert Johnson (Detroit) conceded: “We have to get our regional act together, then get federal money” (quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1078087412458255">Stanton 2011</xref>), before introducing the most recent set of legislation (Senate Bills 443-45) to create a regional transit authority. In fact, local political actors in the region are so aware of the importance of the appearance of cohesion in the past that they’ve even <italic>faked</italic> it—signing agreement after agreement that were almost immediately discredited—hoping that their plans would pass the scrutiny of funding officials. Recall the UMTA’s characterization of the 1979 plan as “a papering over of differences” and “at best a fanciful opening position in negotiations.”</p>
<p>A united front, not just the appearance of one, is important for more than just accessing public money and can be vital for securing the future of nascent metropolitan partnerships. A significant barrier to regional transit in metro Detroit is that statutory amendments are necessary to create and fund a regional transit organization. A parade of different versions of regional transit authority–enabling legislation has made it to the state legislature since the 1970s, each one failing at a different stage and almost all heavily opposed by the very actors it was meant to unite. Some attempts were opposed at the outset (the current legislation is a case in point) and others were rejected because the final product had been altered by the legislative process as legislators reflected the preferences of their constituents. Recently, L. Brooks Patterson called for a plan negotiated directly between the counties and the city (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1078087412458255">Shea 2010c</xref>). Legislation will still be required to implement it, but the implication of this position is that if all the actors agree <italic>and actually support</italic> a plan submitted to the state legislature it might have a chance of emerging intact. It also implies that the collective political clout of a united Big Four may be able to influence legislative debates to protect clauses that are a key to consensus. He might not have realized it, but Patterson was echoing the opinion of Coleman Young more than 30 years ago who concluded that the only hope for regional transit “was <italic>to present a united front to the state</italic> legislature who would have to approve it. At the state level legislators were wary of benefitting Detroit too much so suburban leadership would have to be involved from the start. They <italic>needed a ‘high powered committee’ to sell the plan</italic>” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1078087412458255">D’Anieri 2007</xref>, 140 emphasis added). The 2002 legislation vetoed by Governor Engler is evidence of the power of horizontal cohesion in protecting metro interests. This version of the legislation was fairly close to the original agreement signed by the Big Four on Mackinac Island in 2001. While it was somewhat weak as a governance document, it was the closest that metro Detroit ever got to binding legislation acceptable to all parties. This suggests that a similar display of solidarity behind a plan developed by consensus may also succeed where other attempts have failed. Notably, even when an agreement appeared to have vertical strength when it was brokered and supported by the Governor—as the Tri-Party agreement was in 1975—the lack of commitment, or horizontal support, by local actors undermined the process. The evolution of this case demonstrates the importance of horizontal capacity in pushing the metropolitan agenda in other policy venues. A steady and united front will help secure compromises from state and federal partners and oversight to ensure that the system is developed, as much as possible, according to the interests of the metropolitan region.</p>

<title>Cooperation and Capacity</title>
<p>The tumultuous legacy of regional transit governance negotiations in metropolitan Detroit contributes a great deal to our understanding of how metropolitan partnerships can be made and unmade. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1078087412458255">Weir, Rongerude, and Ansell (2009)</xref> rightly assert that collaboration isn’t enough. Horizontal networks at the metropolitan scale are only part of the metropolitan governance equation. Rather the characteristics of these networks and their resulting ability to exercise vertical power are core determinants of their effectiveness and longevity. This case supports these arguments. The weakness of both horizontal and vertical governance capacity has, to date, prevented the emergence of a durable solution for metropolitan public transit. However, it is most significant in demonstrating that the weakness of horizontal collaboration has undermined horizontal as well as vertical capacity of the effort. This suggests that while both dimensions are important, the cohesion and durability of regional coalitions and the unity of their agendas play a large role in determining vertical strength.</p>
<p>This article has identified a regionalism–localism cycle in response to federal policies and funding supporting regional mass transit. However, there are some reasons for optimism that the current period might not end in quite the same way as the last. Conditions have changed in the region over the past 40 years that may ultimately improve the odds that the latest round of federal funding will result in effective and consolidated metropolitan transit governance.</p>

<title>This Time It’s Different . . . : Reasons for Optimism about the Prospects for Regional Transit</title>
<p>A lot has changed since 1967 that may help to overcome some of the barriers discussed above. The first, and perhaps most significant, change from the first cycle is the economic health of the region. Over the past 10 years, metropolitan Detroit has experienced one of the most dramatic and rapid GDP and population contractions of any large city in the United States. Between 2006 and 2009, metro Detroit’s GDP has diminished by 9.0% led by losses to manufacturing, primarily in the auto industry and professional and business services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1078087412458255">Panek et al. 2011</xref>). Over the past decade, the U.S. Census reported that the central city has lost a quarter of its population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1078087412458255">Bureau 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1078087412458255">Seelye 2011</xref>). Although the suburban areas grew modestly, the metropolitan area as a whole still lost 1.2% of its residents over that period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1078087412458255">The Brookings Institution 2010</xref>). The unemployment rate in June 2011 was 13.7% and still among the highest among large metros in the country (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1078087412458255">Bureau of Labor Statistics 2011</xref>). The Brookings Institution recently listed metropolitan Detroit as one of the weakest performing metropolitan areas in their analysis of the economic recovery of American city-regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1078087412458255">Wial and Shearer 2011</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1078087412458255">12</xref></sup> Looking at the historical record, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1078087412458255">Hill et al. (2011)</xref> conclude the Detroit region had been resilient to economic shocks through the 1980s and 1990s but struggled to recover from shocks from 2000 on. The magnitude and duration—over a decade—of the economic decline of metropolitan Detroit is a staggering challenge for local authorities in the region. In the midst of this crisis, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1078087412458255">Nelles (2010)</xref> finds some evidence that the metropolitan region is starting to come together to confront these challenges in other policy areas. Transit development is collectively discussed as a key to regional recovery and economic resilience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1078087412458255">Helms 2011c</xref>). It is possible that the continuing crisis may increase the urgency of achieving a world-class regional transit system and bridge city and suburban divides. This is especially the case as suburban municipalities are increasingly feeling the strain of the economic downturn. Suburban cities have also been hard-hit by the foreclosure crisis and unemployment resulting from the economic contraction and auto industry restructuring. This has all resulted in shrinking municipal budgets and reduced services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1078087412458255">Detroit 2020 2011</xref>). This vulnerability may increase the sense of connection between city and suburban fortunes—the sense that we’re all in this together—and make compromise easier.</p>
<p>One of the more compelling reasons to tackle public transportation on the regional scale is job decentralization. The Brookings Institution ranked metro Detroit first among the top 10 extremely decentralized employment metros where less than 10% of employment is located within three miles of the central business district (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1078087412458255">Kneebone 2009</xref>). Only 22% of jobs are currently accessible by public transit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1078087412458255">Tomer et al. 2011</xref>) and, despite the Motor City moniker, approximately 30% of city residents lack access to a vehicle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1078087412458255">Bonds 2011</xref>). For a region with such a high unemployment rate, the imperative of connecting people to jobs in the suburbs is a compelling incentive to move forward with a regional transportation agenda. The importance of any system linking residents to suburban jobs was one of the reasons cited for the cancellation of federal funding for the localized Woodward line at the end of the second phase of regionalism and the development of the alternative BRT proposal.</p>
<p>The relationship between the city and suburbs has also changed since the 1960s. The traditional dichotomy of rich suburbs–poor city, Black city–White suburbs has diminished slightly as the region has become more socioeconomically integrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1078087412458255">Hanlon, Rennie Short, and Vicino 2010</xref>). Until the 1990s, metropolitan Detroit was one of the most racially segregated places in the country. While it still ranks quite high on metropolitan segregation indexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1078087412458255">McDade and Turner 2011</xref>), the Black population has increasingly moved into suburban neighborhoods since the 1990s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1078087412458255">The Brookings Institution 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1078087412458255">Farley, Danzinger, and Holzer 2000</xref>). Racial disparities between the city and suburban areas have played an important role in shaping attitudes to regional cooperation in Detroit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1078087412458255">Sugrue 2005</xref>). Suburban residents and policy makers feared that increasing links to the central city would facilitate the migration of Black residents to the suburbs and increase their exposure to central city crime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1078087412458255">Farley, Danzinger, and Holzer 2000</xref>). While metro Detroit has become slightly less racially divided and as race has subsided somewhat as a political issue since the 1970s, there is a greater chance that it would play as divisive a role as it has in previous eras of metro politics. It should be noted that few historical accounts of regional transit in metro Detroit mention race. However, in such a divided metropolis it was never far from the surface, no matter what the issue. Similarly, today race is rarely mentioned in debates about the regional governance of transit, but it may still have an impact on political attitudes. One suburban transit official noted in a sentiment repeated by several other interviewees throughout the region that race may have played a role in suburban reluctance to partner with the city at the beginning of the debate but that the economics and distribution of powers and responsibilities involved in a regional merger were the most important were the dominant considerations in ongoing debates.</p>
<p>One of the most significant changes in the political landscape of regional transit governance has been the entry of private sector actors. Frustrated with political inertia and encouraged by the potential for economic development, a group of private actors came together as M-1 Rail.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1078087412458255">13</xref></sup> This consortium has collectively pledged $120 million toward the Woodward Avenue light rail project, which will be used as part of the local share of matching funds required by federal grants. This buy-in, literally, by the region’s influential business community lends financial and political weight to the project that previous attempts have lacked (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1078087412458255">Hurst 2010</xref>). However, the involvement of the private sector does not guarantee harmony. Disagreements between the M-1 group and Detroit emerged over where tracks should be located (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1078087412458255">Shea 2011</xref>), though a compromise was eventually reached. Private money helped move the Woodward Avenue project forward yet they voiced no objection to the termination of the route before the city limits. In addition, the relationship between the city of Detroit and civic groups like the M-1 coalition and others, like the Kresge Foundation, has been stained at times. While these groups provide civic capacity that is lacking and add vertical influence to the partnership, city officials have been slow to embrace the participation of nongovernmental actors. The M-1 coalition decision to pursue the Woodward project without public assistance demonstrates the commitment of the group to advancing public transit in the city and may be an important example for parallel public projects. In this case, private sector involvement may help accelerate project implementation but it might not necessarily provide a boost to regionalism.</p>
<p>Of all the potential differences between this cycle and the last, the federal government preference that grant recipients develop the project through a regional transportation agency is perhaps the most significant (see footnote 10). The funding promised to Milliken by Ford in the previous cycle was the product of informal discussions between government officials and was only formalized in 1976. It was administered through the UMTA, which expected that a regional transportation agency would be created, but it was not a specific requirement of the grant. In communications with local officials, the UMTA indicated to metro Detroit that its divided and uncoordinated transit system did not merit federal funding and threatened to suspend future funding for rapid transit until a regional consensus was reached (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1078087412458255">D’Anieri 2007</xref>). Although the funding was eventually withdrawn, this threat was perhaps not enough to secure compliance. In this cycle, the creation of a regional transportation authority is a strong requirement for eligibility for New Start and other federal funding. This requirement is high on the minds of officials at the state and local levels as funding deadlines draw closer. U.S. Secretary of Transportation Ray LaHood stressed in a speech to local leaders that metro Detroit needs to set up a metropolitan transit system if it wants to compete for federal investment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1078087412458255">Shea 2009a</xref>). The RTCC, the current pass-through agency for funding, does not have the appropriate legal structure to manage such a system. The fact that inaction could result, again, in the withdrawal of federal support may increase the urgency of reaching an accord on regional transit in metro Detroit.</p>
<p>The situation of cooperative inertia on the regional transit file has prompted the federal government to intervene. A panel of experts—transit operators and public officials—was convened in August 2011 under the direction of Federal Transit Administrator Peter Rogoff to advise Detroit on how their systems overcame regional divisions and “map a bright future for regional transit solutions” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1078087412458255">Helms 2011c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1078087412458255">Federal Transit Administration 2011</xref>). The panel aligns with the Obama administration’s “Strong Cities, Strong Communities” program, a new interagency pilot initiative, which also convenes experts to mentor struggling cities. In 2011, Transportation Secretary LaHood instigated talks with metropolitan Detroit leaders and the Governor to help broker a deal toward a regional transit network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1078087412458255">Helms 2011a</xref>). These interventions have prompted the creation of a new coalition of county commissioners—Regional Partners Advocating Transit Here (R-PATH)—that have committed to work together to find a solution to the current stalemate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1078087412458255">Lawrence 2011</xref>). R-PATH joins an increasingly vocal set of nongovernmental stakeholders that are committed to the development of regional transit in metro Detroit. Among these, groups like the DRCC and Transportation Riders United (a local advocacy group) have been particularly active in both proposing solutions and providing feedback to negotiators. The increasing proliferation and emergence of civil society may also help influence local actors to work toward a regional solution.</p>
<p>A lot has changed since the first attempt of transit regionalism. The partners have the benefit of hindsight and are capable of learning from the mistakes of the past. But even more importantly, the stakes in this round are higher than ever before. The region needs a win to help propel it to economic recovery. The divisions between city and suburbs are softening as racial integration proceeds (albeit slowly) and the pain of recession has led to the weakening of all communities. The involvement of the private sector may breathe new life into old debates while providing the financial support to get some key projects off the ground. Federal requirements for a regional transit system also increase the cost of failure. Federal mentorship may inspire, or shame, local actors to cooperate. Finally, new coalitions are being created in support of the regional transit agenda. At present the future is unclear, but these key differences may result in a metropolitan transit partnership based on a strong regional coalition with greater horizontal and vertical capacity than any previous network.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This article explores whether and how the governance response to federal grants for regional mass transit differs from previous experience in metro Detroit. It asked why attempt to bring about transit reform have consistently failed even in periods of accord between conflicting actors. Finally, it asked whether significant changes in the regional context have the potential to empower it to complete a regional transit agenda.</p>
<p>The short answer is that there are some striking similarities between the debates over regional transit of the 1960s-1980s and current conflicts. This article outlines the parallel ebb and flow of enthusiasm and action for regionalism before and after federal funding announcements in both periods. This pattern suggests a dire future for this round of regionalism. The grand regional plans of the first cycle culminated in a single and exclusively urban project: the People Mover. The Woodward Avenue rail line, currently the only surviving project from the ambitious comprehensive plan, is beginning to look a lot like People Mover 2. However, there are some causes for hope. The changes in the socioeconomic landscape, the urgency of economic crisis, private sector leadership, and the degree of federal stewardship all have the potential to overcome the divisions of the past. The past has demonstrated that a common vision is not enough but that effective metropolitan governance in public transit requires a strong partnership to catalyze and shepherd institutional changes that must be debated at the state level. Ultimately, the future of regional transit in metropolitan Detroit will depend on the ability of actors to come together in a strong horizontal partnership that local actors regard as legitimate and will support in other policy venues. Such a partnership will ensure not only the sustainability of the metro transit agenda but also the creation of a policy actor that can advance and defend metro Detroit’s transit interests in a multilevel policy context.</p>
<p>The future success of regional collaboration on metropolitan transit will depend on overcoming the historical barriers that have divided city and suburban interests: asymmetries of cost outlays and cost burdens, in political representation in a regional transit authority, and the distribution of services. Whatever the next regional system proposed—light rail, BRT, merged or independent—the success of the metropolitan coalition must stem from a realization, particularly on the part of suburban actors, that a regional transit system is vital to the future prosperity of the entire region. This likely means that suburban leaders will have to support development of routes and infrastructure that will initially focus on the central city before the system is expanded to suburban regions, to have faith that even small changes in the metro core will benefit everyone even if concrete progress in the peripheries take some time to materialize. For its part, the city must recognize that this faith may have to be purchased with concessions to the suburbs in the balance of power on the governing board of the regional transit authority. If parties choose to pursue an independent regional authority—and leave SMART and D-DOT intact—the removal of legacy costs will simplify negotiations. However, the difficult issues of distributions of costs and benefits, timing, and balance of power in transit governance remain formidable obstacles to regional transit in metro Detroit. The involvement of federal and now state authorities in promoting new <italic>regional</italic> plans, commitment from the private sector to move forward on local transit options that could connect to a regional system, and the increasing pressures on the region from the economic decline of the metro core may all provide the impetus for actors to overcome these challenges.</p>
<p>This case is instructive on many levels and provides insights for the governance challenges of other metropolitan regions that are applicable in a wide variety of policy areas. First, it reveals the cyclical nature of policy debates and demonstrates that these are not problems that can easily be solved with money. Government investment that requires or encourages regional solutions can help to bring parties to the table, but it does not guarantee results. Second, solutions generated at other levels of government are difficult to achieve and implement. Successive waves of legislation to structure and fund a regional transit authority were often opposed by local actors because they were manufactured compromises that failed to take into account the core positions of the players. Because the local actors were left out of the negotiations, they had no skin in the game and therefore no problem vocally opposing the deals. The intervention of senior levels of government is often thought to be a catalyst to cooperation. However, without the involvement and investment of local actors in the process it will be difficult to craft a plan that will secure their buy-in and support (or compliance). Finally, this set of cases provides some insight into the role of public transit development in struggling regions. In regions suffering from economic downturns, large infrastructure projects can help stimulate recovery by putting people back to work and boosting public morale. Unfortunately, the increased urgency of federal investment has not yet resulted in effective collaboration. Rather, it has prompted a flurry of uncoordinated responses—new state legislation, calls for new taxing authority, new proposals for suburban projects, and a systemically isolated Woodward line. This suggests that while crisis can be a catalyst for action on critical files, it is not necessarily a catalyst for <italic>collective action</italic>. The final outcome of this most recent round of funding may not be known for many years. In the meantime, an analysis of the evolution of transit governance in metro Detroit can contribute to our understanding of the barriers to transit governance in metropolitan regions and how horizontal and vertical dimensions interact to impede the emergence of metro-level institutions.</p>

<p>A total of 14 interviews were conducted with political officials from the four counties and the City of Detroit, officials from the transit authorities, the state Department of Transportation, and regional planning and advocacy organizations between July and September 2011. Interviewees were selected based on their involvement in the transit policy process (i.e., as key officials at the negotiating table or staff tasked by county and city executives to work the file) and/or individuals who were active advocates or detractors of regional transit on behalf of local and regional stakeholder organizations (such as the Southeastern Michigan Council of Governments or the Detroit Regional Chamber of Commerce, among others).</p></fn>

<p>Detroit is unique in the United States as one of the only large metropolitan regions without a regional transit system. However, it is worth noting that metropolitan Detroit is not alone in its tumultuous experience with regional transit partnerships. Other American jurisdictions have also struggled with building effective city–suburban coalitions. Denver’s transit districts’ struggles, and eventual success, in providing service to its sprawling metropolitan region are often invoked as an example of taking the long view of regional coalition building (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1078087412458255">Schneider 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1078087412458255">Pendall et al. 2012</xref>). Ultimately, regional leaders were able to put aside their many differences in the understanding that a modern metropolitan transit system is one of the most important regional assets. In other metropolitan contexts strong intervention by state and provincial governments resulted from decades of inchoate service coordination such as Ontario’s reorganization of Toronto regional transit under the umbrella of Metrolinx in 2006.</p></fn>

<p>This pattern echoes the failure of coalition-building efforts in other metropolitan transit regions.

<p>Although the existence of a regional transit authority was not an explicit requirement for federal funding in either the first-period funding commitment or the programs that were set to support regional transit in the second period, it was a critically important informal requirement. In practice, the federal government will only fund initiatives for which there are clear lines of financial and legal responsibility. In the context of the Detroit case, federal funding shifted from a regional project to a localized one—the People Mover and the Woodward project—in both periods in part because these were to be implemented by a single transit authority in which these responsibilities were unambiguous. Similarly, the proposed creation of an independent regional transit authority in addition to existing authorities was a gambit to fulfill this requirement by skirting the politically difficult issue of a transit authority merger.</p></fn>

<p>Electoral cycles often provide powerful explanations for the behavior of elected officials, particularly with regards to regional governance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1078087412458255">LeRoux, Brandenburger, and Pandey 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1078087412458255">Feiock 2007</xref>). Leaders facing reelection may back away from controversial regional deals negotiated earlier in their tenure in order to appear more focused on local interests. Similarly, newly elected officials may choose not to honor agreements negotiated by their predecessors. These scenarios can explain the dissolution of regional partnerships and agreements over time, as it happened at several junctures over the course of the transit debate in Detroit. However, in the case of regional transit planning in metropolitan Detroit, this explanation is less persuasive as, on the eve of the failure of the 1979 agreement, both county and city executives were in the middle (second year) of their four-year electoral cycles. While the electoral safety of these officials may explain the emergence of a regional deal in the first place, it cannot, by itself, explain its demise. Consequently, this article focuses most closely on the issues of power asymmetry that so influenced the bargaining positions of each of the political actors at the table.</p></fn>
