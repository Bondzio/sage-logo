<body>
<p>What an honor and a sense of joy to receive this Lifetime Career Award from <italic>Management Communication Quarterly</italic>. I am thrilled with this commendation, but I feel particularly humbled given the achievements of outstanding <italic>MCQ</italic> editors over the years and the extraordinary contributions of editorial board members, reviewers, forum editors, and contributors. So many scholars merit this award for their dedication, commitment, and vision to the field and to <italic>MCQ</italic>. I’m deeply grateful to Jim Barker, <italic>MCQ</italic> Editor, and to my colleagues, Patrice, Boris, Gail, Dennis, and Cynthia, for their heartwarming and moving tributes to my career. Given that organizational communication is first and foremost a community of scholars, this award represents the accomplishments of and collaborations with so many academicians who have made <italic>MCQ</italic> the flagship journal of the field.</p>
<p>As a scholar who came into the discipline in 1977, I longed for a journal that would become the primary home for the empirical and theoretical scholarship in organizational communication. As the recognized academic leader in cultivating, articulating, and consolidating research and theory in organizational communication, <italic>MCQ</italic> has become this special place (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0893318912454576">Rooney, McKenna, &amp; Barker, 2011</xref>). The journal has not only fostered a strong sense of community and identity, but it has also played a key role in defining what organizational communication is and what it can be.</p>
<p>As a respondent to this forum, I have struggled to find my voice. I feel so indebted to my cohorts, so bonded in this enterprise that we collectively embrace, and so touched by their commendations. Patrice, I extend my deepest appreciation for your saga of facts, legend, and legacy in charting my <italic>MCQ</italic> journey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0893318912454576">Buzzanell, 2012</xref>). No greater pleasure could come to a scholar than to hear that one’s “ideas, critical linkages to diverse disciplines, and analytical strategies . . . have moved organizational communication . . . and <italic>MCQ</italic> forward.” As a past editor, you have clearly paved the way for multiple voices, ontologies, and methodologies to enter <italic>MCQ</italic>’s marketplace of ideas and your many contributions to the journal have been invaluable.</p>
<p>To Boris, I am moved by your description of good mentors, particularly the qualities that they instill and their allegiances to lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0893318912454576">Brummans, 2012</xref>). I am truly humbled by your comments and if I have imparted even a portion of the teachings of my own mentor, I feel fulfilled. Yet in this reciprocal relationship, it is the caliber of students like you that provide the excitement, energy, and dedication to a mentor’s passion for the field.</p>
<p>To Gail, a fellow ambassador of organizational communication, you highlight another arena in which <italic>MCQ</italic> has figured prominently, as a scholarly home for cross-disciplinary work. I am touched by your chronicle of my role in sharing the “org com” narrative and in brokering interdisciplinary ventures in which communication scholars figure prominently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0893318912454576">Fairhurst, 2012</xref>). Both activities give me great satisfaction and you have figured prominently in so many of these collaborations. Dennis adds an international element to this cross-disciplinary work. Dennis, I have never thought of myself as an “epistemological polyglot” (a term that has an odd ring to my ears), but it is an honor to wear such a badge and to engage in “nomadic theorizing with a communication compass” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0893318912454576">Mumby, 2012</xref>). Both designations resonate strongly with my career aspirations and provide me with a sense of great satisfaction. To the degree that this nomadic compass extends the field’s international outreach is also a credit to you, <italic>MCQ</italic>, and the many colleagues who have embraced this mission.</p>
<p>Cynthia, drawing on bona fide group theory to integrate essays in this forum is so very fitting and appropriate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0893318912454576">Stohl, 2012</xref>). I am touched by the analogy between the bona fide group dimensions and key aspects of my career. Developing stable but permeable boundaries has clearly been a central aim for <italic>MCQ</italic>, particularly in developing it as a home for organization/management communication scholars while maintaining a sense of invitation for new ideas. Highlighting and preserving its communication focus is so pivotal to the past and future of <italic>MCQ</italic>, as the journal continues to negotiate interdependence with its immediate context in the larger fields of communication and organizational studies.</p>
<p>To all my dear colleagues, your heartfelt tributes encompass so many memories of the 25-year history of <italic>MCQ</italic> and my nearly 40 years in the field. These memories shape my salute to <italic>MCQ</italic> as I look back on the status of organizational communication in 1987 and look forward to the future that <italic>MCQ</italic> holds. My tribute rests on five familiar yet important themes—high quality scholarship, communication centrality, innovative and cutting-edge research, interdisciplinary focus, and international outreach.</p>
<p>Of critical importance is <italic>MCQ</italic>’s aim to publish high quality scholarship grounded in communication as a lens for exploring organization and organizing. Although “quality” is an elusive term, scholars generally concur that it stems from high standards, rigorous thinking, and insightful analyses—irrespective of the ontological and methodological foci of articles. Developing a reputation for quality scholarship became a mandate for <italic>MCQ</italic> in its formative years. Specifically, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0893318912454576">Miller (2007</xref>, p. 442) noted that, “the quality of scholarship would eventually make or break the journal” and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0893318912454576">Buzzanell (2007</xref>, p. 445) vowed “to make the reputation for high quality scholarship [in the journal] even better by publishing the best organizationally-oriented communication theory and research.” Raising the caliber of conceptual and theoretical essays while increasing the rigor of empirical articles has made <italic>MCQ</italic> the premier outlet for “the best organizational communication scholarship” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0893318912454576">Buzzanell, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0893318912454576">Miller, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0893318912454576">Rooney et al., 2011</xref>). The future of the journal rests squarely on publishing the highest quality scholarship in the field.</p>
<p>A second and closely related theme is the journal’s role in fostering a repertoire of rich and complex communication perspectives for studying organization and organizing. A willingness to take risks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0893318912454576">Miller, 1993</xref>) and to play out the tensions in organization-oriented communication scholarship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0893318912454576">Buzzanell, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0893318912454576">Zorn, 2007</xref>) broadened the purview of the journal well-beyond the transmission and information processing models that dominated <italic>MCQ</italic>’s “creation period” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0893318912454576">Roomey et al., 2011</xref>). These two themes, sustaining high caliber scholarship and embracing pluralistic and complex views of communication, form the bedrock of <italic>MCQ</italic> and hold the keys to advancing the journal’s stature in the future.</p>
<p>A third theme that deserves special recognition is <italic>MCQ</italic>’s reputation for publishing innovative, cutting-edge thinking on a wide array of conceptual and theoretical issues. Throughout its history, special issues, commentaries, and forum essays have opened spaces for new agendas and introduced alternative models of research. For example, special issues on topics such as the corporate meltdown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0893318912454576">Conrad, 2003</xref>); discourse and resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0893318912454576">Putnam, Grant, Michelson, &amp; Cutcher, 2005</xref>); organizational politics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0893318912454576">Fleming &amp; Spicer, 2008</xref>), and organizational rhetoric (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0893318912454576">Heath, Taylor, &amp; Palenchar, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0893318912454576">Sillince &amp; Suddaby, 2008</xref>) have featured new scholars, reframed traditional research arenas, and fostered insightful conversations. Few readers realize how vital the forum essays have been in provoking intellectual discussions and initiating new research frontiers.</p>
<p>As regular features of <italic>MCQ</italic>, these essays have explored a broad spectrum of ideas and expanded the horizon of the field through triggering sustained research in new domains, such as knowledge management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0893318912454576">Zorn &amp; May, 2002</xref>), corporate social responsibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0893318912454576">May &amp; Zorn, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0893318912454576">Roper &amp; Barker, 2011</xref>), and engaged and public scholarship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0893318912454576">Demsey, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0893318912454576">Krone &amp; Harter, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0893318912454576">Tretheway, 2002</xref>). Recent forums on the communicative enactment of particular types of organizations signal important new frontiers for building knowledge in organizational/management communication (see, for example, special forums on health care organizations, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0893318912454576">Harter &amp; Zoller, 2010</xref>; state-owned enterprises, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0893318912454576">Roper &amp; Barker, 2011</xref>; and nonprofit and voluntary organizations, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0893318912454576">Koshmann, 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0893318912454576">Kirby &amp; Koshmann, 2012</xref>). Special kudos to forum editors, Jim Barker, Steve May, and Kathy Krone, and many guest editors, who have provided intellectual guidance in developing cutting-edge thinking and extending knowledge of the field.</p>
<p>The fourth key theme salutes <italic>MCQ</italic>’s role in advancing interdisciplinary scholarship. Given the mission of the journal and the goals of its founders, this theme seems self-evident. However, the nature of the journal’s interdisciplinary outreach has been a contested issue in <italic>MCQ</italic>’s history. Specifically, the founder and first editors of the journal envisioned it as a home for the convergence of scholarship on management writing and speaking, interpersonal communication, corporate communication, and organizational communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0893318912454576">Yates &amp; Kelly, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0893318912454576">Yates, Kelly, &amp; Feingold, 1987</xref>). This intersection made sense in 1987, given the public address, persuasion, and media roots that formed the early scholarship in organizational and management communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0893318912454576">Putnam &amp; Cheney, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0893318912454576">Redding &amp; Tompkins, 1988</xref>).</p>
<p>Early in the journal’s history, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0893318912454576">Smeltzer (1993)</xref> voiced a concern that neither an integrative definition nor a domain for management communication scholarship had surfaced in the journal’s first six volumes. This concern came to a peak when a special issue on “A Discussion of our Disciplines” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0893318912454576">Miller, 1996</xref>) sparked controversy among professionals who held disparate backgrounds and saw management communication in very different ways. The difficulties in soliciting and integrating scholarship from the four original subdisciplines led editors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0893318912454576">Zorn (2007)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0893318912454576">Conrad (2007)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0893318912454576">Barker (2006)</xref> to push for an interdisciplinary outreach in a distinctly different and international direction. Specifically, the array of disciplinary homes of editorial board members, reviewers, and contributors expanded under all three editors. For <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0893318912454576">Conrad (2007)</xref>, more than one third of his editorial board members were from organizational studies and management programs and 40% of his board resided outside the United States. A multidisciplinary audience for the journal began to grow and has continued to develop under Barker’s editorship. Moreover, recent issues of <italic>MCQ</italic> suggest that the journal has come full circle in its efforts to develop disciplinary connections with scholarship in corporate communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0893318912454576">Christensen &amp; Cornelissen, 2011</xref>) and organizational rhetoric (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0893318912454576">Heath, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0893318912454576">Sillince &amp; Suddaby, 2008</xref>). Thus an ironic twist has occurred in the history of the journal’s interdisciplinary outreach.</p>
<p>Although the term <italic>interdisciplinary</italic> is clearly contested, it seems fundamental to the mission of <italic>MCQ</italic>. Having editors, editorial board members, contributors, and reviewers who have disciplinary/departmental homes outside of communication is essential to the goal of preserving open spaces and providing a sense of place for organizational/management communication scholarship. Similar to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0893318912454576">Conrad’s (2007)</xref> projections, I surmise that over time <italic>MCQ</italic>’s interdisciplinary partners and audiences will shift among multiple and diverse constituencies rather than develop a narrow set of sustained relationships. These shifts will likely follow new frontiers that surface as a result of cross-disciplinary collaborations and research activities in particular domains. In general, an interdisciplinary outreach refers to the breadth and depth of dialogue among an array of scholars who share common threads and yet respond to different disciplinary pulls. This outreach seems essential for preserving the mission and the cutting-edge scholarship of <italic>MCQ</italic>.</p>
<p>Closely linked to this interdisciplinary focus, internationalization is the fifth theme in my tribute to the journal. Situating the journal in an international context has clearly come of age since the time when <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0893318912454576">Zorn (2007)</xref> vowed to focus on the second half of <italic>MCQ</italic>’s name, “An International Journal.” The past three editors have amassed editorial boards with a strong international presence, attracted contributors and reviewers from around the globe, published articles on international and transnational issues, and presented special forums on organizational communication in Brazil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0893318912454576">Putnam &amp; Casali, 2009</xref>) and France (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0893318912454576">Cooren &amp; Grosjean, 2010</xref>). <italic>MCQ</italic> continues to reach out to Africa, South/Central America, and Asia as the number of contributors and editorial board members from these regions continues to grow.</p>
<p>What lies ahead for <italic>MCQ</italic> in the next 25 years? Addressing this question rests on the evolution of the field as well as on the agendas of future <italic>MCQ</italic> editors. Based on current trends, however, I would surmise that the journal will continue to focus on two central problematics—the interface of organization and society and the organization–communication relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0893318912454576">Mumby &amp; Stohl, 1996</xref>). Both the interdisciplinary and international cast of the journal rests on continuing to explore the organization–society relationship. New developments in marketing communication and public relations overlap with research agendas in corporate social responsibility, stakeholder communication, and civic society. Practices of constructive dialogue and enlightened choice in public relations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0893318912454576">Health, 2011</xref>) intersect with the interpretive and critical approaches to corporate social responsibility and suggest avenues for understanding the paradoxes and tensions between internal and external communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0893318912454576">Cheney, Roper, &amp; May, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>As research agendas become increasing collaborative across continents, <italic>MCQ</italic> is likely to reach a new plateau of internationalization in the next several decades. International issues will likely infuse standard research agendas in most areas of the field, especially as organizations strive to address such political and social problems as climate change, economic collapse, and poverty. Current attention to the role of communication in particular types of international organizations, for example, international governmental and nongovernmental organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0893318912454576">Stohl &amp; Stohl, 2005</xref>) and state-owned enterprises (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0893318912454576">Roper &amp; Schoenberger-Orgad, 2011</xref>), underscores the likelihood that research initiatives will become increasingly global.</p>
<p>Relatedly, I suspect that <italic>MCQ</italic> will continue its current focus on interorganizational arenas, private-public partnerships, community collaborations, and institutionalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0893318912454576">Heath, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0893318912454576">Lammers, 2011</xref>). The number of empirical articles that focus on the interorganizational and societal levels reveals how far <italic>MCQ</italic> has come since its first six volumes when research centered primarily on the individual/dyadic level of analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0893318912454576">Smeltzer, 1993</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0893318912454576">1</xref></sup> More importantly, <italic>MCQ</italic> should become a home for exemplars and essays on different approaches to the use of multilevel analyses on a variety of organizational/management communication topics. Continuing to center on the constitutive nature of communication will become the challenge, as scholars struggle with situating the role of messages, discourse, dialogue, and meaning in the interorganizational terrain.</p>
<p>It is likely that <italic>MCQ</italic> will continue to be a major venue for scholars interested in the organization–communication relationship, whether studying how communication constitutes organizations (CCO; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0893318912454576">Cooren, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0893318912454576">McPhee &amp; Zaug, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0893318912454576">Taylor &amp; Van Every, 2000</xref>), the organizing dimensions of corporate communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0893318912454576">Christensen &amp; Cornelissen, 2011</xref>), a communicative theory of the firm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0893318912454576">Kuhn, 2008</xref>), the constitution of clandestine organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0893318912454576">Stohl &amp; Stohl, 2011</xref>), or leadership as the art of translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0893318912454576">Cooren &amp; Fairhurst, 2002</xref>). Scholarship in this arena is likely to continue to grow, given the recent focus on materiality, especially the connections among sites, objects, place, and the body in organizational/management communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0893318912454576">Ashcraft, Kuhn, &amp; Cooren, 2009</xref>). Alternative theoretical perspectives have surfaced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0893318912454576">Schoeneborn, 2011</xref>) and will likely appear in future issues of <italic>MCQ</italic> in addition to studies that embrace sociomaterial practices and new technologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0893318912454576">Leonardi, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>As conceptual maps of the journal’s content reveals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0893318912454576">Rooney et al., 2011</xref>), scholars will also continue to examine the central problematic of voice through focusing on the lenses of difference and diversity, power and resistance, discursive practices, emotions, and work–life issues. Although it is unclear as to the form and direction of future studies in these areas, no doubt, <italic>MCQ</italic> will be at the forefront of these developments.</p>
<p>Looking back and looking forward, it is clear that <italic>MCQ</italic>, in its 25th year of publication, has marked its place in the field. A flagship journal, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0893318912454576">Mumby and Stohl (1996</xref>, p. 50) note, “functions as the primary means by which ideas in a discipline gain ascendency.” In 1996, many subareas of communication and management studies had journals devoted to their specific domains while organizational communication did not. Fortunately, the field looks very different now and <italic>MCQ</italic> has played a formative role in shaping its terrain. It is with deep gratitude that I accept this award and with a genuine indebtedness to <italic>MCQ</italic>, its editors, and my colleagues. I would also like to give a special commendation to Jim Barker, who has moved <italic>MCQ</italic> to a new level of excellence through his visionary leadership during his six years as editor. He has engendered a spirit of community and fostered a sense of identity while casting a broad net to a large group of scholars interested in organization/management communication. May his legacy and that of <italic>MCQ</italic>’s continue for another 25 years.</p>
