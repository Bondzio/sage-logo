<abstract>
<p>RDF and other high calorific value fractions derived from MSW by mechanical treatment processes contain goods such as cans, cables, zippers or batteries which are highly concentrated in metals. The objective of this study was to investigate the importance of these metal carriers (i) for total metal loads and (ii) for sampling errors. Six different products derived from MSW were analysed for carrier bound and total loads of Al, Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Ni, Pb and Zn. Sophisticated sample preparation procedures were applied in order to quantify the separate analyte loads from metallic carriers. Typical values for total metal contents and shares of carrier bound loads were found as follows: Al, 20 g kg<sup>−1</sup> (30%); Cr, 0.4 g kg<sup>−1</sup> (50%); Cu, 5 g kg<sup>−1</sup> (80%); Fe, 40 g kg<sup>−1</sup> (80%); Ni, 0.15 g kg<sup>−1</sup> (70%); Pb, 0.4 g kg<sup>−1</sup> (40%); and Zn, 2 g kg<sup>−1</sup> (30%). NiCd-batteries were found in three materials representing 30–70 % of total Cd contents (total 6–20 mg kg<sup>−1</sup>). Sampling errors related to the distribution of analyte carriers were in most cases found in the range of 50–150 % relative standard deviation in spite of the large sample masses of 200–800 kg. The results demonstrate: (1) metal carriers are responsible for significant analyte loads; if they are not adequately considered, total metal contents may be severely underestimated; (2) sampling errors are dominated by the distribution of carriers; (3) correct analysis of total metal contents including loads from metallic components requires expensive sample preparation.</p>

<title>Metals in municipal solid waste</title>
<p>Municipal solid waste (MSW) and products from mechanical treatment (MT) or mechanical biological treatment (MBT) of MSW are commonly known to be very heterogeneous materials and difficult to analyse. Heterogeneity results from the enormous variability of disposed products comprised in MSW. In particular, heavy metal contents vary extremely since individual products (often such, which irregularly occur in MSW) are highly concentrated in these elements. Cables, brass made shower hoses, stainless kitchenware, electric or electronic devices, etc. which scarcely occur in MSW contain high amounts of heavy metals in metallic species, either pure (e.g. Cu as electric conductor material) or as major components in alloys (brass, stainless steel, etc.). Also many other consumer goods which are regularly collected via MSW contain tiny pieces of metallic components. Examples are: clothes or bags with zippers (brass or zinc casting alloys), toys with metallic drive mechanisms (brass made cogwheels), disposable razors (stainless razor blade), curtains with lead-weighted hems etc. (common applications of the chemical elements in consumer goods are listed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0734242X12442740">Vassilev and Braekman-Danheux (1999))</xref>. Products of linear shape (cables, shower hoses, etc.) or textiles and plastics containing small metallic components may be transferred into high calorific value fractions, since they can hardly be removed by magnetic or eddy current separation techniques. (Note, that common practice of M(B)T is addressed here, which comprises rough shredding, screening or ballistic separation, magnetic separation and in some cases eddy current separation).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0734242X12442740">
<title>Specification of heterogeneity, terminology</title>
<p>In terms of sampling theory, heterogeneity arising from different analyte contents among ‘constituents’ (individual pieces) is defined as constitutional heterogeneity CH<sub>L</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0734242X12442740">Gy, 1992</xref>). CH<sub>L</sub> causes the ‘correct sampling error’ (CSE) (latest sampling theory terminology, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0734242X12442740">Gy, (2004))</xref> which is also known as ‘fundamental sampling error’. CH<sub>L</sub> is an intrinsic property of the lot (here, the amount of high calorific value fraction to be sampled) as long as the constituents stay unaltered. The term ‘analyte carrier constituent’ or ‘analyte carrier particle’ is introduced for such constituents or particles that contain analyte carrier components; whereas the term ‘analyte carrier components’ denotes homogeneous, analyte rich materials. (Note that in sampling theory the term ‘physical component’ classically is used for the pure mineralogical components in minerals. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0734242X12442740">Gy (1992))</xref>. Metals, such as pure copper, brass, zinc casting alloys, stainless steel are metallic analyte carrier components appearing in high calorific value fractions. Examples for non-metallic carrier components are diverse PVC materials containing Cd-, Pb- or Zn-stearates as stabilizers (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0734242X12442740">Gächter and Müller (1990)</xref> for application of heavy metal stabilizers), or PET containing antimony-catalyst. Three kinds of constituents are identified (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0734242X12442740">Figure 1</xref>): (1) non-carriers, which are free of analyte carrier components; (2) poor carriers, containing analyte carrier components in a mass share of less than approximately 10%; and (3) rich carriers, containing analyte carrier components in a major mass share of greater than approximately 10%. Examples for carriers have already been mentioned above (rich carriers: cables, shower hoses; and poor carriers: plastics and textiles with small metallic parts integrated, e.g. trousers). If a constituent is a well defined (consumer) product the term ‘analyte carrier product’ is also used for NiCd-batteries, for example. (In this case the sintered Cd anode inside the battery is the analyte carrier component.) Analyte contents in carrier components and in rich carrier constituents exceed the average analyte contents in high calorific value fractions by two, three or more orders of magnitude. For example, cables contain several hundred grams of copper per kilogram cable whereas refuse derived fuels (RDF) and high calorific value fractions contain several hundred to several thousand milligrams of copper per kilogram of material (see results and literature range given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0734242X12442740">Table 4</xref> below). In contrast the non-carrier constituents and the non-carrier components in poor carrier constituents are of low heavy metal contents. For example, the copper contents in bulk material of high calorific value fractions and RDF such as paper, packaging plastics are in a range of 50–200 mg kg<sup>−1</sup> (see data published by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0734242X12442740">Bilitewski and Heilmann (1999)</xref>, Riber et al. (2009) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0734242X12442740">Rotter (2002))</xref>.</p>

<title>Hypothesis of carrier-induced metal loads and errors</title>
<p>It is presumed that the analyte carrier constituents are responsible for major amounts of analyte loads in high calorific value fractions and contribute significantly to CH<sub>L</sub> and sampling errors. This hypothesis is based on the fact, that: (1) metallic analyte carrier components can dominate analyte loads, even if present in mass share of 0.1%, and (2) one or a few analyte carrier constituents can dominate the analyte content in a sample (even at high sample masses). This concerns all sampling levels. (Note, that in sampling theory the original samples taken from the lot are denoted as primary samples; every mass reduction, also the extraction of test portions is understood as a sampling step resulting in secondary, tertiary etc. samples.) For example, a cable containing 50 g copper present in a primary sample of 100 kg contributes 500 mg kg<sup>−1</sup> to the total copper content of the sample. The same contribution results from a tiny piece of 0.5 g copper in a 1 kg laboratory sample or a 0.15 mg copper particle in a 300 mg test portion (assuming spherical shape 0.15 mg corresponds with a particle size of approximately 0.3 mm). Thus the distribution of carrier constituents may dominate the variation of the analyte contents in the samples and may therefore determine sampling errors. Furthermore, the occurrence of outliers probably results from the presence of analyte carrier particles in samples.</p>
<p>The extent of errors documented for analyses of RDF in the literature corroborates the hypothesis of analyte carriers causing analyte loads and errors. A couple of investigations have been performed to find appropriate methods for quality assurance in RDF and solid recovered fuels (SRF) analysis (project QUOVADIS by Vaccaro et al. (2008), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0734242X12442740">Flamme (2009)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0734242X12442740">Denner and Kuegler (2006)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0734242X12442740">Prochaska et al. (2004)</xref>). All authors state large variations in the results for heavy metals. Metallic particles (copper) are mentioned as the reason for outliers. However, carrier bond analyte loads and carrier-induced error generation have not been systematically quantified so far (except the quantification of metallic carrier bound Al, Cu and Zn loads by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0734242X12442740">Denner and Kuegler (2006))</xref>.</p>
<p>The objective of the present study was to test the hypothesis whether metallic analyte carriers in high calorific value fractions derived from MSW contribute significantly to total heavy metal contents and sampling errors. The results are expected to contribute to the fundamental understanding of heterogeneity and to provide a basis for optimization of sampling and sample preparation techniques.</p>

<title>Concept</title>
<p>The two crucial tasks in quantifying the analyte loads from metallic analyte carrier components are: (1) the determination of sample masses to ensure that a sufficient number of rich analyte carrier constituents occur in the samples; and (2) the quantitative separation of metallic analyte carrier components (originating either from rich or poor carrier constituents) from samples. Respecting these requirements leads to the following concept (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0734242X12442740">Figure 1</xref>): Sample masses are determined from statistical calculations in order to obtain samples that are representative concerning carrier bound loads. The rich carrier constituents are picked out of primary samples and are disassembled or broken in order to liberate the analyte carrier components (or carrier products in case of incorporated batteries) for separate analysis. The remaining ‘bulk material’ from primary samples including poor analyte carrier constituents is shredded to allow a mass reduction to secondary samples suitable for laboratory treatment. The particle size reduction produces rich analyte carrier constituents freshly from poor analyte carrier constituents. (For example trousers, if shredded, yield mostly non-carrier constituents which are pure textile constituents, but a few rich carrier constituents, that carry parts from the broken zipper). The new, rich analyte carrier constituents are separated from secondary samples and disassembled for separate analysis of analyte carrier components. The remaining bulk material free of metallic analyte carrier components is milled and analysed conventionally via microwave digestion and quantitative analyses of digests.</p>

<title>Materials analysed</title>
<p>Six different high calorific value fractions, two of them utilized as RDF, were analysed (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0734242X12442740">Table 1</xref>). All materials were produced from MSW by Austrian MBT or MT plants. In all cases mixed MSW mainly from households was processed (#200301 in European Waste Catalogue). The collection areas differed as follows: rural as well as urban in the case of plant A, rural in case of plant B and urban in case of plant C. Plant A employed a DANO<sup>®</sup>-drum in which paper and cardboard is disintegrated and thus not transferred into high calorific value fractions. Fractions from plant A were landfilled until 2004 due to economic reasons.</p>

<title>Sample masses</title>
<p>Masses of primary samples were determined from the cases of Cu and Cd. These elements were expected to be the ‘worst-case-analytes’ concerning CH<sub>L</sub>. As the heterogeneity concerning copper is reduced when rich carrier constituents get separated, secondary and higher level sample masses were determined from the requirements for Cd. The equation in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0734242X12442740">Bunge and Bunge (1999)</xref> was modified for its application to high calorific value fractions. The modification concerns the replacement of particle diameters by particle masses:</p>

<p>where <italic>M</italic> denotes the required sample mass (kg), <italic>ω</italic> the mass fraction of analyte carrier constituents (dimensionless), <italic>c</italic><sub>expected</sub> the expected analyte content of the material to be sampled (mg kg<sup>−1</sup>), <italic>s</italic><sub>desired</sub> the desired standard deviation (mg kg<sup>−1</sup>), <italic>m</italic><sub>max</sub> the mass of the heaviest carrier particle (kg) and <italic>m</italic><sub>10%</sub> the 10th percentile of carrier particle mass distribution (kg).</p>
<p>Bunge and Bunge’s approach assumes analyte carrier particles being of spherical shape. The original equation operates with the parameters particle diameter and density which particle masses are determined from. In high calorific value fractions carrier constituents are seldom of spherical shape but often cylindrical (cables, pipes or tubes) or planar (floor liners, foils, etc.). Spherical products may be hollow (PVC balls, various metallic containers such as cans or stainless sugar shakers). Therefore particle masses into the equation were directly entered and this thereby avoided the use of a corrective shape factor as, for example, known from the formula in the EN 15442:2011 standard.</p>
<p>The assumptions for sample mass calculations were as follows: pure copper and cadmium stabilized PVC (Cd content 2.5 g kg<sup>−1</sup>) were assumed to be relevant analyte carrier components contributing 2 g kg<sup>−1</sup> to total Cu and 10 mg kg<sup>−1</sup> to total Cd contents in the high calorific value fractions. Particle masses of rich analyte carrier constituents were expected to be in a range of 20 to 200 g in primary samples, 1 to 10 g in &lt; 40 mm secondary samples (0.5–2.5 g in the case of &lt; 15 mm samples) and 5–20 mg in tertiary samples. The acceptable particle mass (for Cd stabilized PVC being the presumptive analyte carrier component) in test samples was calculated by solving Equation (1) for particle mass and setting <italic>m</italic><sub>10%</sub> = <italic>m</italic><sub>max</sub> (implies uniform particles). The sample mass was in this case fixed at 300 mg (mass of test portion for microwave digestion).</p>
<p>The calculated sample masses (desired sampling errors in parenthesis) were around 1200 kg for primary samples [20% relative standard deviation (rsd)], 30 kg for &lt; 40 mm secondary samples (9 kg in the case of &lt; 15 mm samples) (20% rsd) and 1.2 kg for tertiary samples (5% rsd). Desired masses could not be achieved on primary level, partly on secondary level (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0734242X12442740">Table 2</xref>) due to underestimated expenditure of labour for the treatment of primary samples. The maximum particle mass in analytical samples were calculated to be around 0.25 mg (10% rsd).</p>

Separated constituents were stored for later treatment at the laboratory. The remaining bulk material was shredded to &lt; 40 mm. Secondary samples at plant A were obtained from the shredded bulk material by a manual increment division procedure referring to the method described in the EN 15443:2011 standard. Secondary samples were – in contrast to the standardized method – not directly taken from the spread material (‘bed’) but the bed was removed shovel by shovel and the material spread again. Secondary samples were extracted from this second bed. At plant B and C about one-fifth from each &lt; 40 mm sample material (also obtained by manual increment division method) was shredded to particle size &lt; 15 mm. In this case secondary samples were obtained from the &lt; 15 mm material by another mass reduction step, again applying the manual increment division method. Note, that these &lt; 15 mm samples in principle had to be denoted as ‘tertiary’ samples due to the further mass reduction (=sampling) step. In order to avoid confusion about the denotation of samples entering the laboratory, the two-stage shredding and mass reduction were considered as one step and the denotation ‘secondary’ sample was retained. In all cases a UNTHA RS-30 four-shaft-shredder was employed, either with a 40 mm or a 15 mm bottom sieve. The analyte carrier constituents, which were collected from the primary samples before shredding, were disassembled in order to separate the metallic analyte carrier components, for example by separation of pure copper from PVC insulation in case of cables). Soft non-metallic components from disassembly were aliquoted piece by piece in the same dividing ratio as the corresponding bulk materials were divided after being shredded. The aliquotes were added to the &lt; 40 mm and &lt; 15 mm secondary samples. Any glass, stones and other inorganic materials remaining from primary samples were crushed (jaw crusher) and pulverized by means of a rotary disc mill. Pulverized materials were stored for the remix of test samples.</p>

<sec id="section11-0734242X12442740">
<title>Treatment of secondary samples</title>
<p>Secondary samples were air-dried. Dry samples were screened at 2 mm and 6.3 mm in order to separate abrasive sand from the soft materials and to make manual sorting easier. The fractions &gt; 6.3 mm and 2–6.3 mm were manually sorted, composites with metals were disassembled. Three fractions were obtained finally from this process: (1) clean metals (including the analyte carrier components); (2) the bulk material suitable for the cutter mill (including the non-metallic components from disassembled composites); and (3) one fraction containing the sand &lt; 2 mm, undefined dirt crumbs and inorganic pieces. The latter fraction was milled in the rotary disc mill and then screened at 0.5 mm. The sequence of rotary disc mill and 0.5 mm screen allowed inorganic components to be separated because of selective pulverization of brittle components (other materials including plastics and metals stay unaltered). Metals were removed from the &gt; 0.5 mm fraction by hand. The residue was added to the bulk material. The bulk material was put through the cutter mill using a 4 mm square hole bottom sieve. Mass reduction of &lt; 4 mm materials was performed by the manual incremental procedure as described above on small laboratory scale.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0734242X12442740">
<title>Treatment of tertiary samples</title>
<p>Tertiary samples were screened at 0.5 mm and approximately 20% of the mass was passing the 0.5 mm screen. The fraction &gt; 0.5 mm was again fed into the cutter mill, this time with the 0.5 mm bottom sieve (trapezoid holes) inserted. In a 20 min run, 30 to 50% of the material – mainly plastics – did not pass the bottom sieve. This oversize material was carefully collected from the mill after the run. The cutter mill output &lt; 0.5 mm was screened at 0.5 mm in order to remove long fibres which formed lint. The lint and the oversize fraction from milling were mixed and charged into a steel tube. The tube was heated to 200 °C and the charge compacted under high pressure. After cooling, a compact bloc was removed from the tube. The blocs were sawn (hacksaw) into thin slices of approximate 2 mm thickness. The ‘sawdust’ was collected and slices were discarded.</p>
<p>Test samples were mixed from all separately obtained &lt; 0.5 mm fractions and the sawdust in correct proportion. Finally, test samples were milled in the rotary disc mill to guarantee intensive mixing.</p>

<sec id="section13-0734242X12442740">
<title>Digestion and chemical analysis</title>
<p>The 300 mg test portions were weighted in the quartz vessels of a microwave digestion system. Eight millilitres nitric acid (65%) and 1 mL hydrochloric acid (35%) were added per vessel. The temperature programme was as follows: (1) increase temperature to 200 °C within 60 min, (2) hold at 200 °C for 35 min. The solutions obtained were filtered (silicates left) and diluted to 50 mL by deionized water. In the case of samples from plant A, the digests were analysed individually. In the case of samples from plants B and C, five individual digests were mixed in order to obtain test solutions each representing 1.5 g of test sample. The concentrations of the selected metals were determined with ICP-OES (Horiba Jobin Yvon Ultima 2).</p>

<p>The analyte carrier components pure copper, brass, zinc alloy and lead were identified from their characteristic physical properties and were not analysed chemically. The elementary compositions were assumed to match those of commonly used alloy types (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0734242X12442740">Table 3</xref>). The values of analyte contents in batteries also were taken from the literature. Batteries of unknown type (label missing or destroyed) were cut into pieces to view the inner structure. Nickel cadmium batteries, which show the same inner structure as nickel hydride batteries were identified via qualitative testing for cadmium (precipitation of yellow cadmium sulfide).</p>
<p>Coated metals were washed with acid to remove coatings (zinc dissolved with hydrochloric acid; hydrochloric and nitric acid mixed 1 : 3 for the others). Washed metals were merged into the fractions listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0734242X12442740">Table 3</xref>. Small pieces (up to 10 g) of unidentified metals (including stainless steel types) were completely dissolved in acid. Bigger pieces were aliquoted before dissolution: 1% of the particle mass in the cases of pieces &gt; 100 g and 10% in the cases of pieces &lt; 100 g were used for separate dissolution. The solutions from acid washing and dissolutions were mixed in the correct proportion to obtain a test solution representing 1% of dissolved unidentified metals and coatings.</p>

<p>In the following, the results are presented in two ways: (1) total metal contents and the allocation of total contents to specific carrier components and bulk mass; (2) results particularized according to the sampling level for assessing sampling procedures and sampling errors.

<p>Means and confidence intervals of total element contents, split in contributions from diverse carriers and bulk materials are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0734242X12442740">Table 4</xref>. Metallic carriers are in most cases responsible for more than 50% of total element contents. For Cu, the share of carrier bound loads reached values up to 80%. Contributions of carriers show wide confidence ranges, reflecting the rare occurrence of big carrier constituents.

It appears that published data about heavy metal contents in RDF from MSW (see right column in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0734242X12442740">Table 4</xref>) are in general much lower than the values analysed by the present study. The literature range comprises RDFs from various countries, derived from different kinds of waste as well as comparable mixed MSW. Nevertheless, total element contents found in the present study exceed the upper limit of the literature range by far. The concentration levels found in bulk materials excluding metallic components match more or less the ranges of total contents given in the literature. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0734242X12442740">Denner and Kuegler’s (2006)</xref> measurements on fraction 50–250 mm, which were obtained by similar analytical procedures agree well with the present results.

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0734242X12442740">Figure 2</xref> shows the means of total element contents measured and in parallel the total variances (errors) of the measurements. Means and variances are split into contributions from bulk material and carrier components/products from primary and secondary level, respectively. The variances from bulk material measurements are further split into contributions resulting from the extraction of test portions from test samples (‘bulk, test portions’) and cumulated contributions from primary, secondary and tertiary level (‘bulk, test sample’). Errors from secondary and tertiary level (sample preparation) were found to be of low significance. Thus, the plotted accumulated variances are controlled from primary sampling error. Analyte loads originating from metal coatings and unidentified metallic components could not be allocated correctly to primary and secondary level since test solutions from both levels were measured jointly (see ‘Separate analysis of metallic components and batteries’). The loads were entirely allocated to the primary level because mass shares of ‘unidentifiable metals’ were higher on primary level. We assume the bias to be negligible in most cases. The contributions from primary level metals may be significantly overestimated only in the cases of chromium and nickel (secondary level metals underestimated, respectively) since the metallic loads, mainly from stainless steel, were determined via the “unidentifiable metals” fraction (except loads from NiMH batteries).</p>

<p>In general, the results as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0734242X12442740">Figure 2</xref> confirm that metallic carrier components and carrier products dominate total errors. In many cases the larger shares of carrier bound loads and errors result from primary level (black bars in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0734242X12442740">Figure 2</xref>) showing the importance of rich analyte carrier constituents in raw materials. On a secondary level the main variance contributions are due to shredded pieces from overseen ‘primary level carriers’ such as short cables or lead pipes. For example, significant contributions in the case of Pb in material &gt; 25 mm (plant A) and 50–250 mm (plant C) are due to pieces of pure lead, weighing 1.9 to 40 g. Extraordinary variations among test portions from bulk material (e.g. up to 270% rsd for copper, see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0734242X12442740">Table 5</xref>) are also likely due to metallic constituents. Metallic constituents appeared frequently on cutting surfaces of slices from ‘sample sawing’. Thus considerable amounts of residual metallic components (mainly aluminium, copper and brass) have definitely been transferred into bulk material test samples. The highest Cu ‘outlier’ measured (approximately 20 000 mg kg<sup>−1</sup>) corresponds to a pure copper particle of approximately 1 mm size (assuming spherical particle shape) in a 300 mg test portion. Some Zn ‘outliers’ are in parallel with Cu ‘outliers’ indicating brass particles to be the outlier reason. In the cases of chromium, nickel and lead, rsd values of &gt; 30 % (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0734242X12442740">Table 5</xref>) are also caused by ‘outliers’.</p>
<p>The rsd values for primary sampling reveal that primary samples (approximately 200–800 kg, see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0734242X12442740">Table 2</xref>) are too small for accurate determination of loads from rich carrier constituents. Following the dependency of fundamental sampling error from sample mass (rsd decreases with the square root of sample mass; see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0734242X12442740">Gy (1992))</xref>, appropriate sample masses can be estimated from values in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0734242X12442740">Table 5</xref>. Aiming for 10–20% rsd the required masses are often of several thousand kilograms. These values agree with estimations given from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0734242X12442740">Prochaska et al. (2004)</xref> and also with the present estimations via the modified equation of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0734242X12442740">Bunge and Bunge (1999)</xref>. The high rsd values for secondary level carriers were of low significance as their contributions to total element contents were generally low. Variations among test portions were low or moderate in the cases of Al, Cd and Cr but always high for Cu. To achieve rsd values below 20% for Cu would require test portions of approximately 20-fold mass (estimated from dependency sampling rsd/sample mass, see above) or a better particle size reduction for residual metallic analyte carrier components. The results of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0734242X12442740">Denner and Kuegler (2006)</xref> for test samples milled to 1 mm and 0.5 mm (see right column in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0734242X12442740">Table 2</xref>) demonstrate the positive effect of particle size reduction.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Carrier induced metal loads challenge routine methods for analysis of total metal contents in high calorific value fractions from MSW. First, large samples have to be taken in order to assess the contribution of scarcely occurring carriers accurately. Sample masses in the range of several thousand kilograms (dependent on analyte) are required for primary sampling. Second, metallic analyte carrier components have to be considered individually in sample preparation and analytical assay as long as the mix of non-metallic and metallic components cannot be milled to ‘homogeneous’ test samples (required grain size approximately &lt; 0.1 mm). Test portions from coarser test samples will not be representative in terms of the loads from metallic components. This is due to ‘big’ analyte carrier particles scarcely appearing in test portions which cause outliers. The occurrence of outliers may therefore indicate inadequate sample preparation and ‘hidden’ analyte loads from carrier components. Third, to discard metallic components in the course of sample preparation will result in significant underestimation of total metal contents. Fourth, to eliminate outliers from analytical data excludes loads from insufficiently milled metallic components systematically. Thus, data sets excluding outliers will on average underestimate total contents. Fifth, the sample preparation as conducted is extremely time consuming and costly. In spite of extraordinary efforts, residual metallic components appeared in test samples causing unacceptable errors for example in the case of copper. More efficient techniques (comprises also pre-treatment and pulverizing devices) have to be developed, tested and optimized. Furthermore, a larger set of elements including Hg and Cl should be investigated for the importance of carrier bound loads. Nevertheless, correct determination of total metal contents in high calorific value fractions will be considerably more expensive than today’s state of the art analyses of RDF and SRF.</p>
<p>The separate determination of analyte loads from metallic components revealed that high calorific value fractions contain metallic components such as aluminium, pure copper or brass in amounts of several kilograms per tonne. This valuable secondary resource potential represents, at the same time, a potential hazard that has to be taken into account when high quality RDF and SRF is produced. The way in which carriers are distributed by mechanical treatment processes, as well as the impact of carriers on the quality of RDF and SRF should be studied in the future. The proper determination and specification of metal loads forms the basis for these research issues and for the management of resources and hazards related to metals in MSW in general.</p>
