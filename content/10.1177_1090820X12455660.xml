<title>Background:</title>
<p>Appearance, aging, and disorders of the breast are multifactorial. There are intrinsic, patient-specific characteristics, such as breast growth during puberty and propensity for breast cancer, which are primarily inherited. There are also environmental factors, which can be potentially controlled. Monozygotic twins provide an excellent research opportunity to examine the role of extrinsic factors in subjects with identical genetic predispositions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1090820X12455660">
<title>Objectives:</title>
<p>The authors investigate the role and significance of various environmental and acquired factors on breast aesthetics.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1090820X12455660">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>Identical female twins were recruited during the Twins Days Festival in Twinsburg, Ohio, in 2009 and 2010. After consent was obtained, enrolled subjects completed a comprehensive survey on their medical and personal history. Standardized digital photographs were taken by medical photographers. Sixteen aesthetic breast features were subjectively rated by 6 plastic surgery residents blinded to the survey results. These ratings were then analyzed against survey data to determine the significance of different exogenous factors on breast appearance.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1090820X12455660">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>A total of 161 pairs of identical female twins (n = 322) with a mean (SD) age of 47.6 (14.5) years were recruited. Twins who moisturized their skin daily had significantly fewer rhytids (<italic>P</italic> = .002). Twins who received hormone replacement therapy after menopause had more attractive breast shape, size, projection, areolar shape, and areolar size (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .03). However, twins who had a higher body mass index, greater number of pregnancies, and larger cup sizes had significantly less attractive breasts (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05). Twins who smoked cigarettes and consumed alcohol also had significantly less attractive breasts (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05). Twins who breastfed had less attractive areolar size and shape but better skin quality than their counterparts who never breastfed (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .03). Finally, there was a significantly higher incidence of breast pain in twins who primarily slept on their sides compared with twins who primarily slept on their backs (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .008).</p>

<body>
<p>Breast appearance is determined by both genetic and environmental factors. Although we can speculate about what causes undesired breast features, studies supporting these etiologies are limited. One study that compared breast appearance to medical history in 132 unrelated women suggested that weight loss, older age, larger cup size, and higher number of pregnancies contributed to glandular ptosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1090820X12455660">1</xref></sup> A separate retrospective study suggested that higher body mass index (BMI) and smoking also contributed to increased breast ptosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1090820X12455660">2</xref></sup> However, these studies were not able to control for genetic differences between subjects and did not analyze additional factors that contribute to overall breast aesthetics, such as breast symmetry, areolar shape, and nipple ptosis.</p>
<p>The study of monozygotic twins allows for the control of genetic predisposition to certain factors. Through this study in identical twins, we hope to elucidate the relative contributions of different exogenous factors on breast appearance. Understanding these factors can help patients and treating physicians modify factors that contribute to accelerated breast aging as well as help improve the outcomes of reconstructive and aesthetic breast surgery.</p>
<sec id="section6-1090820X12455660" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>Institutional Review Board approval was obtained and recruitment of female identical twins took place during the 2009 and 2010 Twins Day Festival in Twinsburg, Ohio. The Twins Day Festival draws nearly 3000 pairs of twins annually to Twinsburg, Ohio, providing the opportunity to recruit from this specific population. There is a designated research area during the festival, which is used by many researchers performing twin studies. The participants in this breast study were compensated for their time and effort with a gift card. The research team set up a mobile, enclosed unit to provide privacy for the volunteers. Each twin also completed a separate comprehensive 150-item questionnaire that queried for information about environmental, medical, and social history.</p>
<sec id="section7-1090820X12455660">
<title>Photo Grading</title>
<p>A professional medical photographer obtained digital photographs only when both twins agreed to fully participate in the research study. The photographer made every effort to provide consistency in lighting and sizing of the photographs. Six digital photographs were taken for each standing subject at different angles: 1 frontal view with arms at the sides, 2 lateral (right and left), 2 three-quarter (right and left oblique), and 1 frontal view with arms raised above the head. These photos were then matched and collated for individual evaluation by 6 senior plastic surgery resident judges. These judges were blinded to any identifying information as well as any information from the questionnaires. Each participant was rated on 16 aesthetic features (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1090820X12455660">Table 1</xref>), as well as perceived breast age difference between 2 sisters. For each feature, the judges assigned a Likert score of 1 to 5, with 5 being the most aesthetically favorable.</p>

<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>The extrinsic factors were measured against breast quality Likert scores among all participants. The weighted effect of each breast quality on perceived breast age difference was also calculated, allowing perceived age difference to be a consistent basis for comparison between different breast qualities. The differences in extrinsic factors were compared within each twin pair to determine their effects on perceived breast age. Finally, reported morbidities such as breast pain, migraine headaches, back pain, breast cancer, and carpal tunnel syndrome were also analyzed against different extrinsic factors and breast qualities to determine their relationship with breast health. Since each individual participant had been exposed to environmental factors independent from her sister, we also performed statistical analysis using the entire cohort of the participants to examine the absolute effect of environmental factors on the breast appearance. The environmental factors were correlated to the Likert scale evaluations of the appearance attributes, allowing us to create a global breast score (see below).</p>
<p>The data analysis was performed by a biostatistician using forward-selection, stepwise multiple regression. Mean differences between twins were conducted using the Student <italic>t</italic>-test. JMP 8 software (SAS Institute, Inc, Cary, North Carolina) was used to perform the analysis. A <italic>P</italic> value of less than .05 was considered significant.</p>

<title>Demographics</title>
<p>A total of 322 subjects (161 twin pairs) with mean (SD) age of 47.6 (14.5) years (range, 25-74 years), a mean (SD) weight of 160.2 (38.8) lbs (range, 95-295 lbs), and a mean (SD) height of 65.8 (22.6) in. (range, 52-76 in.) participated in this study.</p>

<sec id="section11-1090820X12455660">
<title>Influence of Breast Qualities on Perceived Age Difference</title>
<p>The 16 breast qualities affected perceived age differently. The most significant quality on perceived age difference was skin quality, which contributed to a 0.924-years younger perceived age appearance for every Likert score increment. The second most important quality was scars, which accounted for 0.866-years younger perceived breast appearance for every Likert score increment. Glandular ptosis, nipple ptosis, areolar size, projection, breast shape, breast size, dyschromic patches, and breast symmetry also contributed to younger perceived age appearance for every Likert score increment. Six of the 16 breast qualities judged did not significantly contribute to changes in perceived age, including areolar shape, rhytids, striae, inframammary fold symmetry, lateral skin rolls, and upper pole fullness. The weights of all 16 breast qualities are represented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1090820X12455660">Table 1</xref>. The significant associations between exogenous factors and specific breast qualities are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1090820X12455660">Table 2</xref>. Of note, obesity affected all evaluated measures of the breast appearance in a negative fashion.</p>

<title>Creation of the Global Breast Score</title>
<p>To assess the importance of various factors in perceived breast aesthetics, we created statistical models to explain the observed differences. Using 3 different approaches, 3 different equations were created. The global breast score (GBS) provides a tool to measure and compare the effect of various aesthetic characteristics of the breast on the global aesthetic perception.</p>
<p>First, the photograph raters were asked to rank the 3 most relevant parameters for each twin pair leading to the perceived age difference and rate them from 1 to 3 (1 being the most relevant factor). With this approach, we were able to create the following formula based on the Likert scale values.</p>

<p>Each of the above models can be used to assess the effect of environmental factors on GBS and not just the perceived age difference. Using the first formula (GBS 1) for individual subjects (n = 299) showed that 4 parameters (age, BMI, bra size, and number of pregnancies) significantly affected the GBS value for a given subject (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1090820X12455660">Table 3</xref>). The GBS 2 relationship analysis revealed a similar result with addition of the effect of breast cancer (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1090820X12455660">Table 4</xref>). These data indicated that the women with breast cancer scored about 2.5 points lower in the GBS calculation.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Monozygotic female twins, photographed under standardized conditions by medical photographers, offer among the best opportunities to study the effects of environmental factors on breast appearance and disorders. Although the aesthetic qualities of oneâs breasts are largely determined by genetics and age, this study demonstrates that exogenous factors play a major role in accelerating or decelerating the aging process. The exogenous factor that most negatively influences perceived breast age is breast cancer. Surgical resection of breast tumors results in deformities that include asymmetry, glandular ptosis, and scars.</p>
<p>Cigarette smoking negatively influenced Likert ratings of 8 different breast qualities in twins, including breast size, projection, and upper pole fullness. These results are consistent with previously published findings, such as a cross-sectional study of over 900 postmenopausal women who underwent mammography, which demonstrated that a positive smoking history was significantly associated with decreased breast density.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1090820X12455660">3</xref></sup> Although decreased breast density explains some of our associations, decreased aesthetic appeal of the areola and breast skin may be explained by other consequences of smoking. A recent prospective study demonstrated that cigarette smoking significantly reduced oxygen content and increased the temperature of facial skin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1090820X12455660">4</xref></sup> This mechanism may explain the accelerated areolar aging demonstrated in our study. Furthermore, our results are also consistent with the findings by Guyuron et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1090820X12455660">5</xref></sup> that cigarette smoking significantly accelerated facial aging among twins.</p>
<p>Alcohol consumption also had a negative impact on breast appearance. The molecular mechanism of alcohol consumption on breast aging has not been addressed in the literature at this time. However, alcohol consumption has been strongly linked with increased risk of breast cancer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1090820X12455660">6</xref></sup> Furthermore, Guyuron et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1090820X12455660">5</xref></sup> found similar associations between alcohol consumption and accelerated facial aging. Although excessive alcohol consumption has been linked to numerous morbidities such as coronary heart disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, stroke, hypertension, and peripheral arterial disease, there have not been any published data on the effect of alcohol consumption on breast aging until now.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1090820X12455660">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>Another significant factor that decreased breast attractiveness was higher BMI, which itself is determined by both genetics and behavior. By comparing BMI between identical twins, we were able to control for inherited predisposition and isolate differences in BMI to consequences of exogenous factors such as diet and exercise. A separate study of female identical twins concluded that genetics had a 56% influence on breast size, with 33% concordance in the genes that determine both breast size and BMI.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1090820X12455660">8</xref></sup> This suggests that exogenous factors have a significant impact on both breast size and BMI. Our results suggest that higher BMI negatively influences almost all of the 16 different breast qualities judged, with the exception of scar appearance.</p>
<p>Pregnancy and breastfeeding provided interesting results in breast appearance. Although a higher number of pregnancies decreased the aesthetic appeal of breastsânamely, shape and ptosisâbreastfeeding actually increased the overall aesthetic quality of the breast. Although the attractiveness of areolar shape and size were reduced in women who breastfed, these women had significantly better skin quality than women who had never breastfed. Since skin quality was found to be a much stronger determinant of overall perceived breast age, the net effect of breastfeeding was positive. It is conceivable that pregnancy alone causes negative changes that are significant enough in terms of breast aesthetics that potential negative effects of breastfeeding are masked. Our results support the conclusions of Rinker et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1090820X12455660">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1090820X12455660">2</xref></sup> who reported significant breast size and shape regressions following pregnancy but no significant change in breast ptosis after breastfeeding. Furthermore, their results are also consistent with our findings that smoking, larger cup sizes, and higher BMI were associated with less attractive breasts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1090820X12455660">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1090820X12455660">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Hormone replacement and daily skin moisturizing were both associated with improved breast aesthetics. Moisturizing likely decreases the presence of rhytids by reducing water loss from the epidermis, forming a barrier to skin irritants and regulating epidermal enzymes for corneocyte desquamation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1090820X12455660">9</xref></sup> On the other hand, our study demonstrated that HRT decelerates breast aging in postmenopausal women by replacing estrogen and progesterone. Both estrogen and progesterone are responsible for the proliferation of breast epithelium during puberty. Estrogen elongates the rudimentary ductal tree in developing breasts, whereas progesterone fills out the stroma around the ducts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1090820X12455660">10</xref></sup> Although HRT is not primarily used for the purpose of breast maintenance, our study demonstrates that it may have a significant positive effect on preventing breast atrophy. However, it must be noted that HRT has been demonstrated to increase the risk of breast cancer; therefore, patients must be aware of both the potential benefits and risks of HRT.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1090820X12455660">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>The association between breast pain and position during sleep is remarkable, considering that an estimated 45% of women suffer from mild breast pain and 21% suffer from severe breast pain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1090820X12455660">12</xref></sup> The currently accepted etiology for the majority of nonpathological mastalgia is hormone based. Exogenous factors such as smoking and caffeine consumption have also been implicated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1090820X12455660">13</xref></sup> However, to our knowledge, there have not been any studies directly linking mastalgia to sleeping in a lateral position until now.</p>
<p>Another very important correlation was the increased incidence of migraine headaches in patients with larger breasts. Migraine headaches are associated with irritation to peripheral sensory nerves of the head and neck, causing release of substance P and neurokinin A.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1090820X12455660">14</xref></sup> We hypothesize that in women with larger cup sizes, posterior neck and occipital musculature show a higher baseline tone to balance for the heavier breasts ventrally. The higher tone may cause compression and irritation of the greater occipital nerve, causing occipital migraine headaches. Unfortunately, we did not obtain a detailed migraine headache history. However, starting in 2011, we have added a separate, detailed Migraine Headache Questionnaire to our protocol.</p>
<p>Although this study successfully isolated exogenous factors by controlling for genetic contributions in a relatively large sample size, it was not without methodological limitations. Not all subjects were included in all statistical analyses because of occasional missing data points. The data on exogenous factors were obtained through self-reported questionnaires that were subject to recall bias and question misinterpretation. Furthermore, our breast quality scores were assigned on a subjective Likert scale for âattractiveness,â based on reviewer interpretation and personal preference. However, because the ratings of 6 different judges were averaged, the risk of outlier scores substantially decreased. Identical twins also tend to develop similar lifestyles and have similar exposures to exogenous factors. This emphasizes the need to analyze a larger set of identical twins to discern differences in environmental factors. To improve the validity of our study, we are currently conducting objective measurements of breast parameters to create a correlation with exogenous factors. In this study, we introduced 3 slightly different equations to measure a global score for the aesthetic appearance of the breast. We hope that with inclusion of objective measurements and further refinement of the analyses, one unifying equation can be formulated.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Multiple exogenous factors play a significant role in breast aging and morbidity. Our study provides statistical evidence that higher BMI, smoking, drinking, multiple pregnancies, and larger bra and cup sizes contribute to accelerated breast aging, whereas hormone replacement therapy, breastfeeding, and daily moisturizing significantly decelerate the perceived aging of breasts.</p>
