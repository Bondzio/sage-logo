<abstract>
<p>Amitriptyline (AMT) is commonly used in the management of children with irritable bowel syndrome. AMT is pro-arrhythmogenic and increases the risk of sudden cardiac death. However, there is not enough data regarding the cardiac toxicity in therapeutic doses of AMT in children and the need for screening electrocardiogram (EKG). Errors in computer EKG interpretation are not uncommon. In a risk-prevention study, the authors sought to identify the true incidence of prolonged corrected QT (QTc) interval and other arrhythmias in children with irritable bowel syndrome before the initiation of AMT. Out of the 760 EKGs screened, 3 EKGs demonstrated a true prolonged QTc after the careful manual reading by a pediatric cardiologist and they were not picked by computer-generated reading. The authors conclude that screening EKG should always be performed on children before initiating AMT therapy. Also, the computer-generated EKG needs to be verified by a pediatric cardiologist to avoid serious misinterpretations.</p>

<title>Background</title>
<p>Amitriptyline (AMT) is used in the management of children with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), especially in those with refractory abdominal pain. AMT is thought to decrease stress-induced electrical hypersensitivity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922812447890">1</xref></sup> AMT is also pro-arrhythmogenic and increases the risk of sudden cardiac death in patients with underlying heart disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0009922812447890">2</xref></sup> It is associated with an increased risk of sudden cardiac death at doses above 100 mg.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0009922812447890">2</xref></sup> AMT activates cardiac ryanodine channels causing efflux of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0009922812447890">3</xref></sup> James and Kearns<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0009922812447890">4</xref></sup> evaluated the effects of tricyclic antidepressant overdose on the electrocardiograms (EKGs) in 45 children, and 17 patients showed conduction delay and 9 developed prolonged corrected QT (QTc). However, there is not enough data in the literature regarding the cardiac toxicity in therapeutic doses of AMT in children.</p>
<p>A QTc at or above 480 ms in females or 470 ms in males is probably a sign for long-QT syndrome (LQTS).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0009922812447890">5</xref></sup> The diagnosis of “borderline” QT prolongation or even “borderline LQTS” is commonly given when a patient has a QTc value between 440 and 470 ms.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0009922812447890">5</xref></sup> The “teach-the-tangent” or “avoid-the-tail” method in which the end of the T wave is considered to be the intersection of the tangent to the steepest slope of the last limb of the T wave and the baseline yields a higher accuracy of diagnosis of LQTS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0009922812447890">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0009922812447890">7</xref></sup> Specific T-wave and ST-segment findings can give clues to the presence of LQTS, particularly the presence of T-wave alternans or diffuse T-wave notching.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0009922812447890">8</xref></sup> The most common errors in computer EKG interpretation are seen in arrhythmias, AV blocks, conduction disorders, and electronic pacemakers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0009922812447890">9</xref></sup> In our risk-prevention study, we sought to identify the true incidence of prolonged QTc interval and other arrhythmias in a subpopulation of children with IBS before the initiation of AMT.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>In children between the ages of 6 and 18 years, AMT was used in a dose of 10 mg per day and was given in the evening. In younger (less than 8 years of age) children, a reduced dose of 5 mg (half of a 10-mg tablet) was used. The dose was increased up to 20 mg in older children with refractory abdominal pain.</p>
<p>Over a period of 5 years (2006-2010), a total of 760 screening electrocardiograms were performed before starting AMT in children with IBS. In this risk-prevention study, the computer-generated EKG findings were compared with the manual measurements with calipers by a pediatric cardiologist. The QTc interval was estimated manually by the “teach-the-tangent” method. When a true prolonged QTc interval was identified, AMT was not prescribed. The results obtained from the study were compared with available literature in MEDLINE.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>The result of the study is shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0009922812447890">Table 1</xref>. Out of the 760 EKGs, 3 EKGs demonstrated a true prolonged QTc after the careful manual reading by a pediatric cardiologist. Computer-generated readings failed to identify 2 out of these 3 prolonged QTc intervals. One of the EKGs was reported by the computer as left ventricular hypertrophy but it turned out to be a true prolonged QTc instead (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0009922812447890">Figure 1</xref>). In 6 cases, the computer overreported normal QTc findings as prolonged QTc intervals. Interestingly, the computer read 153 EKGs as borderline prolonged QTc interval, out of which 104 were later verified by manual reading as the same, but 49 of those turned out to be within normal limits. Incidentally, 2 cases of Wolff–Parkinson White syndrome (WPW) were correctly identified by computer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0009922812447890">Figure 2</xref>). One hundred and ninety EKGs were read as “abnormal” by computer but they were later identified to be within the physiological range. The abnormalities identified included sinus arrhythmia (n = 174), ectopic atrial pacemaker (n = 5), first-degree heart block (n = 3), Mobitz type 1 heart block (n = 1), and early repolarization (n = 7).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our study is the first risk-prevention study undertaken in children to identify cardiac arrhythmias, including prolonged QTc and WPW before the initiation of AMT. This is particularly important as AMT is commonly used in children with functional abdominal pain, refractory headache, and even more commonly in bed wetting. Our study will help pediatricians to understand the importance of obtaining an EKG before initiating AMT, especially when there is a need to increase the dose to obtain clinical improvement.</p>
<p>We found that out of the 760 screening EKGs, a software program failed to identify 2 EKGs with prolonged QTc interval. On the other hand, in 6 cases QTc interval was erroneously calculated by the computer as prolonged. Our findings corroborate existing evidence that computer readings are not always reliable. The European Working Party on Common Standards for Quantitative Electrocardiography demonstrated that the average cardiologist was more accurate than the average computer program.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0009922812447890">9</xref></sup> Additionally, less interobserver variability was noted among the 8 cardiologists than among the 9 computer programs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0009922812447890">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>The overall incidence of prolonged QTc intervals on the EKG was not higher than that of adult population described in the literature. In our study, the incidence was 3 out of 736 (0.4%). Interestingly, in a screening study on 2000 healthy adult and adolescent athletes the prevalence of prolonged QT was exactly similar at 0.4%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0009922812447890">11</xref></sup> We also found that 2 out of 736 patients (2.7 per 1000 subjects) had WPW syndrome, which is within the expected range (0.1-3.1 per 1000 population) of incidence of WPW previously described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0009922812447890">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>From the risk prevention point of view, although the incidence of cardiac arrhythmias in children was found to be consistent within the average adult range, the screening EKGs prevented children with existing cardiac arrhythmias from being exposed to the potential hazards posed by AMT. A borderline prolonged QT interval was essentially harmless and not a contraindication to AMT therapy. However, in suspected cases with borderline prolonged QTc intervals, the opinion of a pediatric cardiologist should be sought to rule out underlying serious cardiac conditions.</p>
<p>The practicing pediatricians and the pediatric gastroenterologists who intend to use AMT in children for various clinical purposes should therefore obtain a screening EKG to ensure the safety of the children.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0009922812447890" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This risk-prevention study demonstrates that a screening EKG should always be performed on children before initiating AMT therapy. Computer-generated EKG needs to be verified by a pediatric cardiologist to avoid misinterpretations. Borderline prolonged QTc intervals and nonspecific ST changes are essentially benign in children, but a pediatric cardiologist’s opinion should be sought to rule out underlying serious cardiac conditions.</p>
