<abstract>
<p>This article is an account of a creative learning project conducted in the author’s school in which she worked with a storyteller to engage a class of 14–15-year-old students in exploring other worlds, inspired by the <italic>His Dark Materials</italic> novels by Philip Pullman. The project was conceived as teacher-led action research in which the author observed the impact of new creative learning approaches on the motivation of a group of students who had become disengaged from the learning process in school. Analysis of a series of critical incidents and associated evidence gave insights into the issues and challenges encountered and the effects on students’ learning as the project progressed. The author found that her own role in the classroom was challenged, which shifted her research towards a more ethnographic approach. Her belief in the power of creative learning was deepened, leading her to reflect on the implications for school improvement beyond her own practice and suggesting further lines of enquiry.</p>

<p>This article is based on the premise that education facilitates and nurtures the potential that is already inside the child. In this account I reflect on evidence drawn from a creative learning project conducted in my school through action research with one class for whom that potential had become less visible. The intended outcome of the research was to implement creative learning strategies as a means of re-engaging this group of learners and improving their progress in school. In order to understand the starting point, it is important to consider the national and local political contexts and the ways in which the school’s responses had influenced this class.</p>
<sec id="section1-1365480212450237">
<title>Starting point: The school and classroom context</title>
<p>My school is a large non-selective secondary school (11–18) in a town where the most able are selected at age 11 to attend grammar schools. As a consequence of this, the academic profile of students entering the school is lower than the national average, with a relatively high proportion of students having special educational needs.</p>
<p>Attainment at the school has improved considerably in recent years. It is placed in the higher percentiles in the national school performance tables based on achievement at GCSE and Contextual Value Added (CVA), the measure used at the time of this project to assess pupil progress in relation to their level of attainment on entry. The rise in attainment at the school resulted from a shift in school leadership and development of a vision to raise standards through a systemic approach to target setting and a focus upon academic attainment. This performative culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1365480212450237">Ball, 2003</xref>) was considered pivotal in the achievement of being graded ‘Outstanding’ by Ofsted inspectors.</p>
<p>The performative approach to raising standards in the school and the success associated with this supported the view that performativity can encourage individuals, both teachers and students, to become enterprising, even ‘promiscuous’ in striving for excellence and success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1365480212450237">Ball, 2003</xref>). Within my school role however, I observed a core of individuals for whom this was not the case; here performativity signified ‘inner conflict, in-authenticity and resistance’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1365480212450237">Ball, 2003</xref>, p. 1). It was the limitation that this conflict could place on some learners that I explored through my research, which focused upon a group of disengaged students who were displaying resistance to the performative culture in the school.</p>
<p>My research was inspired by personal experience of the inner conflict associated with performativity. The principles outlined in a poem by Loris Malaguzzi have long influenced my thinking. He asserts that ‘The child is made of one hundred’ – a hundred languages, hands, thoughts, ways of thinking, playing and speaking, listening, loving and understanding – and that there are a hundred worlds to discover, invent and dream. School and culture ‘steal’ the 99, telling the child that the worlds of play, fantasy, imagination and dreaming do not exist. Thus the poem suggests that the natural potential of children is restricted and their learning compartmentalized, through a school and cultural focus on work, reality and reason (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1365480212450237">Malaguzzi, undated</xref>).</p>

<title>‘These children are made of one hundred’: Their story</title>
<p>My enquiry documented changes and explored the impact on motivation and learning observed in a group of 30 Year 9 (14–15-year-olds) learners, both boys and girls, who took part in an innovative creative learning programme. Most of the students in the group had become de-motivated and detached from the school’s drive to raise attainment. Group dynamics were problematic and students had become notorious for their underachievement and negative behaviour in lessons.</p>
<p>The group had originally been placed in a high ability stream as a result of their successful performance in the Cognitive Abilities Tests (CATs) taken on entry to the school aged 11. They were also the final cohort of pupils to be formally involved in Statutory Assessment Tests (SATs), the national assessment tests traditionally taken by students aged 15. As part of a pilot of early entry examination, the group had been entered for their SATs one year early, intended to promote a sense of achievement and allow early study of GCSE examinations in the core teaching subjects. In reality, the move was detrimental to the students and they all underachieved in the assessments as a result of the acceleration. This poor performance was also damaging to the school, which was judged externally by these results.</p>
<p>Following the completion of their assessments the group continued to higher level study in the core subjects, but rather than engaging with this, students became alarmingly disengaged and relationships with teachers declined. Observation of lessons before the creative learning project was developed indicated that lessons lacked challenge and student progress was limited; teachers admitted to not prioritizing the group as they had already completed their assessments and their performance would not reflect upon school performance data. The outcome of this was that students began to demonstrate a concerning disregard for their learning. As the group’s ‘community learning leader’, with responsibility for their academic progress, I recognized that in this class, a ‘toxic culture’ had developed, with the collective deterioration in behaviour, where the souring of rituals, traditions and values threatens the ‘soul’ of the school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1365480212450237">Deal &amp; Peterson, 2009</xref>). This instigated my intervention and the students’ involvement in the project.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1365480212450237">
<title>The aims of the creative learning project</title>
<p>For some years as a teacher researcher I have engaged in enquiry relating to creativity in schools, exploring how it can be used to engage learners and push their development to boundaries outside of those typically achieved within the target driven classroom. I used action research and reflection on personal experience to unpick elements of creativity in education, and to clarify my understanding of creativity from an educational perspective.</p>
<p>My initial work with this group identified that much of the negative behaviour observed appeared to stem from the students’ perceived failure in the SATs, along with a decline in challenge in lessons following the completion of their formal assessments. This had manifested itself in what I perceived initially as avoidance behaviours. In other cases, there appeared a lack of awareness that success in school was derived predominantly from student input and instead a dependence on teachers had developed, possibly as a result of a prescriptive approach to control performance in assessments. The students had become pawns in classroom life, perceiving their own behaviour as determined by external forces beyond their control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1365480212450237">Watkins, 2009</xref>). I therefore developed a project to explore how creative learning could engage the students in the learning process and establish a sense of ownership of their learning. For this, I was allocated a timetabled series of lessons with the group.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1365480212450237">
<title>An action research methodology</title>
<p>As a teacher researcher, it was important for me to use methodological approaches that enabled me to weave enquiry into everyday practice, and to shape this first hand. An aspect of this was ensuring that I developed effective relationships and a sound understanding of the students as subjects of my enquiry. A combination of mainly qualitative methods was used to gather data to construct a case study of the project, including evaluation of lessons by students and my own identification of critical incidents as a teacher and participant observer. It has been argued that the case study is one of the most appropriate formats for school-based research (Hitchcock &amp; Hughes, 1994) as it enables ‘naturalistic every day, cultural and interactional phenomena [to be] studied in their own right and in their own territory’ (p. 316); case study methods get close to the focus of enquiry by accessing subjective factors (thoughts, feelings and desires). Within my case study, critical incidents were identified by value judgements made on the basis of the ‘significance we attach to the meaning of the incident’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1365480212450237">Tripp, 1993</xref>, p. 8). These judgements related to the situations created by the creative learning programme, capturing evidence from the classroom. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1365480212450237">Tripp (1993)</xref> supports the casting of incidents through these ‘professional judgements’ (p. 7) as valid research evidence. He describes such interpretations as ‘those expert guesses which result from combining experience with specialist theoretical knowledge’ (p. 7). Other sources of evidence, for example comments and evaluations from participants, were used to enrich the critical perspective and inform the analysis. As my enquiry centred on investigating learner-centred pedagogical approaches, the person-centred viewpoint that could be achieved from case study was considered wholly appropriate, in order to gather evidence that could be used as the basis for further small-scale change and to gain insights to support wider research and school improvement in the future. This methodology mirrored the aim and nature of the creative learning project itself, in challenging the orthodoxy of the performative culture rooted in quantitative measures of achievement.</p>

<title>From creativity to creative learning</title>
<p>Through my research, I sought to find and implement new and appropriate ways of approaching teaching and learning to promote creativity and the sense of ownership that my own experience of the creative process had already showed it could foster. Although <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1365480212450237">Best and Thomas (2007)</xref> explain that ultimately outcomes can be seen as creative and provide an important focus for activity, the emphasis on process was crucial. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1365480212450237">Watkins (2009)</xref> similarly suggests that over emphasis on endpoints in learning leads to underperformance in the learning journey. As a teaching professional I had come to believe that curiosity and questioning were the most valuable attributes of the process of learning, whether or not this resolves into an outcome. I had observed that when the learning process is reflective and deeper level understanding is encouraged through critical questioning, outcomes tended to be more substantial. I used this concept when designing this enquiry-based project, developing the principle that creativity could support learners in meeting and perhaps exceeding the end points targeted through a performative approach to teaching and learning. This would support an argument for change towards a more creative approach to learning which would hold the potential for driving standards of learning further than the parameters set by a performative approach.</p>
<p>Creativity is a complex concept with no single definition. Whilst I attempted at an early stage to outline the theoretical basis from which my research would be built, my interpretation and depth of understanding of creativity in schools, along with the tensions and dilemmas associated with this, developed as my enquiry evolved. Creativity has traditionally been defined by the so-called creative arts, but I wanted to explore how it can reach much wider domains than this and ‘relates to every facet of human study and learning’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1365480212450237">Best &amp; Thomas, 2007</xref>, p. 28). Presenting two definitions of creativity, Best and Thomas suggest that creativity is a process that leads to innovation. Most simply it is ‘. . . the process of finding and implementing new and appropriate ways of doing things’, while more technically, it can be defined as ‘the intentional and purposeful search for innovation in problem solving’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1365480212450237">Best &amp; Thomas, 2007</xref>, p. 27), a process in which I, as well as my students, would be engaged.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1365480212450237">
<title>Building enquiry based on experience</title>
<p>This was a ‘passionate enquiry’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1365480212450237">Dadds, 1993</xref>), given my commitment to creativity in education, which was derived from my own childhood where creative learning was embraced. Whilst creativity in education is promoted as a ‘good thing’, the development of practice in school required clarity and clear understanding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1365480212450237">Craft, 2005</xref>), inspired by experience but supported by evidence and theory. My enquiry explored the tensions and dilemmas surrounding the valuing and implementation of a creative approach to pedagogy in my school. In order to inform the enquiry-based development I considered the definitions, understandings and characteristics of creativity in relation to learning.</p>
<p>I have always found difficulty in defining what was happening when I was being creative; indeed ‘true creativity often starts where language ends’ (Koestler, cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1365480212450237">Best &amp; Thomas, 2007</xref>, p. 30). Nevertheless, it had always been a key feature of the way that I learned and developed, and it has a distinct sensation. Creativity involves generating something meaningful out of nothing; it is about being curious and having questions; about exploring and investigating possibility in order to make sense of something, but it often involves risk and feelings of discomfort. I wanted my students to experience this in their own learning.</p>
<p>Creativity leads to total captivation in a thought or activity although it is not effortless or spontaneous, it ebbs and flows and involves a mindset that sets no boundaries or limits (Koestler, cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1365480212450237">Best &amp; Thomas, 2007</xref>). The concept of total captivation, or ‘flow’ is described as an engrossing, intrinsically rewarding state or experience that is beyond the parameters of worry or boredom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1365480212450237">Csíkszentmihályi &amp; Csíkszentmihályi, 1992</xref>). Certain activities provide elements that combine to allow the flow experience to develop; such activities are autotelic, that is, rewarding in and of themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1365480212450237">Csíkszentmihályi, 1992</xref>). They involve intrinsic excitement and intense ownership, innovation, control and relevance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1365480212450237">Holly, 1989</xref>). In testing these limits and undergoing new experiences, people can transcend their former conception of themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1365480212450237">Holly, 1989</xref>). I believed that for these students, who had apparently lost faith in the learning process, experiencing autotelic learning and the associated intrinsic rewards would be an ultimate achievement for the project.</p>
<p>In order to explore such learning experiences and the impact that they could have on the behaviour of learners, it was critical that I understood the complexity of creativity in schools and how it could be approached. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1365480212450237">Craft (2005)</xref> argues that creativity in education can be approached in three distinct strands: ‘Creative Teaching’, ‘Teaching for Creativity’ and ‘Creative Learning’. <italic>Creative Teaching</italic> refers to adapting practice using ‘imaginative approaches to make learning more interesting and effective’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1365480212450237">Craft, 2005</xref>, p. 22). <italic>Teaching for Creativity</italic> relates more to ‘forms of teaching that are intended to develop young people’s own creative thinking and behaviour’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1365480212450237">Craft, 2005</xref>, p. 22). Whilst these two approaches relate to ‘effective teaching’, and to ‘learner empowerment’ respectively, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1365480212450237">Craft (2005)</xref> argues that to view the strands as entirely separate is obstructive in some instances, and highlights the views presented in the NACCCE report that ‘teaching for creativity involves teaching creatively’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1365480212450237">NACCCE, 1999</xref>, p. 90). Craft’s third strand of creativity in schools is that of <italic>Creative Learning</italic>, which is characterized by the action of learners ‘using their imagination and experience to develop learning’ (p. 23). She relates creative learning to the contribution that learners make to classroom pedagogy including critical evaluation of their own learning practices and the performance of their teachers. This focus on the role of the learner in developing and contributing to classroom pedagogy was to influence my own approach to the enquiry-based project. This led to reflection upon the role of the teacher when encouraging creativity in the classroom.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1365480212450237">
<title>Planning a creative enquiry</title>
<p>My creative enquiry was part of a Creative Partnerships project. Creative Partnerships was a government-led initiative introduced in 2002 in response to the aforementioned ‘All Our Futures’ report which raised concern that the heavy focus upon mathematics and literacy in the English National Curriculum was suppressing children’s creativity, leaving them without suitable preparation for the demands of a rapidly changing world of work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1365480212450237">NACCCE, 1999</xref>). The enquiry was developed as a pilot project to explore the characteristics of creative learning, which was at the core of the Creative Partnerships ethos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1365480212450237">Creative Partnerships, 2011</xref>). By exploring the principles of creative learning within an authentic school setting, I was able to form coherent links between theory and practice that I hoped would support a proposal for change that would include more robust integration of creativity into my school’s pedagogy. My research concentrated on the impact of creative learning on the behaviour and motivation of learners – their ‘learning behaviours’ – exploring the connection between creativity and motivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1365480212450237">Craft, 2005</xref>). Inevitably, I made comparisons between creative learning situations and the kinds of classroom learning typically found in my school setting, seeking to identify specific areas of learning performance and behaviour influenced by the creative learning strategies.</p>
<p>I planned and delivered the action research element of my enquiry collaboratively, working with a ‘Creative Practitioner’, the term used by Creative Partnerships for a creative professional employed to work with teachers and students on creative learning projects in schools. I was keen to avoid the typical perception of creativity being limited to the visual and performing arts in school, and therefore chose storytelling as the creative medium through which the project would develop. Learning aims for the project included a focus upon improvements in motivation and engagement of learners, encouragement of critical questioning and curiosity and provision of opportunity for students to make connections with prior learning. Given the didactic approach to learning to which the class were accustomed, according to my observations, I was keen to encourage use of imagination to engage the minds of the students as learners. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1365480212450237">Robinson (2011)</xref> associates imagination with creativity, and implies that imagination precedes creativity, which in turn leads to innovation. These basic elements and the phases of creative learning described by Robinson were explored during the project and formed the practical starting point for my enquiry.</p>
<p>I intended to develop an organic enquiry that evolved like a journey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1365480212450237">Watkins, 2009</xref>) in response to the subjects of the research, and follow a creative process such as that outlined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1365480212450237">Csíkszentmihályi (1997)</xref>, who suggests that there are five phases within a cycle:</p>
<list id="list1-1365480212450237" list-type="order">
<list-item><p><italic>Preparation</italic>: this phase initiates the creative process and requires engagement with an idea or concept; during this phase information is required that relates to the subject.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Incubation phase</italic>: this is a period of time when thinking or relating to the problem stops; the individual will engage with seemingly different unrelated matters.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Insight, or ‘Aha’ experience</italic>: the incubation phase will cease suddenly when a solution to the problem comes to the individual’s mind; I have often described this moment as a ‘eureka’ moment.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Evaluation</italic>: the idea or insight is evaluated – a brilliant idea may not always work in reality, so during this phase concepts are thoroughly tested.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Elaboration</italic>: if an idea is viable, the detail is refined during this phase; this is when an outcome would be developed.</p></list-item></list>
<p>The approach to research that I planned to adopt had elements of ethnography; it involved me being ‘simultaneously engaged in a validating process . . . moving backwards and forwards between description and explanation, data collection and tentative fairly inductive analysis’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1365480212450237">Hitchcock &amp; Hughes, 1995</xref>, p. 106). My account is presented as a narrative which makes this process evident in the writing, moving between description, explanation and analysis. Whilst learning sessions were planned prior to delivery, they were organized in response to ideas presented by students in prior sessions, developing a sense that the students were directing the learning and thus the enquiry.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1365480212450237">
<title>Into ‘Another World’</title>
<p>The project, named ‘Another World’ explored the theme of parallel universes using the concepts of Philip Pullman’s <italic>His Dark Materials</italic> trilogy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1365480212450237">2007</xref>). In introducing the project, practical activities were used to capture and encourage use of imagination by incorporating elements of reality with fantasy. Through the use of storytelling games, relationships were formed and ideas developed. This built upon the specialism of the storyteller appointed to collaborate with the school and students on the project:<disp-quote>
<p>My interest as a storyteller lies in what is real and what is fictional and where the line blends. . . For me all stories are true in the moment they are told. (Storyteller interview)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Little was explained to the students about the content of the project, but they quickly identified that their involvement was due to their poor behaviour, and because they were ‘failing’ in school. When asked what they wanted to achieve from the project a number of key aims were identified by students: ‘I would like to learn in a different way’, to ‘work together more effectively’, ‘for our teachers to see us in a different light’ and to prove themselves as ‘positive learners’. After the first session the students began to refer to the sessions as ‘rehab’, and I began to observe a group of learners who had a keenness to be successful, but who felt that they had developed a collective reputation that they could not dismiss.</p>
<p>The content of the project was not shared with the students from the outset, mainly because we did not know what shape it would form, given that it would develop organically in response to our observations of the students and their ideas. We were also keen to avoid an over emphasis on theme or outcome. Students were asked to ‘suspend judgement’ which <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1365480212450237">Holly (1989)</xref> considers an element of being creative, not withholding judgement, but holding judgment back long enough to be able to understand what is being expressed. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1365480212450237">Alleyn Bradford (undated)</xref> describes this as essential in the process of critical thinking and for developing an effective team, both of which were important elements in the prospective development of the class.</p>
<p>One of the greatest steps that I felt the students could make was to shift their belief that their successes were provided by external forces, to success being self-determined. Whilst independence in learning was a desirable characteristic sought in learners in my school, I felt that the performative culture did not necessarily foster this trait in the majority of learners. Instead it favoured teacher-led learning that provided a controlled, assessment-focused learning environment.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Everyone accepts that the goal of ‘independent learning’ is what education should be about. Yet teaching for independent learning is incredibly rare and goes right against teachers’ current implicit values and practice. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1365480212450237">Watkins, 2009</xref>, p. 5)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Following the process of creative learning explained earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1365480212450237">Csíkszentmihályi, 1997</xref>), I was curious to observe the transition from stage one to the ‘insight’ phase, and to scrutinize deCharms’s theory relating to ‘origins’ – those instigating and driving the learning – and ‘pawns’ – those who are controlled by external forces (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1365480212450237">Csiksentmihalyi, 1992</xref>).</p>

<p>These themes broadly resonate with the sequence of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1365480212450237">Csíkszentmihályi’s (1997)</xref> creative process but extend analysis to explore the effects on learning, motivation and culture.</p>
<sec id="section10-1365480212450237">
<title>Critical incident 1: Sparking imagination</title>
<p>The project was introduced with storytelling games that explored the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1365480212450237">Pullman (2007)</xref> and his use of inanimate objects to inspire starting points for the parallel worlds in the <italic>His Dark Materials</italic> trilogy. Students had to use objects selected at random to inspire a story, each taking turns to choose an object and continue the tale. The response to these games was initially slow, with comments being made such as ‘This is the sort of stuff primary kids do, why are we doing this?’ Throughout the activity some students found it difficult to generate imaginative thought in a spontaneous manner, and the storyteller commented privately that ‘in five years of doing this exercise with students of all ages, I have never met a group who have got such limited imaginations – I’m worried’. However, as the game developed students began to suspend judgement, the levels of engagement from the group as a whole increased dramatically and the students were telling stories.</p>
<p>During the group evaluation, students commented, ‘I was rubbish at that’; ‘That was really hard’; ‘I thought that was a baby activity but it was actually really hard’; ‘I don’t think I’ll be able to do this.’ I interpreted the tension and apprehension identified in this first critical incident of the project as an indicator of negative associations with performativity and ‘internalized authority’ where ‘we have roles, models, values that are not our own, goals that are placed upon us’ which can destroy creativity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1365480212450237">Peat, 1989</xref>). Students’ behaviours and reactions were conditioned by the roles, values and success criteria that were normally placed upon them at school. They had to penetrate this barrier in order to engage with a task in which no prior knowledge was required, there was no assessment and no right answer.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1365480212450237">
<title>Critical incident 2: Managing ‘failure’</title>
<p>Certain behaviours were observed during the storytelling activities that were attributed to the tension and challenge of the learning activities. I categorized these into three types:</p>
<list id="list3-1365480212450237" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>‘undermining’ where individuals, or ‘destabilizers’ would make a contribution intended to undermine the learning situation;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>‘direct avoidance’ where students or ‘avoiders’ would immediately resist participation, for example by saying, ‘I don’t know’ or ‘I can’t’;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>‘full commitment’ which involved students as ‘active participants’ making a full contribution to the activity and demonstrating suspension of judgement.</p></list-item></list>
<p>I recall suspending my own teacher judgement where one particular student was undermining the learning situation, resisting my instinct to make a challenge in order to control the situation. I quickly observed, however, that the active participants were using the destabilizers’ contributions to build increasingly fantastical stories and thereby directing their own inclusion strategies within the classroom. Such strategies were successful as I eventually observed a group of learners so engaged in the storytelling process that collectively they presented behaviours associated with being in a state of ‘flow’, presenting their potential to ‘transcend their former conception of self by extending skills and undergoing new experiences’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1365480212450237">Csíkszentmihályi, 1975</xref>, p. 26).</p>
<p>The following illustrative comments include some made by students who had tried to destabilize the learning: ‘I surprised myself, I didn’t think I could be imaginative like that’; ‘I really enjoyed the story telling, it was a very different way of expressing our ideas’; ‘I really enjoyed that, I didn’t think I would enjoy it’; ‘I never had a lesson like that, it was good.’</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1365480212450237">
<title>Critical incident 3: Shifting my teacher role</title>
<p>Following the introductory story telling session, a formal teacher-led theory lesson was delivered, in which we intended to create connections between the themes developed by the students, and the concepts behind Pullman’s work. There was an immediate negative response from students who presented behaviours associated with disengagement and distrust for the project and for my role as project leader. This response supported the theory that creative learning requires creative teaching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1365480212450237">NACCCE, 1999</xref>) and involved me playing a less visible leadership role, more of a participatory role in order to re-establish the students’ expectation of a project led by them. This in turn led me to adopt more of an ethnographic research stance (Hitchcock &amp; Hughes, 1994), observing the students from as natural a standpoint as possible as a participant in the project.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1365480212450237">
<title>Critical incident 4: Creativity for learning and ‘flow’</title>
<p>In order to encourage a sense of ownership of learning, and to provide a practical insight into Pullman’s use of personal objects to initiate critical thinking, the students engaged in a challenge to create a personal ‘tool kit’; a box to represent elements of their personality, filled with objects to represent their learning journey. As project leaders we completed the task prior to this and the results were diverse and highly personal; abstract connections were made with the objects contained within the boxes. Prior to the students making their boxes, the stories and connections contained within some of the leaders’ boxes were shared. The energy in the room, which initially had an apprehensive and negative undertone following the formal presentation during the previous session (Critical incident 3, above) suddenly shifted as the stories were shared by teachers. There was instantaneous engagement and rapport was built as the students gained a rare insight into their teachers’ personal stories, hopes and fears; their leaders were placed in the same vulnerable position that they were soon to experience.</p>
<p>Within moments of the practical exercise beginning, students were active and engaged in the box making activity, and after a short space of time, a state of complete ‘flow’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1365480212450237">Best &amp; Thomas, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1365480212450237">Csíkszentmihályi, 1997</xref>) was observed. Students were making informed decisions about their work, which were highly personal and diversely different from those of their peers, and organized themselves within the learning space to create the best environment for their perceived needs.</p>
<p>There was very little noise from student conversation but the frenetic energy created by the students realizing their ideas filled the room. Interaction with teachers was not focused as anticipated on seeking assistance to create a refined outcome, but instead on sharing their ideas and how they intended to realize these. What had been achieved was an autotelic activity, with the first real signs that creative learning could foster a sense of intrinsic motivation, drawing out varied and personal meanings for participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1365480212450237">Csíkszentmihályi &amp; Csíkszentmihályi, 1992</xref>).</p>
<p>Feedback gathered from students about the activity reflected the intrinsic motivation being gained from the experience and suggested that in order to motivate learners, it is critical that opportunities allowing a degree of interpretation and self-direction are provided.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I really enjoyed the box thing. I weren’t really thinking about what I did, I just did it.</p>
<p>I enjoyed that, I don’t know why. I think just because it was mine and I could do it however I liked.</p>
<p>The box looks like me!</p>
<p>I learnt how to make a box; I liked it.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1365480212450237">
<title>Critical incident 5: Rejecting destabilization – a change in group culture?</title>
<p>There was one instance of ‘undermining’ behaviour observed during the box making activity when a student attempted to distract others from their flow. This behaviour stemmed from the individual visualizing an ambitious outcome in the early making stages, and not having the technical skill or knowledge to create it. This supported the argument that some knowledge and technical expertise is required for creativity to be realized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1365480212450237">Craft, 2005</xref>). The ‘destabilizer’ went through a progressive phase of opting out of the activity, starting with direct avoidance of ‘I can’t do this’, linked to perception of possible failure in the task. This individual, who was observed regularly engaged in undermining behaviours, responded insightfully during initial interviews, saying ‘I feel bad in school when I fail’ and ‘I mess around in lessons if I am bored or I don’t get something.’</p>
<p>The avoidance behaviour resulted in an interesting reaction from a number of students in the group who might previously have been drawn into the negative behaviour. Some moved themselves away from the distraction, including an individual who had previously presented ‘undermining’ responses; some reprimanded the student; one began to teach the distracting student some of the techniques they had used when making their own box. They had therefore demonstrated evidence that they were now adopting self-initiated inclusive strategies.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-1365480212450237">
<title>Critical incident 6: Merging fantasy and reality: Creative learning</title>
<p>Further into the project, students were presented with a scenario, inspired by the principle of the parallel universes described in Pullman’s books and drawn from their reactions observed during earlier sessions. The story was based around a fictional research academy and the discovery of a mystery disease that was creating holes in the imaginations of young people and holes to other universes. As the story was narrated there was silence. As a participant observer, I had noted the shifts in energy of the group throughout the project and had become sensitive to the atmosphere in the classroom, considering how immeasurable and subjective factors often observed or ‘felt’ in the classroom could be recorded as valid factors for identifying change and response in the learners.</p>
<p>I perceived the silence in the group at that moment as the ‘incubation phase’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1365480212450237">Csíkszentmihályi, 1997</xref>), or the period of time when an individual absorbs information, often subconsciously, which precedes an ‘Aha’ or ‘eureka’ moment.</p>
<p>The words that broke the silence were simple: ‘Is that real?’</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-1365480212450237">
<title>Critical incident 7: Transforming imagination to reality</title>
<p>Students began to expand on their ideas linked to the Pullman-inspired scenario. Interesting issues emerged that provided a source for debate amongst students, indicating that high-order thinking was being conducted through the connection of imagination with prior learning and understanding. As students divided into subgroups to develop their ideas of the physical, scientific and spiritual aspects of their own fictitious worlds in response to the scenario, descriptions of fantastical parallel universes began to evolve. With each idea came debate, where students challenged the ideas in connection to their understanding of reality.</p>
<p>An example included a discussion heard between students about a world where everyone was beautiful. The group proceeded to invent a world where everybody fulfilled their stereotype of perfection, until a pupil from another group questioned them by saying ‘how can everything be beautiful? If everyone is beautiful then nobody would know what beautiful is.’ Further debate followed that questioned the meaning of perfection and the requirement of polar opposites for balance and stability.</p>
<p>Examples of high order critical thinking, defined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1365480212450237">hooks (2010</xref>, p. 7) as ‘the longing to know – to understand how life works’, were observed on numerous occasions throughout the ideas generation phase of the project. Such critical questioning occurred without prompting and I perceived this as an indication to support hooks’s argument that children have a pre-disposition to critical thinking.</p>

<sec id="section17-1365480212450237">
<title>Summary of learning from ‘Another World’</title>
<p>The level of engagement observed in the students was beyond anything I could have imagined from a group who had previously collectively demonstrated profound lack of motivation and no purposeful engagement in learning. Students demonstrated critical curiosity and high order thinking in response to the learning opportunities provided, which were learner focused and required minimal teacher input. The quality and diversity of outcomes developed by the students exceeded expectations, leaving them surprised by their own achievements. Such outcomes, which were not pre-planned, gave an indication that high-level outcomes could be achieved by following a process of creative learning such as that described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1365480212450237">Csíkszentmihályi (1997)</xref>. When comparing the outcomes developed by the students with those highlighted as possibilities during project planning, they achieved superior levels of learning and understanding. The students drew upon their knowledge from a wide range of cross-curricular areas in order to inform their ideas, providing support for my belief that a project based approach to learning can be used in schools to consolidate learning and underlining the importance of meaning making. My summary of the outcomes, and the elements involved in the process of students coming to make connections between their ideas and prior learning, highlighted some interesting thoughts relating to the involvement of the subconscious and learning. It led me to consider whether storytelling can have the same function as writing, in tapping into the unconscious in order to allow us to observe and understand it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1365480212450237">Holly, 1989</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section18-1365480212450237">
<title>The strands of creativity in schools</title>
<p>I concluded that the project had enabled the exploration of all three elements described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1365480212450237">Craft (2005)</xref> relating to creativity in schools:</p>
<list id="list4-1365480212450237" list-type="order">
<list-item><p><italic>Creative teaching</italic>: I suspended judgement and abandoned the expectations relating to outcomes and targets that I had become programmed as a teacher to fulfil. I had to engage with the creative learning process myself, to identify the ‘rules’ that I normally enforce as a teacher and then to break them in order to direct the process of creative learning through the design of learning activities and provision of a setting conducive to creative activity and learning.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Teaching for creativity</italic>: the provision of creative learning activities that engaged learners and encouraged a shift in perception about learning was essential. Storytelling activities unlocked the students’ innate creativity, giving them confidence to articulate their ideas. The personal toolkit activity encouraged a sense of ownership of learning, and fostered a state of ‘flow’, during which time students had an invaluable period of self-reflection, which challenged them to consider themselves as ‘I’ within the group. This seemed to have broken the negative culture that stifled the group.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Creative learning</italic>: students’ engagement in the creative learning process in the final phase of the project reflected their capability. The process of using imagination to initiate ideas, followed by creative thinking, and then realization of ideas through innovation supports both <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1365480212450237">Robinson’s (2011)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1365480212450237">Csíkszentmihályi’s (1997)</xref> models of the creative learning process.</p></list-item></list>
<p>The nature of development of these three interdependent strands within the action research as the enquiry evolved, suggested that these elements are interconnected and all need to be present for creativity in schools to be most effective.</p>
</sec></sec>
<sec id="section19-1365480212450237">
<title>From exploration to explanation</title>
<p>The experience of delivering a project to a group of learners was vastly removed from any previous learning experience in which I had been involved. It gave me an opportunity to explore some of the theories relating to creativity and pedagogy that had inspired my enquiry. However, being a small scale, exploratory case study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1365480212450237">Hitchcock &amp; Hughes, 1995</xref>), it raised more questions than it served to answer.</p>
<p>The methodological approach to my enquiry enabled me to engage fully with the process, and to use my own experience and viewpoints as a starting point for enquiry. The ethnographical case study approach enabled me to work closely with the learners that I was studying, and gain an insight at times into what the experience might have felt like as a student learner. This shared experience, positioning myself as a learner within the class, encouraged positive relationships with the learners, which were critical in encouraging the risk taking and high-level critical thinking that was evident towards the end of the enquiry. I am in no doubt that positive relationships with learners are essential to inform effective teaching that is sensitive to the needs of the learner, and for the level of trust required for students to challenge their perceptions and make uncomfortable steps forward in their thinking. This conviction of the significance of teacher–student relationships is shared by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1365480212450237">Craft (2005)</xref> who states that ‘the relationship between the teacher and the learner must form the focus of the study’ (p. 23). I wondered if the tensions associated with academic performance, along with associated methods of teaching and particular kinds of relationships, were influential in the evolution of the class’s previously negative group culture. Whilst the restrictions of my enquiry did not allow research of this idea in more depth, I considered this a critical idea evolving from my research that would form the basis of further ‘explanatory’ enquiry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1365480212450237">Hitchcock &amp; Hughes, 1995</xref>, after Yin, 1984).</p>
<p>The world economy depends on the nurturing of creative individuals. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1365480212450237">Robinson (2011)</xref> contends that businesses face the challenge of training employees who bring issues from school associated with limited breadth of skill and awareness of their creative capacity, which restricts their ability to innovate or perform in a challenging world market. Yet recent proposals for education reform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1365480212450237">DfE, 2010a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1365480212450237">2010b</xref>) continue to direct schools towards performance-related practice through their reference to the accountability and performance of teachers and school leaders. The effectiveness of schools is evaluated using national and global performance data. However, it is acknowledged in the ‘Case for Change’ report that ‘high-performing systems do not tend to be prescriptive about teaching method in general’; the report goes on to state that ‘prescription about teaching method appears to be an effective approach to securing basic minimum standards, but ineffective as a strategy to encourage excellence’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1365480212450237">DfE, 2010b</xref>, p. 17). This suggests that there is a place for innovation and creativity in schools, but when schools are faced with the pressure of performance and increasing expectations with regard to standards, I would question the extent to which schools are willing to embrace this concept.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-1365480212450237">
<title>The challenge of creative learning and critical thinking</title>
<p>The process of my enquiry challenged both my own creative thinking and that of the learners at the centre of the research. Despite the process of creative learning and critical thinking being uncomfortable at times, each individual involved in the process was successful in engaging and progressing through the process. This gives a strong indication that creativity and critical thinking are innate human traits, and therefore can be successfully nurtured in school. It could be argued that the discomfort associated with the process is instigated by the tensions associated with performativity, and the ‘seriousness of adulthood’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1365480212450237">Peat, 1989</xref>) as I have recognized in my personal reflections. The research suggested that creative learning has the capacity to raise standards in learning, beyond the limits set by the teacher or the school. The diversity observed in the behaviours and outcomes presented by the students suggested that the child is indeed ‘made of one hundred’ as Malaguzzi suggests, but this creates tensions within the current policy environment.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>[Performativity] requires individual practitioners to organize themselves as a response to targets, indicators and evaluations . . . to set aside personal beliefs and commitments and live an existence of calculation. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1365480212450237">Ball, 2003</xref>, p. 1)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Whilst I agree the need for a performative culture in schools for driving attainment to a standardized level, my passion for creativity prevents me from accepting that this approach to education in its entirety is beneficial for the learner. A performative approach does not necessarily promote self fulfilment, given that performance targets are generally externally set. This is where I consider a creative approach to learning could play an effective and balancing role in schools; to foster the skills associated with intrinsic motivation, high-order thinking and independent learning. The pilot research described in this account supports my belief that there is a place for creativity in the most performative of establishments. It served to identify further strands of enquiry into the potential role of creativity in schools, exploring the logistical implications of a wider reaching creative pedagogy, and how this might be successfully implemented.</p>
