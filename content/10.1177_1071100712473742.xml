<title>Background:</title>
<p>There are various methods available to fix a calcaneal osteotomy, ranging from screws to plates and staples. It is not clear if one method is superior to the other. In this series we compare the complications and union rates of 3 different methods of fixation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1071100712473742">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>A retrospective review of the records of a consecutive series of patients who had a calcaneal osteotomy was undertaken. All patients had their osteotomy by the same technique, however the subsequent fixation was performed using 3 different methods: a lateral locking plate, a headless, or a headed screw. The screws were placed through a separate stab incision inserted from the infero-posterior heel. Records were kept of subsequent symptoms from the hardware and need for hardware removal as well as any complications. When screws were inserted, the entry point in relation to the weight-bearing surface of the calcaneus was also recorded. Sixty-seven osteotomies were investigated, of which 17 were fixed using a headed screw, 18 using a headless screw, and the remaining 32 were fixed using a lateral plate.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1071100712473742">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>There was an overall 97% union rate. The only 2 cases of delayed union were both fixed using a lateral plate. Overall, 47% of the headed screws, 11% of the headless screws, and 6% of the lateral plates were removed to address symptoms that were suspected to arise from the hardware. There was a 10% rate of wound complication in the lateral plate cohort. There were no cases of sural nerve injury or neuroma. No correlation was found between entry position of screw and subsequent hardware symptoms.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1071100712473742">
<title>Conclusions:</title>
<p>Calcaneal osteotomies have high union rates regardless of fixation method. Fixation using a headed screw is associated with a high rate of secondary screw removal. This was unrelated to the position of the screw in relation to the weight-bearing surface of the calcaneus in our series. Hardware problems were less frequent in the headless screw or the lateral plate groups; however, the incidence of local wound complications and radiological delayed union was higher in the group fixed with a lateral plate. This may be related to the greater soft tissue dissection and lesser compression achieved at the osteotomy site.</p>

<body>
<p>Calcaneal osteotomy is often performed to correct the alignment of the hindfoot and the weight-bearing axis of the lower limb. It is commonly undertaken in combination with other bony or soft tissue procedures in correction of a more global foot deformity. The operative approach, the position of the osteotomy, the direction of the shift, and the mode of fixation are all subject to considerable variation.</p>
<p>Historically, fixation of a calcaneal osteotomy with a headed screw has been associated with high rates of complications due to posterior heel pain from prominent screw heads, requiring secondary surgery for screw removal. In our unit, the method of fixation has changed over time and according to surgeon preference while the operative approach and the technique utilized have remained relatively unchanged, which provided a good opportunity to compare the outcome of calcaneal osteotomy with respect to fixation methods utilized. These included fixation using a headed screw, a headless conical screw, or a laterally applied stepped locking plate. We also present the medium-term results in 67 calcaneal osteotmies using our standard operative approach.</p>
<sec id="section6-1071100712473742" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>The hospital electronic database, which has been in use since 2008, was searched for any patient who had undergone a calcaneal osteotomy. The patient demographics, indication for surgery, and any concomitant operative procedures were noted. In all cases the principal operating or supervising surgeon was 1 of 2 fellowship-trained orthopaedic foot and ankle surgeons (NC, DS). Both surgeons had initially used headed screws for their fixation, but 1 had changed to the headless screw and the other to lateral locking plates. The standard operative approach was a modification of the extended lateral approach to the calcaneus as popularized by Freeman et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1071100712473742">4</xref></sup> The cohort was divided into 3 groups according to the fixation methods. The first group was a headed screw group (HSG), in this group all screws had a prominent head and included a solid 6.5 mm AO/Synthes (West Chester, PA) partially threaded screws or Depuy (Warsaw, IN) ACE 6.5 mm cannulated partially threaded screws. The next group comprised a headless screw group (HL), and all screws used were the Acutrak plus (Acumed, Hillsboro, OR), which is a headless tapered cannulated screw. Finally, a lateral plate group (LP) was identified where the implant used was a stepped locking plate (OrthoSolutions, Essex, UK). Sixty-seven osteotmies in 55 patients were analyzed. The male to female ratio was 2:2.5. The average age was 48 (range, 19-81). In 31 heels the procedure was as part of a pes cavus correction; 28 were as part of reconstruction for tibialis posterior tendon insufficiency. The remaining 8 were performed to correct malalignment secondary to previous trauma (1 case), residual clubfoot (4 cases), or in the treatment of a Haglund deformity (3 cases). Other than the 3 cases of Haglund correction, when a lateral closing wedge osteotomy was performed, all other osteotomies were planned to be a uniplanar slide in the required medial or lateral direction. The average follow-up was 32.5 months, with a range of 3.5 to 150 months.</p>
<p>There were 17 heels that were fixed with a headed screw (HS), 18 with a headless screw (HLS), and the remaining 32 with a lateral plate. The 3 groups were compared with respect to the outcome measures shown on the graph in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1071100712473742">Figure 4</xref>, which included union of the osteotomy, hardware symptoms, and need for hardware removal and soft tissue complications including nerve injury and infection. Statistical analysis was performed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) with advice from a statistician.</p>
<p>Any patient who had the surgery through a different approach or had their fixation by a different fixation method to the ones discussed previously was excluded from the analysis. In some cases the patient was found to have had the contralateral calcaneus operated on prior to the start of the database. If that procedure met our inclusion criteria it was also included in the analysis.</p>
<p>The outcome measures included union of the osteotomy, hardware symptoms, or the need for hardware removal. Soft tissue complications, in particular the presence of sural nerve injury or neuroma, flap necrosis, or infection, were also recorded. Any complications arising from a concomitant operative procedure were excluded from the analysis.</p>
<p>When screws were used, we mapped the entry point of the screw in relation to the weight-bearing surface of the calcaneus. This was achieved by dividing the tuberosity into 4 quarters, with the plantar quarter labeled as I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1071100712473742">Figure 1</xref>). We then noted the screw entry quarter (SEQ) in each case. The angle between the screw and the osteotomy (screw osteotomy angle, SOA) was also measured. The SOA was defined as the caudal angle made by the intersection of the central axis of the screw and the line of the osteotomy. It was hypothesized that tightening the screw with an angle greater than 90 degrees (obtuse) would have the effect of driving the tuberosity in a superior direction. This was of interest to establish if there was a correlation between this angle and the subsequent superior migration of the osteotomy, which was also recorded in each case.</p>

<title>Operative Technique</title>
<p>The patient is placed supine with a lateral bolster under the ipsilateral buttock. Unless otherwise indicated, general anesthesia and a popliteal block was used before a thigh tourniquet was inflated to 300 mmHg.</p>
<p>The operative exposure was made by an L-shaped incision, the 2 limbs of which met at the lateral side of the heel at an angle of no less than 100 degrees. In contrast to the direct lateral approach, damage to the sural nerve was avoided.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1071100712473742">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1071100712473742">6</xref></sup> The osteotomy was performed using an oscillating saw at a 45 degree angle to the weight-bearing surface, taking care not to breech the medial cortex. The osteotomy was then completed with an osteotome.</p>
<p>In cases where screw fixation was performed, a 1 to 2 cm incision was made on the posterior heel, in the midline, aiming to avoid the weight-bearing skin, and a single screw inserted and the position confirmed with image intensification.</p>
<p>In the cases where a lateral plate is used, a locking step plate was positioned over the displaced osteotomy and 2 locking screws were inserted into 1 fragment initially, followed by nonlocking screws into the other fragment. For a medial displacement, the locking screws were placed in the displaced tuberosity fragment initially, followed by nonlocking screws in the main body fragment. The opposite was done for a lateral displacement. It was important to hold the foot in dorsiflexion while fixing the osteotomy to ensure compression of the bony surfaces.</p>
<p>The limb was placed in a below-knee cast and was non-weight-bearing for 6 weeks unless a concomitant procedure necessitated a longer casting period. Radiographs were taken at 6 weeks and again at around 3 months postsurgery.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<sec id="section9-1071100712473742">
<title>Hardware symptoms and removal</title>
<p>Forty-seven percent (8 of 17) of the headed screws were removed during the follow-up period and after union of the osteotomy was confirmed for symptoms associated with weight-bearing or footwear and was relieved with subsequent removal of the hardware. This compared with 11% (2 of 18) and 6% (2 of 32) in the HLS and LP cohorts, respectively. This discrepancy reached statistical significance using the Fisher’s Exact Test (<italic>P</italic> = 0.003).</p>
<p>It is important to note that heel pain in 1 case in the HLS group continued despite hardware removal. Subsequent imaging confirmed that she had developed a focus of osteonecrosis within the calcaneus, which is an unusual complication of this procedure. If this were excluded from the hardware complications, a removal rate of 6% (1 from 17) could be considered for the HLS group. The other patient continues to complain of discomfort following screw removal although feels that it has improved.</p>
<p>The symptoms from the lateral plate were due to irritation of the peroneal tendons in 1 case. This was confirmed with ultrasonography and was relieved with hardware removal. The other case continued to have symptoms of hindfoot pain despite removal of the plate. We therefore consider the symptoms to have been unrelated to the plate; having excluded this case from the hardware complications, the removal rate of 3% (1 of 31) could be considered for the LP group.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1071100712473742">
<title>Union</title>
<p>Union was defined as bony continuity of greater than 50% of the osteotomy gap, in 2 planes, and in the absence of pain and tenderness. If in doubt a CT scan was the modality of choice to further investigate. Overall, 97% (65 of 67) of the osteotmies had clinically and radiologically united at the time of cast removal in an average of 46 days (range, 41-53). In the remaining 2 cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1071100712473742">Figures 2a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1071100712473742">2b</xref>), nonunion or delayed union was suspected on the radiographs. Both of these cases were fixed using a lateral plate. In the first case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1071100712473742">Figure 2a</xref>) the patient was asymptomatic at 12 months following the surgery and no further intervention was deemed necessary. The second patient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1071100712473742">Figure 2b</xref>) was complaining of mild heel pain on bearing weight at just over 4 months postsurgery. At the time of writing, further intervention was not planned and more time has been assigned for union to complete.</p>
<fig id="fig2-1071100712473742" position="float">

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1071100712473742-fig2.tif"/></fig>
<p>The LP group therefore has a radiographic union rate of 94% (30 of 32) in this series. None have required revision surgery to address their nonunion in comparison to a 100% union rate in the other groups.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1071100712473742">
<title>Infection and wound complications</title>
<p>In 3 cases, persistent wound discharge in the postoperative period required wound debridement, dressings, as well as oral antibiotic therapy. All 3 cases resolved without the need for operative debridement or hardware removal. All 3 cases were in the lateral plate group. This meant there was an overall infection rate of 4.5% (3 of 67), with the infection rate in the LP group calculated as 9.4% while that in the other 2 groups was zero. On the whole, there were no instances of skin flap necrosis, or any that postoperative infection resulted in a secondary operative intervention.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1071100712473742">
<title>Nerve injury</title>
<p>Nonspecific paraesthesia associated with the scar was documented in 8 (12%) of the cases. These were distributed evenly among the different groups with no significant association with a particular fixation technique. These symptoms were confined to the scar only, and injury to the main branches of the sural nerve, resulting in anesthesia distal to the incision, was not encountered in any of the cases. There were also no instances of painful neuromata requiring secondary exploration.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1071100712473742">
<title>Screw position</title>
<p>We found no correlation between the screw entry quarter with respect to the plantar surface of the os calcis and the subsequent need for screw removal. The removal rate in those with a SEQ of 1 or 2 was 26% and that with a SEQ of 3 or 4 was 33%. In fact, out of 4 cases with screws in the first SEQ (ie, insertion at the weight-bearing surface), none required removal. Although the number of cases was very small to draw firm conclusions, removal appeared to be closely correlated to the prominence of the screw head rather than the entry quarter. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1071100712473742">Figure 3</xref>, for example, where a third SEQ was assigned, the screw head prominence produced symptoms and necessitated removal despite the entry position being away from the weight-bearing surface.</p>
<fig id="fig3-1071100712473742" position="float">
<label>Figure 3.</label>

<p>In this example, the prominent screw head was symptomatic, requiring removal despite the high SEQ.</p>

<p>Superior displacement of the tuberosity fragment occurred in 11 cases overall. When both HLS and HS groups are considered together, 9 out of 35 (26%) had migrated whereas only 2 out of 32 (6.3%) had done so in the LP group (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). When fixed with a screw, the average screw osteotomy angle was 93.5 degrees. The average SOA in the cases where migration had occurred was 82 degrees compared to 99 degrees for the ones that no superior migration was evident. This difference was not statistically significant.</p>

<sec id="section14-1071100712473742" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Calcaneal osteotomies have high union rates. This is not surprising considering the vascularity and the cancellous nature of the bone. Maskill et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1071100712473742">7</xref></sup> and Wacker et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1071100712473742">11</xref></sup> reported no cases of delayed or nonunion in their series; Bolt et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1071100712473742">1</xref></sup> had only 1 case in 17 (6%) that required revision surgery and bone grafting. In another series<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1071100712473742">2</xref></sup> a 5.88% rate of delayed union and no case of nonunion was reported. We had a 100% union rate using a single screw in our <italic>screw</italic> cohorts. In our LP group we identified 2 osteotomies where the radiographical criteria for union had not been satisfied at 4 and 12 months, respectively, resulting in an overall union rate of 97%. When considering the LP group separately, the union rate was 90%. Neither of these cases have symptomatically warranted revision surgery. The difference in union between the techniques was not statistically significant; however, the trend may be related to the inherent inability of achieving compression across the osteotomy site through the locking plate. Since this study, it has become our practice to “lock” the osteotomy, after displacement, by dorsiflexing the foot and the toes while applying the plate in an aim to maximize compression.</p>
<p>In most series the calcaneal sliding osteotomy has been fixed using 2 screws<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1071100712473742">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1071100712473742">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1071100712473742">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1071100712473742">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1071100712473742">10</xref></sup> while others used a single screw<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1071100712473742">11</xref></sup> only. The number of screws used does not appear to affect the union rate, which is similarly high in all series. We had a 100% union rate when using a single screw. The use of 2 screws was therefore not necessary in our experience.</p>
<p>Secondary surgery to remove hardware, which can give rise to symptoms on weight-bearing, is a well-known problem when using headed screws to fix calcaneal osteotomies. Removal rates as high as 53% have been quoted in the literature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1071100712473742">1</xref></sup> We had a similar experience when headed screws were concerned, with a removal rate of 47%. A significant reduction in the need for hardware removal was however shown when a headless screw or a lateral locking plate was used. The removal rate was less in the LP compared to the HLS groups (6% vs 11%); this may be because the scar tissue at the screw entry site in the HLS cases may result in symptoms, whereas when using a plate, an incision over the weight-bearing aspect of the heel is avoided altogether. This is further suggested by the fact that 1 patient continued to remain partially symptomatic over the scar despite the removal of their headless screw.</p>
<p>Results were similar in another study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1071100712473742">8</xref></sup> of 28 pes planovalgus corrections, with the calcaneal osteotomy component fixed using 2, headed, partially threaded, 6.5 mm screws. The investigators reported a 35% rate of hardware removal at an average of 14 months postsurgery. There was an 11% rate of wound infection but no documented delayed or nonunion. The hardware removal rate appears to be unrelated to the direction of tuberosity slide. In series performed by the same operative technique, medial slide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1071100712473742">8</xref></sup> and lateral slide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1071100712473742">7</xref></sup> resulted in 35% and 34% hardware removal rates, respectively.</p>
<p>We found no correlation between the position of the screw entry (SEQ) and the resultant need for screw removal. Although it is intuitive that a screw placed away from the weight-bearing surface should be less symptomatic, in practice this did not result in a lower hardware removal rate. It must, however, be noted that the numbers involved were small, and firm conclusions can only be drawn from a larger randomized series. We suggest therefore that the use of headless screws or lateral plates will significantly reduce the need for secondary hardware removal. Osteotomies fixed with a single screw appear to have excellent union rates with no loss of position and the need for a second screw is questionable. The entry position should remain away from the weight-bearing surface, and although no direct benefit with respect to symptom from the hardware was confirmed in our study, this practice has no detrimental effect and is one that we continue to adhere to.</p>
<p>The operative approach in all cases in our series was the same through an extended lateral approach. We had no cases of skin flap necrosis or wound breakdown. A 12% rate of minor paresthesia limited to the scar alone was documented, but there were no cases of injury to the branches of the sural nerve or sural neuritis found. This operative approach protects the nerve by staying posterior to it. This is in contrast to the direct lateral approach through an oblique incision that is commonly used for a calcaneal osteotomy, which puts the nerve at risk. Sural neuritis and neuromata have been reported in 2% to 6% of cases in other studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1071100712473742">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1071100712473742">11</xref></sup> In both studies one third of these cases were subjected to further surgery and required exploration of their neuroma with burial of the stump to address their symptoms.</p>
<p>In a large series of 129 patients who had undergone a medial slide calcaneal osteotomy to correct a pes planovalgus deformity,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1071100712473742">9</xref></sup> 2.3% developed sural neuritis and 3.9% had a superficial wound infection. Unfortunately, the authors do not provide their fixation method nor do they document any cases of hardware removal. They have also not mentioned any cases of delayed or nonunion in their complications. Our overall rate of superficial wound infection was 4.5%, which is comparable with the other series. All of the cases however were in the lateral plate cohort. This increase in wound problems may therefore be related to the extra soft tissue stripping required for the exposure of the lateral surface of the calcaneus to accommodate the plate.</p>
<p>Unless otherwise indicated, we aim to fix the osteotomy without any superior displacement of the tuberosity. It has been suggested that a deliberate 0.5 cm superior displacement may in fact be desirable by reducing the plantar pressures over the medial and lateral forefoot.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1071100712473742">5</xref></sup> In the same cadaveric study, however, the authors noted an increase in the lateral forefoot pressure when the superior migration was greater than 0.5 cm. In our study, the rate of inadvertent superior migration was significantly reduced when a lateral plate was used. When a screw is used, we found no correlation between the entry position of the screw or the screw osteotomy angle in the later superior migration of the tuberosity. In fact, the average SOA was more acute (82 degrees) in cases where migration had occurred. This difference was not statistically significant. One explanation is the presence of a preoperative equinus contracture with the tendoachilles exerting the superior deforming force. None of our patients had a concomitant gastrocnemius or tendoachilles lengthening, and preoperative assessment of an equinus contracture was not recorded for all cases, so we were unable to evaluate this hypothesis.</p>
<p>To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first that directly compares the various fixation methods for a calcaneal osteotomy. Although the operative approach and technique used to perform the osteotomy was the same in all cases, different surgeons performed the surgery, which introduces a degree of bias in the analysis. Another weakness of the study was lack of standardization between the patients with respect to their deformity, time in cast, concomitant operative procedure, and general medical condition. The numbers involved in the various groups were also small. A larger randomized, standardized study would be the gold standard to make any firm conclusions.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Following a calcaneal osteotomy, 30% to 50% of patients underwent secondary surgery to address plantar symptoms from hardware when a headed screw was used. The use of lateral plates and headless screws significantly reduced this rate. A single screw achieved excellent results, and the addition of a second screw was not beneficial. The use of lateral plates was associated with a higher rate of delayed union and wound complications. A lower incidence of inadvertent superior migration of the tuberosity was associated with the use of lateral plates in our series, but the clinical significance of this is uncertain. Headless screws achieved the best results and the lowest complication rates in this study.</p>
