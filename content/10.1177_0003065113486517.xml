<p>NPR’s Renée Montagne was interviewing David Wessel, economics editor of the <italic>Wall Street Journal</italic>, on the morning of September 21, 2012. The Dow Jones was rising despite worldwide unrest, high unemployment, and the increasing likelihood that a presidential candidate thought to be unfriendly to Wall Street, Barack Obama, would win a second term in November. Montagne asked Wessel why, in the face of all this bad news, stocks were rising.</p>
<p>“Well,” Wessel replied, “it’s always hard to know why the stock market does what it does. And it’s important to remember that the mood on Wall Street could change abruptly at any moment.”</p>
<p>Wessel’s language is so familiar it doesn’t strike us as the bizarre cultural phenomenon it is. That’s <italic>always</italic> how commentators describe Wall Street. Apparently, we have all known all along that the financial markets are utterly irrational, but I at least had not paused to consider the implications.</p>
<p>In <italic>Minding the Markets</italic> David Tuckett shines a laser-sharp light on the obvious but (for most of us) split-off fact that the financial markets are conducted according to the logic of the most primitive of emotions, with scarcely a dose of the rational choice that traditional economic theory assumes is running the show. Tuckett’s book, subtitled <italic>An Emotional Finance View of Financial Instability</italic>, is a brilliant piece of applied psychoanalysis.</p>
<p>Writing for sophisticated nonpsychoanalysts—especially those in economics and finance—Tuckett’s dense book takes an ambitious stab at explaining the implosion of the financial markets in 2008 using what might best be termed a “social-psychoanalytic” approach. He relies most heavily on the concepts of disavowal, which for the lay reader he terms “divided thinking,” and affect contagion in groups, which he calls “groupfeel,” and on a careful consideration of the operation of specific primitive defenses in the presence of overwhelming anxiety and uncertainty.</p>
<p>I found <italic>Minding the Markets</italic> to be strongest in its attempt to understand the underlying psychological forces that led to the economic catastrophe of 2007–2008, and relatively weaker when the author takes a stab at translating the understanding he’s gained into a prescription for remedial action in the real-world marketplace. However, one can hardly fault Tuckett for failing to deliver a cure for what ails us economically in a pioneering foray into this new territory.</p>
<p>Tuckett begins his “emotional finance view of financial instability” by fileting traditional economic theory, which, by the time we finish reading his efficient critique, seems like an annoying diversion so deluded by fantasies of rationality that it shouldn’t even slow us on our path toward understanding.</p>
<p>Next he tackles the emerging and popular field known as “behavioral economics,” associated with the work of Daniel Kahneman, Amos Tversky, and others. Kahneman and Tversky first demonstrated empirically that financial decision making is far from rational. Then, Tuckett explains, behavioral economists became interested in the influence of emotion on risk taking and decision making. Tuckett minces up their theory too. He sees this field as deeply limited in its contribution, as it simply grafts a dimension of uncertainty, based on emotion, onto standard economic models.</p>
<p>Getting into the meat of his argument, Tuckett then counters both traditional economic theory and behavioral economics with a psychoanalytically based theory of the markets that he uses to account for dimensions of emotion, the vicissitudes of excitement and anxiety, the development of unconscious procedures to handle the anxiety created by uncertainty and vast amounts of information, and large-group dynamics including affect contagion and shared and viral excitement. All these are essential for a real understanding of financial markets.</p>
<p>Tuckett bases his theory of the emotional market on a series of fifty-two interviews he conducted in 2007 with successful senior asset managers in six international financial capitals. Each had at least ten years’ experience and controlled at least a billion dollars. The timing seems eerily fortuitous—he gained a unique view into the minds of the very cohort of financial leaders who either contributed to the financial meltdown a year later, or were caught unawares by it when it was their job to know exactly what the markets were doing and how they were trending.</p>
<p>He establishes that financial decision makers operate in an environment characterized by an overwhelming load of uncertainty, and both an excess and a paucity of meaningful data. The value of financial assets being inherently volatile, intense anxiety and conflict are inevitable for those who play with them. To explain what happens psychologically in this environment, Tuckett introduces the concepts of “the phantastic object,” organizing stories, “groupfeel,” and “divided thinking.”</p>
<p><italic>Phantastic objects</italic>. “Phantastic object” is a phrase coined by Tuckett and Richard Taffler to refer to powerful psychological “attractors” that, operating unconsciously, stimulate intense fantasies of gratification or frustration. Essentially, the asset manager falls in love with a product, business, or stock, developing an excited attachment that becomes contagious. Underlying this attachment to the phantastic object is the belief that “something innovative and exceptional was changing the world” (p. 18). Historically, economic phantastic objects have included the Dutch Tulip Bulb Mania of 1636–1637 and the dot-com excitement of the 1990s. In the lead-up to the 2008 financial meltdown, the phantastic objects included subprime mortgage derivatives and new financial instruments with bewildering names like “credit default swaps” and “broad index secured trust offerings.” According to Tuckett, Warren Buffett called these exciting new financial products “financial weapons of mass destruction.”</p>
<p><italic>Organizing narratives</italic>. From his interviews, Tuckett concludes that financial managers used story narratives for a variety of purposes. Creating an effective narrative was an unconscious strategy that allowed managers to act in the face of frightening uncertainty. Their stories made “their decision-making sensible and coherent and apparently form[ed] a basis which allowed them conviction about what they did” (p. 159).</p>
<p>The organizing narratives constructed by his respondents have typical features. The stories often include an element of excited grandiosity and exceptionalism, with the manager feeling that he and he alone has the insight or information to make this deal. He believes he can see patterns others miss. The manager is proud of techniques he has developed to “control his emotions” and thereby believes he is making a more rational or mathematical decision than others might. The narrative of a “buy” often includes the two conflicting components of “exceptional expectation” and security. The story allows the manager to tolerate the inevitable instability of the markets. Something in the created story seems to put a limit on experienced risk and uncertainty. And something in the story engages the decision maker in a sort of unique, love-struck way.</p>
<p><italic>Groupfeel</italic>. Integrating the work of the social psychologist Irving Janis on the phenomenon of “groupthink” with Wilfred Bion’s work on groups, Tuckett offers the concept of “groupfeel.” Janis’s groupthink concept has been widely accepted in social psychology to explain the strange behavior of groups wherein, as Tuckett describes it, “situations arise where those in a group become so identified with each other’s feelings and beliefs that they cannot think properly about other possibilities” (p. 66). Groupthink is characterized by the suppression of dissent, polarization of attitudes, and bad decision making. To this Tuckett adds Bion’s ideas about groups and arrives at groupfeel. He writes that “membership in the group feels good and exclusion from the group feels bad. . . . when individuals are involved in <italic>groupfeel</italic> in a basic assumption group they do not each process any available information about events in external reality individually. . . . in this situation evidence from outside about what might be factual and not tends to be treated merely as background noise. What makes members of such a group feel secure is not any consideration of facts but the fact that they are all doing the same thing together” (p. 68).</p>
<p>Here’s the core of Tuckett’s emotional finance theory: an exciting narrative gets created about the attractiveness of a <italic>phantastic object</italic> (e.g., subprime mortgage derivatives). The excitement becomes contagious, and the larger group accepts the imagined value of the phantastic object, even as groupfeel engineers the disappearance of integrated, sophisticated thinking. Under the influence of this group love affair, “divided thinking” takes over.</p>
<p><italic>Divided thinking</italic>. “Divided thinking” is the term Tuckett uses to describe the splitting off of alternative views of reality that are inconsistent with the emotional state of the excited group. Divided thinking explains “why the significant skeptics who doubt or criticize what is happening gain no traction and are invariably dismissed, ignored, greeted with derision, or even threatened” (p. xv). Divided states led to the reckless decisions that culminated in the financial crisis. Reducing the conditions that create divided states, and fostering “integrated states,” is necessary for the prevention of future financial calamities.</p>
<p><italic>From assessment to a treatment plan</italic>. Tuckett concludes his book with a game attempt to apply his psychoanalytic understanding of how markets operate to the development of a psychoanalytically based “treatment plan” for the economy. In the final chapter, “Making Markets Safer,” he spells out steps he views as essential for attaining proper emotional regulation of financial markets. Essentially his prescriptions are designed to reduce divided states and promote integrated states of mental functioning. Sensibly, he wants those involved in the markets to be capable of mentalization.</p>
<p>With operating markets set up as the “patient,” his prescription is fundamentally psychoanalytic: increase awareness, insist on self-reflection, teach people to compare their fantasies with reality. Teach market participants the role of emotion in decision making and the value of understanding past “neurotic” behavior; reduce “divided states” by increasing transparency and self-reflection; and undermine the pernicious factors of idealization, exceptionalism, and runaway excitement.</p>
<p>Though I admire the ambition of Tuckett’s treatment plan, I was left with a feeling that his prescriptions are unrealistic. As I read the recommended maneuvers, I thought, “No one is going to do that, not even close.” The analytic treatment plan is fine, but how on earth would we expect the patient to come to treatment? Tuckett does sketch several institutional changes that would <italic>force</italic> some semblance of reflection and consideration of broader, not divided, fields of data and possibilities. My own diagnosis of the financial markets as patient, aided enormously by Tuckett’s perceptive analysis, is that the patient suffers from a rampant personality disorder, is prone far more to action than to thought, is allergic to self-reflection, and operates in an ahistorical mode. Tuckett’s narrative convinced me that while “the patient” is incapable of psychoanalytic understanding, a psychoanalytic perspective can be useful in crafting necessary rules and regulations.</p>
<p><italic>Applied analysis</italic>. Tuckett’s book is a gem in the field of applied analysis, specifically in the subgenre of applied psychoanalysis of group behavior. Like Leo Rangell in the ambitious and classic <italic>The Mind of Watergate</italic>, Tuckett endeavors to discover the fantasies, dreams, defenses, and relational paradigms that underlie the narrated stories and visible actions of a vast group, in Tuckett’s case the high-level managers who largely control financial markets. Elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0003065113486517">Gourgeuchon 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0003065113486517">in press</xref>) I have suggested a typology of applied psychoanalysis. Tuckett’s work fits mainly in the category of “psychoanalysis of the community,” in which an entire community is taken on as “the patient.” I think his work is strongest when he is analyzing the “patient’s” emotional regulatory systems, the operations of the community’s fantasies, and the dangers of defensive splitting.</p>
<p>Although Tuckett sticks faithfully to the field in which he did his research interviews, the minds of his asset managers, his formulations about phantastic objects and his extension of Janis’s groupthink to the concept of groupfeel are valuable to those of us excited about the ongoing possibilities of applied analysis. For example, certain convictions in the public sphere that seem to be impervious to demonstrated fact, such as the belief in widespread U.S. voter fraud, or the undying conviction that president Obama may not have been born in the United States, start to make sense when understood under the rubric of the phantastic object, an exciting idea that contagiously grips the imagination of a large group struggling with overwhelming uncertainty.</p>
