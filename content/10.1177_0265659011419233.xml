<abstract>
<p>The ability to argue and to create alliances with peers are important social competencies for all children, including those who have speech, language and communication needs. In this study, we investigated the management of arguments and alliances by a group of 5-year-old male friends, one of whom has a persisting speech difficulty (PSD). Twelve argument episodes that arose naturally during video-recorded free play at school were analysed, using Conversation Analysis. Overall the data show that the child with PSD was just as likely as one of his friends to be included in, or excluded from, play alliances. Detailed analysis of two episodes reveals that the child with PSD competently used a range of linguistic devices in and around arguments and that his speech difficulties apparently did not impact on his ability to form alliances. This study highlights the need for those of us who work with children to take account of peer interactions and to consider the linguistic strategies that children employ when participating in peer talk and play: the social world in which inclusion and exclusion are accomplished. The study also illustrates the value of qualitative micro-interactional analysis as a research tool for investigating social inclusion and exclusion.</p>

<title>I Introduction</title>
<p>Children with persisting speech difficulties (henceforth PSD) are typically aged five or above who display ongoing difficulties in the normal development of speech that have no known cause. They present with unclear speech and are typically reported to have difficulties making themselves understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0265659011419233">Pascoe et al., 2006</xref>). Speech and language therapists and teachers often report that children with PSD experience social difficulties such as finding it hard to join in conversations, and that sometimes this may result in discord amongst peers. In one study where children were asked to share their views about their communication difficulties, participants described their difficulties with social interaction. They shared concerns about failing to get their message across clearly and described incidents of misunderstanding with their peers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0265659011419233">Owen et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>The research literature reports that in general children with speech, language and communication difficulties engage in more negative interactions than typically developing peers and have problems initiating and maintaining meaningful friendships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0265659011419233">Durkin and Conti Ramsden, 2010</xref>). The consequences of this are reported to be far-reaching, putting them at risk of rejection, bullying and social exclusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0265659011419233">Botting and Conti-Ramsden, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0265659011419233">Brinton and Fujiki, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0265659011419233">Conti-Ramsden and Botting, 2004</xref>). Many of these social risks have been identified by focusing on measures such as self-esteem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0265659011419233">Lindsay and Dockrell, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0265659011419233">Lindsay et al., 2002</xref>) or the behavioural manifestations of risk from a key adult’s perspective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0265659011419233">Hauner et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0265659011419233">Nathan, 2002</xref>). Other researchers have compared the communication behaviours of groups of children with specific language impairment (SLI) with typically developing peers in their school settings. These studies reveal that children with SLI participate in fewer interactions than their peers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0265659011419233">Hadley and Rice, 1991</xref>) and are more likely to be withdrawn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0265659011419233">Guralnick et al., 1996</xref>). This kind of social isolation may reduce a child’s capacity to engage and collaborate successfully with peers during interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0265659011419233">Brinton et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0265659011419233">Craig and Washington, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0265659011419233">Hadley and Rice, 1991</xref>). Children with SLI have been found to lack verbal skills required for conflict resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0265659011419233">Horowitz et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0265659011419233">Stevens and Bliss, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>The findings from the SLI literature are potentially highly relevant and applicable to children with PSD. However, to date little attention has been given to the social consequences of PSD specifically. In a single case study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0265659011419233">McCleod (2006)</xref> used the International Functioning, Disability and Health Framework (ICF; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0265659011419233">World Health Organization, 2001</xref>) to illustrate that Jarrod, a 7-year-old boy with PSD, would benefit from an holistic assessment of his needs, including not only the typical speech assessments but also an analysis of his ability to participate in daily life tasks. The ICF provides further incentive to study children like Jarrod in the context of their real lives, in order to develop a more detailed understanding of how social risks might be manifested through their interactions. Thus in summary, research suggests that children with PSD might be at risk socially and may be involved in negative social exchanges with peers.</p>
<p>Conversation analysis (CA) is one research approach that can be used to explore how a child’s communication difficulties, such as PSD or SLI, may impact on their conversational partners in real situations. CA differs from other types of discourse analysis by avoiding the use of an abstracted system of coding and analysis. Instead, its aim is to reveal how utterances in ordinary conversations can accomplish particular social actions by their design and sequential placement, as oriented to by the participants themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0265659011419233">Goodwin, 2000</xref>). CA research has shown how each participant pays close attention to talk in previous turns in order to construct their own next turn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0265659011419233">Schegloff, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0265659011419233">Schiffrin, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>There are numerous examples of the application of CA that focus on how communication impairments impact on the conversational success of individuals (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0265659011419233">Beeke et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0265659011419233">Clarke and Wilkinson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0265659011419233">Radford and Tarplee, 2000</xref>). This focus is relevant because, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0265659011419233">Schegloff (2003</xref>: 45) argues, there is a need to study those with communication impairments not purely as members of speech impaired groups but ‘like other co-participants … going about the business of their “ordinary talk”.’</p>
<p>While to date there has been relatively little research aimed at understanding how social interaction is accomplished between peers in the face of a speech difficulty, some recent CA studies have begun to address these issues. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0265659011419233">Sidnell (2010)</xref> has shown that in peer interaction 4-year-old children highlight misunderstandings due to mispronunciation by the use of questioning repeats to initiate repair. However, children who are just slightly older are less likely to focus on these types of misunderstandings, being instead more concerned with establishing shared meaning and cooperation. They accomplish this by using repair initiations that invite further information and detail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0265659011419233">Newbold et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0265659011419233">Sidnell, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0265659011419233">Tykkyläinen, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Since the child with PSD is first and foremost a child like other children, it is equally important to consider the wider perspective of research into children’s peer interaction. Research from ethnographic and CA perspectives has provided valuable insights into the social lives of children, in particular how language is used between friendship groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0265659011419233">Corsaro, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0265659011419233">Denzin, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0265659011419233">Kryatis, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>One recurrent activity that has been frequently noted in children’s peer interactions is argument. Arguments play a positive and important role in the development of close relationships between children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0265659011419233">Corsaro and Rizzo, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0265659011419233">Goodwin and Goodwin, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0265659011419233">Maynard, 1986</xref>). Their disputes are ‘not necessarily aggressive’ but in some way are ‘serious, real and aggravated’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0265659011419233">Garvey and Shantz, 1992</xref>: 94). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0265659011419233">Corsaro (2005)</xref> has found that children naturally aim to protect their play space. When children prohibit others from joining their play it is a demonstration of their commitment to sharing and preserving an alliance with their existing play partners. Play access, the nature of play and object disputes are all common causes of children’s arguments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0265659011419233">Corsaro and Rizzo, 1990</xref>). In these situations children collaborate with each other to negotiate their social positions and accomplish social organization of their own peer group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0265659011419233">Maynard, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0265659011419233">Corsaro and Rizzo, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0265659011419233">Goodwin and Kryatis, 2007</xref>). Negotiating inclusion in ongoing play, defending property and sharing opinions are just a few aspects of peer related competence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0265659011419233">Hutchby, 2005</xref>). These may be more challenging for a child with PSD who is likely to find it harder to express themselves with clarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0265659011419233">Owen et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Henceforth the term ‘argument’ will be used to refer to an interaction between two or more children where there is an exchange of views opposing another’s actions or statements. CA studies have revealed that arguments are mutually created (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0265659011419233">Schiffrin, 1985</xref>): from the CA perspective an argument arises from intricate cooperative behaviours from each participant, rather than being a breakdown in communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0265659011419233">Nguyen, 2011</xref>). A participant will need to pay close attention to the previous turn in order to construct an appropriate response, which may either escalate or end the argument. So an argument between friends can be considered to be a linguistic device that is used to share disagreement and to begin negotiations for changing the status quo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0265659011419233">Church, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0265659011419233">Corsaro and Rizzo, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0265659011419233">Maynard, 1986</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0265659011419233">Eisenberg and Garvey (1981)</xref> show that arguments have an identifiable and coherent structure in which one person opposes another’s actions or statements and each participant establishes a functional role. The argument advances when the first speaker responds to the second’s opposition. This is illustrated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0265659011419233">Table 1</xref>, with an example from the present data.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0265659011419233">Goodwin (1990)</xref> shows that in children’s arguments, opposition is developed through partial repetition of the preceding turn in order to challenge it. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0265659011419233">Goodwin and Goodwin (1990)</xref> also identify some common strategies that participants focus on and use when arguing together. For example, children use ‘format ties’ to build alliances between participants. They do this ‘using syntactic, semantic and phonological surface structures of prior turns’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0265659011419233">Goodwin and Goodwin, 1990</xref>: p. 177). One example is a ‘character tie’, used to make a link between a character in the utterance and an aspect of the immediate context (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0265659011419233">Goodwin and Goodwin, 1990</xref>). For example the use of ‘he’ in ‘he doesn’t want to play with you, he wants to play with me right’ is an attempt to tie the character relating to ‘he’ into an alliance with the speaker, implying that they both share the same stance and some agreement about the opposition in the ongoing play. It is a strategy used to advance a point of view.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0265659011419233">Maynard (1986)</xref> found that even young children negotiated to collaborate with each other in multiparty arguments. Maynard found that principal parties within an argument can invite a third party to display an alignment to support the advance of a particular stance. Once an ‘alignment structure’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0265659011419233">Maynard, 1986</xref>) has been created, the two aligned participants (Party 1) collaborate in an alliance against the party holding an opposing position (Party 2). In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0265659011419233">Figure 1</xref>, boxes A, B and C represent the potential alliance formations that exist in a three-party interaction during play. The numbers 1, 2 and 3 represent the participants. In A, all participants are in agreement and play cooperatively. In B, two participants have developed an alliance and collaborate whilst a third party fails to gain entry to their play and plays alongside. There are no alliances in C: the three participants argue against each other and play individually.</p>

<p>In summary, research has shown that children as part of their typical daily life will encounter arguments and that this is an important context for developing alliances with each other. However, there has been no previous research, to our knowledge, that investigates peer arguments where one of the children has a communication impairment such as PSD.</p>
<sec id="section2-0265659011419233">
<title>1 Aim of the study</title>
<p>The aim of this study is to investigate how peer interactional issues such as sustaining arguments and creating alliances are managed when one of the children has PSD. In order to address this topic using the CA method, a single case approach is adopted, in which a child with PSD is studied in naturalistic play interaction with his friends.</p>

<sec id="section3-0265659011419233">
<title>2 Research questions</title>
<p>In interactions involving a 5-year-old boy with PSD and his friends, the following research questions are posed:</p>

<sec id="section4-0265659011419233" sec-type="methods">
<title>II Method</title>
<p>The participant in the study who is described as having PSD is a 5-year-old boy who will be called Mick, a pseudonym. Assessment using South Tyneside Assessment of Phonology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0265659011419233">Armstrong and Ainley, 2007</xref>) shows that he uses a number of persistent immature phonological processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0265659011419233">Grunwell, 1997</xref>). These include context sensitive voicing, velar fronting, cluster reduction and gliding. In addition to this, his articulation of emerging final and medial fricatives is atypical.</p>
<p>Mick attends a rural mainstream school. He is healthy, with normal hearing and is reported to be at least average in his school work. His understanding and expressive language have not been noted to be of concern. However, his teachers are worried about his speech. In class he has been observed to give up on interactions with teachers, to avoid answering questions and to show frustration during interactions with adults. This has sometimes also been observed with peers, although Mick is reportedly a popular boy. The two friends of Mick who participated in the study, who will be given the pseudonyms Fred and Johnny, are of the same age and are reported to have no difficulties with their communication skills.</p>
<p>After parental consent had been obtained, Mick’s interactions with his two friends were recorded. In line with ethnographical approaches widely used in branches of sociological and sociolinguistic research (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0265659011419233">Corsaro, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0265659011419233">Goodwin and Heritage, 1990</xref>) a six-week period of filming took place in the classroom during ‘free play’ with no teacher present. This method provided an opportunity to observe interactions that occurred naturally as the children played together.</p>
<p>Mick chose Fred and Johnny as play partners at each data collection session. This fitted with the description that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0265659011419233">Corsaro (2005</xref>: 115) presents of early childhood friendships where ‘the notion of friendship relates to observable shared activities, playing together in specific areas and protecting the play from other children’. The boys’ behaviour was therefore considered to be representative of their typical interactions.</p>
<p>In total, 12 argument episodes were identified and transcribed orthographically using CA conventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0265659011419233">Atkinson and Heritage, 1984</xref>), described in <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0265659011419233">Appendix 1</xref>. Because Mick’s atypical speech production is relevant to one of the research questions, his utterances were also transcribed phonetically. In the transcripts, his contributions are presented in a relatively broad phonetic notation that aims to capture the main atypical features of his speech. The orthographic glosser presents the transcriber’s interpretation of the target words.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0265659011419233" sec-type="results">
<title>III Results</title>
<p>In the first stage of analysis, the videos and transcripts were inspected in order to identify argument episodes. These were noted to occur at some point in each of the recorded play sessions. ‘Argument episodes’ were identified by the following criteria: (1) an interruption of the flow of cooperative play, (2) composed of three or more turns, and (3) occurrence of an oppositional turn taken by the opposer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0265659011419233">Eisenberg and Garvey, 1981</xref>). A collection of 12 multiparty argument episodes was assembled in this way. When two of the boys collaborated before and during an argument, this was identified as ‘alignment’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0265659011419233">Maynard, 1986</xref>), leading to the creation of an ‘alliance’. An alliance is identified when two or more of the boys play and interact cooperatively. How arguments and alliances were identified analytically will be illustrated in detail below, with reference to two argument episodes.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0265659011419233">Table 2</xref> gives an overview of the findings in terms of the nature of the argument (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0265659011419233">Corsaro and Rizzo, 1990</xref>) and of the alliance structures that were created during each episode (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0265659011419233">Maynard, 1986</xref>). ‘Opposing opinion’ refers to disagreements about the nature of play, such as what to play and how to play with particular objects. ‘Access’ arguments arise when a third party attempts to gain entry to ongoing play.</p>

<p>Johnny features in all of the argument alliances. In four of these Mick collaborated with him to form a one-party alliance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0265659011419233">Maynard, 1986</xref>) that excluded Fred. In a further four episodes, an alliance was formed between Johnny and Fred, excluding Mick. In the remaining four argument episodes, no alliances were formed.</p>
<p>In the next section, two representative argument episodes – Episode 1 ‘Fire Hose’ and Episode 5 ‘Birthday’ – are analysed, with a focus on key strategies that the boys employed to establish alignment, create alliances and thereby influence the course of the argument. Following that, the results are discussed in relation to Mick’s PSD and communicative competencies within the interactions.</p>

</fig>
<p>Prior to this episode the boys have been discussing what they could play. They stand around a table with a box of plastic model pieces upturned. Johnny is at the top of the table, and Fred and Mick stand on either side of Johnny. Mick and Johnny take pieces out of the box whilst Fred stands and watches.</p>
<sec id="section6-0265659011419233">
<title>a The alliance</title>
<p>To begin with the three boys appear to be building a toy together, but closer inspection reveals that Mick and Johnny form a one-party alliance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0265659011419233">Maynard, 1986</xref>) leaving Fred on the sidelines. Johnny has positioned himself as the director of the play activity and holds on to the model as it is constructed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0265659011419233">
<title>b Naming</title>
<p>Early in the interaction Johnny employs the alignment strategy of using Mick’s name to invite him to play. This is an effective method of linking Mick to Johnny’s play.</p>
<list id="list2-0265659011419233" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>1:01 <italic>Johnny</italic>: no Mick Mick lets-lets make along water pipe</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>In line 02 Mick implicitly accepts this offer of collaboration when he adds a green piece to the model, simultaneously commenting on this action:</p>
<list id="list3-0265659011419233" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>1:02 <italic>Mick</italic>: there the green ones</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Throughout the interaction Johnny uses this alignment strategy to acknowledge or direct Mick’s actions, which in turn effectively maintains their alliance, as in lines 13, 25 and 32.</p>
<list id="list4-0265659011419233" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>1:13 <italic>Johnny</italic>: yeah Mick Mi::ck</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>1:25 <italic>Johnny</italic>: yeah that’s it Mick</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>1:32 <italic>Johnny</italic>: Mick you need to put it o::n</p></list-item>
</list>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0265659011419233">
<title>c Agreed / shared play actions</title>
<p>The alliance is maintained because Mick cooperates by following Johnny’s play and verbal directions. The analysis reveals that in fact the boys’ actions are tied closely to their talk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0265659011419233">Goodwin, 2000</xref>). For example Mick matches his play to Johnny’s so that he always offers a piece (lines 02, 08, 10, 12), which fits a specific pattern of colours and shapes: red cog and green long piece. They have an implicit agreement, which Fred is not party to, about the pattern sequence: Johnny will only accept a red or green piece at this point. This is evident when he ignores Fred’s offer of a yellow cog in line 04 then acknowledges the addition of a green piece by Mick in 05.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0265659011419233">
<title>d Shared linguistic formulae</title>
<p>Early in the interaction the format of ‘(and) we need’ is used by all of the boys.</p>
<list id="list5-0265659011419233" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>1:03 <italic>Fred</italic>:  we need that</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>1:05 <italic>Johnny</italic>: yeah and we nee[::d ]</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>1:06 <italic>Mick</italic>:         [and] we need</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>As the interaction proceeds, ‘and we need’ is recycled. Johnny and Mick’s turns acquire a rhythm as they begin to respond to each other with overlapped turns (lines 05, 06) at times allowing no interval between their adjacent utterances (lines 10–12, 15–17).</p>
<list id="list6-0265659011419233" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>1:10 <italic>Mick</italic>:  mm red one’s on (.) and a green =</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>1:11 <italic>Johnny</italic>: = and we have that one =</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>1:12 <italic>Mick</italic>:  = and we need a bendy one</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>In the examples above the boys closely orient to each other’s talk. They complete each other’s turn, creating a joint production of talk that parallels their construction of the model.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0265659011419233">
<title>e Attempts to gain access</title>
<p>Johnny and Mick dominate the interaction, using their alliance to prevent interruption by Fred. Fred begins by trying to work out the ‘rules of entry’ and makes several attempts at joining in, but he is blocked each time by one or other member of the alliance. His first attempt in line 03 fails and his offer is rejected in favour of Mick. In a second attempt he employs some of the same alignment strategies used by the others. He partially recycles the format ‘and we need’ and using a character tie (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0265659011419233">Goodwin and Goodwin, 1990</xref>), which links a play piece to Johnny:</p>
<list id="list7-0265659011419233" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>1:09 <italic>Fred</italic>: need a red one Johnny don’t we?</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Acting on behalf of the alliance as a single party, Mick takes Johnny’s turn:</p>
<list id="list8-0265659011419233" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>1:10  <italic>Mick</italic>: mm red one’s on (.) and a green =</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The first part of this turn addresses Fred’s question using a statement about the model ‘mm the red ones on’ but then he adds ‘and a green’ to pick up the pattern of his earlier synchronized turns with Johnny. This invites a contingent response from Johnny who uses the conjunction ‘and’ to begin his own turn:</p>
<list id="list9-0265659011419233" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>1:11 <italic>Johnny</italic>: = and we have that one =</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Here we can see that the use of these linguistic resources of alignment reaffirms the alliance between Johnny and Mick, protecting their play from Fred’s intrusion.</p>
<p>In lines 05 and 15 Johnny begins each turn with ‘yeah’ in response to Fred (lines 03, 14). However, although he has agreed that the model needs something, he does not accept the offer of a piece from Fred. Instead, in line 05 he turns his attention to Mick and accepts the green piece, which adds to the colour pattern emerging in the model. This sequence happens again in line 15 when Johnny verbally accepts that a piece is needed but does not take the yellow piece offered by Fred. A few turns later and after arguing with Fred (see below) he overlaps Fred’s turn (line 31) to accept a new colour ‘orange’ introduced by Mick (lines 16 and 30). This again illustrates that he and Mick continue to work together to make a fire hose.</p>
<list id="list10-0265659011419233" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>1:16<italic> Mick</italic>:  and we need an orange one</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>1:31 <italic>Fred</italic>:  that isn’t, that[isn’t-</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>1:32 <italic>Johnny</italic>:       [Mick] you need to put it o::n</p></list-item>
</list>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0265659011419233">
<title>f The argument</title>
<p>In a third bid to access the play, Fred initiates an argument. The argument begins in line 18, when Fred blocks Mick’s turn in order to protest about the choice of a piece that Johnny is adding to the model.</p>
<list id="list11-0265659011419233" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>1:18 <italic>Fred</italic>: no, [NO NO NO NO</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>      ((starts to attach a piece to model))</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>As well as protesting verbally, Fred also displays his disagreement with the ongoing play by putting his piece on the model himself. Johnny becomes the opposer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0265659011419233">Eisenberg and Garvey, 1981</xref>) and the argument takes off, lasting until line 23. At this juncture Mick redirects the talk by designing his turn to follow on from Johnny’s turn just prior to the argument, in line 17: he reverts to the same format as Johnny ‘and then we need’.</p>
<list id="list12-0265659011419233" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>1:17<italic> Johnny</italic>: = and then we need this one</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>1:24<italic> Mick</italic>:  and next – and next we need another of these</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>       ((offers a red cog and then puts it on model))</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>This has the effect of shutting down Fred’s argument, which has failed to secure him access to the play. At this point Fred gives up on his attempt to join in (lines 33–34) leaving Mick and Johnny playing together.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0265659011419233">
<title>g Summary</title>
<p>In this episode Mick and Johnny successfully use a number of alignment devices that enable them to develop and maintain a robust play alliance. This keeps both of them central to the play whilst denying Fred’s entry to it. Fred eventually tries to break the alignment and join in by using an argument but finally gives up, leaving Johnny and Mick to continue to play cooperatively.</p>

<title>2 Episode 5: ‘Birthday’</title>
<p>In this next episode (Episode 5: ‘Birthday’) similar components and strategies to Episode 1 (‘Fire Hose’) can be observed, although there are differences in who uses them, as this time it is Mick who is being excluded from the play.</p>
<fig id="fig3-0265659011419233" position="float">

</fig>
<p>The boys build birthday cakes with bricks. Mick is doing this on his own, while Fred and Johnny are playing together. The boys rummage around in the box looking for ‘candles’.</p>
<p>As in Episode 1 (‘Fire’) a one-party alliance is established prior to the argument. Johnny uses a character tie, ‘me and Fred have the mostest’ (line 68). The specific reference to each of them here highlights the two-against-one aspect of the play and ‘mostest’ introduces a competitive element. Fred volunteers his support to Johnny with an agreement (line 69) and a collective pronoun ‘we’ (line 71) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0265659011419233">Maynard, 1985</xref>).</p>
<list id="list13-0265659011419233" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>5:69 <italic>Fred</italic>: yeah</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>5:71 <italic>Fred</italic>: BUT I haven’t::; no we haven’t (2.1)</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Despite the implicit alignment between Johnny and Fred, Mick attempts to form an alliance with Johnny (line 75) using a character tie (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0265659011419233">Goodwin and Goodwin, 1990</xref>). At this point Mick provides a statement of intent about his plan to involve Johnny, although he does not offer a direct invitation to him. Johnny is animated in the talk and tied in to the action, described in line 73, of making a cake.</p>
<list id="list14-0265659011419233" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>5:73 <italic>Mick</italic>: and I gonna make a cake with it</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>5:75 <italic>Mick</italic>: with- with Johnny</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Mick attempts to alter the social organization of the group by persuading Johnny to leave play with Fred and to join him. At line 83 he uses a question with Johnny’s name to explicitly seek collaboration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0265659011419233">Maynard, 1986</xref>):</p>
<list id="list15-0265659011419233" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>5:83 <italic>Mick</italic>: Johnny don’t need teams do you?</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>At this juncture Johnny (line 84) uses the opportunity instead to overtly position himself with Fred. His use of a collective pronoun in ‘we want to’ marks a collective agreement with Fred:</p>
<list id="list16-0265659011419233" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>5:84 <italic>Johnny</italic>: we want to (1.0)</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Fred responds to the threat of losing his play with Johnny by introducing the notion of ‘team’ play (line 76). He does this with another character tie using ‘my’ to claim ownership of the team with Johnny as a member of it. This formalizes the existing alliance he shares with Johnny:</p>
<list id="list17-0265659011419233" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>5:76 <italic>Fred</italic>: no:: no (.) Johnny on my team</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Fred has changed the nature of the argument and promoted himself to a status position. He has created a team and now has the authority to select his team members. He also implies a local rule: if you are not on the team you cannot play (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0265659011419233">Goodwin and Goodwin, 1990</xref>). This effectively protects his ongoing play with Johnny from intrusion by Mick.</p>
<p>If Mick were to accept the suggestion of teams he would still be left out of the play. This illustrates how the argument helped Fred and Johnny use their alliance effectively to block Mick’s access to their play. Mick in this situation is unable to break the alliance and at this point appears to be vulnerable, becoming an onlooker and showing some signs of becoming upset.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0265659011419233">
<title>3 The child with PSD in peer arguments</title>
<p>In Episode 1 Mick demonstrates a number of competencies that enable him to cooperate with Johnny to forge and maintain an effective alliance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0265659011419233">Corsaro and Rizzo, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0265659011419233">Goodwin and Kryatis, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0265659011419233">Maynard, 1985</xref>). He does this by orienting closely to prior turns and by responding quickly with his next turn. He uses character ties and recycling of formats to maintain a rhythm and synchrony with Johnny. He and Johnny work successfully in an alliance to protect their play from Fred’s influence.</p>
<p>Mick’s speech difficulty is apparent in the course of this episode, in the sense that most of his utterances evidence immature or atypical pronunciations. However, this seems to be of no consequence for the other two boys in this interaction. There are no instances where they initiate repair from Mick; nor are there any instances where Mick initiates self-repair. It was noted that Mick’s physical actions are congruent with Johnny’s, which may reduce the demands on speech clarity, for example in lines 02 and 10:</p>
<list id="list18-0265659011419233" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>1:02 <italic>Mick</italic>: /dϵə: din wɒɮ/</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>      there green ones ((picks up another long green piece adds it))</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>1:10 <italic>Mick</italic>: /m: ʋϵd wɒnz ʔn an a din/</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>      mm red one’s on (.) and a green = ((Mick adds green))</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>When Mick uses deictic words such as ‘these’ and ‘them’, these are pronounced as [d̻is̻] (line 24) and [ϵm] (lines 08 and 26), but again this is not problematic for the other participants, perhaps because his actions alongside his speech ‘do the talking’. The analysis thus suggests that the understandability of talk can only be assessed within the context of the activity in progress and the non-verbal elements of the interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0265659011419233">Goodwin, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>In Episode 5, despite using a number of interactional strategies, Mick does not manage to enter the ongoing alliance between Johnny and Fred. Although his speech difficulty is apparent in many turns, such as line 70, his co-participant’s next turn response routinely follows immediately and is contingent on the content of Mick’s turn:</p>
<list id="list19-0265659011419233" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>5:70 <italic>Mick</italic>: /Mǝʊ nǝʊ ðɪv tʰʊk ɔl dǝ ʋʷ:m<sup>ǝ</sup>/</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>      OH NO YOU TOOK ALL THE (BLUE) (.)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>5:71 <italic>Fred</italic>: BUT I haven’t::::no we haven’t (2.1)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>5:73 <italic>Mick</italic>: /an aɪm gʌnə meɪʔə deɪʔ ən ɪʔ/</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>      and I gonna make a cake with it</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>5:74 <italic>Fred</italic>: NO</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>As in the ‘Fire hose’ episode, there is a notable absence of repair initiations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0265659011419233">Newbold et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0265659011419233">Sidnell, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0265659011419233">Tykkyläinen, 2010</xref>), further evidence that in this context Mick’s speech does not hinder his participation. It appears that the children focus on sharing meaning but do not orient to phonetic aspects of turn design.</p>
<p>At the end of Episode 5 Mick could be described as ‘vulnerable’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0265659011419233">Brinton and Fujiki, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0265659011419233">Botting and Conti-Ramsden, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0265659011419233">Conti-Ramsden and Botting, 2004</xref>). After this particular argument episode, Mick resumed play on his own whilst Johnny and Fred continued their one-party alliance in their play. However, our analysis does not indicate that his exclusion is a consequence of his speech difficulty. His exclusion from the play, which developed gradually over time, is rather attributable to the robust nature of the alliance prior to and during the argument that the other two boys used to protect their ongoing play partnership. It is hard to imagine how any child could find an effective way of becoming part of a ‘team’ in which the only two members have ‘agreed’ the entry criteria and update those criteria in the course of Mick’s application for membership.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0265659011419233" sec-type="discussion">
<title>IV Discussion</title>
<p>This study was stimulated by the lack of research to date about how children with PSD participate in their every day talk with their peers. In the case of Mick, reports from his teachers indicate that he displays some difficulties interacting in the classroom, both with peers and adults. This suggests that Mick may be at risk of experiencing some difficulties socially. We might predict that for Mick arguments would arise because of his difficulties speaking clearly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0265659011419233">Owen et al., 2004</xref>), or that he might find it difficult to participate in arguments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0265659011419233">Guralnick et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0265659011419233">Hadley and Rice, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0265659011419233">Horowitz et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>However, despite Mick’s speech difficulties the analyses reveal that he competently uses a range of linguistic devices in and around arguments with his friends. In Episode 1 Mick effectively collaborates with a friend and successfully protects the ongoing play thus preventing interruption from a third person. By contrast, in Episode 5 he is exposed as vulnerable in the face of a highly effective strategy to exclude him from ongoing play. Nevertheless, it would seem that even here his speech difficulty does not impact on his ability to participate in social play with his friends. Overall, it was found that across the 12 argument episodes identified in the recordings, Mick was just as likely to be included in, or excluded from, play alliances as one of his friends (Fred). Thus there is no evidence from the interactions of this particular child, that a persisting speech difficulty is a particular risk factor for social exclusion at the micro level of play interaction.</p>
<p>The application of an ethnographic perspective and CA methodology has provided an opportunity to consider Mick’s speech behaviours as they manifest in the routine peer interactions in which he participates. The analysis has highlighted the complexity of linguistic and non-verbal behaviours that 5-year-old boys draw upon as resources when spontaneously forging alliances and conducting arguments. It has been shown that their arguments during play are instrumental in helping them organize themselves, each other and their play space without direct adult intervention. Together they negotiate and use a range of communication skills to decide how play will proceed and who is involved. In these respects, the nature of their arguments and their participation appears to be typical of boys this age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0265659011419233">Corsaro, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0265659011419233">Corsaro and Rizzo, 1990</xref>).</p>
<p>An important finding is that alignment strategies are vital for forging and maintaining alliance. It has been shown that together the boys construct the interaction turn by turn. Careful attention to each other’s talk enables them to use linguistic devices such as repeated formulae from each other’s turns and character ties (use of names and pronouns). These strategies are effective for creating alignments and hence alliances in and around their arguments whilst playing. Paired alliances are created linguistically in both episodes, and both instances illustrate how useful these alliances are for directing the course of play and in the short term excluding another from joining in. For all of the boys, being able to participate verbally in this way enables them to navigate through their play together and hence participate in an important aspect of their social lives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0265659011419233">Corsaro, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0265659011419233">Maynard, 1986</xref>). In both the episodes that were analysed in detail here, the child outside of the alliance also uses strategies to try and establish alignment, but these attempts are thwarted by the members of the alliance. It was shown that effective and robust alliances are developed over time and are continuously reaffirmed during interaction through synchronized talk and action.</p>

<title>V Conclusions</title>
<p>For early-years professionals – such as teachers and speech and language therapists – this research points to the value of studying and facilitating peer interactions in informal contexts. Providing children with a context for shared play and negotiation will enable them to develop further skills for peer interaction. Interactional analysis of this type enables professionals to identify key vocabulary, language structures and interactional routines involved in creating alliances, which could be of functional value by directly improving the child’s linguistic skills for social competence in a classroom setting. Furthermore the details that emerge from the analyses here provide some insights into how functionally relevant opportunities for therapy might be developed. For example, interventions that promote the linguistic skills needed for developing alliances and participating in arguments may facilitate a child’s participation. Friends’ names, pronouns, repeating each other’s prior utterances are all linguistic components of alignment and argument and could be integrated into therapy goals alongside the development of speech sounds.</p>
<p>At a broader level, identifying the trajectories of arguments and alliances sheds some light on the processes that give rise to inclusion and exclusion during the course of play. This is helpful for understanding the social life of children who have a communication impairment such as PSD.</p>
