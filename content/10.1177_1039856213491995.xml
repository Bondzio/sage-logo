<p>Fifty child and adolescent psychiatrists and residents participated. According to their collective experience, the adolescents’ memorial journey triggered a variety of mental health problems, including psychosis, but only one case of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

<title>Conclusions:</title>
<p>Although it may seldom lead to PTSD, the Holocaust memorial journey can be a major stressor for some participating teenagers. Evaluating “high risk” adolescents prior to their planned exposure to likely stressors and conducting large, prospective studies that examine the impact of pre-planned stressors on the lives of adolescents are warranted.

<p>During World War II, the Nazis perpetrated genocide against the Jews, murdering about 6 million. As a major method of killing, European Jews were systematically concentrated in Poland for mass murder in extermination camps. The Jewish state of Israel and the identity of Jewish Israelis have emerged in this catastrophic shadow.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1039856213491995">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1039856213491995">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Holocaust continues to be remembered in Israel in a variety of ways. Among them, every year approximately 20% of Israeli high school students travel to Poland for an 8-day “Holocaust memorial journey”. Since 1988, more than 300,000 Israeli adolescents have had this experience, which is currently an optional part of the Education Ministry’s school curriculum. Escorted by a “live witness” (a Holocaust survivor), the students enter the site of concentration camps, share the Holocaust stories of family members, and learn more about this tragic period of Jewish history. Aspects of the journey have attracted criticism in Israel – the journey is widely considered an emotional stressor, and one of the prevailing concerns is that it may trigger mental health problems, particularly post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), among participating teenagers. There is accumulating evidence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1039856213491995">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1039856213491995"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1039856213491995">5</xref></sup> that “indirect exposure” to traumatic events, like learning that a close relative or friend<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1039856213491995">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1039856213491995">7</xref></sup> encountered a horrific event or viewing disturbing televised images, such as the 1995 bombing of the Federal Building in Oklahoma City<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1039856213491995">8</xref></sup> or people falling or jumping from the World Trade Center towers in the “September 11” terrorist attacks,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1039856213491995">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1039856213491995">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1039856213491995">10</xref></sup> may precipitate PTSD.</p>
<p>There have been previous studies of Holocaust memorial journeys, but these have tended to focus on the educational, cultural and sociological aspects of the journey rather than potentially adverse mental health consequences. Nevertheless, a study of 1996 adolescents who went on the journey found that 1% believed that they did not have the “mental strength” to deal with their experiences (unpublished findings presented to the Israeli parliament).</p>
<p>In order to begin to understand the psychological consequences of the Holocaust memorial journey for teenagers, we sought to ascertain the experiences of child and adolescent mental health professionals in Israel with the country’s student population.</p>
<sec id="section5-1039856213491995" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>The authors developed a questionnaire to elicit the clinical experiences of child and adolescent psychiatrists and residents (trainees) in the specialty in Israel regarding the mental health consequences, in particular PTSD, of the Holocaust memorial journey for students. To enable comparison of the impact of the journey to Poland with other stressors, the questionnaire also examined the psychiatrists’ and residents’ experience in relation to students’ responses to other traumatic events and after the annual “sleep-out” school trip. Sleep-out school trips, lasting 2–5 days, entail adolescents being away from home and having a close, sometimes intense interaction with their peers, yet without the “imposed” emotionally traumatic content of the memorial journey. The questionnaire covered psychiatrists’ and residents’ general psychiatric experience, experience with adolescent PTSD, experience with adolescents referred after the memorial journey, and experience with adolescents suffering from a mental disorder <italic>before</italic> going on the journey or on the yearly sleep-out trip.</p>
<p>The survey was conducted at the annual meeting of the Israel Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Association held in June 2011 in Acre, Israel. An explanation about the study was given to the attending psychiatrists and residents, who then elected to participate or not. Only those child and adolescent psychiatrists and residents practicing in Israel were included. The study was approved by the local institutional Ethics Review Board.</p>
<p>Because this is a descriptive study with relatively small numbers, statistical tests were not performed. Percentages are rounded to the nearest unity.</p>

<sec id="section6-1039856213491995" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>Fifty child and adolescent psychiatrists and residents in child and adolescent psychiatry participated in the survey. Some 37 (74%) were specialists and 13 (26%) were residents; 19 (38%) were male.</p>
<p>Out of the 50 psychiatrists and residents surveyed, 31 (62%) indicated that during the past year they had evaluated adolescents after a traumatic episode (of any cause). The total number of adolescents referred after a traumatic episode was reported to be more then 440. The most common diagnoses for these patients were PTSD (26%), adjustment disorder (25%), mood disorder (19%), anxiety disorder (19%) and psychotic disorder (6%).</p>
<p>About one-third (<italic>n</italic>=16, 32%) of the psychiatrists and residents stated that during the previous year they had evaluated adolescents for psychological consequences of the Holocaust memorial journey to Poland. The diagnosis in these cases included anxiety disorder (a total of 13 cases), adjustment disorder (8 cases), mood disorder (7 cases), psychosis (4 cases), and PTSD (1 case); 8 cases had other diagnoses. The psychiatrists and residents reported that in 23 cases, adolescents were referred for psychotherapy. Eight patients required pharmacotherapy and one required hospitalization. Specific risk factors in the adolescents evaluated during the previous year for consequences of the Holocaust memorial visit included: previous psychiatric crisis (15 cases), social difficulties (11 cases), specific traumatic event during the memorial visit (6 cases), and previous family crisis (6 cases).</p>
<p>Approximately three-quarters (<italic>n</italic>=38, 76%) of the psychiatrists and residents reported that during the past year they had at least one patient who had been on the memorial journey, and 45 (90%) suggested that they had at least one patient who had an opportunity to go on the journey but did not do so. The frequent reasons mentioned for not going to Poland were that the patient did not want to go (89%), the school opposed the patient’s trip (67%), financial reasons (52%), medical reasons (33%), and parental opposition (31%) (the percentages add up to more than 100% because for some students more than one reason applied).</p>
<p>About two-thirds (<italic>n</italic>=32, 64%) of the psychiatrists and residents indicated that in the past year they had been asked to see at least one adolescent for psychiatric consultation about going on the journey (i.e. before the journey took place).</p>
<p>Approximately one-third (<italic>n</italic>=16, 32%) of the psychiatrists and residents reported that they had evaluated adolescents for psychological consequences of the annual sleep-out school trip during the last year; 23 (46%) of the psychiatrists and residents reported having seen in the past year for psychiatric consultation at least one adolescent about going on a sleep-out school trip (i.e. before the school trip occurred).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The memorial journey to Poland is laden with purpose and profound meaning for Jewish people. It also constitutes an emotional stressor, yet this experience, shared by a large number of Israeli adolescents, as well as by adolescents from a large number of other countries,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1039856213491995">11</xref></sup> has been scarcely studied. Furthermore, there has been no research on the topic by mental health professionals. The present study was a pilot survey of active child and adolescent psychiatrists and residents in Israel, to begin to ascertain potential clinically relevant mental health consequences of the memorial journey, especially PTSD. There is increasing recognition that horrific events can trigger PTSD even if the sufferer was not present at the time of the original trauma.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1039856213491995">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1039856213491995"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1039856213491995">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>About a third of the psychiatrists and residents who participated in the survey reported that, over the previous year, they had evaluated patients suffering from mental health problems after the memorial journey. A central finding of our study is that the journey appeared to trigger a variety of mental health problems, including psychosis, but only a single case of PTSD. We have no data on the duration of these problems in the sample.</p>
<p>It is difficult to find an event closely comparable with the memorial journey to Poland. Sleep-out school trips are shorter and lack the heavy, historically driven emotional element of the memorial journey, yet for some adolescents are a significant stressor due to the distance from home and intensity of peer interactions. Sleep-out school trips occur annually over three high school years, and more adolescents participate in them in comparison with the memorial journey. It is thus noteworthy that this study found a similar number of referrals of adolescents in relation to the memorial journey compared with sleep-out trips, despite the lower frequency of memorial journeys, strengthening our assumption that the memorial journey is a more stressful experience.</p>
<p>The study is not without limitations. The data are retrospective, relying on accurate recall of survey participants. Further, the sample is relatively small and we do not know whether our findings represent the experiences of all practicing child and adolescent psychiatrists and residents in Israel. It is also likely that non-medical mental health professionals, who were not surveyed, were assessing and/or treating adolescents in relation to the memorial journey (as well as for other traumatic events).</p>
<p>In conclusion, the present study provides preliminary data that the memorial journey may lead to various mental health problems in teenagers, but seldom to PTSD. The findings will be relevant for clinicians, young people, parents, educators and policy makers, and also potentially relevant for stakeholders of memorial journeys of other traumatized groups. Evaluating “high risk” adolescents prior to their planned exposure to likely stressors (memorial journeys, sleep-out trips, etc) would seem prudent. It is important to emphasize that the support that <italic>all</italic> adolescents receive before, during and after exposure to anticipated stressors is likely to influence the psychological consequences.</p>
<p>As for further research, large, prospective studies that examine the impact of pre-planned stressors on the lives of adolescents are warranted. In relation to Holocaust memorial journeys, it would be salutary to ascertain similarities and differences between Israeli teenagers and teenagers from other countries, and also to compare teenagers having one or more grandparents as a Holocaust survivor with teenagers not having such a family history.</p>
