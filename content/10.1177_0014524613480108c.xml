<p>Two libraries, and two readers of Clement: Photios’ (c.820-893 AD) library included Clement’s <italic>Hypotyposeis</italic>, which is mostly lost to our modern collection of his works; Photios wrote to expose Clement’s doctrinal heresies, now Ashwin-Siejkowski critically reads Photios’ critique in order better to understand Clement’s theology. His novel and interesting project involves considering Photios’ exposition of eight heresies in Clement, taking into account the Byzantine scholar’s own presuppositions and anachronisms, and testing his critique against the evidence for Clement’s theology in his extant works. In this way, Ashwin-Siejkowski seeks to stir contemporary scholars out of their sense of familiarity with the Alexandrian theologian, and to reveal dimensions of Clement that are otherwise hidden to us. He depicts his project as a trial, where Photios is the prosecutor and Clement is in the dock. His own role is to defend Clement, not chiefly on the basis of the lost <italic>Hypotyposeis</italic> by which he is attacked, but from the works that survive. You and I are invited to sit in the jury.</p>
<p>The eight ‘erroneous doctrines’ found by Photios and examined by Ashwin-Siejkowski are the metaphysical doctrines that eternal matter and ideas exist (Chapter I) and that there were many worlds prior to Adam’s creation (Chapter II); the theological teaching concerning two Logoi of the Father (Chapter III); the creaturely nature of the Son of God (Chapter IV), and a docetic understanding of Christ (Chapter V); and the anthropological ideas of the transmigration of souls (Chapter VI); a shameful construal of the creation of Adam and Eve (Chapter VII), and the notion that angels sexually impregnated women (Chapter VIII).</p>
<p>This is an ambitious and (in the best sense) an imaginative book. Only a sure-footed interpreter who feels intimately acquainted not only with Clement’s writings but with his whole way of thinking could dare to attempt it. The method has some anomalies: it involves criticising Photios for insufficiently historical-critical sensitivity to Clement, but this is not quite fair to the Byzantine, whose scholarly tools were (as Ashwin-Siejkowski recognises) of a different source and ilk. It enters into an argument with someone whose eyes were largely fixed on lost portions of the elusive <italic>Hypotyposeis</italic>; the observation that Clement’s extant works display remarkable theological coherence provides only a partial and limited response to this difficulty. However, the approach has significant strengths. Ashwin-Siejkowski makes a close study of Photios’ exegetical approach and searches carefully for statements in Clement that are analogous to the perspectives Photios criticises. Together, these make it possible for him to show that Photios’ criticisms are not best explained as sound interpretations of works inaccessible to us, but are more likely to be misunderstandings derived from his way of reading Clement. The argument is nuanced and Ashwin-Siejkowski notes the places where he thinks the <italic>Hypotyposeis</italic> may indeed contribute significantly to Photios’ different perspective. His method for studying comments on Clement’s lost works is one of the significant contributions that his book makes.</p>
<p>The book is full of insights into post-Nicene exegesis and into the late antique reception history of Alexandria’s first great Christian scholar. Photios, however, is not Ashwin-Siejkowski’s primary interest; rather, he seeks to provide a fresh perspective on Clement, by asking questions of him that modern scholarship has left to one side. This freshness gives breath to every page of <italic>Clement of Alexandria on Trial</italic>. The Clement that it presents is primarily an exegete much more than a philosopher. He is deeply committed to apostolic teaching but brilliantly original in his interpretation and presentation of it. This picture is consistent with the figure of Clement presented in other modern scholarship, but the approach, questions and emphases are new and engaging.</p>
