<title>Background:</title>
<p>Displaced medial malleolus fractures require surgical repair because of the critical role the structure plays in normal joint function. Various approaches exist, but options are limited for small fragment fractures. This study compared repair with the Medial Malleolar Sled fixation system (Trimed, Inc, Valencia, CA) to lag screws in 2 modes of biomechanical loading in a cadaveric model.</p></sec>
<sec id="section2-1071100712466231">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>A Müller type B medial malleolus fracture was simulated on matched pairs of cadaveric lower extremities and repaired with the sled or 2 cancellous lag screws. Tibial distraction (tension, n = 10) or internal rotation (torsion, n = 11) was applied. Fragment movement was measured in the sagittal (tension and torsion) and transverse (torsion-only) planes. Fragment movement at 1 mm and 2 mm (clinical malunion) of gapping during tension and at 2, 4, 6, and 8 N-m during torsion was analyzed via paired <italic>t</italic> tests.</p></sec>
<sec id="section3-1071100712466231">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>In tension, the load at the 2-mm gap was statistically lower for screws (<italic>P</italic> = .026). Opening angle was statistically larger for the sled at the 1-mm (<italic>P</italic> = .0004) and 2-mm (<italic>P</italic> = .008) gap. In torsion, gapping was statistically lower for the sled (ranging from <italic>P</italic> = .0013 at 4 N-m to <italic>P</italic> = .0187 at 8 N-m). No differences were detected for opening angle or transverse plane movement.</p></sec>
<sec id="section4-1071100712466231">
<title>Conclusion:</title>
<p>The sled appeared stronger in tension and as effective as lag screws in torsion. The sled may be a viable option for fractures too small for 4.0- or 3.5-mm lag screws.</p></sec>
<sec id="section5-1071100712466231">
<title>Clinical Relevance:</title>
<p>The sled may be suitable in applications where a tension band would normally be considered and may provide stronger fixation in osteoporotic bone compared with lag screw fixation.</p></sec>

<p>The medial malleolus osteoligamentous complex is critical to maintain rotational stability of the ankle and biomechanical function. In addition, the articular congruency provided by the medial malleolus is important in maintaining ankle articulation and normal loads across the tibiotalar joint, thereby reducing the incidence of posttraumatic arthritis. Therefore, displaced medial malleolus fracture should be anatomically reduced and held with some form of fixation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1071100712466231">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>A variety of fracture patterns are seen with medial malleolus fractures, depending on the mechanism of failure. With rotational injuries of the ankle, medial malleolus fractures tend to initiate at the level of the plafond or slightly below and propagate medially in a transverse fashion (Müller type B) or superiorly in a slightly oblique fashion (Müller type C), exiting the medial wall of the tibia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1071100712466231">12</xref></sup> The more distal avulsion-type fractures of the medial malleolus are classified as Müller type A and the vertical shear fractures as Müller type D. The AO Foundation recommends tension band construct or lag screw fixation for Müller type B and C fractures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1071100712466231">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>Tension band fixation is the less commonly used technique. The bands are placed on the convex side of the fracture, which converts tensile forces into compressive forces on the articular side.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1071100712466231">10</xref></sup> This technique has been shown to be a biomechanically stronger and stiffer construct than lag screw fixation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1071100712466231">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1071100712466231">13</xref></sup> It is, therefore, recommended in osteoporotic bone.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1071100712466231">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1071100712466231">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1071100712466231">13</xref></sup> Also, it has better fixation with smaller fragments. However, one of the well-known complications with tension band wiring is prominent hardware that may require reoperation for removal.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1071100712466231">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1071100712466231">9</xref></sup> Ostrum and Litsky<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1071100712466231">13</xref></sup> reported a 15% complication rate related to painful hardware, and Georgiadis and White<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1071100712466231">7</xref></sup> reported 13.6% rate of removal of hardware due to pain and prominence. The twisted knots of the wire can be palpable under the skin and cause irritation, resulting in a second operation to remove hardware. This can become an issue particularly in the elderly patient due to wound healing problems.</p>
<p>Lag screws are the most popular means of medial malleolus fracture fixation. However, there are associated limitations and well-known complications. Lag screws cannot be used with fragments that are so small that they preclude placement of screws. In this situation, it is recommended to use the tension band construct, which allows use of the deltoid ligament to aid in reducing and maintaining the reduction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1071100712466231">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1071100712466231">8</xref></sup> There are also reports of issues with painful hardware.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1071100712466231">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1071100712466231">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1071100712466231">9</xref></sup> However, when screws are placed within the safe zone, hardware complications can be minimized.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1071100712466231">5</xref></sup> Another issue associated with unicortical lag screw fixation is possible poor screw purchase in the metaphyseal bone of the distal tibia. Lag screws must be long enough so that the threads pass beyond the fracture. This results in screw purchase in relatively less dense bone in the metaphyseal region.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1071100712466231">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1071100712466231">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>Other, more novel techniques have been described in the literature to create stronger/stiffer constructs without the complications of prominent hardware. These include suture anchors, tension band constructs with fiberwire loops, bicortical lag screw fixation, and fixation with bioresorbable screws. These constructs have been tested in small clinical populations without one particular method being consistently recommended over another.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1071100712466231">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1071100712466231">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1071100712466231">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1071100712466231">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>The purpose of this study was to analyze the biomechanical performance of a new fixation method for medial malleolus fractures, the Medial Malleolar Sled fixation system from Trimed, Inc (Valencia CA), and compare it with that of lag screw fixation. Lag screw fixation was chosen because it is the most commonly used method and current standard treatment for a majority of medial malleolus fractures. The new sled system is analogous to a tension band technique in that it incorporates 2 prongs inserted into the medial malleolus that are connected in an inverted U-fashion on top of the periosteum of the malleolus and secured with a specialized washer and 2 screws for fixation into the tibia. Both the sled and lag screw constructs were evaluated in longitudinal traction and axial torsion tests.</p>
<sec id="section6-1071100712466231" sec-type="materials|methods">
<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<p>Ten pairs of cadaver specimens in the tension evaluations (mean age 58.5 years; range, 28-76 years) and 11 pairs in the torsional evaluations (mean age 57.1; range, 43-71 years) were used in this study. Bone mineral density was measured in each distal tibia based on a lumbar spine protocol with no significant differences between matched sled and screw specimens in either the tension (mean 0.54 g/cm<sup>2</sup>; range, 0.40-0.80 g/cm<sup>2</sup>; <italic>P</italic> &gt; .43) or torsional evaluations (mean 0.60 g/cm<sup>2</sup>; range, 0.29-0.77 g/cm<sup>2</sup>; <italic>P</italic> &gt; .59). Specimens were dissected of all soft tissues except for the deltoid ligament and the ligaments and capsule around the talonavicular joint. The talonavicular joint was kept intact because of the tibionavicular ligament of the superficial deltoid. The tibiotalar joint was locked in neutral using two 3.2-mm dia. steel pins that were removed prior to testing. The tibia was cut 12 cm above the anterior distal tibia articular surface. The foot was disarticulated through the calcaneocuboid joint and the navicular-cuneiform joints. The posterior process of the calcaneus was removed to secure the construct for testing. A transverse cut across the medial malleolus at the level of the plafond was then made to simulate a Müller type B fracture using a thin (0.37-mm) oscillating saw blade to minimize bone loss. Fixation was performed using the sled or screw technique, alternating between left and right specimens to avoid side preference.</p>
<p>Insertion of the sled followed the product technique guide provided by the manufacturer. A fracture reduction clamp was temporarily used while 2 small (1.1-mm) K-wires were placed along the anterior and posterior borders of the medial malleolus to hold the reduction. It was important to leave enough space between these wires for subsequent sled insertion. Two additional, smaller K-wires (0.9 mm) were passed parallel to each other using the sled guide. A 2.0-mm cannulated drill bit was used to drill over the 0.9-mm K-wires into the fragment piece across the fracture site and just into the tibia, making sure not to drill too far into the tibia to ensure proper fixation of sled legs into the proximal fragment. This drilling was a critical step for subsequent insertion of the sled because the diameter of the K-wires was significantly smaller than the diameter of the prongs on the sled. Without drilling, fracture of the fragment piece could occur with insertion of the sled. The sled was then inserted over the K-wires. The provided drill guide was applied to the fracture construct for placement of the 2 screws in the proximal tibia. Screws were placed on a specialized washer over the sled to secure it to the tibia. Care was taken not to violate the tibial articular surface when placing these screws. During fixation, adequate alignment was confirmed with fluoroscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1071100712466231">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<p>The technique for insertion of lag screws was based on AO principles.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1071100712466231">8</xref></sup> As with the sled insertion, a fracture reduction clamp was used to maintain anatomic reduction. Then a K-wire was placed through the anterior colliculus with the wire parallel to the medial articular surface in an anteroposterior (AP) view and parallel to the tibialis anterior cortex on a lateral view. The posterior K-wire was placed through the posterior colliculus parallel to the anterior K-wire but maintained within the “safe zone.” Screw paths were drilled with a 2.9-mm cannulated drill bit. Then, 4.0-mm cannulated, partially threaded, titanium cancellous lag screws (DePuy, Inc, Warsaw IN) were placed to hold the fixation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1071100712466231">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

<p>In preparation for experimental testing, the hindfoot and proximal tibia of each specimen were secured into a PVC pipe tubing with 3.2-mm dia. steel pins and PMMA (polymethylmethacrylate). Care was taken to protect the deltoid ligament from the PMMA during curing. The tibia was positioned within the center of the PVC pipe to align with the center of the plafond and the loading axis of the materials testing equipment. This also induced rotation around the center of the tibiotalar joint for torsional tests.</p>
<p>The specimens were then secured in an Instron 1321 servohydraulic materials testing machine (Instron Corp, Norwood, MA), retrofitted with MTS TestStarII control and data acquisition system (MTS Systems Corp, Eden Prairie, MN) so that the hindfoot remained stationary and movement occurred via an applied displacement rate (or rotation in the case of torsion) on the tibia. To directly measure relative fragment movement, 2 pairs of black beads were secured immediately above and below the fracture site. Just prior to testing, but after specimens had been secured in the Instron, the 2 pins holding the tibiotalar joint in neutral flexion were removed. During experimental testing, a video camera (Panasonic PV-GS35 Digital Palmcorder; Panasonic Corporation of North America, Secaucus, NJ) monitored bead and thus fragment movement in the sagittal plane. For tensile experiments, the camera was mounted approximately 28 cm from the fracture surface. Distraction of the tibia from the hindfoot occurred at 1 mm/s until failure. For torsional experiments, the tibia was internally rotated at 1 degree/s relative to the hindfoot, simulating an external rotation of the foot relative to tibia, until failure. Because of potential for rotational movement of the fragment in the transverse plane during torsional experiments, the camera was directly mounted to the Instron actuator, which rotated with the tibia, approximately 10 cm from the fracture surface. A mirror was secured above the fracture site on the tibia at a 45-degree angle to simultaneously capture movement in both the sagittal and transverse planes in the same video images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1071100712466231">Figure 3</xref>).</p>

<p>Video recordings were processed in NIH Image J software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) to track positional coordinates of distal fragment and tibial beads. Using geometric relations, fragment movement relative to the tibia was calculated. For tension experiments, the load to achieve 1 mm and 2 mm of average fragment distraction (gapping) in the sagittal plane was measured as well as the simultaneous fragment opening angle. For torsional experiments, fragment gapping and opening angle were calculated from sagittal plane images at 2, 4, 6, and 8 N-m of torque. Circumferential and medial/lateral movements of the fragment relative to the tibia were determined from the transverse plane images.</p>

There was a statistically significant difference, however, in the average load to achieve 2 mm of gapping (<italic>P</italic> = .026). Fragment opening angle at 1 mm and 2 mm of gapping revealed greater anterior vs posterior gapping at the fracture site during load application (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1071100712466231">Figure 5</xref>).

<p>Testing proceeded until ultimate failure, which was defined as a decrease in the measured force. Modes of failure were fairly consistent in the tension studies with some degree of deltoid attenuation and loss of fixation. In specimens fixed with lag screws, initial failure occurred via pullout of screws from the tibia and then proceeded to catastrophic failure, which occurred in most specimens with fracture of the fragment. In specimens fixed with the sled construct, 2 had failure via inferior pullout of the 2 screws placed in the tibial metaphysis, and the other 7 had fracture through the fragment at the prong insertion sites. In one pair, the deltoid tore at ultimate failure with both the screw fixation and sled construct still intact.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1071100712466231">
<title>Torsion Experiments</title>
<p>Analysis of torsional data focused on the displacement of the fracture fragment relative to the tibia at torque values of 2, 4, 6, and 8 N-m. All 22 specimens remained intact at 2 N-m of torque. Some of the specimens underwent ultimate failure with high torque values. Twenty-one specimens reached 4 N-m, 17 reached 6 N-m, and 11 reached 8 N-m.</p>
<p>In an analysis of sagittal plane movement, fragment gapping for the sled was statistically lower than for the screws at each torque level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1071100712466231">Figure 6</xref>), although the gap overall was small, less than 2 mm. Although not statistically significant, measurement of fragment opening angle revealed a trend for more anterior gapping of the fragment with screws vs the sled construct (ranging from <italic>P</italic> = .11 at 2 N-m to <italic>P</italic> = .52 at 8 N-m) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1071100712466231">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<p>With analysis of transverse images, rotational stability of the construct was quantified by 2 movements of the fracture fragment relative to the tibia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1071100712466231">Figure 3</xref>)—circumferential movement along the arc of rotation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1071100712466231">Figure 7</xref>) and medial/lateral displacement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1071100712466231">Figure 8</xref>). There was no statistical difference between construct types in circumferential movement, although there was a trend for more anteriorly directed movement (ranging from <italic>P</italic> = .11 at 2 N-m to <italic>P</italic> = .52 at 8 N-m). No statistical difference was found in medial/lateral movement of the fragment relative to the tibia between the 2 groups, although a trend existed for the sled to displace more medially than the screw constructs (ranging from <italic>P</italic> = .06 at 4 N-m to <italic>P</italic> = .34 at 8 N-m).</p>

<p>As with the tension studies, testing proceeded until failure. Failure of the sled specimens in torsion was not quite as uniform as in the tension studies. Failure occurred with various combinations of deltoid attenuation, implant failure, and fracture of the distal fragment. Modes of failure included loosening of screws from metaphyseal tibial bone in 7 lag screw specimens, loosening of metaphyseal cancellous screws in 2 of the sled specimens, and bending of the prongs in 4 specimens. Fracture of the distal fragment in the screw fixation group generally occurred with fracture of the posterior screw through the lateral wall of the medial malleolus. Fracture in the sled group occurred at prong insertion sites. Four specimens in the sled group had fractures through the distal fragment piece and 9 in the lag screw group. One pair had complete failure of the deltoid ligament for both screw and sled construct prior to any failure of fixation.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The goal of bony fracture fixation is to efficiently achieve and maintain anatomic alignment to permit bone healing and restore function. To evaluate different surgical treatments, the types of loads the fixation would experience during healing should be considered. In this study, 2 different loading scenarios were implemented for medial malleolar fractures. Tensile force has been routinely simulated in the literature to assess techniques for medial malleolar fractures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1071100712466231">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1071100712466231">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1071100712466231">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1071100712466231">18</xref></sup> Clinically, tension would occur at the fracture site with a pronation-type force across the ankle and from the tensile forces created by the deltoid ligament. The importance of this loading is also evidenced by fixation failure often being by pullout. It is also a common injury mechanism via pronation-abduction. Torsional loading is not a commonly performed loading scenario to assess medial malleolar fracture fixation. It was added to this study as supination/external rotation is a common injury mechanism and thus a potential stressor to such fixed fractures.</p>
<p>The magnitude of the forces experienced by a fracture fixation in the clinical setting is not known, and thus criteria were selected to compare techniques, with the underlying premise that stronger fixation would permit better healing. During tensile tests, the load achieved at 1 to 2 mm of gapping was selected as the level at which malunion would be of concern. It is also a common limit in the literature to compare medial malleolar constructs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1071100712466231">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1071100712466231">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1071100712466231">18</xref></sup> During torsional tests, gapping was not the only fragment movement observed, and thus specific torque levels achieved by the constructs were selected to assess fragment motion and thus compare constructs.</p>
<p>Under tensile loads, the higher loads required to reach 2 mm of gapping with the sled construct suggests that the sled is a stronger construct in this mode of loading. This may partially be explained by the theory on how the sled construct functions. The sled construct was intended to function in a similar fashion as a tension band by converting tensile forces into compression.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1071100712466231">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1071100712466231">16</xref></sup> In this context, the current study is consistent with previous studies demonstrating that tension band constructs are stronger than lag screws under tensile loads.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1071100712466231">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1071100712466231">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1071100712466231">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1071100712466231">13</xref></sup> The opening angle, however, was larger with the sled construct. This was likely because the screw heads were secure against the medial malleolus cortex while the precontoured angle of the sled prongs did not necessarily sit flush against this cortex, resulting in uneven force distribution. However, the difference between construct types was only on the order of 2 to 3 degrees.</p>
<p>Under torsional loads, a combination of tensile and shear stresses exists across the fracture site. A tensile load is generated in the deltoid as the foot is externally rotated relative to the tibia. This is due to the distraction of the tibiotalar joint as the plafond rotates over the articular surface. In addition, the deltoid ligament pulls the medial malleolar fragment anteriorly and laterally, causing a shear load at the fracture surface. The standard tension band construct, as with K-wires and 18- or 20-gauge wires, is not ideal to withstand bending and shear loads. The 2 K-wires that traverse the fracture site provide some resistance to shear; however, they are of small diameter compared with lag screws, and bending resistance is proportional to the diameter to the fourth power. The prongs of the sled are of larger diameter than the typical K-wire in tension band constructs, providing more bending resistance. Also, as a shear load is applied to the traditional tension band construct, it can rotate around its one point of fixation proximally, which is generally a screw applied to the metaphysis of the tibia like the hands of a clock moving around the face. The sled construct provides a washer and 2 points of fixation proximally via 2 screws, which may provide additional strength and stiffness under shear loads. The data, however, for torsional performance did not demonstrate a clear difference between sled construct and lag screw fixation. Under torsional loads, the sled construct appears equal to lag screw fixation with regard to rotational stability. The sled construct did show significantly less gapping in the sagittal plane in the torsional studies compared with lag screws, indicating again that it is a stronger construct in resisting tensile loads.</p>
<p>As mentioned previously, the most common method for medial malleolus fracture fixation is with unicortical lag screws, although the technique does have shortcomings. It is not ideal for small avulsion-type fractures and relies on screw purchase in the metaphyseal bone of the distal tibia. Hardware complications can result if screws are not placed within the safe zone.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1071100712466231">5</xref></sup> Given that the sled construct appears to be stronger in tension and as effective as lag screws in torsional stresses for the type B avulsion fractures studied here, it may be a viable option for avulsion-type fractures that are too small for 4.0- or 3.5-mm lag screws and for which tension band wiring would be indicated as the sled has features that simulate tension band fixation. The complications due to prominent hardware that occur with the typical K-wires used in tension band constructs may be overcome with the sled. The sled has a lower profile, protruding approximately 2.2 mm from the tibial cortex, whereas the traditional tension band construct is approximately 2.8 to 3 mm from the cortex of the medial tibia with an 18-gauge wire. Although the sled construct does have a lower profile, it is not known if this results clinically in lower complications due to prominent hardware. In vivo clinical studies would need to be done to make this assessment. In addition, studies looking at tension band constructs have made recommendations for its use in osteoporotic bone based on the findings that it is a stronger and stiffer construct under tensile loads compared with lag screw fixation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1071100712466231">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1071100712466231">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1071100712466231">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1071100712466231">13</xref></sup> Similarly, the sled construct does seem to be stronger under tension than lag screws in this study and may be an option in osteoporotic bone as fixation with the sled in the lowest bone quality failed by screws pulling out of cortical bone on the tibia or fracturing the fragment. With the dependence of lag screw fixation on screw purchase in the metaphyseal bone of the distal tibia, the common initiation of failure with this fixation via screw pullout from the tibia is detrimentally impacted by osteoporotic bone. The bone mineral density of the specimens in this study was within the osteoporotic range.</p>
<p>There are limitations to the study. Inherent in many cadaveric studies is the issue with variations in bone quality. In an attempt to limit the effects of variation, the study was designed around a paired <italic>t</italic> test statistical analysis. In addition, cadaveric bone cannot replicate living bone as it heals under physiologic stress. The study looked at behavior of constructs with a one-time load to catastrophic failure and did not look at fatigue characteristics. Finally, the fracture, simulated as a straight transverse plane at the level of the plafond, would represent a less stable fracture than might occur clinically with interdigitating fragments. However, given the encouraging biomechanical findings in this study, it would be useful to address in vivo results of the sled construct.</p>
