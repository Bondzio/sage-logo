<p>I came to Timothy Brennan’s extraordinary book like the long-time jazz-head that I am, and, true to its subject, reading it was like listening and grooving hard to a long, long, serpentine solo by a Coltrane or a Dolphy, sweeping through worlds of past- and present-time music like the sound of an ever-divergent horn.</p>
<p>Brennan moves between Cuban ‘son’ and ‘habanera’, West Coast and East Coast rap, Colombian punk rock, the huge mythic richness of Ishmael Reed’s novel <italic>Mumbo Jumbo</italic>, the Nigerian high life of Fela Kuti, through a host of tributaries of ‘the chaotic flow of influences’ in so-called popular music, to a final coda on the ‘imperial jazz’ of the Caribbean Basin, which found its cosmopolitan crucible in New Orleans. And it is a rare journey, travelled with both keen insight and eloquent aplomb, a work that opens many doors of contemporary culture and has the critical nous to expose the commercial and mendacious origins of much else that passes as ‘popular music’.</p>
<p>One of Brennan’s prime arguments is that the great people’s musics of the Americas, be they jazz, salsa, motown or rap, have been corralled and proclaimed as fundamentally ‘Usonian’ by US critics eager to exercise their cultural chauvinism. Brennan argues that they are not simply and narrowly ‘American’ at all, but rooted in the Afro-Latin notes, infectious and multiterritorial, sounding through the Caribbean and the other Americas. They found their human entry points through the music of the millions of Cubans, Mexicans, Haitians, Puerto Ricans and other Caribbean and Latin American peoples who were arrivants in the US, particularly during a historical epoch in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, when US imperial aggression was at its apex. He finds the sounds and the musical genius of the Caribbean at the very provenances of jazz, with its originators and pioneer performers from across the entire Caribbean Basin – a pattern that has, of course, continued right through the century’s narrative of jazz, from Ellington’s greatest and earliest trombone section, including Jamaican Garveyites ‘Tricky Sam’ Nanton and Puerto Rican Juan Tizol, which the Duke declared reflected the ‘West Indian influence’ within the US, to the provenances of Sonny Rollins in the Virgin Islands, Eric Dolphy in Panama and the great bassist and revolutionary minstrel Charles Mingus, born on the Mexican frontier in Nogales, Arizona.</p>
<p>Brennan puts the musical truth directly and straight out of the ‘world music’ stacks of HMV or other record stores, where all sounds that are not American or British are branded as ‘the rest’ by the dubious categorising that puts Bulgarian folk music and the Trio Los Paraguayos next to Miriam Makeba’s click songs and the genius of Ravi Shankar. ‘The discourses of pleasure are political’, he asserts. ‘On the one hand, peripheral countries are popularly depicted not only in the media but in many scholarly studies, in either the drab tones of destitute barrios or in the carnivalesque colors of mayhem, starvation and war.’</p>
<p>In his section on Nicaragua during the 1980s, where Brennan explores the music of the Sandinista revolution, he shows how key figures, such as the poet and priest Ernesto Cardenal and head of the National Recording Studios Luis Enrique Mejia Godoy, had a powerfully libertarian attitude to the migration of musical genres and wished that more US musical forms, embodied in the work of artistes like Stevie Wonder and Aretha Franklin, could gain more currency within Nicaragua – demonstrating that the movement of sounds in and out of the formation of American musics crossed the US frontiers in both directions to potent sonic and cultural effect. He shows how Godoy’s dictum, that music’s need is not only to please the consciousness, but also to ‘organise the heart’, led directly to the wide popularity of the album <italic>Guitarra Armada</italic>, continually broadcast over the airwaves of Radio Sandino in 1978, with lyrics that helped to train the defenders of the revolution in weapons and explosives against the aerial bombing and attacks by the US-supported Somozista counter-revolutionary forces.</p>
<p><italic>Secular Devotion</italic>’s words travel many a mile in the tradition of the Afro-Latin troubadours and musical griots, and there is many an insight and inspired chorus along the way.</p>
