<abstract>
<p>A revised version of the Fennema-Sherman Mathematics Anxiety Scale (FSMAS-R) was assessed for its factor structure, reliability, and validity with 1,601 pretertiary students. Factor analyses supported a two-factor model. The construct validity of the FSMAS-R was demonstrated through intercorrelations between subscales and correlations with self-confidence and mathematics achievement test scores.</p>

<p>Affective factors have been reported to play a critical role in mathematics education in various studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0748175612459198">Ma &amp; Kishor, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0748175612459198">McLeod, 1994</xref>). Among these affective factors, mathematics anxiety is one of the most widely researched (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0748175612459198">McLeod, 1992</xref>). Mathematics anxiety is reported to correlate robustly with mathematics achievement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0748175612459198">Hembree, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0748175612459198">Ma, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0748175612459198">Richardson &amp; Suinn, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0748175612459198">Wigfield &amp; Meece, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0748175612459198">Zakaria &amp; Nordin, 2008</xref>) and with mathematics avoidance. Students’ choices to pursue advanced mathematics courses or mathematics-related careers are affected by these two constructs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0748175612459198">Ashcraft, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0748175612459198">Chipman, Krantz, &amp; Silver, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0748175612459198">Schwarzer, Seipp, &amp; Schwarzer, 1989</xref>). Researchers (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0748175612459198">Faust, Ashcraft, &amp; Fleck, 1996</xref>) are thus interested to explore programs that have the potential to reduce mathematics anxiety. These studies require theoretically and methodologically sound instruments that measure mathematics anxiety. Few such instruments, however, are available. The aim of this study was thus to modify and assess the psychometric properties of an existing mathematics anxiety scale for use in mathematics education research.</p>
<p>The Fennema-Sherman Mathematics Anxiety Scale (FSMAS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0748175612459198">Fennema &amp; Sherman, 1976</xref>) and the Mathematics Anxiety Rating Scale (MARS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0748175612459198">Richardson &amp; Suinn, 1972</xref>) are the two most commonly used mathematics anxiety scales in research studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0748175612459198">Evans, 2001</xref>). Although both scales measure mathematics anxiety, the FSMAS was designed to measure mathematics anxiety in classrooms, whereas the MARS was designed to measure general anxiety toward mathematics and consists of items that are not related to school mathematics. The FSMAS was chosen as the foundation instrument in this study due to its relevance to mathematics education.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0748175612459198">Fennema and Sherman (1976)</xref> designed the FSMAS to measure mathematics anxiety in high school students, and they defined mathematics anxiety as “feelings of anxiety, dread, nervousness, and associated bodily symptoms related to doing mathematics. The dimension ranges from feeling at ease to feeling distinct anxiety” (p. 326). Some studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0748175612459198">Evans, 2001</xref>) questioned the accuracy of the FSMAS in measuring mathematics anxiety due to the lack of research conducted to assess its psychometric properties. However, strong psychometric properties were reported for a modified version for college students by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0748175612459198">Betz (1978)</xref>. This modified version consists of 10 items from the original 12 FSMAS items, some of which have been reworded. Out of these 10 items, 5 are positively worded and 5 are negatively worded. A split-half reliability coefficient of .92 was reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0748175612459198">Betz, 1978</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0748175612459198">Dew, Galassi, and Galassi (1983)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0748175612459198">Pajares and Kranzler (1995)</xref> reported Cronbach’s α of .72 and .90 on college and high school samples, respectively. Test–retest reliability of .87 was reported over a 2-week period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0748175612459198">Dew et al., 1983</xref>). Satisfactory correlations of about .70 with other mathematics anxiety scales, such as the 98-item MARS, were also reported by several studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0748175612459198">Cooper &amp; Robinson, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0748175612459198">Dew et al., 1983</xref>).</p>
<p>The factor structure of the modified FSMAS by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0748175612459198">Betz (1978)</xref>, however, was not as well established. Exploratory factor analyses (EFAs) conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0748175612459198">Pajares and Urdan (1996)</xref> on separate middle school, high school, and college samples showed that the items loaded on two factors, with one item, “It wouldn’t bother me at all to take more mathematics classes,” failing to load on either factor, or loading weakly on either factor across the three samples. The remaining items separated into positively and negatively worded items, except for one item, “I get really uptight during mathematics tests.” This item was an adaptation of an original FSMAS item, “A mathematics test would scare me.” The modified item was very similar to the negatively worded version of another FSMAS item, “I almost never get uptight while taking mathematics tests.” Hence, future studies may consider using the original item instead.</p>
<p>Recognizing the need to further validate the factor structure of the modified FSMAS, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0748175612459198">Bai, Wang, Pan, and Frey (2009)</xref> conducted an EFA, which also separated the positively and negatively worded items into two factors. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0748175612459198">Bai et al. (2009)</xref>, however, attempted to improve on the modified FSMAS by adding new items and rewording some items. This resulted in some items that are very similar to items in instruments that measure other domains of mathematics affect. For instance, one of the items in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0748175612459198">Bai et al.’s (2009)</xref> scale, “I enjoy learning with mathematics,” is very similar to items in several scales that measure enjoyment of mathematics (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0748175612459198">Aiken, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0748175612459198">Tapia &amp; Marsh, 2004</xref>). Since <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0748175612459198">Betz’s (1978)</xref> version of the FSMAS was changed quite drastically in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0748175612459198">Bai et al.’s (2009)</xref> study, results of the latter study cannot be considered an assessment of the factor structure of the modified FSMAS. Hence, the factor structure of this scale remained unclear, and the primary aim of this study was to assess the factor structure of this scale.</p>
<p>This study included two original FSMAS items, which were removed from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0748175612459198">Betz’s (1978)</xref> version of the scale without substantial justifications, back into the scale. In addition, as suggested above, the modified item, “I get really uptight during mathematics tests,” was changed back to its parent item, “A mathematics test would scare me.” This revised version of the FSMAS was termed the <italic>Fennema-Sherman Mathematics Anxiety Scale–Revised</italic> (FSMAS-R). Other than investigating the factor structure of the FSMAS-R, this study also aimed to assess the psychometric properties of the instrument (in the original English language) when used with a predominantly Chinese sample from Singapore at the pretertiary level by (a) estimating the internal consistency of each subscale; (b) investigating relationships between scores on its subscales, and scores from measures of theoretically related constructs (self-confidence in mathematics and mathematics achievement); and (c) evaluating its test–retest reliability.</p>
<sec id="section1-0748175612459198" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>This study was conducted in three phases. Phase 1 (<italic>n</italic> = 12) was a pilot study that preliminarily assessed the suitability of the items in the FSMAS-R for the participants of this study. Phase 2 (<italic>n</italic> = 1,601) is the main study that used data from a predominantly Chinese sample from Singapore to assess the instrument’s factor structure, internal consistencies, and correlations between mathematics anxiety and theoretically related constructs. Finally, Phase 3 (<italic>n</italic> = 208) used data from another predominantly Chinese sample from Singapore to confirm the factor structure of the instrument and to assess its test–retest reliability over a 1-month period. All items were randomly sequenced prior to administration in all three phases.</p>
<sec id="section2-0748175612459198">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>All participants were mathematics students enrolled in 6 out of the 21 pretertiary institutions in Singapore. All pretertiary institutions in Singapore prepare students for the General Certificate of Education Advanced Level (GCE “A” level) Mathematics Higher 2 (Syllabus 9740) examination administered by the University of Cambridge–London Examination Syndicate (UCLES) in the English language. In terms of academic achievement at a national mathematics examination conducted annually, these six institutions consisted of two top, two average, and two bottom institutions. For the past 5 years, the top, average, and bottom institutions were respectively ranked top five, between 8th and 13th, and bottom five at the annual national mathematics examination.</p>
<p>Phase 1 was composed of five Chinese males (41.7%) and seven Chinese females (58.3%) with a mean age of 17.9 years. The Phase 2 sample was composed of 676 males (42.2%), 788 females (49.2%), and 137 participants (8.6%) who did not indicate their gender, with a mean age of 17.8 years. Although participants were predominantly Chinese (<italic>n</italic> = 1,583; 98.9%), 10 (0.6%) were Indians and 8 (0.5%) were Malays. The Phase 3 sample was composed of 107 males (51.4%) and 101 females (48.6%), with a mean age of 17.7 years. Participants were again predominantly Chinese (<italic>n</italic> = 207; 99.5%) with only one Indian (0.5%).</p>

<sec id="section3-0748175612459198">
<title>Instruments Used for Validation of the FSMAS-R</title>
<p>To validate the FSMAS-R for the participants of this study, self-confidence in mathematics and mathematics achievement were, respectively, measured with the short form of the Attitudes Toward Mathematics Inventory Self-Confidence Subscale (short ATMI-SC; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0748175612459198">Lim &amp; Chapman, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0748175612459198">Tapia &amp; Marsh, 2004</xref>) and a pen-and-paper mathematics test.</p>
<sec id="section4-0748175612459198">
<title>Self-confidence in mathematics</title>
<p>The short ATMI-SC comprises five items, which are measured on a 5-point Likert-type scale with response options ranging from <italic>strongly disagree</italic> to <italic>strongly agree</italic>. It measures students’ “confidence and self-concept of (their) performance in mathematics” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0748175612459198">Tapia &amp; Marsh, 2004</xref>, p. 17). Using data collected from 1,601 pretertiary students in Singapore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0748175612459198">Lim and Chapman (2012)</xref> reported that the short ATMI-SC exhibited good overall internal consistencies (α = .90) and satisfactory test–retest reliability over a 1-month period (<italic>r</italic>
<sub><italic>xx</italic><italic>′</italic></sub> = .81, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). In addition, correlation analyses between the short ATMI-SC and other subscales on the short form of the ATMI (measuring enjoyment toward mathematics, motivation to do mathematics, and value of mathematics), and correlation analyses between the short ATMI-SC and other theoretically related constructs such as mathematics achievement test scores, showed that the short ATMI-SC was suitable for use with pretertiary students in Singapore to measure self-confidence in mathematics.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0748175612459198">
<title>Mathematics achievement</title>
<p>An expert panel was used to assess the content validity of the 3-hour pen-and-paper mathematics achievement test. Specifically, a panel of five teachers, each with at least 5 years of mathematics teaching experience in a local pretertiary institution, set the test items and marking schemes, which were similar to past years’ GCE “A” level mathematics questions and marking schemes, respectively. Additionally, a setter of the GCE “A” level mathematics paper from UCLES was invited to review the test items and marking schemes and to provide feedback on their validity. Test scripts were marked using the same marking scheme developed by the five teachers. To ensure scorer reliability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0748175612459198">Houser, 1998</xref>), each test item was marked by the same teacher for all scripts. Additionally, 10% of the scripts were randomly chosen and evaluated again by another two senior teachers with at least 10 years of mathematics teaching experience at the pretertiary level. Interrater reliability between the five main markers and the two senior teachers ranged from .98 to 1.00.</p>
</sec>

<sec id="section6-0748175612459198">
<title>Procedures</title>
<p>In Phase 1, 12 participants responded to the FSMAS-R. They were also asked to respond to open-ended questions, adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0748175612459198">Bell (1987)</xref>, on whether the instructions and items were clear, and how the scale could be improved. Besides obtaining written responses to these open-ended questions, a discussion based on the same questions was held with every participant to solicit feedback that participants might otherwise fail to report from the written survey. Results from this pilot phase indicated that the instructions and items in the FSMAS-R were clear and appropriate. The participants in Phase 1 took at most 10 minutes to complete the FSMAS-R.</p>
<p>In Phase 2, the FSMAS-R was administered to 1,618 participants by nine teachers in classroom or lecture settings. All participating teachers attended a briefing before they administered the survey. Participants were told explicitly that the results of the survey would not affect their school grades in any way and that they could choose to remain anonymous or opt out of the survey. Screening for missing data was conducted prior to the data analysis. Any completed FSMAS-R form with missing item responses was excluded from the final data pool. This reduced the initial sample of 1,618 participants to 1,601.</p>
<p>The 1,601 participants were then randomly split (stratifying for gender and school) into two groups. This resulted in 338 males, 394 females, and 68 students with unknown gender in Subsample 1 (<italic>n</italic> = 800) and 338 males, 394 females, and 69 students with unknown gender in Subsample 2 (<italic>n</italic> = 801). EFA was conducted on data from one subsample, followed by confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) on the other subsample to determine the factor structure of the FSMAS-R when it was used with pretertiary students in Singapore. Some redundant items were then removed using the classical item analysis approach to obtain the final version of the FSMAS-R (final FSMAS-R).</p>
<p>Additionally, the short ATMI-SC was administered in Phase 2 to all participants, and codes were used to trace participants’ mathematics achievement test scores. The 1,601 participants who completed all items in the FSMAS-R also completed all items in the short ATMI-SC. However, a further reduction to 1,027 participants occurred in matching the FSMAS-R and achievement test scores. Thus, all analyses that relied on achievement scores relied on this smaller subsample. The data collected were then used to investigate correlations between scores on the final FSMAS-R subscales and with scores on the short ATMI-SC and mathematics achievement test. Data collected in this phase were also used to assess the interconsistencies of the final FSMAS-R subscales.</p>
<p>In Phase 3, the final FSMAS-R was administered twice over a 1-month period to assess test–retest reliability. In the first and second administrations of the final FSMAS-R, respectively, 254 and 220 participants completed all items in the survey forms. After matching participants who completed all items in both administrations, data from 208 survey forms were used. In addition, data collected from the first administration of the final FSMAS-R were used to cross-validate the factor structure obtained earlier in Phase 2 using a CFA. All participants were able to complete the final FSMAS-R within 8 minutes.</p>

<title>Factor Structure and Internal Consistency of the FSMAS-R</title>
<p>All responses to negatively worded statements were reversed prior to analysis of data. SPSS 19 and LISREL 8.71 were used to conduct the EFA and CFAs, respectively. Prior to conducting these analyses, screening tests for conformity to underlying EFA and CFA assumptions were conducted. These tests generally produced satisfactory results. Mahalanobis distances and <italic>z</italic> scores (using a conservative α level owing to the large sample size) indicated no notable univariate or multivariate outliers within the data set. There was also no evidence of multicollinearity among all the item scores. Skewness and kurtosis coefficients were then examined to detect any departures from normality in the item distributions. This analysis indicated significant levels of skew across many items within the scale. Consequently, the PRELIS Normal Scores module was used to improve the score distributions before conducting the factor analyses. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0748175612459198">Table 1</xref> contains item-level descriptive statistics for data collected from both subsamples in Phase 2.

<title>EFA on Phase 2 Subsample 1 data</title>
<p>Maximum likelihood estimation was used in the initial extraction of factors from responses to the 12 items. As the subscales were expected to correlate, an oblique (promax) rotation that permits correlation among factors was used. Factor loadings and communalities are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0748175612459198">Table 3</xref> (loadings drawn from the pattern matrix). Based on Kaiser’s criterion and Cattell’s scree test, the items separated into two factors, which together accounted for 63.63% of the total score variance. Except for Item 2, the positively worded items (Item 1 and Items 3-6) separated from the negatively worded items (Items 7-12). The two resulting factors were termed FS-EASE and FS-ANX, respectively.</p>

<title>CFA on Phase 2 Subsample 2 data</title>
<p>A CFA was then performed on Subsample 2 data to determine whether the two-factor structure obtained with Subsample 1 was robust. As all the items were designed to measure only one factor in the original FSMAS, a one-factor model was also tested. However, the EFA performed in this study and results of past studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0748175612459198">Pajares &amp; Urdan, 1996</xref>) suggested a two-factor loading and unclear loading by Item 2. Hence, four alternative models were tested: (a) a one-factor model containing all the 12 items; (b) a two-factor model, where Item 2 loaded on FS-EASE; (c) a two-factor model, where Item 2 loaded on FS-ANX; and (d) a two-factor model, where Item 2 was removed from the scale.</p>
<p>Fit indices for each factor model are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0748175612459198">Table 4</xref>. Several indices were used to assess model fit. As the chi-squared statistic (χ<sup>2</sup>) is strongly dependent on sample size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0748175612459198">Hu &amp; Bentler, 1995</xref>), χ<sup>2</sup>/<italic>df</italic> ratios instead of probability values are presented for each model. In general, χ<sup>2</sup>/<italic>df</italic> ratios ranging from two to five are considered to represent adequate model fit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0748175612459198">Byrne, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0748175612459198">Tanaka, 1993</xref>). As the various models subjected to CFA were nested designs, the chi-squared change (Δχ<sup>2</sup>) statistic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0748175612459198">Hu &amp; Bentler, 1995</xref>) was used to test for differences in fit between the models. Two absolute fit indices (the standardized root mean residual [SRMR] and the goodness-of-fit index [GFI]) and two incremental fit indices (the nonnormed fit index [NNFI] and the comparative fit index [CFI]) are also presented. Various authors (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0748175612459198">Browne &amp; Cudeck, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0748175612459198">Byrne, 1989</xref>) suggested that good model fit is indicated by indices of less than .08 for the SRMR, and greater than .90 for the GFI, NNFI, and CFI.</p>

<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0748175612459198">Table 4</xref>, all the χ<sup>2</sup> values were significant due to the large sample size. All the two-factor models produced significantly better fit indices than the one-factor model, with acceptable SRMR, GFI, NNFI, and CFI indices. However, Item 2 has a factor loading of only .23 and .15 in the second and third models, respectively. Hence, the last model, where Item 2 was removed, was preferred. However, the χ<sup>2</sup>/<italic>df</italic> ratio was outside the recommended range for this model. Subsequently, addition of error covariances and removal of items using the classical item analysis approach were used to improve the χ<sup>2</sup>/<italic>df</italic> ratio.</p>
<p>Error covariances were added after referring to modification indices. In removing items using the classical item analysis approach, three criteria were used: (a) item loadings, (b) improvement in fit indices, and (c) internal consistencies. Specifically, items that had low factor loadings or high cross-factor loadings were shortlisted and removed one by one. Fit indices and internal consistencies were examined after the removal of each item. The removed item was returned to the scale, if fit indices worsened or internal consistencies fell outside the recommended range of .70 to .91 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0748175612459198">Nunnally &amp; Bernstein, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>Consequently, the two models with the best fit indices after modification were (a) Items 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6 loading on FS-EASE; and Items 7, 8, 9, 10, and 12 loading on FS-ANX; with an added error covariance between Items 4 and 5 (i.e., remove Items 2 and 11); and (b) Items 1, 3, 5, and 6 loading on FS-EASE; and Items 7, 8, 9, 10, and 12 loading on FS-ANX (i.e., remove Items 2, 4, and 11). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0748175612459198">Table 5</xref> presents the fit indices and internal consistency values for these two models.</p>

<title>Correlations Between Subscales and With Theoretically Related Constructs</title>
<p>The next aim of this study was to investigate the pattern of correlations between the final FSMAS-R subscales and theoretically related constructs—self-confidence in mathematics (measured with the short ATMI-SC) and mathematics achievement (measured with the mathematics test described above). Average scores for all items in each factor were calculated without reversing scores for negatively worded items to illustrate negative correlations among factors that measure opposing domains of affect. Pearson’s product–moment correlation coefficients were then calculated using SPSS 19. Prior to calculating the coefficients, the distributions of all summed variables were examined. No notable deviations from normality were detected.</p>
<p>Scores on the FS-EASE and FS-ANX subscales were expected to correlate negatively as these two subscales measure opposing feelings that students have about mathematics. As reported in numerous studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0748175612459198">Fennema &amp; Sherman, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0748175612459198">O’Neal, Ernest, McLean, &amp; Templeton, 1998</xref>), self-confidence in mathematics (measured by the short ATMI-SC) was expected to correlate negatively with mathematics anxiety (measured by the FS-ANX subscale) and positively with ease with mathematics (measured by the FS-EASE subscale). Finally, scores on the FS-ANX and FS-EASE subscales were expected to correlate negatively and positively (respectively) with mathematics achievement test scores, as mathematics anxiety and achievement were reported to correlate negatively in numerous studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0748175612459198">Cooper &amp; Robinson, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0748175612459198">Hembree, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0748175612459198">Ma, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0748175612459198">Richardson &amp; Suinn, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0748175612459198">Wigfield &amp; Meece, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0748175612459198">Zakaria &amp; Nordin, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Data from participants in Phase 2 were used to investigate the correlations between the two FSMAS-R subscales and their scores with the short ATMI-SC and mathematics achievement test scores. As predicted, the FS-ANX score correlated significantly and negatively with the FS-EASE, short ATMI-SC, and mathematics test scores (<italic>r</italic> = −.64, −.90, and −.50, respectively; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). The FS-EASE score correlated significantly and positively with the short ATMI-SC and mathematics test scores (<italic>r</italic> = .66 and .49, respectively; <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). Finally, the short ATMI-SC scores correlated significantly and positively with mathematics achievement test scores (<italic>r</italic> = .52, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). The results of a McQuitty linkage analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0748175612459198">McQuitty, 1961</xref>) are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0748175612459198">Figure 2</xref> to illustrate the relationships among these variables.

<title>Test–Retest Reliability of the Modified FSMAS-R</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0748175612459198">Cohen (1988)</xref> recommended that the minimum size for reliability coefficients is .70 to consider an instrument’s scores stable measures of an underlying property.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The main aims of this study were to investigate the factor structure of the FSMAS-R and to assess the reliability and validity of the final instrument after removing redundant or ambiguous items. Concurring with other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0748175612459198">Bai et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0748175612459198">Pajares &amp; Urdan, 1996</xref>), a two-factor model outperformed the one-factor model. After considering item loadings, fit indices and internal consistency, three items were removed to give a more parsimonious nine-item scale with a two-factor structure, where all the positively worded items loaded on the FS-EASE subscale and the negatively worded items loaded on the FS-ANX subscale. Although earlier studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0748175612459198">Scheier &amp; Carver, 1985</xref>) had suggested that positive and negative effects were opposing indicators of the same dimension, more recent studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0748175612459198">Bai et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0748175612459198">Marshall, Wortman, Kusuals, Herving, &amp; Vickers, 1992</xref>) have reported otherwise. The results of this study supported the more recent findings and suggested that positively and negatively worded items measure different, though related constructs.</p>
<p>Based on data collected from a predominantly Chinese sample from Singapore at the pretertiary level, other psychometric properties of the FSMAS-R were highly favorable. The final FSMAS-R subscales displayed good internal consistencies and satisfactory test–retest reliability over a 1-month period. The correlations between the FS-ANX and FS-EASE subscales, and their correlations with theoretically related constructs (self-confidence in mathematics and mathematics achievement), were all in line with theoretical justifications and past empirical research and supported the construct validity of the instrument. In particular, very high correlation was found between mathematics anxiety and self-confidence in mathematics (<italic>r</italic> = −.90, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) for the sample of this study. This finding concurred with the results of past studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0748175612459198">Mulhern &amp; Rae, 1998</xref>). Moreover, the items in the short ATMI-SC subscale were originally designed to measure both mathematics confidence and anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0748175612459198">Tapia &amp; Marsh, 2004</xref>). Hence, it may be possible that the FS-ANX subscale is also an indicator of students’ confidence level in mathematics.</p>
<p>However, the McQuitty linkage analysis illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0748175612459198">Figure 2</xref> shows that for the participants of this study, mathematics achievement had a stronger relationship with self-confidence in mathematics than with mathematics anxiety and ease with mathematics. This result suggested that self-confidence in mathematics is a more important correlate of mathematics achievement than mathematics anxiety and ease with mathematics. Future studies may consider the use of multiple regression analysis to further investigate the relationships among these variables.</p>
<p>As a predominantly Chinese sample from Singapore at the pretertiary level was used in this study, further studies are necessary before using this instrument with students from different cultures and schooling levels. Nevertheless, the results of this study suggested that the final FSMAS-R is a promising instrument for measuring mathematics anxiety. Such an instrument can potentially be used to identify students with high mathematics anxiety. School counselors can then take appropriate actions to help these students cope with their anxiety toward mathematics. This instrument can also be used by schools to evaluate the effectiveness of counseling or other intervention programs designed to reduce mathematics anxiety.</p>
