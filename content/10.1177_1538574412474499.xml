<abstract>
<p>Femoral arteriovenous fistula (AVF) is an abnormal communication between femoral artery and vein, which is frequently caused by an iatrogenic or traumatic event. Surgery and endovascular approach with coil and stent graft placement are the most frequent choices of treatment. Herein, we present 2 cases of iatrogenic superficial femoral AVF, which were treated with percutaneous balloon-assisted <italic>N</italic>-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate glue (<italic>N</italic>-BCA). Both fistulae had a short tract, and 1 of the patients had previously undergone a failed coil embolization. The occlusions with <italic>N</italic>-BCA were achieved immediately, and both fistulae remained obliterated at 1 and 12 months of follow-up.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Femoral arteriovenous fistula (AVF) usually occurs after arterial catheterization and is one of the most common iatrogenic vascular injuries. The overall incidence of vascular complications for femoral arterial access ranges from 1.73% to 9%<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1538574412474499">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1538574412474499">2</xref>
</sup>; these complications include AVF, pseudoaneurysm, hemorrhage, arterial thrombosis, and peripheral embolization. The potential harmful effects of such an AVF are mainly caused by arteriovenous volume shunting, which results in cardiac volume overload, limb ischemia, and other less common symptoms.</p>
<p>Surgical procedures such as partial resection, ligation, and primary repair are traditional options for treating AVF. Less invasive endovascular occlusion of the fistula using metallic coils and covered stents has become a more popular method in recent years. Here, the cases of 2 patients with femoral AVF are reported, each with a short fistulous tract, which were successfully treated with <italic>N</italic>-butyl-cyanoacrylate (<italic>N</italic>-BCA; Histoacryl, B. Braun, Tuttlingen, Germany) glue through a balloon occlusion technique.</p>
<sec id="section2-1538574412474499">
<title>Case 1</title>
<p>A 65-year-old man presented with right groin bruit and symptoms of worsening heart failure. His ejection fraction was 39%. Doppler ultrasound confirmed a femoral AVF that was thought to be related to a recent cardiac catheterization. Endovascular occlusion of this fistula was requested, and informed consent was obtained from the patient.</p>
<p>Arterial access was obtained into the left common femoral artery in a retrograde fashion, and a 6-F, 40-cm long Balkan vascular sheath was advanced into the contralateral external iliac artery. Venous access was then obtained in the left common femoral vein (FV) in an antegrade fashion, and a 9-F, 10-cm vascular sheath was placed. A wire was then advanced into the contralateral superficial FV.</p>
<p>An arteriogram of the right superficial femoral artery (SFA) confirmed a fistulous communication between the proximal SFA and FV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1538574412474499">Figure 1A</xref>). The tract was estimated to be 15 mm long and 3 to 4 mm in diameter. A C2 catheter was advanced from the right SFA into the fistulous tract, and direct contrast injection of the fistula was performed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1538574412474499">Figure 1B</xref>). The tip of the C2 catheter was then left near the junction of the fistulous tract and the FV.</p>

</fig>
<p>A 14-mm × 4-cm balloon was advanced through the venous sheath into the proximal right FV and inflated to cover the fistulous tract. The C2 catheter was injected again to confirm correct positioning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1538574412474499">Figure 1C</xref>). A mixture of ethiodol 3 mL and <italic>N</italic>-BCA 1 mL was injected through the C2 catheter under fluoroscopic guidance into the fistulous tract. There was no extravasation beyond the fistulous tract. The catheter was carefully removed, leaving the glue mixture intact within the fistulous tract. Postembolization arteriograms demonstrated complete occlusion of the AVF without compromise of the arterial lumen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1538574412474499">Figure 1D</xref>). A completion venogram confirmed patency of the right femoral and iliac veins. Follow-up Doppler ultrasound performed 3 weeks after the procedure confirmed closure of the AVF. The right groin bruit resolved and was still absent after 1 month, at which time the patient died as a result of heart failure.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1538574412474499">
<title>Case 2</title>
<p>A 68-year-old woman underwent cerebral angiography with difficult right femoral arterial access. The patient was fully anticoagulated for the cerebral angiography (active clotting time &gt;300) seconds. Upon completion of the procedure, a large right groin hematoma was discovered, and a diagnostic right femoral arteriogram showed a high-flow AVF between the right SFA and the FV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1538574412474499">Figure 2A</xref>). An initial embolization attempt via left groin access was unsuccessful (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1538574412474499">Figure 2B</xref>). A coil was anchored in the circumflex femoral artery and deployed into the tract, but this procedure failed to occlude the AVF. Glue embolization was contemplated at that time, but the idea was abandoned because of the high flow of the AVF and the short fistulous tract. The patient was brought to our department the next day for a second attempt at occluding the fistula.</p>

</fig>
<p>As in the previous case, arterial and venous access was obtained in the left common femoral artery and left common FV, respectively, and the glue mixture contained a 3:1 ratio of ethiodol to <italic>N</italic>-BCA. Multiple projections of right femoral arteriograms were obtained to better characterize the AVF. A 5-F C2 catheter was advanced into the fistulous tract and placed adjacent to the venous insertion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1538574412474499">Figure 2C</xref>). After inflation of a 14-mm diameter balloon in the vein, approximately 2 mL of the glue mixture was injected into the fistulous tract under fluoroscopic guidance.</p>
<p>A repeat arteriogram demonstrated complete occlusion of the AVF and nonvisualization of the right common FV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1538574412474499">Figure 2D</xref>). Follow-up Doppler ultrasound performed 2 weeks after the procedure and confirmed closure of the AVF. Her last clinic visit a year later showed no bruit at the right groin.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Iatrogenic femoral AVF is an abnormal communication between the artery and the vein that is caused by penetration of a needle through both the vessels. Simultaneous puncture of the vessels most often occurs when arterial access is attempted below the bifurcation of the common femoral artery, where the artery and the vein are anterior and posterior in relation.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1538574412474499">3</xref>
</sup> The incidence of iatrogenic femoral AVF ranges from 0.11%<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1538574412474499">3</xref>
</sup> to 0.86%<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1538574412474499">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1538574412474499">5</xref>
</sup> in patients receiving femoral arterial catheterization. A small AVF may remain asymptomatic and may not require treatment. However, a large AVF can result in significant arteriovenous shunting and may potentially cause cardiac volume overload, limb ischemia, skin ulceration, and, less commonly, venous hypertension and bacterial endocarditis.</p>
<p>Traditionally, femoral AVFs are treated surgically.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1538574412474499">6</xref>
</sup> Partial resection, ligation, and primary repair can be performed under local anesthesia, with definite closure attained in most cases. However, surgical treatments may be complicated by local infection, pain, and scarring, and surgery may be associated with difficult future groin punctures, delayed ambulation, prolonged hospitalization, time away from work, and increased costs. In patients presenting with delayed diagnosis of AVF, significant enlargement of the surrounding venous structures and nerve damage can potentially complicate surgical repair. A simple perforation of an enlarged venous structure with high flow and a relatively thin wall may lead to massive hemorrhage during the surgery. Furthermore, perisurgical morbidity and mortality rates are high in patients with severe trauma or multisystemic organ dysfunction.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1538574412474499">7</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Percutaneous transcatheter embolization is a minimally invasive alternative to surgery, and both coil embolization and covered stent graft techniques have been used to treat femoral AVFs. Coil embolization of iatrogenic femoral AVF was first reported in 1994.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1538574412474499">8</xref>
</sup> Four cases of iatrogenic femoral AVF were successfully treated with coils, but there was asymptomatic coil migration into the pulmonary artery in 1 patient. This technique, therefore, may be limited in treatment of the larger fistula or in a short-tract fistula, as securing coils within the tract may be difficult. In the second case reported here, the patient underwent unsuccessful coil embolization before presentation at our department. Because of concerns about coil migration, one end of the coil was deployed into the circumflex femoral artery to “anchor” the coil. However, there was insufficient volume within the deployed coil to fill the tract, resulting in procedure failure. Covering the fistulous tract with an arterial stent graft is an alternative endovascular approach for treating femoral AVF.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1538574412474499">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1538574412474499">10</xref>
</sup> As stent technology has improved over the last decade, using a covered stent graft for traumatic AVF and pseudoaneurysm has increased in popularity. However, placing a stent graft across a joint requires serious consideration, as there are concerns about stress fracture and stent durability. Furthermore, branch vessels may be compromised, particularly when lesions occur at the bifurcation of the common femoral artery. A 1-year patency rate of 88% has been reported for covered stents in iliac, femoral, and popliteal arteries, and stent thromboses have been detected in 17% of the patients treated with this procedure.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1538574412474499">11</xref>
</sup> Therefore, long-term anticoagulation therapy may be appropriate to maintain stent patency in these patients.</p>
<p>The tissue adhesive <italic>N</italic>-BCA has been found to be an effective, feasible, and efficient embolization material for acute arterial hemorrhage in multiple applications, including embolization of intracranial arteriovenous malformations,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1538574412474499">12</xref>
</sup> embolization of gastrointestinal hemorrhage,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1538574412474499">13</xref>
</sup> and treatment of high-flow priapism due to blunt perineal trauma.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1538574412474499">14</xref>
</sup> A single case report has been published regarding the use of <italic>N</italic>-BCA glue to close a femoral AVF.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1538574412474499">15</xref>
</sup> In this case, the patient had a long, narrow fistulous tract rather than the short, high-flow fistulous tracts described here. The anatomy in this previously reported case allowed for use of a microcatheter to deliver glue without the need for balloon protection. Embolization with glue is an irreversible procedure, as <italic>N</italic>-BCA immediately polymerizes into an adhesive solid agglutinate upon contact with tissues. Fibrosis around the glue is the eventual result. To avoid gluing of uninvolved structures, the procedure needs to be performed with utmost caution.</p>
<p>In the cases described here, several technical methods ensured successful completion of the procedure. A large-diameter balloon was used to occlude the vein, preventing transit of glue into the vein and possible embolization to the lung during fistula closure. Once the balloon was inflated, the C2 catheter was advanced as close as possible to the venous side of the tract to avoid potential glue reflux and distal arterial embolization into the femoral artery. Because flow in the fistula was temporarily occluded with the balloon, the glue could be diluted with ethiodol in a 1:3 ratio to slow down the polymerization, allowing enough embolic material to be delivered to the tract while the catheter tip remained patent. The use of high-quality fluoroscopic imaging was vital to preventing unwanted spillage beyond the tract. The catheter used to deliver the glue was retrieved in its entirety before the glue polymerized.</p>
<p>In conclusion, balloon-assisted <italic>N</italic>-BCA glue embolization is an effective, simple, and efficient procedure that can safely close a short-tract/fast-flowing femoral AVF.</p>
