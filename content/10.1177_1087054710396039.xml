<abstract>
<p><bold>Objective</bold>: Current diagnostic criteria specify that ADHD involves difficulties with inattention and/or hyperactivity/impulsivity. Researchers using factor analysis have consistently found support for an inattention factor in both children and adults. Findings have been mixed regarding whether hyperactivity and impulsivity reflect one or two dimensions. To date, no study has examined the merits of separating hyperactivity and impulsivity factors to predict socioemotional and academic outcomes in young adults. <bold>Method</bold>: The current study examined self-reported ADHD symptomatology data from 1,096 college students. Subsets of the sample completed a variety of outcome measures. <bold>Results</bold>: The prediction of outcomes provided support that complemented confirmatory factor analysis for the separation of the hyperactivity and impulsivity constructs. Impulsivity uniquely predicted more outcomes than hyperactivity alone. <bold>Conclusion</bold>: Results were consistent with the conceptualization of ADHD as primarily a disorder of behavioral inhibition. Future research using alternative outcomes and clinical populations should be conducted.</p>

<p>ADHD is a behavior disorder estimated to affect between 3% and 7% of school-age children and can continue into adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1087054710396039">American Psychiatric Association, 2000</xref>). Individuals with this disorder display prolonged and pervasive problems with attention, overactivity, and/or impulse control. Researchers have been interested in examining the organization of these symptom clusters for some time. The majority of this work has been conducted with children. The few researchers studying adults have relied on factor analytic techniques. Although instructive, such an approach is only a starting point in providing information that is applicable from a diagnostic standpoint. In the current study, the argument is made that researchers should be using an additional approach: the ability of the symptom clusters to predict clinically relevant outcome variables. This method, combined with factor analytic work, can provide more definitive evidence concerning the multidimensionality of this disorder.</p>
<sec id="section1-1087054710396039">
<title>Evidence for the Dimensionality of ADHD</title>
<p>The organization of the diagnostic criteria for ADHD has not remained stable over time. The description of attention deficit disorder (ADD), with or without hyperactivity, in the <italic>Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders</italic> (3rd ed., <italic>DSM-III</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1087054710396039">APA, 1980</xref>) suggested a three-factor model for the disorder; however, because all three dimensions were so highly correlated, the disorder was subsequently characterized as unidimensional in the <italic>DSM-III-R</italic>, when it came to be known as ADHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1087054710396039">APA, 1987</xref>). The diagnostic criteria in the current <italic>DSM-IV</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1087054710396039">APA, 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1087054710396039">2000</xref>) describe a two-factor structure (inattention and hyperactivity-impulsivity), while including subtypes of the disorder that reflect the distribution of symptoms across the two domains: predominantly inattentive type, predominantly hyperactive-impulsive type, and combined type. From a diagnostic standpoint, it is imperative that we conduct research to uncover the true nature of the disorder. Although there does appear to be some agreement about which symptoms are associated with ADHD, agreement concerning the organization of those symptoms—in particular, whether hyperactivity and impulsivity are separate constructs—will lead to more accurate subtype criteria that will be useful for developing and evaluating treatments.</p>
<sec id="section2-1087054710396039">
<title>Children and adolescents</title>
<p>Interest in examining the dimensionality of ADHD is reflected in the plethora of factor analytic studies in children. To date, this work suggests that ADHD is indeed multidimensional. However, studies do not agree on the number of dimensions. Some confirmatory factor analytic (CFA) studies of teacher and parent ratings found support for a two-factor structure both when ADHD symptoms were examined in isolation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1087054710396039">Collett, Crowley, Gimpel, &amp; Greenson, 2000</xref>) and when they were examined with other disruptive behavior disorder symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1087054710396039">Molina, Smith, &amp; Pelham, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1087054710396039">Pillow, Pelham, Hoza, Molina, &amp; Stultz, 1998</xref>). Other CFA studies have found support for a three-factor model of ADHD that splits the hyperactivity/impulsivity dimension into separate factors (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1087054710396039">Burns, Boe, Walsh, Sommers- Flanagan, &amp; Teegarden, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1087054710396039">Gomez, Harvey, Quick, Scharer, &amp; Harris, 1999</xref>). However, these authors noted that model selection criteria other than the fit indices, such as the limited improvement in fit and the high correlation between the hyperactivity and impulsivity factors, favored the more parsimonious two-factor model. Therefore, there seems to be some consensus that the two-factor structure is most appropriate for children, but it is unclear if this structure best reflects the manifestation of this disorder later in life.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1087054710396039">
<title>Young adults and adults</title>
<p>Several prospective longitudinal studies have demonstrated that up to 80% of children with ADHD continue to have symptoms into late adolescence (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1087054710396039">Willoughby, 2003</xref>, for a review) and persistence rates into adulthood can approach 70% (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1087054710396039">Faraone &amp; Biederman, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1087054710396039">Mannuzza, Klein, &amp; Moulton, 2003</xref>, for reviews). Despite the greater recognition of ADHD in adulthood in recent versions of the <italic>DSM</italic>, there are still several problems with using the <italic>DSM-IV</italic> criteria to diagnose adults with ADHD, including the fact that current diagnostic criteria (i.e., the number of symptoms required for a diagnosis and the available subtypes), are based on research conducted with children and, to a lesser extent, adolescents (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1087054710396039">McGough &amp; Barkley, 2004</xref>). It is unwise to use the child model to make assumptions that guide research and clinical practice at the adult level without empirically verifying the appropriateness of the model. Given that there has been support over time for various models of ADHD in children, it is unclear whether the two-factor structure of the <italic>DSM-IV</italic>, and therefore the subtypes associated with <italic>DSM-IV</italic> criteria, is appropriate for adults. If the symptomatology of ADHD is organized differently in adults compared to children, future diagnostic criteria specific to adults will need to be added to the <italic>DSM</italic>.</p>
<p>Several researchers have used exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and/or principal components analysis (PCA) as well as CFA to examine the factor structure of self-reported ADHD symptoms in adults and have come to differing conclusions. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1087054710396039">Smith and Johnson (1998)</xref> found via PCA/EFA and CFA that a two-factor solution (inattention and hyperactivity-impulsivity) was most appropriate for 15 of the 18 self-reported <italic>DSM-IV</italic> criteria in college students. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1087054710396039">DuPaul et al. (2001)</xref> also found support for the two-factor structure using EFA in the U.S. sample and in a New Zealand sample of college students. DuPaul et al. used a 24-item self-report measure created for their study that contained 17 <italic>DSM-IV</italic> criteria.</p>
<p>More recently, researchers have found support for a three-factor solution (inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity) for ADHD symptoms in college students and other adult samples. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1087054710396039">Span, Earleywine, and Strybel (2002)</xref> used CFA to test a one- and three-factor model as well as several different two-factor models of 18 self-reported <italic>DSM-IV</italic> criteria in college students. Their results consistently showed that the three-factor model fit the data better than any of the other models. In addition, analyses using EFA and CFA on 44 items from the self-report version of the College ADHD Response Evaluation (CARE) indicated three distinct factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1087054710396039">Glutting, Youngstrom, &amp; Watkins, 2005</xref>). Using CFA, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1087054710396039">Proctor and Prevatt (2009)</xref> found the three-factor model to be superior to other models for parent and self-report of the 18 <italic>DSM-IV</italic> criteria (both current and childhood) in a sample of college students referred for an ADHD evaluation. A three-factor model that allowed for correlated errors and cross-loadings demonstrated improved fit in this study. Similarly, a three-factor model that allowed for cross-loadings provided the best fit for <italic>DSM-IV</italic>-based symptoms when CFA was used to compare it to other models in a sample of adults in the Netherlands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1087054710396039">Kooij et al., 2005</xref>). Finally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1087054710396039">Barkley, Murphy, and Fischer (2008)</xref> found a three-factor solution for the 18 <italic>DSM-IV</italic> items in his large-scale study of clinic-referred adults. Therefore, as with the research on children, this work suggests that ADHD is indeed multidimensional in adults. At this point, there appears to be more factor analytic support for three rather than two dimensions in adults.</p>

<title>The Need for Prediction of Outcomes</title>
<p>Using factor analysis to examine the dimensionality of ADHD symptomatology in adults is a good first step, but a solely factor analytic approach has limitations. First, the results of any factor analysis will vary depending on the items being analyzed. Symptoms for one disorder could appear unidimensional if factor is analyzed along with symptoms from other disorders. At the other extreme, any unique symptom of a disorder could become its own factor if enough homogeneous items assessing that symptom are included in a factor analysis. Although this approach is a good starting point, it does not provide information about how these dimensions operate in real life; thus, it is limited in terms of clinical utility.</p>
<p>If the hyperactivity and impulsivity symptom clusters behave in distinct ways in adults, then splitting up this factor would be important to furthering the current conceptualization of ADHD. There is some evidence that these two symptom dimensions may differ in their trajectory over time. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1087054710396039">Mick, Faraone, and Biederman (2004)</xref> found that hyperactivity and impulsivity symptoms remitted at the same rate until the ages of 9 to 11, at which point the remission rate for hyperactivity appeared to increase compared to the rate for impulsivity. Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1087054710396039">Kooij et al. (2005)</xref> found a small but significant decline in hyperactivity between the ages of 18 to 75 but no such relationship for impulsivity. Indeed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1087054710396039">Barkley et al. (2008)</xref> posited that his finding that the three <italic>DSM-IV</italic> impulsivity criteria loaded on their own factor in clinic-referred adults could be due to symptoms of motor overactivity improving more rapidly over time than symptoms of verbal impulsivity.</p>
<p>There is also evidence to suggest that symptoms of hyperactivity are not as useful in distinguishing adults with ADHD from community control or clinical control groups as symptoms of inattention and impulsivity/disinhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1087054710396039">Barkley et al., 2008</xref>). When Barkley added to the <italic>DSM-IV</italic> criteria a list of items to assess the current conceptualization of the disorder as one of behavioral and cognitive inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1087054710396039">Barkley, 1997</xref>), such as making decisions impulsively and driving a motor vehicle much faster than others, these new symptoms outperformed all <italic>DSM-IV</italic> hyperactivity symptoms in terms of classification accuracy. These findings suggest that the current <italic>DSM-IV</italic> subtype of hyperactive-impulsive is not useful for adults.</p>
<p>To examine further if hyperactivity and impulsivity symptom clusters behave in distinct ways in adults, we need to employ an additional empirical strategy: the prediction of outcomes. This approach emphasizes that the utility of the symptom clusters, both theoretically and clinically, rests with their ability to predict uniquely various social-psychological adjustment outcomes. Such an approach would provide more evidence than factor analytic data alone for determining whether the hyperactivity and impulsivity symptom clusters should be conceptualized as one or two dimensions in adults.</p>
<p>To date, only one study has used such an approach. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1087054710396039">Kooij et al. (2005)</xref> found that all three ADHD symptom factors (inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity) were correlated with measures of somatic symptoms, anxiety, depression, and social dysfunction as well as items assessing psychosocial impairment (presence of self-reported psychological disorder, use of medication for a psychological disorder, and degree to which mental health problems interfered with social contacts and social activities) in their population-based sample of adults. The correlations for inattentive and hyperactive symptoms were larger than for impulsive symptoms. When all three symptom factors were entered into regression equations predicting psychosocial impairment scores, inattention and hyperactivity factors were uniquely related to all impairment measures, whereas impulsivity demonstrated a small negative effect in half of the equations. Even though these findings seem contradictory to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1087054710396039">Barkley et al.’s (2008)</xref> evidence of the unimportance of hyperactivity, they do provide some support for keeping hyperactivity and impulsivity separate dimensions. Such an approach has yet to be used with young adults or with other outcome variables.</p>

<sec id="section5-1087054710396039">
<title>The Present Study</title>
<p>The goal of the present study was to add to the current literature by using an empirical outcome prediction approach, combined with factor analysis, to examine the multidimensional nature of ADHD in young adults. To accomplish this goal, the research described above was replicated by examining the factor structure of ADHD symptomatology using CFA. Because of limitations of the <italic>DSM-IV</italic> criteria (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1087054710396039">McGough &amp; Barkley, 2004</xref>), an expanded pool of 44 items from the CARE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1087054710396039">Glutting, Sheslow, &amp; Adams, 2002</xref>), which was developed specifically for young adults, was also examined. Because CFA supported a three-factor model, the ability of separate hyperactivity and impulsivity factors to predict important outcomes thought to be related to adjustment to college, especially for those exhibiting ADHD symptomatology (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1087054710396039">DuPaul, Weyandt, O’Dell, &amp; Varejao, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1087054710396039">Weyandt &amp; DuPaul, 2006</xref>, for reviews) was then examined. These included the presence of other forms of psychopathology, emotional adjustment, social adjustment, and academic performance. Given the literature reviewed above regarding the nature of hyperactivity in adults, it was expected that impulsivity would be uniquely related to the various outcome measures more so than hyperactivity.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>The participants and CARE data reported here were also used in a prior study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1087054710396039">McKee, 2008</xref>); therefore, the description of the participant population and the procedure to collect the CARE data are the same for the two studies.</p>
<sec id="section7-1087054710396039">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Students from three entering classes (2007 through 2009; <italic>N</italic> = 1,143) of a small, private college in the Mid-Atlantic United States participated in this study. Only students with enough data to score at least one subscale of the questionnaire (i.e., 75% of the items completed for that subscale) were included in the analyses, which reduced the sample to 1,096 students. Students ranged in age from 16 to 22 years (<italic>M</italic> = 18.07, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.60). The majority of students (74%) were 18 years old. Female students (<italic>n</italic> = 578) slightly outnumbered male students (<italic>n</italic> = 518). Approximately 83% of the students identified themselves as White, approximately 3% as Hispanic/Latino/a, 4% as African American, 6% as Asian/Pacific Islander, and 4% as Other/international students. Approximately 7% of students indicated that they had been previously diagnosed with ADD or ADHD, about 4% identified themselves as learning disabled, and about 2% reported that they had another psychiatric diagnosis (e.g., obsessive-compulsive disorder, tic disorder, communication disorder).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1087054710396039">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>As part of their orientation to college, all participants assembled in an auditorium to complete an exam or a survey required by the college. Following their completion of the exam/survey, students were invited to participate in the present research project by reading and signing a consent form and completing a packet of questionnaires. Students were informed that the purpose of the study was to understand behavioral difficulties that may impact learning and performance in college and that, if they gave consent/assent, information would also be obtained from their academic records. Students who indicated they were under the age of 18 at the time of orientation were informed that if they assented to the study, their parents would be contacted to obtain consent. A letter was sent home to parents asking permission to use the students’ questionnaire data and to invite the student to participate in future studies. Approximately 74% of the parents provided permission. The data of those students whose parents did not provide permission were destroyed. Over the course of their 1st year at college, subsets of these students were invited to participate in various research projects conducted by psychology department faculty and senior thesis students. Various outcome measures from these projects were used in the present study. All projects were approved by the college’s Institutional Review Board.</p>

<title>Measures</title>
<sec id="section10-1087054710396039">
<title>CARE</title>
<p>Incoming 1st year students were screened for ADHD symptomatology using this 59-item self-report questionnaire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1087054710396039">Glutting et al., 2002</xref>). Students indicated the degree to which statements such as “I am forgetful in daily activities” described them over the last several months using 3-point scales (0 = <italic>disagree</italic>, 1 = <italic>undecided</italic>, 2 = <italic>agree</italic>). Some items were worded positively and were reverse scored such that higher numbers indicated greater ADHD symptomatology for all items. Forty-four items from this measure are scored to yield three-factor scores corresponding to the three domains of ADHD symptoms: inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. The CARE Manual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1087054710396039">Glutting et al., 2002</xref>) indicates that these factor scores have high levels of internal consistency (Cronbach’s α ranging from .74 to .90) and test<italic>–</italic>retest reliability (<italic>r</italic>s ranging from .77 to .91), and can discriminate between college students with and without ADHD better than between college students who were and were not classified as learning disabled. The CARE also contains all 18 <italic>DSM-IV</italic> criteria, 16 of which are used in the factor scores described above. These 18 items can be summed to create scores for the two symptom clusters from the <italic>DSM-IV</italic>: inattention and hyperactivity-impulsivity.</p>
<p>In addition, the CARE contains 13 items related to comorbid symptomatology. One item assesses substance use; five items assess anxiety symptoms (Cronbach’s α in the current sample = .73), such as experiencing intense fear, having difficulty controlling worries, and having repetitive thoughts; and two items assess disruptive behavior: difficulty controlling one’s temper and getting in trouble with the law. The four items assessing mood symptoms and the one item assessing somatic complaints were not used in the present study.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1087054710396039">
<title>Beck Depression Inventory–Second Edition (BDI-II)</title>
<p>The BDI-II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1087054710396039">Beck, Steer, &amp; Brown, 1996</xref>) is a 21-item self-report measure of depressive symptomatology. A subset of participants (<italic>n</italic> = 144) completed this measure approximately 1 month into their first semester of college. Students were asked to rate the extent to which they had experienced specific depressive symptoms in the past week, including on the test day. Scores on this measure can range from 0 to 63 with higher numbers indicating more severe levels of depressive symptomatology.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1087054710396039">
<title>Student Adaptation to College Questionnaire (SACQ)</title>
<p>This 67-item questionnaire measures the quality of adaptation to college life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1087054710396039">Baker &amp; Siryk, 1999</xref>). Participants were asked to report how closely each item applied to them currently using a 9-point scale (1 = <italic>applies very closely</italic>, 5 = <italic>applies somewhat</italic>, 9 = <italic>does not apply at all</italic>). A subset of students completed this measure near the end of their first semester (<italic>n</italic> = 93). The questionnaire has four subscales that assess various aspects of adaptation. Three subscales were used in the present study: academic adjustment, social adjustment, and personal-emotional adjustment. Raw scores from the three subscales were converted into <italic>T</italic>-scores using norms based on gender and length of time in college. <italic>T</italic>-scores for each subscale ranged from 25 to 75, with larger <italic>T</italic>-scores indicating better adaptation. Reliability of the SACQ has been well documented among college samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1087054710396039">Baker &amp; Siryk, 1999</xref>). Validity for the academic, social, and personal-emotional subscales was established by correlating scores on these subscales with grade point average (GPA), levels of campus involvement, and use of psychological services, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1087054710396039">Baker &amp; Siryk, 1999</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section13-1087054710396039">
<title>Peer Relations Inventory (PRI)</title>
<p>This 20-item measure is designed to assess the frequency of various aspects of relational aggression in young adults since the time they started high school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1087054710396039">Yee &amp; Pierce, 2010</xref>). Relational aggression was defined as covert, indirect behaviors intended to lower an individual’s social standing among peers. Students answered questions such as “classmates spread a rumor about you” using 4-point scales (1 = <italic>never</italic>, 4 = <italic>very often</italic>). The questionnaire contains four subscales (calculated as means) that measure the degree to which individuals were victims and perpetrators of relational aggression as well as the extent to which they received support if they were a victim or offered support to a victim of relational aggression. A subset of students who matriculated in 2003 (<italic>n</italic> = 184) completed this measure approximately 1 month into their first semester of college, and students who matriculated in the fall of 2005 (<italic>n</italic> = 488) completed the measure during their 1st year orientation. Internal consistency was adequate in the present sample for three of the subscales: victim of relational aggression α = .76, offered support to a victim α = .80, and received support when a victim α = .78. The scale assessing the extent to which one was an aggressor was not used in the present study because it was unreliable (α = .63).</p>

<p>The registrar provided information for those participants matriculating in the fall of 2003 who voluntarily submitted SAT-I verbal and math scores to the admissions office (the scores were not a requirement for admission; <italic>n</italic> = 398). Scores can range from 200 to 800 on the verbal and math portions of the test.</p>

<title>Descriptive Statistics</title>
<p>Means and standard deviations were computed for the 44 CARE items that comprise the three factor scales as well as two <italic>DSM-IV</italic> items that are not part of the CARE factor scales. The means for all 46 items ranged from 0.14 to 1.37 with standard deviations that ranged from 0.43 to 0.90. As expected for a measure of disorder symptomatology, the majority of items averaged below the midpoint of the scale. The following items were close to or above the midpoint of the scale: making careless mistakes (<italic>M</italic> = 1.37, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.81), getting down to assigned work easily (<italic>M</italic> = 0.90, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.80), daydreaming (<italic>M</italic> = 1.36, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.78), having others borrow one’s notes (<italic>M</italic> = 1.14, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.85), getting lost in one’s thoughts (<italic>M</italic> = 1.18, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.86), fidgeting or squirming (<italic>M</italic> = 1.07, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.89), starting to do one thing and ending up doing another (<italic>M</italic> = 1.04, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.84), and fiddling with things (<italic>M</italic> = 0.95, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.89). Three items, turning in assignments on time (<italic>M</italic> = 0.14, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.43), having difficulty engaging in leisure activities (<italic>M</italic> = 0.18, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.50), and following through on instructions/finishing projects (<italic>M</italic> = 0.20, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.48) were highly skewed.</p>
<p>Means and standard deviations for the various outcome measures are reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1087054710396039">Table 1</xref>. These descriptive statistics suggest that the current sample is fairly typical of college students at a selective liberal arts college such that academic indicators are fairly high, adjustment is average, and other indicators of psychopathology are low.</p>

<p>EQS-Version 6.1 for Windows (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1087054710396039">Bentler, 2006</xref>) was used to test the various models. The maximum likelihood method with robust estimation was employed because the data showed slightly skewed distributions. Correlations among the latent factors were freely estimated, miniscales were not free to load on more than one factor, and error terms were assumed to be independent. Several indices were used to evaluate the overall fit of each model. Values greater than .90 for the goodness of fit index (GFI), the comparative fit index (CFI), and the robust comparative fit index (RCFI) as well as values less than .05 for the standardized root mean square residual (SRMR) and the robust root mean square error of approximation (RRMSEA) were used as indicators of good fit. The commonly used chi-square statistic (the EQS residual-based chi-square) is reported, but caution should be used in interpreting it as an index of fit because it is substantially affected by sample size. This statistic was used instead of the Satorra−Bentler scaled statistic because of ease of comparing models using the chi-square difference test.</p>
<p>The fit indices for the various models based on published CARE miniscales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1087054710396039">Glutting et al., 2005</xref>) are displayed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1087054710396039">Table 2</xref>. Neither the one- nor the two-factor model was a good fit to the data. In the three-factor model, inattention was moderately correlated with hyperactivity and with impulsivity (<italic>r</italic> = .55 and <italic>r</italic> = .44, respectively), whereas the correlation between hyperactivity and impulsivity was .62. Although the SRMR and RRMEA were slightly higher than what would be expected, an examination of the fit indices for this model suggests that it is a relatively good fit to the data and a significantly better fit than the two-factor model.</p>
<p>Because <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1087054710396039">Glutting et al.’s (2005)</xref> miniscales were based on data from their direct item factor analysis as well as item difficulty levels within their sample, their item groupings may not be appropriate for the current sample. Thus, a new set of miniscales was constructed using the same approach as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1087054710396039">Glutting et al. (2005)</xref>. One-, two-, and three-factor models were estimated using these new CARE miniscales. Fit indices for these models were nearly identical to those for the published miniscales. Therefore, the three-factor model was the best fit to the data for both the published miniscales and the miniscales created for the present study.</p>

<title>DSM-IV items</title>
<p>The self-report form of the CARE also contains all 18 <italic>DSM-IV</italic> diagnostic criteria for ADHD. In an attempt to replicate prior research, CFA was used in the present study to test the adequacy of a one-, two-, and three-factor model for the individual <italic>DSM-IV</italic> items (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1087054710396039">Table 2</xref>). The same EQS program parameters and fit indices as described above were used for these analyses. As indicated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1087054710396039">Table 2</xref>, none of the models was a good fit to the data. Lagrange multiplier tests indicated that allowing some items to load on more than one factor would improve the fit of the three-factor model. Because previous studies showed a three-factor model with cross-loadings was a better fit to the data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1087054710396039">Kooij et al., 2005</xref>), an additional three-factor model was examined that allowed the “talking excessively” item to load on the hyperactivity and impulsivity factors and the “easily distracted” item to load on the inattention and hyperactivity factors. In this model, inattention and hyperactivity were highly correlated (<italic>r</italic> = .66), inattention and impulsivity were moderately correlated (<italic>r</italic> = .37), and hyperactivity and impulsivity were highly correlated (<italic>r</italic> = .64). This model showed a statistically significant improvement in fit compared to the three-factor model with no cross-loadings, but the CFI and RCFI were still lower than expected for the model to be considered a good fit to the data.</p>

<title>Prediction of Outcomes</title>
<p>A series of regression analyses was conducted to explore how models with hyperactivity and impulsivity as one construct versus separate constructs predicted various socioemotional and academic outcomes. Separate factor scores for inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity were created using the 44 items that were part of the CFA results from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1087054710396039">Glutting et al. (2005)</xref> and which represented the best fitting model from the CFA analyses in the present study. A combined hyperactivity-impulsivity factor score was also created. Simple correlations between these factor scores and various outcome measures were calculated and are displayed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1087054710396039">Table 1</xref>. An alpha of .01 was used to reduce the Type 1 error rate.</p>
<sec id="section22-1087054710396039">
<title>Hyperactivity and impulsivity as one construct</title>
<p>To determine if the inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity factors from the two-factor solution each uniquely predicted outcomes, a regression equation was calculated for each outcome measure. Semipartial correlations from these regression equations are reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1087054710396039">Table 1</xref> and provide evidence that inattention is important for predicting a wide variety of outcomes, such as other forms of psychopathology from the CARE (concern about frequency of drug use, having difficulty controlling one’s temper, and anxiety items), academic adjustment during the first semester, and 1st year cumulative GPA. The hyperactivity/impulsivity factor uniquely predicted various indicators of psychopathology from the CARE (concern about frequency of drug use, having recently been in trouble with the law, and anxiety items) as well as the extent to which someone was a victim in peer relationships and the extent to which someone received support if he/she was a victim or offered support to a victim of relational aggression. Other socioemotional adjustment and academic outcomes were not uniquely predicted by the combined hyperactivity/impulsivity factor.</p>

<sec id="section23-1087054710396039">
<title>Hyperactivity and impulsivity as separate constructs</title>
<p>To evaluate the utility of a three-factor solution for self-reported ADHD symptomatology, researchers need to determine whether disaggregating the hyperactivity/impulsivity factor results in each of those variables uniquely predicting various outcomes. A regression equation using scores from the three-factor CFA as predictors was conducted for each outcome measure. Semipartial correlations from these regression equations are reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1087054710396039">Table 1</xref> and provide evidence for an advantage of separating hyperactivity and impulsivity factors. If the hyperactivity factor and impulsivity factor each significantly predict an outcome, then it makes sense to separate the factors because one is adding something to the prediction over and above the other predictor. This pattern was observed for the CARE anxiety items. In addition, significant prediction of an outcome by one factor (either hyperactivity or impulsivity) and not the other would also provide support for separating the constructs. Impulsivity uniquely predicted various psychopathology items from the CARE (concern about frequency of drug use and both disruptive behavior items), the extent to which someone is a victim in peer relationships, and math SAT scores. Hyperactivity did not uniquely predict any outcome variables on its own.</p>
<p>The only support for grouping hyperactivity and impulsivity together would come from their having significant independent associations with an outcome (i.e., significant Pearson’s <italic>r</italic>) but neither uniquely predicting that outcome (i.e., nonsignificant semipartial <italic>r</italic>), which would indicate that the independent association is driven solely by shared variance and not by anything unique to each variable. This pattern occurred with the personal-emotional adjustment and academic adjustment variables from the SACQ and the extent to which someone received support if he/she was a victim of relational aggression. Therefore, when using factor scores based on the CARE, somewhat more support exists for separating hyperactivity and impulsivity than for combining them into one dimension.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Based on the methodology utilized in the current study, the three-factor model appears to be a more useful organization of the symptoms of ADHD in young adults than the current two-factor conceptualization in the <italic>DSM-IV</italic>. CFA results from the present study replicated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1087054710396039">Glutting et al.’s (2005)</xref> findings, with the three-factor model showing the best fit to the data for the published CARE miniscales as well as miniscales created for the present sample. When examining the <italic>DSM-IV</italic> items, a three-factor model with cross-loadings was the best fit to the data, which is consistent with prior research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1087054710396039">Kooij et al., 2005</xref>; however, fit indices revealed that this model was not a good fit. It is important to note that two <italic>DSM-IV</italic> criteria on the CARE are worded differently from what is presented in the <italic>DSM-IV</italic>. The difficulty sustaining attention criterion is worded as having trouble “staying tuned in with tasks like this questionnaire.” In addition, the word “quietly” is omitted from the difficulty engaging in leisure activities criterion. Moreover, studies that found a three-factor model to be superior to a two-factor model utilized <italic>DSM-IV</italic>-based measures with frequency scales that had between 4 and 7 points. The 3-point scale used on the CARE indicates only presence or absence of the symptoms, which, combined with the wording changes, could explain some of the difficulty with obtaining adequate fit indices. These findings are also consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1087054710396039">Barkley et al.’s (2008)</xref> idea that when more symptoms of behavioral disinhibition are included in the analysis, thus providing a better balance in terms of the representation of the three symptom types (as is done in the CARE), a stronger third factor emerges.</p>
<p>Examining factor analytic studies alone will not resolve this issue. One also needs to examine the unique correlates of each factor. Separate hyperactivity and impulsivity factor scores based on the larger pool of items from the CARE were used to predict a variety of socioemotional adjustment outcomes. In these analyses, the anxiety score from the CARE was significantly predicted by both CARE-based hyperactivity and impulsivity factors. Such findings could be partially due to method variance with items from the CARE predicting other items from the CARE. However, as predicted, a variety of outcomes were uniquely predicted by impulsivity alone, including several CARE items related to risky/disruptive behavior and the extent to which someone is a victim of relational aggression. Only three outcomes related to college adjustment and social support showed patterns that suggested support for combining hyperactivity and impulsivity into one factor; therefore, the three-factor model could have more clinical utility than the two-factor model.</p>
<p>Such a three-factor conceptualization could encourage research into important developmental aspects of the disorder such as how much and why some symptom clusters change into adulthood while others do not, and whether some symptoms become more impactful over time in terms of functional impairment. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1087054710396039">Barkley et al. (2008)</xref> has indicated, hyperactivity may decrease over time in terms of its impact on functioning, whereas impulsivity and other symptoms of behavioral inhibition may be the driving force behind adult impairment. Therefore, it is possible that as individuals age symptoms of hyperactivity not only decrease but also lead to particular lifestyle choices as a means to compensate such as seeking out a more active job and avoiding situations where one has to sit still for long periods. Alternatively, symptoms of impulsivity/disinhibition may not only improve over time but may also be more impairing for adults than symptoms of hyperactivity in terms of interfering with relationships and engaging in risky/antisocial behavior. Separating the three symptom types could be very useful for better understanding how particular symptoms are associated with functional impairment in adults.</p>
<p>The findings of the present study have important implications for our understanding of the nature of this disorder, especially in terms of diagnosis and developing effective treatments for adults. Because the <italic>DSM-IV</italic> criteria for hyperactive-impulsive symptoms are dominated by symptoms of hyperactivity, it is impossible for an adult to qualify for the hyperactive-impulsive or combined subtypes without having some impairing symptoms of hyperactivity. Therefore, there may be a number of adults who have severe symptoms of impulsivity or behavioral disinhibition who are overlooked because they have outgrown or learned how to compensate for their hyperactive behavior. A three-factor conceptualization would encourage revision of the current criteria. Indeed, some options being considered by the <italic>DSM-V</italic> task force include adding new impulsivity criteria and changing the subtype distinction either by only having the combined type or by having a single diagnostic code for the disorder, and using descriptions for specific behaviors instead of subtypes (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.dsm5.org/ProposedRevisions/Pages/proposedrevision.aspx?rid=383#">http://www.dsm5.org/ProposedRevisions/Pages/proposedrevision.aspx?rid=383#</ext-link>). Conceptualizing ADHD in adulthood as having three factors would also prompt clinicians to ask how treatments directed at impulsivity or hyperactivity alone would be different from treatments directed at the combined factor. Determining the effectiveness of both behavioral and pharmacological interventions targeted at specific symptom clusters could promote more cost-effective treatments and greatly advance work in this area.</p>
<p>The results from this single study cannot definitively answer the question of whether hyperactivity and impulsivity are one factor or two, but they can tell us that this method, prediction of outcomes, should be used to investigate this question further. Future studies that examine a broader range of outcomes that are theoretically related to hyperactivity and/or impulsivity will yield additional evidence to help answer this question. Such outcomes can include judicial code violations in college, driving habits and violations, police contact (e.g., disturbing the peace, disorderly conduct), other reckless/risky behavior (e.g., unprotected sex), money mismanagement, substance use and abuse, and relationship problems (with coworkers/supervisors, friendships, and romantic relationships). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1087054710396039">Barkley et al.’s (2008)</xref> work and the present findings suggest that impulsivity/disinhibition would be uniquely related to these outcomes more so than hyperactivity.</p>
<p>The findings from the present study need to be interpreted in light of its limitations. First, this study focused only on self-reported ADHD symptomatology. Examining self-report is an important initial step in this research because it is so heavily relied on for assessment at the adult level, especially when reports from significant others or parents are unavailable. Once we understand more fully how self-report measures behave, we can then turn to other indicators such as reports from multiple informants and behavioral observations to see if the findings concerning multidimensionality are replicated. In addition, different subsamples of participants completed different outcome measures in the present study, preventing the comparison of results across outcome variables. Future research that follows the same cohort of participants over time examining a variety of outcome variables will add greatly to this literature.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the current sample was drawn from a fairly homogeneous population of White, middle- to upper-class students from a small, liberal arts college and is not representative of the population of college students as a whole. In addition, it is a nonclinical sample, so the results cannot generalize to a clinic-referred sample in which the severity of psychopathology would presumably be greater. Nevertheless, at this point, it is important to examine the entire continuum of symptomatology because we may miss important information if we examine only those individuals who are impaired enough to seek treatment or who would meet criteria for a diagnosis. For a variety of disorders, subclinical levels of symptomatology can be associated with impairment. That said, the factor structure and ability of the factors to predict important outcomes may differ in clinical versus nonclinical populations, which would have implications for revisions of the <italic>DSM</italic> criteria that are to be used for clinical diagnosis. Therefore, it is important to replicate this research with clinically referred young adults.</p>
<p>Future research should also be directed at examining further the clinical implications of the present findings. We know that symptom expression in adults with ADHD is different compared with symptom expression in children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1087054710396039">APA, 2000</xref>). What is unclear is whether this difference is reflected in the measures that we use for adults. In addition to the present study, two prior studies that found support for a three-factor structure of ADHD symptomatology used adult-specific measures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1087054710396039">Conners et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1087054710396039">Glutting et al., 2005</xref>). As more measures that take into account adult-specific symptom descriptions are developed and validated, more evidence will be available to examine the unique correlates of the symptom clusters and to determine whether the <italic>DSM-IV</italic> criteria are appropriate in this population.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the present study established that predicting outcomes combined with factor analysis can be a useful method when examining the complex factor structure of ADHD symptoms. This approach provides converging evidence for disaggregating the hyperactivity/impulsivity factor in ADHD. Still, future research using a broader range of outcomes is warranted. Agreement concerning the organization of ADHD symptoms in young adults is needed to develop accurate diagnostic criteria. Such criteria are essential for creating and evaluating treatments for this disorder, especially in the postadolescent population.</p>
