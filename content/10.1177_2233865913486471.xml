<abstract>
<p>Korea’s economic structure has changed in a trend toward that of an advanced economy. Although the manufacturing sector has been dominating and a source of economic growth for a long period, there has been a recent shift toward the service industry. The sector’s share of both production output and employment is still rising. However, Korea’s service industry, despite its great significance in terms of employment and value-added, is not considered fully advanced. While its role is increasing, its economic share and rate of productivity growth is relatively slow compared with that of other countries. Thus, advancement of the service industry is essential in order to achieve a more prosperous economy. This paper presents the characteristics of Korea’s service industry and suggests strategies for its development.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In recent decades, there has been increasing attention on the role of the service sector in the economy. The service industry makes a key contribution in term of providing economic inputs and employment in many countries. The service economy in 2009 constituted over 50% of the gross domestic product (GDP) in many economies in the world; for instance it accounted for 74.4% of the GDP of the European economy, 79.3% of the GDP in the USA, and even 43.4% in the case of China. As the economy continues to develop, the importance of the service sector continuously increases.</p>
<p>Korea has emerged as one of the world’s major industrialized economies over recent decades through manufacturing and export-oriented development strategies. Although manufacturing is the key industry in Korean economic development, the services industry is developing rapidly.</p>
<p>The service industry’s share in the GDP in Korea has been around 60% since the 1980s. Specifically, the shares of transport, storage, communication and finance, insurance, real estate and business services have increased since the 1970s. Producer service industries provided relatively less input to the manufacturing industry, which revealed in the process of service industries in Korea. Over time, with increasing standards of living, the consumer service sectors in Korea will grow rapidly.</p>
<p>The development of the service industry has raised issues related to the role of and trends in industry in the economy. This paper attempts to answer the following questions: what is the role of the service industry in the economy? What is the service industry? What are the trends in its growth? In the next section, the conceptual issues around the service sector are described, presenting key factors regarding the importance of the sector and highlighting the characteristics of the services industry in the world economy. Following this, the development and characteristics of the service industry in Korea are discussed. Finally, development strategies for the Korean service industry are suggested, followed by conclusions.</p>

<title>Overview of service industry development</title>
<sec id="section3-2233865913486471">
<title>Service industry: conceptual issues</title>
<p>The service sector is relatively difficult to define and to encompass. There are a number of ways to identify the sector, its divisions, its industries and the types of jobs within them. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-2233865913486471">Simmering (2005)</xref>, the general category of the service division includes a wide variety of industries, but can be categorized into primarily consumer-oriented, primarily business-oriented or mixed.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-2233865913486471">OECD (2000)</xref> defines services as a diverse group of economic activities not directly associated with the manufacture of goods, mining or agriculture. They typically involve the provision of human value added in the form of labor, advice, managerial skill, entertainment, training, intermediation and the like. They differ from other types of economic activities in a number of ways. Many cannot be inventoried and must be consumed at the point of production. This is in marked contrast with manufactured products, whose tangible character allows them to be stored, distributed widely and consumed without direct interaction with the entity that produced the good.</p>
<p>The services division can also be explained by its economic activities as physical, intellectual and other experiential activities. Physical activities involve repairing cars, landscaping, cutting hair or preparing a meal. Intellectual activities involve providing education or training, such as at a university or technical institute. Aesthetic activities entail providing consumers with artistic or visual experiences—museums, theater performances, art shows and musical performances are good examples. Finally, other experiential activities involve providing customers with recreation, such as in amusement and theme parks, zoos, camping grounds, and so on.</p>
<p>According to The International Standard Industrial Classification of All Economic Activities (a United Nations system for classifying economic data—ISIC), services include value added in wholesale and retail trade, including hotels and restaurants, transport, government, financial, professional, personal services, health care and real estate services. Imputed bank service charges, import duties and any statistical discrepancies noted by national compilers as well as discrepancies arising from rescaling are also included.</p>
<p>As widely classified, the service industry refers to tertiary industrial activities. That is, it follows the concept of helping or facilitating primary and secondary economic activities. The common practical perspective sees services as, “the activities not directly related to producing materials”, which is the definition accepted by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). It considers the service industry as supporting the primary and secondary industries.</p>
<p>The Korean Standard Industrial Classification (KSIC) was introduced based on the original 1958 version of the ISIC in 1963. The principles of the KSIC closely follow those of the ISIC. The ISIC sets out the principles used in its construction and the criteria relevant to the delineation of the various levels of classification. The main criteria concern the characteristics of the activities of the economic units, which determine the degree of similarity in the way the economic processes are organized by the units. The four principal aspects of the activities considered are as follows: the characteristics of inputs of goods, services and factors of production; the process and technology of production; the characteristics of the goods and services produced; and the use to which outputs are applied.</p>
<p>To the four-digit level, the structure of KSIC (Rev. 9) is very similar to that of ISIC (Rev. 4). However, a fifth digit has been added and the classification categories and code numbers have been adapted to reflect the Korean circumstances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-2233865913486471">UNSD, 2012</xref>). The service industry in the Korean Standard Industrial Classification is subdivided into 14 categories, as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-2233865913486471">Table 1</xref>, such as wholesale and retail, eating and lodging places, transportation, communication and finance.</p>

<title>The importance of the service industry</title>
<p>According to the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-2233865913486471">World Bank (2000b)</xref>, the structure of a developing economy is transformed toward an increase in the manufacture and service industry shares of the GDP, while that of agriculture diminishes. As income increases, the demand for agricultural products, mainly food, reaches its natural limit. Furthermore, owing to technology changes, agricultural productivity increases rapidly, which makes agricultural products relatively less expensive and diminishes their share in the economy. These changes also lead to a downward trend in demand for agricultural labor. At the same time, there are more employment opportunities in the manufacturing and service sectors. As a result, in the first stage of development, manufacturing output will be the major share of GDP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-2233865913486471">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<p>In the next development stage, owing to technological progress, productivity in the manufacturing industry grows rapidly. This increases labor productivity and eliminates jobs. Meanwhile, the demand for services such as education, health and many other areas is rising as income continues to increase. Thus, the service industry expands significantly. Owing to the characteristics of services requiring people rather than machines, the sector’s demand for worker also increases. Since service is labor-intensive, its product prices are high, causing the total value to become large, thus increasing its share in the GDP. This trend leads to the shares of both the agriculture and the manufacturing sectors further diminishing, and eventually, the service sector becomes the leading sector of the economy.</p>
<p>Many services are key inputs to other economic activities. These include infrastructure services such as energy, telecommunications and transportation; financial services that facilitate transactions and provide access to finance for investment; health and education services that contribute to a healthy, well-trained workforce; and legal and accountancy services that are part of the institutional framework required to run a healthy market economy. These services are essential to facilitate growth in other sectors, such as agriculture and manufacturing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2233865913486471">Cali et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Not only are services important for the economy, but they also have a direct impact on social development, providing health and education services. While social services are often run and funded largely by the public sector, increased involvement of the private sector in health service provision could reduce the total burden on public sector resources. Services tends to require more human resources than other sectors. Thus, the demand for an educated labor force grows. As a result, this requires more investment in education. Another benefit of the growing service sector is that, by using fewer natural resources than agriculture and manufacturing, it puts less pressure on the local, regional and global environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-2233865913486471">World Bank, 2000b</xref>).</p>
<p>There have been concerns that the growth and domination of service sector will lead to the loss of the core and tradition roles of the manufacturing sector in the economy. However, the service sector cannot be significantly developed without being based on a strong industrial economy. The manufacturing industry has developed toward an increasing trend to focus on profitable sales and after-service areas. Economic development will be achieved not simply through development of the service industry, but rather by deepening the interdependence of the manufacturing and service industries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2233865913486471">Baker et al., 2008</xref>).</p>

<title>World service industry development</title>
<p>As can be seen from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-2233865913486471">Figure 2</xref>, the service sector since the 1970s has been gradually increasing and becoming the dominant economic activity, while the roles of agriculture and manufacturing have declined. In 2009, the share of the service sector in the world economy has reached around 72%, while manufacturing and agriculture account for approximately 25 and 5%, respectively. This is the nature of economic development: a “powerful historical pathway of structural transformation”, which leads every country to move from agriculture to industry and then to services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-2233865913486471">Timmer and Akkus, 2008</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>As explained in previous section, the decrease in relative prices of basic consumption goods in parallel with the growth of demand for services has resulted in the dominating trend toward the service sector. However, this trend cannot be fully understood without recognizing the role of complex technological and economic transformations, blurring the distinction between manufactured goods and services. The interaction between manufacturing and services, especially of business services, has indeed become stronger and more complex.</p>
<p>Many service activities support the manufacturing sector. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-2233865913486471">Peneder et al. (2001)</xref>, important differentiations have emerged within the service sector, leading some analysts to identify a process of “quaternarisation”, characterized by the rise of sophisticated intermediate services, which are used as inputs by other sectors of the economy.</p>
<p>In order to look at the structure of an economy, comparison of the shares of its three main sectors—agriculture, industry, and services—in the country’s total output and employment is important. Initially, agriculture is a developing economy’s most important sector. As income per capita rises, agriculture loses its primacy, giving way first to a rise in the manufacturing sector, then to a rise in the service sector (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-2233865913486471">Figure 2</xref>). These two consecutive shifts are called industrialization and post-industrialization. Most growing economies are likely to go through these processes, which can be explained by structural economics. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-2233865913486471">Figure 3</xref> shows the share of the service sector as a percentage of GDP in low-, middle- and high-income countries and worldwide. Overall, this share considerably increased for all groups of countries in the period 1990–2010. However, the share of GDP of services for low- and middle-income countries was far below that of high-income countries and worldwide, being about 50% compared with over 70% in 2010.</p>

</fig>
<p>Most countries are in the process of becoming service economies as the share of service industries in economic activities continues to grow. This leads to increasing international trade flows in services (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-2233865913486471">Figure 4</xref>). The figure shows consistent increases in international service trade over time and for all country groups.</p>

</fig>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-2233865913486471">Table 2</xref> shows that employment is shifting out of agriculture and into services, and the service sector accounts for more than 40% of all employment worldwide. This employment can be relatively unskilled, such as in the tourism and retail sectors, thus benefiting the poor in particular. Financial services, tourism, distribution, health and education are all important sectors for developing countries, in terms of their contribution to employment and GDP.</p>

<p>Studies by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2233865913486471">Cali et al. (2008)</xref> indicate that, while some of these services, such as tourism, financial services and transport, already constitute an important proportion of exports for some developing countries, new opportunities are arising in the knowledge service sectors. In the health sector, for example, Indian companies are now providing scanning services for hospitals in the USA, and the Asian tourism sector has reported escalating numbers of patients from developed countries participating in medical tourism. There are also growing opportunities in the provision of information technology (IT)-enabled services, such as call centers, back-office functions and software development, particularly in countries like India, the Philippines, China and South Africa.</p>
<p>As the interdependence of the manufacturing industry deepens, increasing the productivity of the service industry is becoming important as a means of strengthening manufacturing industry competitiveness. Transport, telecommunications, electricity and other key service sectors are crucial not only in terms of absorbing employment, but also as infrastructure for corporate economic activities. With companies now choosing countries for international foreign investments, greater priority is being placed on the productivity of these sectors. Until now, the service industry has generally been regarded as a low-productivity, labor-intensive industry. While it has been growing rapidly as a share of total output, aggregate productivity growth has generally lagged behind that of the goods sector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2233865913486471">Maclean, 1997</xref>). However, the industry embraces a wide range of business types. According to the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2233865913486471">OECD (2001)</xref>, certain service industries are in fact contributing extensively to higher productivity, such as transport, warehousing and telecommunications services in Australia, Finland and Italy, or the wholesale and retail industries in the USA. Service industry innovation has been regarded as less dynamic than in the manufacturing industry, with it simply using the technology developed elsewhere rather than introducing its own innovations. The recent advance in information communications technology, however, has boosted service industry awareness of the importance of technological development and service industry R&amp;D.</p>
<p>The servicelization (the shift to rising dominance of services in the share of overall activity) of the economy implies an increased role of the service industry for any particular economy. Its growth facilitates growth in the rest of the economy. Services such as energy, telecommunications and transportation are important to all sectors of the economy; financial services facilitate transactions and investment; health and education services contribute to a healthy, well-trained workforce; and legal and accountancy services allow the institutional framework that is required to run a successful market economy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-2233865913486471">OECD, 2000</xref>).</p>

<title>The change in structure of the Korean economy</title>
<p>Korea had one of the fastest growing GDPs in the late 20th century. The GDP has increased almost 100-fold, from about US$8 billion to over US$800 billion, in the period 1970–2009, while the per capita Gross National Income (GNI) rose from US$255 to US$17,175 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-2233865913486471">Figure 5</xref>). Korea has gone from being one of the poorest countries in the world to being a high-tech industrialized country. Korea’s economic structure is based on poor natural resources, a small consumer market and an export-oriented development strategy.</p>

<p>In 2009, agriculture contributed just 2.7% to Korea’s GDP, compared with industry at 36.4% and services at 60.7% (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-2233865913486471">Figure 6</xref>). As can be seen from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-2233865913486471">Figure 6</xref>, the Korean economy structure shifted dramatically from agriculture to manufacturing in the 1980s and then to services in the late 1990s. However, since then, this trend has slowed down. The share of the service sector has remained almost unchanged at around 60% of GDP for a decade.</p>

<p>The Korean economic structure has shifted toward that of an advanced economy, indicated by a decrease in industry share, being replaced by services. However, compared with other advanced economy, such as the G7 countries, Korea needs to foster further structural change in its economy. The data from the OECD shows the production shares of the agriculture and industry sectors in Korea, which are higher than those of G7 countries (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-2233865913486471">Table 3</xref>). In particular, these figures are almost double those of the USA. The Korean service sector accounts for a relative lower share compared with G7 countries, especially in finance- and real estate-related activities. This can be explained by the development strategy of Korea, in which industry has been the major engine for economic development since the 1970s. Moreover, in Korea and some other Asian countries the government extensively and intensively intervened in the workings of the banking system, and so the banks often became the ﬁnancing instruments for development plans and industrial policies. The government directly or indirectly exerted inﬂuence on loan-making decisions, and so the prospects of repayment or performance may not have been the primary concern to the banks. Thus, banks had little incentive to develop capacities to perform their basic functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2233865913486471">Hwang et al., 2003</xref>). Although Korea has shifted the economic structure toward a service economy recently, the industry sector has retained a large share of the economy.</p>

<p>On the other hand, employment in the agriculture and manufacturing sectors has continued to decline, according to the data. The share of employment in the country’s agriculture sector against the total stood at 10.6% in 2000, but has recently declined to below the 10% level—7.2% in 2008.

<p>During the period 2004–2009, the employment structure in Korea changed, with a trend toward increasing share of the service sector. The employment shares of both agricultural and industrial sectors decreased gradually, whereas the other service activities showed an increase trend from 20.5 to 27% of total employment in the same period. In total, the service sector accounts for nearly 70% of employment in Korea (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-2233865913486471">Table 5</xref>). Thus, the shift of labor from industry into the service sector reflects the movement of the Korean economy toward becoming an advanced economy.</p>

<p>As discussed above, the Korean service industry has a similar share of total employment compared with G7 countries, accounting for nearly three-quarters of all jobs in the economy. However, considering the output produced by this industry, Korea still lags behind other countries (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-2233865913486471">Table 7</xref>). In Korea, nearly 70% of total labor produces only 60.8% of GDP, whereas this figure in most G7 countries is greater than 70%. The ratio of employment share to production share approximates the productivity of the service industry. According to this, service sector restructuring will be needed for Korea in order to reach the level of productivity in other G7 countries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-2233865913486471">Figure 9</xref>).</p>

<p>Related to the productivity measurements, a simple indicator is the output per worker by industry, which is shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table8-2233865913486471">Table 8</xref>. In general, Korea has become a developed country; however, there is still a gap between Korea and the G7 countries in terms of productivity. The output per worker in Korea is only US$49.7, which is lower than that of G7 countries. Looking at the service industry, this figure is even lower. The output per worker in services in G7 countries is mostly double, or in some cases three times greater than, that in Korea, especially in finance, real estate and business activities. These mean that the value added or created by the service sector is still in limited. The history of the economic development of Korea has shown the dominant role of the industry sector. The shift of the economy from an industrial base toward a service base has taken place only recently. Therefore, the value chain system as well as diversification of the service sector will take time to improve.</p>

<p>Within the service industry, based on Statistics Korea’s service classification (KSIC 2007), the results from the service industry survey conducted in 2009 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table9-2233865913486471">Table 9</xref>) show that wholesale and retail, accommodation and food service, and personal services are the major sub-sectors in terms of number of establishments. Those types of services accounted for over 70% of new business establishment units in 2009. Wholesale and retail, accommodation and food services also create many jobs as their share of employments is approximately 50% of the total. In terms of sale value, wholesale and retail trade is still a leading sector within the service industry.</p>

<p>The period 2001–2009 shows a relatively high growth rate of real estate, business and health services in terms of establishment, sales as well as job creation. in contrast, the corresponding figure of the leading sub-sector, wholesale and retail trade, is the lowest among the 11 sectors. Information and communication services, which are strong in the Korean economy, show a relatively small share in terms of both establishment and worker numbers. However, their sales value is much higher, which implies the efficiency of the sector.</p>
<p>Korea’s economic development over the past 25 years has been based on industrialization, giving priority to manufacturing rather than services. However, since the financial crisis of late 1997, the importance of the service sector has been increasingly recognized. Comprehensive reforms in the service sector were recommended to restore the economy to its previous growth path. The results of the Uruguay Round negotiations and the OECD accession enabled the Korean government to open up its services sector, and the distribution services and business services, among others, were almost completely liberalized. The liberalization of transportation, finance and telecommunication services was then accelerated after the financial crisis in 1997. Thanks to accelerated liberalization, Korea’s trade in services has increased rapidly in recent years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2233865913486471">Kim and Kim, 2003</xref>). While the development of exports in services more or less paralleled the development of the economy between 1996 and 2002, exports of services have grown faster in recent years.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-2233865913486471">Figure 10</xref> shows that, since 1985, the share of the GDP of trade in services has been gradually increasing, reaching a peak in 1998 (14.5%). In 2000–2009, after a slight decline from the peak, the figure again continued to increase rapidly.</p>

<p>A recent empirical study on foreign direct investment (FDI) into Korea’s service industry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-2233865913486471">Yeo et al., 2008</xref>) states that, after the recovery from the economic crisis, it was widely accepted by both academics and government that fostering a high value-added service industry would make a crucial contribution to the second leap-off of the Korea economy. Recognizing the importance of the service industry as an engine of future economic growth, the Korean government fostered key service industries such as producer services, financial services, logistics and professional services. In addition, the Korean government has taken active policy measures to attract inward FDI into the service industry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-2233865913486471">Figure 11</xref>). The wholesale and retail, transport and storage, and business services are regarded as being typical producer services and have high positive coefficients on trade openness and the agglomeration of service FDI.</p>
<p>Considering the economic weight of the service industry in Korea, the R&amp;D proportion is much too low compared with manufacturing and the level of other advanced nations. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-2233865913486471">Park and Shin (2012)</xref>, the R&amp;D intensity of the Republic of Korea’s manufacturing is higher than the OECD average. It is ninth highest out of 33 countries. In contrast, the R&amp;D intensity of the Republic of Korea’s service sector is lower than the OECD average. It is only eighteenth out of 33 countries. Therefore, in the Republic of Korea there are visibly more innovative investments in the manufacturing sector than in the service sector. This may help to explain why services lag behind manufacturing in productivity. Since it has focused mainly on manufacturing, the R&amp;D policy should be modified to provide support considering the unique features of the service industry. The scale of government support for basic R&amp;D fields should be expanded as well.</p>
<p>With the economic structure becoming more sophisticated, Korean economic structure has been increasingly shifting to a more knowledge-based service economy, like those of the USA and European countries. However, the economy still lags far behind developed nations in educational, medical, legal and other knowledge-based services, forcing many Koreans to head overseas and spend billions of dollars every year for more advanced and higher-quality services. In order to nurture the high-value-added services sector as a new growth engine and create jobs, the government should lower the entry barrier for a range of services sectors and promote competition, on top of providing tax breaks and other incentives.</p>
<p>According to the Korea Development Bank Research Institute, Korea’s knowledge-based services industry accounted for only 25% of its GDP in 2006, substantially lower than the OECD average of 42%. Reflecting the nation’s inadequate services infrastructure, businesses and individuals here are taking huge amounts of money out of the country to enjoy an array of advanced services available in foreign countries.</p>
<p>Globalization has affected all facets of the world economy. This includes services, which in most economies are the single largest contributor to economic growth and employment. There have been studies attempted to measure globalization of a country by building a so-called Globalization Index (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-2233865913486471">Samimi et al., 2012</xref>). Most of the indices are composed of four major components: economic integration, personal contact, technology and political engagements. The indicators shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table10-2233865913486471">Table 10</xref> were selected to show the globalization aspects of the service industry in the cases of Korea and G7 countries.</p>

<p>As it can be seen from <xref ref-type="table" rid="table10-2233865913486471">Table 10</xref>, the data for each indicator varies significantly among countries. The USA perform quite well in all individual dimensions, whereas Korea is in the opposite situation, except for the IT indicator, which is one of Korea’s competitive advantages in the world economy. In terms of trade in services, UK and the USA are at the top, while Germany and France are in first and second positions, respectively, for FDI in services. For tourism, France is still a well-known destination, thus it ranks first, followed by the USA and Italy. In term of migrants, Canada is known as a country with a broad immigration policy, which is reflected in Canada’s ethnic diversity. Overall, Korea lags behind G7 countries in most aspects of service globalization.</p>

<title>Development strategy for Korea’s service industry</title>
<p>The service industry has been playing an important role in the Korean economy as it now accounts for over 60% of the economy, whether measured in terms of GDP or employment. The importance of services is expected to increase further owing to the socio-economic structure changes and the globalization of Korea’s manufacturing sector. However, Korea’s service industry, despite its great significance in terms of employment and value added, is not considered to be fully advanced. While the role of the service industry is increasing, its economic share and rate of productivity growth are relatively low compared with other countries. Thus, the advancement of the service industry is vital in order to achieve a more prosperous economy.</p>

<list-item><p>Korean firms have to compete with large-scale foreign firms and well-known international brands in the service industry. This makes it difficult for Korea’s service industries, consisting largely of small and medium-sized firms, to expand into international markets.</p></list-item>

<p>The phenomenon of the integration of manufacturing and service industries poses a great challenge to the traditional theory of operation and management for enterprises. With the development of information technology and companies’ deeper understanding of “customer satisfaction”, a growing number of multinational manufacturers have begun to increase the value of core products through providing services to customers. Service-based manufacturing is becoming the main trend worldwide. A large number of research applications in developed countries show that service-oriented manufacturing industry contributes to the growth of the entire service industry and economic growth.</p>
<p>The production services value chain help to extend the traditional manufacturing value chain as it involves research, advertising, branding, packaging, promotion, distribution, after-sales guarantees and many other areas. However, significant differences exist in the level of integration, speed and methods in different countries. Research into the service-oriented manufacturing model is necessary to address problems in the transformation of the manufacturing industry to improve the core of service-based competition. Based on the characteristics of Korea’s service industry as well as the global trend of service development, the overall framework for the development strategy of Korea’s service industry can be described as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-2233865913486471">Figure 12</xref>.</p>

</fig>
<p>Productivity growth as well as the globalization process in Korea’s service industry still lags behind other those of advanced countries. This can be considered as being due to the poor perception of the service industry by both policy-makers and consumers. As a result, there are a number of obstacles such as entry barriers, unfavorable business environment and limited domestic market, which have hindered the advancement of Korea’s service industry. More importantly, Korea’s service sector has not been significantly exposed to global competition. It is important to demonstrate the benefits to be derived from liberalisation and competition in the services sector. Such benefits may materialise in terms of increased trade in both goods and services, higher inward investment in the service sectors and, above all, better access to services by consumers at lower prices. Recent experience suggests that insufficient liberalisation in service sectors has been detrimental to attracting private foreign investment in Asia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-2233865913486471">OECD, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Another reason may be that the market for service industries is not well developed because of the strong base of the manufacturing industry. Thus, together with further efforts toward regulatory reforms, it is necessary to develop markets that promote competition in order to achieve innovation and productivity improvement in the service industry.</p>
<p>Innovation and productivity growth require the private sector to freely unleash its energy. For this purpose, it is necessary to promote the development of a business environment to facilitate competition with the appropriate allocation of roles between the public and private sectors based on the characteristics of service industries. It is also important to promote innovation and competition through market liberalization. The government can invest more in order to provide incentives for knowledge-based businesses in services. Deregulation would be a core issue for the development of the service industry. It is necessary, however, to guard against the imprudent idea that the less regulation there is, the better. Needless to say, regulation concerning entry barriers and direct controls on prices and licenses should be kept to a minimum in order to allow wider competition. Also unequal treatment of service firms by existing policies should be scrapped.</p>
<p>Korean economic structure has been increasingly shifting to a more knowledge-based service economy. However, the Korean economy still lags far behind other developed nations in knowledge-based services. Since Korea has focused mainly on manufacturing, it is necessary to shift and expand the R&amp;D policy toward the service industry in order to achieve more advanced and higher-quality services. Owing to the deepening interdependence between manufacturing and the service industries, innovation in both industries should be pursued simultaneously. New trends are developing: the manufacturing industry is becoming more service-oriented, while the service industry is being spurred on by the manufacturing industry. Meanwhile, interaction between these two industries continues to intensify. The Government should play an important role in developing or sponsoring innovation networks focused on services. It should utilize or establish a specific kind of R&amp;D institution that can fit the service innovations and be service innovation centers oriented to service industry. These aim to advice about best practice, identify common pitfalls, etc. Firm-level benchmarking, so as to identify and communicate good practices in innovation, and the organization and management of innovation-related activities are also important elements of knowledge transmission for service suppliers.</p>
<p>Service industry requires more human capital than other sectors. Thus, in order to improve the productivity of services, changes should be made to the education system. The fact is that the education system in Korea has been focusing on technology science rather than social science for many decades. Korea’s manufacturing industry has established a strong academic structure that has supporting the significant development of manufacturing industry, whereas the service industry does not have that. Thus, the government should promote communication between industry and educational facilities and support initiatives for establishing this kind of structure for the service industry. In addition, it is necessary to implement policy changes in the education system aimed at curriculum change and a greater research fund as well as relationship enhancement between industry and educational institutions. The government should also develop the research vision and schemes in the service area in order to guide R&amp;D activities in the education system.</p>
<p>Korea is one of advanced countries in terms of IT. Thus, the utilization of IT has allowed the service sector to easily expand in all aspects, such as value added, employment and the consumer network. Furthermore, the use of IT has enabled the real-time verification of users’ assessment of service quality. In order to increase value added and to create new businesses through improving customer satisfaction and service quality, it is important to establish an effective communication system between service providers and consumers and to create cross-sectional benchmarks for quality assessment for the service industry. This will lead to better service quality assessment and promotion of sufficient competition.</p>
<p>An advantage of FDI is the technology spillover effect. Although Korean government has recently taken active policy measures to attract FDI into the service industry, Korean policies have not encouraged FDI in sectors requiring sophisticated technology. Many foreign managers consider that Korea is still reluctant to allow foreign competition on the local market. More broadly, one obstacle to further collaboration between Korean firms and foreign partners is the absence of the notion of win–win situations. This may more particularly hinder R&amp;D alliances and foreign R&amp;D activities, which Korea precisely wants to encourage. Therefore, greater openness to the world economy is another priority to boost productivity in service sector. According to the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-2233865913486471">OECD (2008)</xref>, the stock of FDI in Korea is the third lowest in the OECD countries and inflows have fallen since 2004. Moreover, the share of inward FDI in service sector is the third lowest OECD-wide. Consequently, foreign affiliates accounted for only 8% of service-sector turnover and 4% of employment in 2004, well below the OECD averages of 19 and 10%, respectively. Strengthening international competition requires reduction of the barriers to FDI, including foreign ownership ceilings in key services, and liberalizing product market regulations. In addition, it is important to foster a foreign investment-friendly environment by enhancing the transparency of tax and regulatory policies and reforming the labor market. Moreover, the incentives for foreign investment in Free Economic Zones should be extended more broadly within the service sector. In the area of trade, Free Trade Agreements should be broad-based, including services as well as goods.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Korea’s economic structure has been changed in a trend toward becoming an advanced economy. Although the manufacturing sector has been dominant and a source of economic growth for a long period, there has been a shift from the manufacturing sector toward the service sector. Service industry now accounts for over 60% of the economy, whether measured in terms of GDP or employment This reflects the nature of economic development and is also a result of the recognition of the importance role of the service sector in the economy by Korean policy-makers. However, Korea’s service sector still accounts for a relatively small proportion of the national economy compared with other advanced nations.</p>
<p>Recent research on Korea’s service industry showed various market unfriendly regulations and high entry barriers as well as low productivity, which were identified as weaknesses of the industry. With regard to the current situation of Korea’s service industry, this paper suggests the following policy implications.</p>
<p>In general, together with further efforts for regulatory reforms, it is necessary to further the liberalization and globalization of the markets to promote competition and achieve innovation in order to develop an advanced service industry. Specifically:</p>
<list id="list5-2233865913486471" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>First, it is important to promote innovation and competition through market liberalization. The government can invest more in order to provide incentives for knowledge-based businesses in services. Deregulation is a core issue for the development of the service industry. Regulation concerning entry barriers and direct controls on prices and licenses should be kept minimal in order to allow wider competition.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Second, since Korea has focused mainly on manufacturing, it is necessary to shift and expand the R&amp;D policy toward the service industry in order to achieve more advanced and higher-quality services. Governments should play an important role in developing or sponsoring innovation networks focused on services. Firm-level benchmarking, so as to identify and communicate good practices in innovation, and the organization and management of innovation-related activities, are also important elements of knowledge transmission for service suppliers.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Third, in order to improve the productivity in services, government should implement the policy to improve labor productivity rather than to increase the quantity of human resources. The communication system between industry and educational facilities which has been established for the manufacturing industry should also be developed for the service industry. It is necessary to introduce an incentive system for skilled workers and increase the investment in R&amp;D in services in order to increase labor productivity.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Fourth, the development of IT systems that allow the service sector to easily expand should be focused and utilized. It is important to establish an effective communication system between service providers and consumers and to create cross-sectional benchmarks for quality assessment for the service industry</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Finally, international competition should be strengthened by reducing barriers to FDI, including foreign ownership ceilings in key services, and liberalizing product market regulations. The incentives for foreign investment in Free Economic Zones and Free Trade Agreements should be extended more broadly within the service sector.</p></list-item>
