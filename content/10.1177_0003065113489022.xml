<p>Although the beginnings of “psychological healing” can be traced back several thousand years (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0003065113489022">Jackson 1999</xref>), modern experiential therapy began in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0003065113489022">1895</xref> with Freud and Breuer’s <italic>Studies on Hysteria</italic>. Since then, several hundred forms of psychotherapy have been developed. Most of these will be consigned to the dustbin of history, but cognitive therapy is here to stay. Although the fact is rarely acknowledged, cognitive therapy is developmentally an offspring of psychoanalysis. Aaron Beck was a young psychoanalyst when he discovered that people suffered not only from memories but also from distorted, and often unconscious, beliefs. Even when some toxic beliefs are conscious (“I am evil,” “I am unlovable”), their origins in the past, functions in the present, and consequences for the future are often unknown to the patient. Since Beck’s development of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) in the late 1960s, many studies have demonstrated its efficacy and efficiency. Recently, brain scans have shown changes in brain function after a course of CBT. These findings are difficult to ignore, even for those of us interested in depth psychotherapies that deal with patients’ unique subjectivities. Many, it would seem, have shied away from CBT because of its superficiality in comparison to psychoanalytic treatments. It is important, however, to acknowledge that even superficial procedures, such as the removal of a melanoma, can have life-altering consequences. I believe it is possible to blend psychoanalytic and cognitive analytic treatments, with impressive results in lessening suffering. (Indeed, many experienced clinicians function in this way, even if that is not how they consciously conceptualize their work.) Apparently, despite having been president of the International Association of Cognitive Psychotherapy, so does Robert Leahy, the author of <italic>Overcoming Resistance in Cognitive Therapy</italic>.</p>
<p>Before discussing the book’s many useful points, I want to note two semantic errors, both of them present throughout this volume and widespread in mental health writing and speaking more generally. These errors are also pervasive in society as a whole. Since words are our principal tool, we hamper our work when we use them unclearly. The first error is the confusion of thought and feeling. When people say they feel unlovable, evil, unsafe, hopeless, or helpless, they are speaking not of emotions but of cognitive assessments. Powerful emotions including anxiety, shame, guilt, and self-hate can accompany these assessments, but that does not alter the fact that they are beliefs. For generations we have taught students incorrectly when we have told them to ask if the patient “feels hopeless or helpless.” Hopelessness refers to a belief that nothing positive will happen in the future, and helplessness is the belief that one has no ability to modify current dysphoric circumstances. Since these are cognitions, they can be analyzed as to developmental origin, current function, and future consequence. It is understandable, given the epidemic confusion in society, that patients will confuse thought and feeling, so it is decidedly unhelpful when clinicians continue the muddle. Although Leahy does not do this as much as Burns does in his otherwise admirably clear and useful book on CBT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0003065113489022">1999</xref>), he still makes the error. He writes of the therapist’s desire to “feel competent” (p. 11) or that the patient “would feel victorious,” would focus on “feelings of worthlessness,” or “always felt like she did not get enough attention” (p. 33). These are not feelings but thoughts, and the therapeutic dialogue is greatly weakened by the confusion.</p>
<p>The other error is the gross overuse of the concept of “need.” This may be related to the impact of psychotherapy on the larger society. The psychotherapeutic problem with needs is that they are unanalyzable; food, water, air, and shelter from the cold are imperatives. Most of what concerns us in the consulting room is an infinite combination and permutation of desires, wishes, yearnings, longings, hungers, passions, cravings, etc. When clinicians agree with patients’ mislabeling of wants as needs, they enable the patient to remain unconscious of motives they do not wish to recognize or understand. When people say to their therapist or partner, “I need for you to . . . ,” they really mean they want something but do not think they have a right to ask for it. These need-wish confusions are interpersonally coercive and intrapsychically avoidant. The mislabeling removes crucial psychic phenomena from analytic purview.</p>
<p>Leahy deals with cognitive resistances in treatments that could best be described as cognitive analysis, as they focus much more on thinking than on behavior. His work is clearly an integrative effort. In an introductory chapter he writes, “I have borrowed from psychoanalytic thinking, Bowlby [attachment theory], Piaget, moral philosophy, microeconomic models, cognitive psychology, [and] behavioral models” (p. 15). He demonstrates this synthetic approach throughout the book.</p>
<p>He begins honestly and humbly, noting that “perhaps one out of three patients treated for depression in cognitive therapy shows clinically significant change” (p. 1). He goes on to say that cognitive therapy treatments have recently become far more individualized via case conceptualizations. “Case conceptualization includes an analysis of the patient’s current cognitive schemas, interpersonal problems and behavioral deficits, and excesses <italic>as related to early childhood experience<underline>s</underline></italic>” (p.1; emphasis added). This bears a resemblance to psychodynamic formulation and would clearly give the cognitive therapist a much more subtle understanding of the patient’s development, conflicts, deficits, defenses, and character style. Remarkably for a book on cognitive therapy, he concludes the introduction with a section on countertransference.</p>
<p>The next two chapters are theoretical. He first defines resistance and then examines it from psychoanalytic, behavioral, and cognitive perspectives. Chapter 3, “Resistance to Procedure,” is more cognitively oriented but concludes with sections relevant to all psychotherapeutic work (continuity of appointments, abusive or seductive behavior toward the therapist, splitting the transference, and premature termination). His responses to sexual verbalizations directed to the therapist are to set limits much more quickly than would be done in a psychoanalytic treatment. Except for the most aggressively erotized behaviors, analysts would be more inclined to explore the origins and functions, both intrapsychic and interpersonal, of the behavior rather than quickly proscribing it.</p>
<p>Part II, the heart of the book, is devoted to “dimensions of resistance.” The seven chapters are titled “Validation Resistance,” “Self-Consistency,” “Schematic Resistance,” “Moral Resistance: Compulsive Responsibility,” “Victim Resistance,” “Risk Aversion and Depressive Resistance,” and “Self-Handicapping.” Although these terms are obviously different from what psychoanalytic clinicians would use, they hint at parallels with psychodynamic thinking. Validation issues are similar to issues addressed by self psychology. Self-consistency relates in part to issues we would think pertain to identity. That chapter also introduces the interesting concept of “sunk costs.” The phrase refers to people’s unwillingness after spending significant energy in maladaptive thinking and functioning to change those patterns. Schematic resistance refers to habitual, rigid patterns of thought, the origins of which are usually unconscious. Moral resistance is similar to superego resistance and includes a discussion of obsessional mechanisms. Victim resistance examines a passive-dependent approach to life. Risk aversion and oppressive resistance include examples of the many ways depressed (and anxious) people avoid change. The final chapter of this section, on self-handicapping, delineates types and motives regarding unconsciously self-defeating ways of thinking and the ensuing behavior.</p>
<p>The book’s last section, on cognitive therapy and countertransference, most clearly demonstrates Leahy’s synthetic approach. I think it would be an understatement to say that discussions of countertransference are rare in the CBT literature. It is therefore significant, both theoretically and practically, that Leahy says “countertransference exists, no matter how objective or technique-driven you are as a therapist” (p. 5). By exploring problems related to countertransference, he conclusively establishes his commitment to pragmatism, rather than obsessing about the “purity” of his approach to psychotherapy. He does not distinguish among various forms of countertransference, such as the therapist’s average expectable response to the patient’s transference, as opposed to an idiosyncratic response born of the therapist’s unique past. That would be a bit much to expect in a book by a cognitive analytic author. The important point is that he is clear that pretending that countertransference does not exist will only harm the clinical work. In chapter 11, on evaluating the countertransference, his assessment is congruent with modern psychoanalytic thinking, as he proves that therapy is not done <italic>to</italic> the patient; rather, the therapeutic relationship is co-created by both participants. The penultimate chapter, on using the countertransference, is limited to four topics: countertransference with narcissistic patients, dysfunctional communication patterns and countertransference, dependency demands and countertransference, and the verbally abusive patient. Again, it would not be fair to criticize the limited coverage of countertransference, as this is not a book on that topic. Rather, it augurs well for the future of the experiential therapies that such an integrative work exists. There have been too few such efforts. A swelling tide of integration in psychoanalysis is revealed by the broadening of the psychoanalytic tent to include drive, ego, object, and self approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0003065113489022">Pine 1990</xref>), as well as attachment theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0003065113489022">Wallin 2007</xref>); the recent birth of the journal <italic>Neuropsychoanalysis;</italic> reviews such as this one appearing in <italic>JAPA;</italic> and work by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0003065113489022">Bers (2006)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0003065113489022">Bieber (1980)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0003065113489022">Erdelyi (1985)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0003065113489022">Safran (1998)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0003065113489022">Wachtel (1997)</xref>. We need many more such synthetic efforts to have a comprehensive theory of mental development, functioning, and change. For too long clinicians have functioned as though “all problems were nails because their only tool was a hammer.” Given people’s infinite differences, this obviously can’t work. There wouldn’t be so many therapies if one size fit all.</p>
<p>In summary, the book’s title does not do justice to its breadth. A better title might be <italic>Cognitive Aspects of Resistance in Psychotherapy</italic>. Since so much psychotherapy teaching treats different approaches as “pure cultures,” Leahy’s work is a useful antidote to sectarianism. The book is unquestionably useful for psychotherapy training programs. I’m not sure if it would be useful in the training of psychoanalysts. The only way to determine that would be for psychoanalyst teachers to read it, have their minds tickled and stretched by it, and discuss whether candidates would find it confusing, helpfully enriching, or perhaps both.</p>
