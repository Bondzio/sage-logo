<abstract>
<p>Novel poly(ethylene terephthalate) nanocomposites have been developed, incorporating commercial bottle grade polyester and modified organoclay, which exhibit enhanced thermal and dynamic-mechanical properties and improved foaming behavior. A benefit arising from the use of an organoclay is that this class of material is generally able to withstand the high processing temperatures of engineering polymers, such as poly(ethylene terephthalate), and not undergo decomposition. This offers a great advantage over the use of organic modifiers, whose volatile by-products are known to promote thermal degradation of the polymer matrix under such conditions.</p>
<p>In this work, a novel organoclay was obtained via intercalation of <italic>bis</italic>-(hydroxyethyl terephthalate) in sodium montmorillonite layers and then used to prepare poly(ethylene terephthalate)-clay nanocomposites via melt compounding by using a twin-screw extruder. Thermogravimetric analysis indicated that the onset decomposition temperatures of poly(ethylene terephthalate) nanocomposites incorporating this organoclay were higher than those of controls based on commercial organoclays. However, the inclusion of this new nanofiller also led to a drastic decrease of melt viscosity, which in turn suppressed foaming. In order to compensate for the effects of the viscosity reduction, pyromellitic dianhydride was used in the reactive extrusion process of poly(ethylene terephthalate) nanocomposites. Rheological analysis showed a strong improvement in viscosity of these poly(ethylene terephthalate)/pyromellitic dianhydride/organoclay nanocomposites, to levels of the same order of magnitude as reference commercial foaming grade poly(ethylene terephthalate), or higher. Samples were foamed using carbon dioxide as physical blowing agent in a batch foaming process. Comparison of sample morphology, performed by scanning electron microscopic analysis, indicated very good results in some samples in terms of cellular morphology and foam density.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0021955X12445405" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Polymeric nanocomposite foams are gaining great attention in recent years because they can combine the great potential of nanofillers with the reduced weight of cellular structures to give products with improved specific properties. The combination of functional nanoparticles and foaming technology may lead to a new class of lightweight materials with high strength and multifunctional properties.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021955X12445405">1</xref></sup> In particular, nanofillers offer unique advantages compared to conventional micro-sized particles for controlling the cellular morphology, since it is possible to generate a large number of nuclei with a relatively low particle loading due to the extremely small particle size. The mechanical and functional properties are also very favorable, high aspect ratio and large surface area per unit weight, making these particles desirable as reinforcing elements for cellular structure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021955X12445405">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Among semicrystalline polymers, poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) is very interesting due to its combination of low cost coupled with good mechanical properties (e.g., Young's modulus, yield strength) – and functional attributes (e.g., chemical resistance, thermal stability). This commends PET for diverse uses in industrial applications such as the reinforcement of textiles, fibers, tires and rubber goods and for food and beverage packaging. Recently, the production of foamed PET as the core element for sandwich structures, or as sheets for thermal insulation applications and packaging, has engendered increasing interest, mainly due to the wide temperature range it accommodates through its high melting temperature (<italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub>) and the presence of a crystal phase, which improves solvent resistance and mechanical properties. However, its use in technical engineering applications is limited by its slow crystallization rate, which can reduce the productivity in industrial processes. Attempts to foam bottle- or fiber-grade PET were unsuccessful when continuous processing techniques, such as extrusion, were used. This was mainly due to (a) the low extensional viscosity of the polymer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021955X12445405">3</xref></sup> (strictly related to the melt strength) which leads to the formation of large bubbles during the foaming process as a result of the coalescence of small cells and (b) the slow crystallization rate, hindering fast stabilization of the cellular structure and allowing collapse of cells. It is well-known that high melt viscosity is necessary for the formation of stable bubbles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021955X12445405">3</xref></sup> and, as a consequence, PET copolymers and PET grades with intrinsic viscosity in excess of 1.0 g/dl should be used to overcome these limits, but the low productivity of melt rigradation processes resulted in increased polymer production costs. The increase of extensional viscosity can be successfully obtained by using a chain extender such as PMDA,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0021955X12445405">4</xref></sup> but this reactive process must be carefully managed to avoid gel formation in the polymeric matrix.</p>
<p>Many attempts have been made in literature to prepare PET/layered silicate nanocomposites to exploit the potential of nanofillers in PET foams.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0021955X12445405">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0021955X12445405">6</xref></sup> It is well documented in scientific literature that sodium montmorillonite (Na<sup>+</sup>MMT) dispersed in a matrix polymer leads to increased mechanical properties of the resulting composite.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0021955X12445405">7</xref></sup> The addition of layered silicates can also lead to enhancement of functional properties, such as improved gas barrier<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0021955X12445405">8</xref></sup> and flame resistance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021955X12445405">9</xref></sup> Moreover, clay nanoparticles may act as nucleating agents for bubble generation in foams as demonstrated in both discontinuous (such as the batch technique<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0021955X12445405">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021955X12445405">11</xref></sup>) or continuous (such as the polymer extrusion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021955X12445405">1</xref></sup>) foaming processes. The main technique employed to produce polymer nanocomposites is melt compounding, due to its high productivity and to the absence of solvents and monomers which have environmental and cost disadvantages. The high deformation rates employed in extrusion compounding improve the dispersion of nanoparticles in the molten polymer matrix, by breaking clay aggregates into smaller tactoids,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0021955X12445405">12</xref></sup> and then either intercalating polymer chains into clay platelets, to give intercalates nanocomposite, or completely destructuring the lamellar stacks to give exfoliation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0021955X12445405">13</xref></sup> The efficiency of nanoclay dispersion, intercalation and/or exfoliation in a polymeric matrix depends on several parameters, related to the polymer properties and the chemical structure of the clay. Strain is a key factor in breaking the clay aggregates,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0021955X12445405">14</xref></sup> but the chemical affinity of polymer and clay is the main responsible for the level of exfoliation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0021955X12445405">15</xref></sup>: if the compatibility between polymer and clay is low, processing conditions would not influence the extent of intercalation in the nanocomposite.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0021955X12445405">16</xref></sup> Because of the hydrophilic nature of clay, polymers with low polarity cannot be intercalated in unmodified clays and it is necessary to improve the compatibility between the two phases by the surface modification of the clay with the addition of surfactants. Conventionally, hydrated Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> ions of pristine-layered silicate are ion-exchanged with cationic surfactants, such as alkylammonium or alkyphosphonium cations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0021955X12445405">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0021955X12445405">19</xref></sup> to produce organoclay characterized by improved compatibility with hydrophobic polymer matrix.</p>
<p>PET/organomodified clay nanocomposites cannot be prepared through conventional melt blending techniques, since the processing temperature of PET is higher than the thermal stability of commercial organoclays containing alkylammonium or alkyphosphonium cations as platelets intercalant.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0021955X12445405">20</xref></sup> In order to prevent PET/organoclay nanocomposites degradation, much attention has been directed toward the development of improved organophilic treatments for layered silicates. As suggested in the literature,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0021955X12445405">21</xref></sup> when the organoclay is exfoliated or intercalated with the polymer, a general decreasing in its viscosity occurs, due to chain scission promoted by surfactant during melt compounding process. This phenomenon combines with the low shear and elongational viscosities and the low melt strength of PET, which further prevent it from being foamed by common processing technologies such as gas extrusion foaming, and complex and expensive procedures have to be used.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0021955X12445405">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>In this work, we propose a direct exchange of Na<sup>+</sup> in MMT platelets with the monomer component of PET, <italic>bis</italic>-(hydroxyethylterephthalate) (BHET). In order to balance viscosity reductions, pyromellitic dianhydride (PMDA) was used as a chain extender to increase the molecular weight of the PET/organoclay nanocomposites by reactive extrusion process, since it has a melting point (about 283°C) near to that of PET<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0021955X12445405">23</xref></sup> and readily reacts during PET processing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0021955X12445405">24</xref></sup> The effect of molecular weight increase, through chain extension or branching, on the foaming properties of the matrices prepared were investigated by means of the batch foaming technique, using carbon dioxide as blowing agents.</p>

<p>Organically modified MMT (NaMod) was prepared by intercalation of BHET into clay galleries, according to the following procedure: 10 g of BHET were dissolved in 200 ml of ethanol at room temperature; 6.0 g of Na<sup>+</sup>MMT were suspended in 300 ml of distilled water and stirred for 30 min at 70°C. BHET solution was poured into the Na<sup>+</sup>MMT suspension and stirred for 3 h at 70°C. Solvents were subsequently evaporated by means of rotary evaporator, at 75–80°C for about 90 min. Once made solid, the powder was dried in a vacuum oven at 250°C for 30 min and milled in a porcelain mortar.</p>
<p>PET nanocomposites were prepared via melt compounding through extrusion using a counter-rotating twin screw extruder (D = 25 mm and L/D = 25) equipped with a four-zone temperature control. The residence time, which influences the extent of the PMDA reaction as verified during preliminary extrusion activities, was measured with a dark tracer and was managed by setting the polymer flow rate, using a volumetric feeder attached to the hopper and controlling the extruder screw speed. Before melt compounding, the chain extender, the PET and the clay were mechanically mixed (according to the formulation) and vacuum-dried overnight at 120°C to remove the excess moisture.</p>
<p>All foam samples were produced by using about 0.5 g of polymer. Two samples for each PET grade were enclosed in the pressure vessel at room temperature and kept at 120°C overnight and vacuum-dried by means of a vacuum pump. The blowing agent, carbon dioxide, was inserted into the vessel at the pressure of 60 bar after cooling at room temperature. The temperature was then raised to and kept at 300°C for 35 min to erase the previous thermal history.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0021955X12445405">15</xref></sup> The dissolving of the sample was then performed at 250°C and 75 bar for 30 min. The foaming temperature for all samples was evaluated from differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) scans as the temperature at least 10°C higher than the onset temperature for melt crystallization. At the end of dissolution, the temperature was quenched at –20°C/min to the desired value and a pressure quench was applied to samples down to atmospheric pressure. The measurement of apparent density of foamed sample was performed using an hydrostatic balance according to the ASTM D792 standard.</p>

<p>Thermal stability of nanocomposites was studied by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The weight loss caused by the degradation at high temperature was monitored as a function of temperature. Measurements were performed by a TA Instruments (New Castle, DE, USA) TGA Q5000.

<p>Thermal and crystallization behaviors were studied using a DSC-Q1000 differential scanning calorimeter from TA Instruments.

<p>Different processing conditions were investigated to maximize the intercalation of clay with the polymer macromolecules (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0021955X12445405">Table 2</xref>). The screw speed ranged between 40 and 70 rpm, the resulting residence times ranging between 180 s and 107 s. In order to limit the thermal degradation of PET, occurring at long residence times, and to assure enough time for the nanofiller intercalation, the screw speed was then fixed at 55 rpm. The temperature profile for the different heating zones was selected in order to maximize the measured torque and to keep the melt temperature in the extruder metering zone equal to 283°C.

<p>As the amount of clay increased, a decrement of the measured torque values was observed with respect to neat PET, regardless of residence time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0021955X12445405">Figure 1</xref>). This behavior was confirmed by rheological tests, as described below. In order to avoid viscosity drop during processing, a chain extender (PMDA) was used,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0021955X12445405">4</xref></sup> and new formulations based on non-modified, commercial and BHET-modified clays were produced. The chain extension induced by the PMDA was able to compensate the negative effect on melt viscosity induced by the thermal treatment above 280°C and by the presence of the organoclay modifier. The chain extension was not equally effective for all compositions, and the clay never allowed an increase of the torque with respect to the neat polymer value.

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0021955X12445405">Figure 2</xref> also shows the XRD diagram for Na<sup>+</sup>MMT and different samples of PET_NaMod hybrids. A careful observation of curves (a) and (b) reveals the presence of very small and broad diffraction peaks corresponding to the same diffraction angles on pristine unmodified Na<sup>+</sup>MMT. The low peak intensity reflects the reduced amount of clay in the composites, respectively, 1% and 3% for curves (a) and (b). The experimental results highlighted that no effective variations in the d-spacing were achieved by melt compounding, due to the poor compatibility between the two phases. In addition, the reduction of the viscosity of the nanocomposite matrices, and consequently of the polymer molecular weight, decreased the ability to transfer shear stresses during extrusion, preventing the intercalation of polymer into the clay platelets.</p>
<p>The effect of viscosity of the polymer matrix on the process of intercalation/exfoliation was highlighted in a work by Fornes et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0021955X12445405">25</xref></sup> Different shear levels play an important role during the melt compounding of nanocomposites. Initially, the stress should help breakup large organoclay particles into dispersed stacks of silicate tactoids. Further down the extruder, transfer of stress from the molten polymer to the silicate tactoids is believed to shear them into smaller stacks of silicate platelets. Finally, individual platelets peel apart through a combination of shear and diffusion of polymer chains in the organoclay gallery. The polymer viscosity (as a result of its molecular weight) is a critical parameter during melt compounding, since high melt viscosity exerts a greater stress on the tactoids.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0021955X12445405">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the case of composites filled with NaMod organomodified clay, a marked reduction in d-spacing values in comparison with NaMod powder were obtained (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0021955X12445405">Table 3</xref>). This behavior was attributed to the higher compatibility of BHET monomer with the polymer matrix rather than to the clay. This led to partial migration of BHET from clay galleries toward the matrix, consequently reducing the interlamellar distance. The use of both Na<sup>+</sup>MMT and NaMod clays did not result in fully intercalated structures for PET-based nanocomposites.</p>
<p>Hydrolytic and thermal degradations during melt compounding process of the PET matrix lead to a reduction in the molecular weight and viscosity, also reducing mechanical properties and processability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0021955X12445405">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0021955X12445405">27</xref></sup> The property deterioration of PET may be compensated by addition of chain extender, as pyromellitic dianhydride (PMDA), capable of a rapid reaction between polymeric chains end groups.</p>
<p>The X-ray diffractograms of PET-organoclay nanocomposites obtained by reactive extrusion are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0021955X12445405">Figure 3</xref>. Addition of different PMDA weight percentages affects nanocomposite morphology, as demonstrated by a shift toward lower 2θ values, in comparison to the PET_NaMod (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0021955X12445405">Table 4</xref>). These observations indicate that the inter-lamellae distance expanded, and that polymer chains intercalated the clay galleries, due to increased shear stress transfer from the modified PET matrix to the clay particles.

<p>Plots showing the weight loss percentage vs. temperature for Cloisite 25A and NaMod are reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0021955X12445405">Figure 4</xref>. The onset degradation temperature of NaMod is higher than commercial organoclay Cloisite 25A. Weight loss curves are quite complex, revealing multiple phenomena for both NaMod and Cloisite 25A. In the first case, at least two distinct steps in weight loss can be identified. The first step is associated with the evolution of ethylene glycol as volatile condensation reaction byproduct (onset at 220°C). The second weight loss step, starting at 400°C, corresponds to thermal decomposition of organic compound. In the case of Cloisite 25A, a more complex mechanism is evident. Three different degradation phenomena start at about 215, 270 and 320°C, respectively.

<sec id="sec16-0021955X12445405"><title>Rheological characterization</title>
<p>The rheological behavior of the PET nanocomposites was compared to that of the foaming grade PET in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0021955X12445405">Figure 6(a)</xref>. The presence of clay resulted in a viscosity reduction in particular when the organic modifier was present; a similar result has been already evidenced in the literature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0021955X12445405">8</xref></sup> The presence of organomodified fillers, causing depolymerization of polyester matrix, reduces the molecular weight and in turn lowers the viscosity. A further contribution to viscosity reduction in the prepared nanocomposites was probably induced by the plasticizing effect of BHET. On the contrary, the addition of PMDA to bottle grade PET caused a strong increase in viscosity, recovering values being comparable (for 0.15% by weight) or, for some formulations, higher than those exhibited by foaming grade PET (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0021955X12445405">Figure 6(b)</xref>).

<p>The effects on the viscosity of the addition of PMDA to nanocomposite formulations demonstrated that this is a viable approach to compensate the degradation induced by the presence of clay. The increased rheological properties in ternary nanocomposites (PET-PMDA-nanofiller) were responsible for the higher mechanical stresses applied to tactoids during the extrusion process, and in turn for the better intercalation (as confirmed by XRD analysis shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0021955X12445405">Figure 3</xref>).</p>

<p>The pyromellitic dianhydride (PMDA) does not affect viscoelastic behavior of the PET-PMDA blends, as has also been reported in literature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0021955X12445405">23</xref></sup> The value of the storage modulus at low temperatures for a PET-chain extender blend was of the same order of magnitude as that of the neat PET.

Average cell size and cell size distribution were evaluated by means of SEM. The morphology was comparable to, if not better than, that shown by the reference foam grade PET. This behavior was related to the viscosity values exhibited by the different samples, as measured in rheological tests. It is evident that the higher the sample viscosity, the more uniform was the cell size. This was direct evidence that the viscosity was the controlling factor for cellular structure, allowing cell stabilization and avoiding coalescence of small cells into large ones during their growth.

<p>An innovative organoclay was prepared via intercalation of BHET in Na<sup>+</sup>MMT layers and was used for the preparation of nanocomposites based on a low-viscosity (bottle grade) PET via melt compounding. The nanocomposites prepared with the new nanofiller exhibited higher thermal stability compared to those prepared with the commercial one (Cloisite 25A from Southern Clay, USA), as confirmed by TGA performed on different formulations. The presence of nanofillers led to a drastic decrease of nanocomposite viscosity during the extrusion process, due to the lowering of the molecular weight of the polymeric matrix. The rheological properties of nanocomposites were inferior to those of neat PET. This affected the intercalation of the nanofiller, mainly because of the reduction of the mechanical stresses applied by the molten polymer to the silicate tactoids. As also confirmed by the XRD analysis, the nanofiller was only marginally intercalated.</p>
<p>In order to contrast the macromolecular degradation induced by the presence of nanofiller coupled with that due to the processing temperature, a chain extender –PMDA – was added during melt blending. This addition of PMDA was found to be an effective means of increasing the viscosity of nanocomposite matrices. This was confirmed by rheological tests, in particular for materials in which the innovative organoclay had been incorporated. In ternary nanocomposite systems (PET-PMDA-NaMod), the increased viscosity induced an improvement of the nanofiller dispersion and intercalation, compared to binary (PET-organoclay) nanocomposites. The better dispersion of nano-reinforcement resulted in a significant increase in storage modulus, up to about 50% for samples containing higher PMDA content, compared to the values for neat and foam grade PET. It was also demonstrated that coupling of the innovative organoclay and chain extender enabled production of foams with a cellular morphology comparable to that of the commercial foam grade PET, but which also exhibited increased dynamic mechanical response and markedly increased thermal stability of the matrix.</p>
