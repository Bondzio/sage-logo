<abstract>
<p>Although the modern pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) has followed general pediatrics and adopted the family-centered care model, little is known about how families prospectively experience PICU care. The authors' goal was to better understand the experiences of families whose child was hospitalized in a PICU. They conducted a 12-month prospective ethnographic study in a PICU in a tertiary care hospital in a large North American urban center. Data were obtained via participant-observation and formal and informal interviews with 18 families and staff key informants. Findings revealed a disconnect between the espoused model of family-centered care and quotidian professional practices. This divergence emerged in the authors' analysis as a heuristic that contrasts a professional “office” to a sick child’s “bedroom.” PICU practices and protocols transformed the child into a patient and parents into visitors; issues such as noise, visitation, turf, and privacy could favor staff comfort and convenience over that of the child and family. The authors' discussion highlights suggestions to overcome this divergence in order to truly make the PICU family centered.</p>

<title>Background</title>
<p>Despite vast advances in health policies and technologies, and the concomitant decrease in childhood morbidity and mortality worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1367493511430678">Rajaratnam et al., 2010</xref>), the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) remains an essential component of pediatric care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1367493511430678">Namachivayam et al., 2010</xref>). Even in wealthy nations, children still fall gravely ill and experience traumatic injury needing intensive care; furthermore, admissions for complex chronic conditions are increasing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1367493511430678">Namachivayam et al., 2010</xref>). Pediatric practice has evolved over the last few decades from a paternalistic model in which the health-care provider “knew best” to one which is now “family-centered” with parents as partners in care planning and delivery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1367493511430678">American Academy of Pediatrics, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1367493511430678">Johnson, 2000</xref>). The modern PICU has followed suit, responding to the family-centered care model in the delivery of care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1367493511430678">Frazier et al., 2010</xref>). The core principles of such a family-centered care model are the “understanding that the family is the child’s primary source of strength and support and that the child’s and family’s perspectives and information are important in clinical decision making” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1367493511430678">American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Hospital Care, 2003</xref>: 691). Principles of family-centered care extend beyond family involvement in decision making and include family input into other aspects of health care such as into how systems work and architectural elements of facility design. Importantly, PICU care differs from other realms of pediatric care: The acuity of the care and the higher possibility of the admission ending in the death of a child (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1367493511430678">Ramnarayan et al., 2007</xref>) means that PICUs have a distinct position vis-à-vis the family and family-centered care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1367493511430678">Macnab et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1367493511430678">Tomlinson et al., 2002</xref>). An explicit inclusion of family in PICU practice is increasingly being demonstrated proactively through orientation booklets, open visiting policies, parent bed spaces, and sibling inclusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1367493511430678">Giannini and Miccinesi, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1367493511430678">Giganti, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1367493511430678">Lilly, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1367493511430678">Rozdilsky, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1367493511430678">Smith et al., 2007</xref>). While literature suggests PICUs are increasingly incorporating family-centered care into their practice, an important question remains: How is the modern PICU actually <italic>experienced</italic> by families of critically ill children?</p>
<p>Research to date on parental experience of the PICU spans several broad areas, including research on interventions to improve communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1367493511430678">Braner et al., 2004</xref>); parental distress, including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1367493511430678">Balluffi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1367493511430678">Colville et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1367493511430678">Mu and Tomlinson, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1367493511430678">Nelson and Gold, In press</xref>); parental needs during their child’s stay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1367493511430678">Farrell and Frost, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1367493511430678">Meert et al., 2008</xref>); parental involvement in critical incidents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1367493511430678">Frey et al., 2009</xref>) and end of life care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1367493511430678">Carnevale et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1367493511430678">Meert et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1367493511430678">Meyer et al., 2006</xref>); and research comparing staff perceptions to parental perceptions of PICU practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1367493511430678">Latour et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Better understanding the complexity of the PICU environment means that a variety of research approaches will be needed. To date, research on parental perspectives has been based mostly upon questionnaires, Likert-type scales, and retrospective accounts after the child has been discharged or has died. Assessing parental perspectives of the PICU using such methods helps weave together diverse strands of understanding. Nonetheless, there remains a paucity of in-depth prospective data on how the PICU is experienced by patients and families. The aim of this study was to contribute to this research domain by examining the experience of families whose children were hospitalized in a PICU using in-depth prospective qualitative methods.</p>

<title>Methodology</title>
<p>In order to better understand the prospective experiences of families of critically ill children in a PICU, we undertook an ethnographic study. Ethnography is a qualitative research methodology designed to understand lived experience as embedded in a sociocultural context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1367493511430678">Sinuff et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section3-1367493511430678">
<title>Setting, participants, and procedures</title>
<p>Using participant-observation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1367493511430678">Dewalt and Dewalt, 2002</xref>), and formal and informal interviewing, we spent 12 months in the PICU in order to better achieve a holistic understanding of family experience as lived in a tertiary care PICU. The PICU in our study was a combined medical-surgical unit and trauma referral center with 12 beds (four isolation rooms, eight beds in an open space) and 500 admissions per year. Services included postoperative cardiac care and an extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) program. The average length of stay was 6 days with a 7% mortality rate. This PICU was within a 160-bed freestanding pediatric hospital in a North American city of three million and was Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) accredited with a fellowship training program. This unit was a leader in North America for developing family-centered care in the 1980s and was one of the first to implement a 24-hour “open visiting policy” for families, starting in the mid-1980s.</p>
<p>We purposely recruited families of children needing high-acuity care in order to target those whose stay would most likely be protracted and therefore who would be more able to provide extensive data. Children (to 18 years) admitted to the PICU were eligible for inclusion if their Daily Estimate of Mortality Risk (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1367493511430678">Figure 1</xref>) was rated as high or very high for 3 days (minimum) during one admission. The estimate of mortality was completed daily for each child by the attending physician. Parents were then approached by a staff nurse for recruitment, and if verbal agreement was given, parents were then approached by an on-site researcher who explained the study and obtained written consent. Families were excluded in cases where there were pending legal issues. Staff, including physicians, nurses, and allied health-care workers, were recruited into the study as key informants, that is, to help understand the cultural context of the PICU and how the families fit into that context.</p>

</fig>
<p>A researcher and research assistant (RA) were present in the PICU on weekdays, occasional evenings, and weekends. Data collection included such activities as observing morning rounds with various team members (e.g. attending and consultant physicians, nurses, social workers, physiotherapists, ethicists, pastoral workers, music therapists), attending family meetings, and conducting formal and informal interviews with recruited family members. Interviews occurred at a location chosen by the family member (e.g. at the bedside, in the cafeteria, in a private office). Researchers also had permission to view recruited patient charts. Data from participant-observation were transcribed into three kinds of fieldnotes: methodological, theoretical, and personal reflections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1367493511430678">Emerson et al., 1995</xref>); audio-recorded interviews were transcribed verbatim.</p>

<sec id="section4-1367493511430678">
<title>Analysis of data and rigor</title>
<p>Data analysis included case-by-case as well as cross-case analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1367493511430678">Ayres et al., 2003</xref>); the family and treating team together were considered a case. A contextual analysis was also conducted in order to create an understanding of the PICU’s sociocultural environment in which to embed the case analyses. Member checking of the preliminary analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1367493511430678">Giacomini and Cook, 2000</xref>) was done with staff and families inside the institution as well as via research presentations to PICU staff in two other North American centers; the analysis was then refined based upon the feedback. Criteria for methodological rigor were applied using established methods for qualitative research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1367493511430678">Carnevale, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1367493511430678">Sandelowski, 1986</xref>): an audit trail was maintained via detailed fieldnotes; audio-recorded interviews were transcribed by an outside professional; and data and investigator triangulation were built into the design, including an assortment of data collection methods, and supervisory meetings were held during which the researchers—both trained in medical anthropology and neither with prior clinical experience—and an advisory committee (including a physician, an experimental psychologist in palliative care, and two doctorally-prepared nurse-researchers with clinical experience in pediatrics) discussed raw data and analysis. The human subject protocol for this project was approved by the hospital’s Institutional Review Board.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>A total of 25 families were eligible for recruitment, of which 18 participated (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1367493511430678">Table 1</xref>). Reasons for nonparticipation included patients whose family members were not present at the hospital, and families who were “too busy,” “overwhelmed,” or “not interested.” No family withdrew from the study.</p>

<p>Twelve months of observing the quotidian practices in the PICU produced a large volume of data, with more themes than can be explored in one manuscript. The findings presented in this paper are drawn specifically from data collected via participant-observation and pertain to the challenges of integrating families into the sociocultural context of the PICU. Related findings have been presented elsewhere (Carnevale,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1367493511430678">1997</xref>; Macdonald, et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1367493511430678">2008</xref>; Macdonald, et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1367493511430678">2005</xref>; Macdonald and Murray <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1367493511430678">2007</xref>; Macdonald, et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1367493511430678">2006</xref>).</p>

<title>Overarching frame: The office versus the bedroom</title>
<p>Our analysis reveals an important divergence between the espoused practices of family-centered care as theorized and described in the pediatric literature, and the lived experiences of family members in the PICU. Helping to make sense of this divergence, a heuristic emerged in our analysis: <italic>the Office versus the Bedroom</italic>. On one hand, the PICU becomes for family members a substitute bedroom for their sick child. Notwithstanding family-specific narratives, an idealized “sick child’s bedroom” conjures imagery such as warm blankets, a familiar environment, soft lighting, and music in effort to encourage healing and recovery. On the other hand, the water-cooler office-like atmosphere in the PICU presents cultural aspects of daily practice that stand in stark relief. The office culture of the PICU is present in overt as well as implicit ways. For example, in the center of the PICU is a work station with material representations of office culture: computers, telephones, trade books, bulletin boards with announcements, and a coffee pot and snacks for staff. In addition are the related behaviors of office culture: It is not uncommon to see staff around this central work station conversing about the weather or sports statistics, eating snacks, laughing, and telling jokes. Fieldnote Excerpt 1 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1367493511430678">Table 2</xref>) captures overlapping staff conversations observed in this context.</p>

<p>While the PICU is neither an office nor bedroom, using this overarching heuristic allows us to express the divergence in the data between professional practices and family experiences. This analysis parses into two main themes, together suggesting that the goals of family-centered care may be greatly challenged by quotidian practice in the PICU.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1367493511430678">
<title>Theme Number 1: Transformation: From a “child and parent” to a “patient and visitor”</title>
<p>Once admitted to the PICU, a typical sequence of events unfolds as described in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1367493511430678">Table 3</xref>. As this case outlines, in aiming to optimize the child’s biomedical outcome, critical care is structured around a complete regulation of the physical body of the patient. Sedation, restraints, manipulation, and penetration together are part of the life-sustaining technologies used on and in the child. Notwithstanding staff concerns and focused efforts to the contrary, children are transformed from embodied subjects—active social beings—into medicalized objects laid flat on their backs on a stretcher. In so doing, the child becomes “the patient.”</p>

<td>An 8-month-old boy arrives in the PICU from emergency in respiratory distress. He is crying and thrashing vigorously. He is breathing through an oxygen mask. Two nurses lift him from his crying mother to a stretcher. The nurses hold him down: one tries to apply the electrocardiogram stick-on electrodes, while the other looks for a vein to begin the intravenous infusion. This is an “uncooperative” patient; within minutes the nurses have tied both his arms to the stretcher. The mother stands in the background, weeping quietly but staying out of the way. The child becomes motionless, limp and his skin turns cyanotic. Four physicians arrive in moments, along with a respiratory technologist. The mother is “asked” to leave because they are going to do an emergency intervention. The curtains are pulled around the bed. An endotracheal tube is inserted and in a few minutes the child is pink, and his “combatant” or “resistant” behavior begins again. The child is given a number of medications to control this resistance. The child still resists and is then given a muscle relaxant to block his voluntary motor function.<break/>The child is now motionless and quiet. The muscle relaxant is stopped in a few hours; other sedatives are adjusted to keep him sufficiently quiet and immobile to maintain the mechanical ventilation. He lies on his stretcher, motionless, for the next three days. His parents visit 4-6 hours/day, talking quietly, touching his head, or stroking his skin. Some hours pass without any human touch; others are filled with chest physiotherapy, chest auscultation, nurses changing his position, blood drawn for testing.</td>

<p>What happens to a parent as the process unfolds? The mother weeping in the background is displaced from her former position as the child’s central guardian and nurturer and placed in the position of helpless observer. She is “asked” to leave the room. Our fieldwork confirms other PICU literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1367493511430678">Just, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1367493511430678">Meyer et al., 1998</xref>) that suggests that as this process unfolds, families can be thrown into an emotional unraveling and role ambiguity as they are displaced from being family, and replaced into the role of “visitors.” As this transition occurs, family members experience a host of emotions. Being asked to leave the room of a critically ill child is not a benign act. In our data, one of the most hurtful and difficult acts parents experienced was to be treated as a visitor and removed from their child’s bedside.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1367493511430678">
<title>Theme Number 2: The “family” in family-centered care</title>
<sec id="section10-1367493511430678">
<title>Turf and control of space</title>
<p>The data make it clear that families were actively encouraged by staff to personalize the bedside of their child. For example, they were told to bring blankets, toys, and pajamas from home and to tape photos or drawings on the walls near the bedside. Such acts help bring to staff the “humanness” of the family they are caring for as well as reassure families that the child is not just a patient but remains their child. This personalizing contributes to lessening the child’s displacement to the role of patient and the family’s displacement to the role of visitor; furthermore, it may contribute to family coping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1367493511430678">Macnab et al., 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>Notwithstanding such efforts, the child’s bed was clearly not the family’s property. The bed belongs to staff: Staff lean on the beds during rounds, place their clipboards on the bed rails while writing notes, and often jiggle the sedated child in the process. Beds are also used to store excess medical supplies as Fieldnote Excerpt 2 describes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1367493511430678">Table 2</xref>).</p>
<p>Furthermore, while staff actively create ways that family members can have access to their child, an unspoken condition is placed on this access. Nurses, for example, usually work on the patient’s right side; consequently, family members must visit from the left. Family members are reminded that they must not touch any of the equipment attached to and monitoring their child, and there is no space for a parent to lie beside their child on the bed. In contrast, while family members are expected to respect the equipment and stay out of the way, staff can be quite relaxed with the child’s bed and the technology, using the space as if it was their own property, as described in Fieldnote Excerpt 3 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1367493511430678">Table 2</xref>).</p>
<p>According to the sign on the door to the PICU, only “immediate family” are allowed in to be with the child; furthermore, only two “visitors” are allowed at the bedside at one time. This rule is intended to help ensure patient confidentiality and to maintain crowd control. In so doing, the PICU defines who counts as integral to this child’s life and also whose life this child is integral to. In contrast, while there are restrictions on which family members enter the PICU, staff not associated with the unit walk through as a shortcut to other parts of the hospital. Furthermore, groups of rounding staff can reach up to 15 members walking from bedside-to-bedside each morning and afternoon, spending upward of 30 minutes discussing a child’s case and making use of teachable moments to educate trainees.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1367493511430678">
<title>Comfort and accommodation</title>
<p>Standing beside a sick patient for an extended period of time can be exhausting for staff and family. When available, family members will be offered a chair to sit upon and sometimes will be brought a rocking chair if their child can be removed safely from the bed. Chairs are hard to come by in this PICU, however, and can be jealously guarded by both families and staff as demonstrated in Fieldnote Excerpt 4 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1367493511430678">Table 2</xref>). One mother told us that she would strategize daily about how to get a chair and stay sitting on it to ensure that no one took it, while another spoke about finding a short backless stool that she and her husband alternated sitting upon. While this stool did not allow her to be at her child’s eye level, it did give her some relief from standing. It is important to note that this mother was not complaining; she was grateful to have the chance to stay by her child’s bed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1367493511430678">
<title>Noise levels</title>
<p>Visitors to the PICU are expected to keep noise levels to a minimum and is ostensibly one reason behind the “two family members per child” visitation policy. This PICU was noisy and active with humming ventilators, beeping intravenous pumps, and 24-hour illumination, and the actual largest contributor to noise was staff voices. While staff conversations were elevated during emergencies; this noise was mostly the everyday buzz of a busy office. We observed that the PICU was often so noisy that during morning rounds the attending physician would ask peripheral nonrounding staff to reduce their speaking volume so the rounding group could hear the case presentation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1367493511430678">
<title>Confidentiality and privacy</title>
<p>Confidentiality and privacy are central tenets of biomedical ethics. In keeping with this imperative, family behavior is monitored in the name of privacy. Family members are told to keep close to the bedside to ensure that they are out of the auditory and visual fields of private information being discussed or written at patient bedsides or at the central station. Maintaining confidentiality is challenging given that the majority of patients are in a central room where there are no walls between beds. The only physical barriers between patients are curtains; these are usually left open for safety reasons. Furthermore, curtains do not necessarily increase privacy; as one attending physician commented, a closed curtain actually produces a less confidential space because it raises staff and parent curiosity and people will strain hear what is going on behind it.</p>
<p>While family behavior is monitored, staff commonly talk among themselves about patients. For example, patient conferences—gatherings of key staff to discuss a patient’s care—often occur near the central station. Morning rounds occur at each patient’s bedside, during which a group of up to 15 staff and trainees openly discuss each patient. During invasive procedures, curtains may be pulled to increase privacy; however, the treatment of sedated patients is not always done privately, as described in Fieldnote Excerpt 5 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1367493511430678">Table 2</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Current PICU practice has followed general pediatrics in endorsing family-centered care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1367493511430678">Davidson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1367493511430678">Frazier et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1367493511430678">Just, 2005</xref>). While there are many aspects in this PICU that demonstrate this focus on the family and on parental participation in care (e.g. 24-hour visiting policy, family conferences, encouraging bedside photographs), nonetheless, what emerged from our analysis was an unsettling tension at the level of implicit taken-for-granted practices. A divergence between the aspirations and mandates of two major social groups is present in this PICU: that of family members of ill children and that of professional staff.</p>
<p>It is perhaps not surprising that we found this tension. Previous literature has remarked on various components of this divide, outlining especially the resultant challenges for implementing family-centered care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1367493511430678">Frazier et al., 2010</xref>). Staff resistance to the accommodation of families in the PICU has been justified via a concern that family members could introduce infection into the PICU, get in the way of staff activities, breach patient confidentiality, and increase staff workload (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1367493511430678">Giganti, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1367493511430678">Maxton, 1997</xref>). These concerns have been greatly dispelled, however, by three decades of PICU research showing not only that these concerns are mostly mythic but also the positive outcomes for both the child and the family members of close family involvement in a critically ill child’s care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1367493511430678">Frazier et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1367493511430678">Giganti, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1367493511430678">Heater, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1367493511430678">Just, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1367493511430678">Meyer et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1367493511430678">Proctor, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1367493511430678">Smith et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The relationships between an institution adopting recommendations for family-centered care, staff embodying the required philosophical and ideological commitments, and eventual outcomes in which families actually feel they are really at the “centre of care” are complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1367493511430678">Giganti, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1367493511430678">Letourneau and Elliott, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1367493511430678">Proctor, 1987</xref>). While many PICUs have an “open access” policy, for example, families continue to be transformed into “visitors,” thereby protocolizing their role in their child’s illness and contributing to role ambiguity. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1367493511430678">Carnevale (2005)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1367493511430678">Maxton (1997)</xref> have both taken issue with the language and sentiment that suggests parents at the bedside of their critically ill child are “visiting” when really they are “parenting.”</p>
<p>In addition to requiring staffs' ideological commitment, the built environment of the PICU and its usage also presents a number of challenges for parental accommodation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1367493511430678">Davidson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1367493511430678">Meert et al., 2008</xref>); some of these challenges are more immediately remediable than others. Buying more chairs for parents to sit by the bedside and allowing parents to put up photographs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1367493511430678">Macnab et al., 1997</xref>) are small ticket items, both financially as well as relative to staff inconvenience. The issue of noise is more complex, however still modifiable with moderate financial expense. Noise is a recurring theme in the PICU literature with clear evidence that noise disrupts patient rest and compromises health outcomes, contributing to distress and anxiety, which may require increased use of sedation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1367493511430678">Carno and Connolly, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1367493511430678">Cureton-Lane and Fontaine, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1367493511430678">Playfor, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1367493511430678">Trapanotto et al., 2004</xref>). Furthermore, noise affects PICU staff performance and health negatively as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1367493511430678">Morrison et al., 2003</xref>). Evidence from one PICU found that noise levels were eight times higher than recommended safety levels and that it was the health-care professionals—not the machines and technologies—who were the “chief noisemakers” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1367493511430678">Milette and Carnevale, 2003</xref>). While staff “noise” is often from essential information-sharing conversations, there is clearly excessive “chit-chat” at excessive volumes that could be greatly reduced. The culture of a library is such that when you enter, lowering your voice to a whisper is automatic; excessive signage and repercussions are not required because it is culturally understood that libraries are quiet environments. The bedroom of a sleeping child demands similar behavior in many households. The culture of the PICU can be more like an office: noisy with human chatter. While high-tech solutions such as “quiet” equipment and sound-absorbing materials would help, the most cost-effective measure is clearly staff education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1367493511430678">Milette and Carnevale, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1367493511430678">Morrison et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>More complicated interventions include facilitating parents' and siblings overnight stays with physical as well as emotional support to prevent sleep loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1367493511430678">Stremler et al., 2008</xref>); some PICUs have even adapted their architectural designs to ensure parents can sleep near their ill child (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1367493511430678">Smith et al., 2007</xref>). Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1367493511430678">Tomlinson and colleague (2002)</xref> make complex suggestions for foundational changes to staff education, using role modeling and reflective practice. While the specific elements of the PICU that require change to bring policy and practice into alignment with family-centered care are many, we suggest that having family representatives—already popular in many centers—present in the design and ongoing development of many aspects of care (e.g. from the physical layout to the way rounds are run) would be a move in the right direction.</p>
<p>To our knowledge, this is the first PICU ethnographic study. While other important work has engaged parental perspectives on PICU care, our study is novel in that we spent 12 months using participant-observation as well as interviewing to prospectively understand quotidian practices. Like any methodology, there are limitations to our data and analysis, however. While our attention to methodological rigor suggests our findings are transferable to other PICUs, this is not a quantitative study and therefore our results are not generalizable beyond the immediate setting.</p>
<p>Juxtaposing the metaphors of the bedroom and the office encourages us to reevaluate the practices and values implicit in PICU care. Of course, the PICU is neither an office nor a bedroom: While the PICU could never be “a bedroom” given the need for safety and ethical standards, it also should not be an “office.” Using this frame allows our analysis to beg the question as to how “family-centered” pediatric critical care really is. The triumphal history of critical care in terms of improved outcomes for critically ill children is undisputed; the rhetoric characterizing its practice as structuring care around the patient and family perhaps has not been sufficiently challenged. Research demonstrates a gap between PICU nurses and physicians perceptions and families perceptions of what families want and need (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1367493511430678">Blower and Morgan, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1367493511430678">Latour et al., 2011</xref>) and between knowledge of family-centered care and implementation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1367493511430678">Just, 2005</xref>). The ideal PICU environment is neither an office nor a bedroom but rather a dynamic process that needs to be both, to different degrees, in different circumstances. We found that while parents recognized that it is not functional to expect that their critically ill child will be cared for in a “bedroom-like” environment, there are still many aspects of the “office” that are unnecessary and have negative effects and about which staff may not be aware.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-1367493511430678">
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>While pediatric critical care has evolved into a family-centered care model, this study demonstrates an ongoing divergence between professional and family culture in the PICU. Operationalizing family-centered care is challenged by structural design, ideological commitment, and quotidian practices. Changing cultural practice is no small matter; information alone, while necessary, is not sufficient. The beginning of change, however, can come from questioning the status quo and increasing awareness of parental and staff perceptions. The strong intention of staff in this and other PICUs to help family members in distress demonstrates that they care deeply about families. It is our hope that these data will serve as a catalyst to help staff and administration reflect upon their own practices and re-vision where they might make changes that can benefit all.</p>
