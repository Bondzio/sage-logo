<title>Case Report</title>
<p>A previously healthy 5-year-old boy presented with a 1-month history of upper-respiratory symptoms, with subsequent development of nonbloody loose stools for 2 weeks. He awoke on the day of presentation feeling nauseated. He was brought to his pediatrician’s office, where he had nonbloody, nonbilious vomiting. His past medical history was notable for tracheomalacia during infancy. He was fully immunized, not taking medications, and had no known infectious exposures. His mother could not recall any intakes of unusual food. He was adopted, and therefore, his family history was unknown. In the office, he was noted to be hypothermic and peripherally cyanotic without detectable blood pressure. The patient was urgently transported to a local emergency department. On presentation, he was lethargic yet responsive to verbal stimuli, centrally flushed but peripherally cyanotic. His temperature was 95.8°F, blood pressure was 91/58, heart rate was 140 beats/min, oxygen saturation was 100%, and Glasgow Coma Scale score was 12. The patient had no signs of respiratory distress and had an intact gag reflex. He was admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit for further management. On admission, he was somnolent, though responsive to voice and touch. He had dilated pupils of 7 mm, but they constricted to 3 mm with light. There was no pallor or jaundice. His abdominal examination was significant for periumbilical tenderness with moderate abdominal distention. There was no visible rash, bruising, or bleeding.</p>
<p>His laboratory evaluation was notable for an elevated white blood cell count of 33.9 × 10<sup>9</sup>/L with a lymphocytic predominance, a hematocrit of 43.3 g/dL, and an elevated platelet count of 886 000/µL. His electrolyte and liver panels, amylase, lipase, coagulation panel, creatinine kinase, troponin-I, C-reactive protein, ammonia, extended serum, and urine toxicology screens were within normal limits. His cerebrospinal fluid showed 1 white blood cell/mm<sup>3</sup> without red blood cells. Subsequent bacterial cultures of blood, urine, throat, and cerebrospinal fluid were sterile. A Bartonella antibody titer and a nasal viral panel were negative. Stool sent for bacterial culture, ova, and parasites as well as <italic>Clostridium difficile</italic> toxins were negative.</p>

<title>Hospital Course</title>
<p>As his mental status improved, 24 hours after his initial presentation and an initial fluid resuscitation, he continued to complain of abdominal pain, and his stools became hemoccult positive. An abdominal ultrasound showed gallbladder sludge and moderate ascites with a normal appearing appendix. There was no gallbladder wall thickening or an ultrasonographic Murphy’s sign. An abdominal computed tomography showed circumferential bowel wall thickening of the splenic flexure and proximal descending colon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0009922812456901">Figure 1</xref>). Subsequently, a colonoscopy was performed to evaluate the etiology of colonic thickening. Grossly, nodular and pale mucosa with multiple areas of ulcerations were documented in the distal transverse colon, splenic flexure, and proximal descending colon. There was a distinct demarcation between the normal and abnormal mucosa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0009922812456901">Figure 2</xref>). Colonic biopsies showed foci of ulceration and regenerative colonic crypts with hyalinization of lamina propria, findings that are consistent with ischemic colitis.</p>

<p>The patient was supportively treated with continued intravenous hydration, intravenous antibiotics, and pain management. His dietary intake was slowly advanced without difficulty, and he was discharged home on hospital day 7 with complete resolution of his symptoms. An outpatient computed tomography angiography of the abdomen showed an absence of vascular anomaly. A serum panel to determine prothrombotic conditions was found to be normal. His colonoscopy was repeated 4 weeks after hospital discharge, which showed complete histopathological resolution.</p>

<title>Final Diagnosis</title>
<p>Ischemic colitis as a result of hypovolemic shock</p>

<sec id="section4-0009922812456901">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Although nearly 90% of cases of ischemic colitis occur in patients &gt;60 years old, this condition can occur at any age.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922812456901">1</xref></sup> The increased incidence in elderly people is related to underlying cardiac diseases and age-related lengthening of blood vessels supplying the colon.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0009922812456901">2</xref></sup> Primary blood supply of the colon is through the superior and inferior mesenteric arteries with continuity between the 2 systems provided by the marginal artery of Drummond, which connects the proximal ends of the colic vessels along the mesentery. This critical vessel can be tenuous around the splenic flexure, absent in 5%, and poorly developed in the right colon in 50% of the general population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0009922812456901">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0009922812456901">4</xref></sup> During a global hypoperfusion state, the right colon is often affected, whereas local, nonocclusive events typically involve the colonic watershed areas of the splenic flexure and the rectosigmoid region.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0009922812456901">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0009922812456901">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>To our knowledge, ischemic colitis has been rarely described in children in the literature; the pediatric clinician’s responsibility is to apply evidence from the adult literature as appropriately as possible. Because ischemic colitis is extremely unusual in the pediatric population, and children lack age-related risk factors, we felt that a further investigation for other pathological mechanism such as vascular anomaly or prothrombotic conditions was warranted. However, this particular child had a normal anatomical, infectious, and hematological evaluation.</p>
<p>Approximately 60% of patients with ischemic colitis present with an acute onset, crampy abdominal pain, often followed by bloody stools within 24 hours, which should not necessitate red blood cell transfusions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0009922812456901">3</xref></sup> In hemodynamically compromised patients, other diagnoses should be carefully sought.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0009922812456901">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0009922812456901">7</xref></sup> Abdominal tenderness is usually noted over the ischemic bowel segments, indicating transmural necrosis. Symptoms of an associated ileus may be noted, and peritoneal signs may develop because of transmural infarction and necrosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0009922812456901">6</xref></sup> Leukocytosis is a specific marker of this condition, whereas metabolic acidosis, neutrophilia, and lactate and alkaline phosphatase elevation may be present but are poorly specific.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0009922812456901">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>Abdominal computed tomography is the most useful imaging tool for evaluating ischemic colitis. With an exception of pneumatosis coli, the radiographic changes are not well correlated with a clinical prognosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0009922812456901">9</xref></sup> Colonic perfusion has typically normalized by the onset of symptoms, making angiography in the acute setting a low-yield imaging choice.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0009922812456901">3</xref></sup> Plain radiography may demonstrate loss of haustral markings, pneumoperitoneum, pneumatosis coli, or portal vein pneumatosis. The latter 3 findings are suggestive of transmural infarction and should prompt an emergent surgical evaluation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0009922812456901">3</xref></sup> A barium enema is a good choice for visualizing strictures, but it would be contraindicated if there is a clinical suspicion of bowel perforation or peritonitis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922812456901">1</xref></sup> The use of a barium enema with a sigmoidoscopy has been replaced by the use of colonoscopy, which is currently considered the most sensitive diagnostic tool.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0009922812456901">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Grossly, petechial hemorrhages with areas of pale and edematous mucosa are characteristic of early ischemic changes. A single longitudinal colonic strip of inflammation or ulceration, referred to as a colon single-stripe sign, is a characteristic of a mild disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0009922812456901">9</xref></sup> Several findings are more likely associated with ischemic rather than inflammatory changes. These include segmental lesions, clear demarcation between normal and abnormal mucosa, sparing of the rectal mucosa, and resolution of findings on repeated endoscopies. The histological changes include crypt distortion, edema, mucosal and submucosal hemorrhage, inflammatory cell infiltration, granulation tissue, intravascular platelet thrombi, and necrosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0009922812456901">10</xref></sup> Ulcerations may sometimes develop because of resorption of hemorrhage and mucosal sloughing. During colonoscopy, bowel inflation needs to be minimized, and advancing beyond an abnormal mucosa needs to be done cautiously to minimize the risk of perforation.</p>
<p>Most patients can be medically managed without any surgical interventions; adequate fluid resuscitation and hydration is critical for proper bowel perfusion, and bowel rest decreases further intestinal oxygen demands. Cardiac function should be optimized, and vasoconstrictive agents should be minimized. Serial physical exams are crucial to assess for markers of intestinal gangrene or perforation. Progressive abdominal tenderness, guarding, fever, or ileus are of concern and should prompt a surgical consultation for the necessity of an exploratory laparotomy. Of note, the serosal surface during laparotomy can be unreliable because ischemic changes progress from the luminal to the serosal surface. In the acute stages of disease, surgical management should be sought in the setting of peritonitis, pneumoperitoneum, intestinal gangrene on endoscopy, or refractory sepsis. Other indications include more than 14 days of diarrhea, gastrointestinal bleeding, or evidence of protein-losing enteropathy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0009922812456901">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>Clinical signs of ischemic colitis typically resolve within 24 to 48 hours, whereas imaging resolution may take up to 14 days in mild cases and 6 months with severe bowel ischemia. Almost 50% of adult patients with ischemic colitis have irreversible damage. Of these, 20% to 25% have segmental ulcerating colitis, 15% have gangrene, 10% have strictures, and 1% have fulminant colitis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0009922812456901">5</xref></sup> A chronic form of ischemic colitis can occur and manifests with an intermittent abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea, with a nonspecific inflammation, crypt distortion, and epithelial injury on colonic biopsy. Unlike the acute presentation, chronic cases may respond to topical steroids.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0009922812456901">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>We would like to emphasize the clinical importance in considering ischemic colitis in children who develop abdominal pain and/or bloody stools after an episode of hemodynamic instability. Because ischemic colitis is unusual in the pediatric population and children lack age-related risk factors, further investigations for other mechanisms can be beneficial because abnormal findings might change the patient’s management and provide guidance in avoiding risk factors. What is considered by many to be an adult gastrointestinal process may be more common in children than we have appreciated.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Ischemic colitis is rarely reported in children, and pediatric practitioners should be aware of this condition, especially when evaluating children who present with persistent abdominal pain and/or bloody stools after an episode of hemodynamic instability.</p>
