<p>Historians have long pointed to the destructive environmental impact of colonialism and to the role of European states in creating new bureaucracies to regulate and control natural landscapes across their empires. The path-breaking work of Richard Grove, William Beinart, Richard Coates, James MacKenzie and David Arnold, among others, has indicated ways in which historians might consider how Europeans encountered the landscapes of the non-European world and the long-term impact of British imperialism as well as its legacies in the present. While acknowledging the deleterious environmental consequences of colonialism, James Beattie sets out to present a ‘picture of greater complexity’ by focusing on the environmental anxieties that the encounters with unfamiliar landscapes engendered and on the responses that those encounters provoked among settlers, scientists, government officials and artists in South Asia (primarily India) and the Australasian colonies (New Zealand and Australia) from 1800 to the end of the First World War. The sources of these anxieties, as Beattie shows, stemmed from a myriad of interconnected concerns, which have often been viewed in isolation, ranging from those linked to health, hygiene, climate change, agricultural development and aesthetic considerations. What makes Beattie’s analysis particularly valuable is his insistence on the dialogue and connections between inter-related parts of the British Empire (South Asia and Australia), which are frequently considered separately. This has led him to problematise the distinctions that have been made between environmental change in colonies of extraction and colonies of settlement. Moreover, in comparing South Asia, Australia and New Zealand, he stresses the importance of local issues in accounting for differing experiences and outcomes.</p>
<p>Drawing on Tony Ballantyne’s concept of ‘webs of empire’, Beattie’s analysis centers on the debates and dialogues concerning health, development and the environment among Scottish educated doctors, German trained foresters, settlers and government officials, who did so much to shape policy and thinking about environmental transformations at a crucial moment in time. Chapter one establishes the framework for these debates and explores the differing colonial contexts, while subsequent chapters focus on colonial health as well as on anxieties regarding deforestation, desertification and the aesthetic costs of environmental change. In emphasising the key role played by Scottish educated doctors and German trained foresters in intellectual debates in India, New Zealand and Australia, Beattie challenges some of Richard Grove’s arguments regarding the role of these doctors, who were deeply concerned with the environmental effects of colonisation. Whereas Grove suggests that their advocacy of forest conservation represented a critique of colonisation, Beattie argues, in contrast, that they played an important role in colonial development, and he attempts to demonstrate that for them forest conservation represented first and foremost a desire for efficient resource management.</p>
<p>Beattie bases much of his analysis on the individual contributions and biographies of both Scottish educated doctors and German trained foresters and on the trajectories of other key individuals. In India, these figures include the Scottish-trained surgeon, Alexander Gibson, who played a key role in establishing the Bombay Forest Department in 1847, for which he acted as Conservator until 1860. In New Zealand, David Monro, a member of a famous Scottish medical family, made his contribution by publishing a botanical overview of the Nelson and Marlborough provinces and corresponded with Kew Gardens. One of the most interesting biographical sketches, however, focuses on neither a doctor nor a forester, but on an eccentric artist, poet and park designer, Alfred Sharpe. In a chapter entitled ‘Colonial Aesthetic Anxieties’ Beattie explores how environmental change and contact with unfamiliar landscapes gave rise to a series of aesthetic anxieties that were distinct from those that centered on unhealthy environments, which had prompted tree planting, drainage and anti-pollution legislation. Beattie uses Sharpe’s experiences in northern England, New Zealand and eastern Australia to reveal ‘imperial-wide aesthetic anxieties’, which were shaped by local and international influences and the intellectual current of Romanticism. Indeed, he emphasises the importance of Romanticism for both nineteenth-century Europeans and colonialists abroad, which he argues has been somewhat neglected.</p>
<p>As a young art student Sharpe was a fervent admirer of the Pre-Raphaelites and John Ruskin. For reasons still unknown, he migrated to New Zealand in 1859, when he was twenty-three. Beattie argues that nostalgia and environmental anxiety underpinned his conception of the artist’s role. Sharpe was scathing in his criticism of settlers and bitter about their importation of foreign plant and animal life, which had transformed the distinctive features of the New Zealand bush, a central focus of his artistic work. His aesthetic environmental anxieties centred on environmental loss and led to calls to preserve Australian forests in rural areas, though he did not neglect urban environments, such as Auckland and Newcastle, advocating public gardens and tree planting, which evoked Lutyens’ Delhi.</p>
<p>While health, hygiene and aesthetic concerns were at the core of drives to conserve and protect the natural environment among colonial administrators, doctors, foresters and anxious settlers, other forces shaped conservationism. In both Australasia and South Asia the fear of drifting sands or desertification haunted settlers and sojourners, who saw in the phenomenon a powerful threat to continued agricultural development. Early on at Joseph Bank’s suggestion, James Cook had named New Zealand’s Northland coast the ‘Desert Coast’, and subsequent travellers to New Zealand, Australia and India voiced concerns about the desertification of the landscapes that they saw before them. This ultimately led to reclamation projects, such as New Zealand’s 1903 Sand drift Act and to new models of landscape protection.</p>
<p>Beattie’s analysis of imperial environmental anxieties and the initiatives and measures that they inspired is based on research in archives and libraries in Australia, New Zealand, Scotland and the United Kingdom, as well as on a wealth of secondary sources. Although Beattie has consulted the India Office Records in London, South Asian sources are conspicuously absent. While this lacuna might be justified by the fact that he is primarily concerned with colonial views of the natural world and with settler responses to unfamiliar and changing environments, one is left wondering about the extent to which indigenous environmental knowledge, practices and approaches had any impact on the ways in which settlers and Europeans more generally approached questions of environmental change. Specifically, what kinds of interaction were there between travellers, settlers, colonial administrators, doctors, foresters and local populations over time? To what extent did European ideas have an impact on indigenous practices and ideas? How did local environmental knowledge and resistance to colonial policies affect environmental initiatives across the British empire, and in South Asia and Australasia in particular? While Beattie cites Kapil Raj’s ground-breaking book, <italic>Relocating Modern Science</italic>, New York, 2007), on these interactions, he does not venture into this enormously important and still largely unexplored domain. While Beattie is to be commended for showing how environmental anxieties among Europeans connected South Asia and Australasia, one also wonders about the extent to which environmental anxieties were shared not only within an empire, but across empires. Although he shows how French reclamation models shaped responses to desertification in Australasia and South Asia, Beattie would have done well to explore more fully the larger dialogue that took place across the British and French empires in this period. These missing pieces aside, Beattie should be applauded for providing historians with a fresh look at the very real environmental anxieties that linked British settlers, travellers, scientists and administrators across continents well into the twentieth century.</p>
