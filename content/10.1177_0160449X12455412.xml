<p>In the twelve weeks from mid-February to early May 2006, 3.5 to 7 million people marched in over 160 cities in the United States to rally for immigrant rights. Turnout to the 2006 protests surprised local organizers. Historically it surpassed turnout to the Chicago Haymarket protests, any protest event during the civil rights era, and any antiwar protest. The mobilizations, driven by and focused on the rights of noncitizens, reached upward of 650,000 marchers in Los Angeles alone. Citizens and noncitizens rallied in large cities and small towns alike, totaling over 260 separate, peaceful demonstrations.</p>
<p>The authors of <italic>Rallying for Immigrant Rights</italic> provide a thorough analysis of how these protests came about, the actors and mechanisms involved, and the consequences and possibilities for the future. They make a compelling case that political engagement should include not only voting or contacting elected officials but also contentious action by noncitizen actors. Particularly useful to a labor studies curriculum is the book’s discussion of coalition building among organized labor, immigrant rights, community groups, and religious groups.</p>
<p>This edited volume offers detailed studies on the roles of key institutions in building support for the 2006 protests. For example, Spanish-language DJs spread information and provided common frames for the protests, the Catholic Church as a mobilizing structure gave the protests legitimacy, and the family engaged in intergenerational information sharing, mobilization, and framing. In addition, in case studies of Chicago and Denver, the contributors reveal how coalitions framed the protests and brought communities together across racial lines. The latter chapters in the volume directly address the relevance of immigration politics to the case of the 2006 marches.</p>
<p>Though several chapters in this volume seem intended for a scholarly audience, the arguments highlighted in the book make it a stimulating resource for a broader labor studies or social movements curriculum. Randy Shaw’s and Ruth Milkman’s chapters would be excellent additions to a labor studies syllabus, as they specifically focus on the role of organized labor in the 2006 mobilizations and the potential for continued collaboration moving forward.</p>
<p>Shaw reveals how key actors in the Los Angeles labor movement built an alliance of labor, clergy, and immigrant rights groups in the mid 1990s. This alliance helped facilitate the historic AFL-CIO reversal on immigration and led the Immigrant Worker’s Freedom Ride, which likely laid the groundwork for the 2006 protests in so many towns across the country. Shaw argues that the alliances already in place were able to quickly mobilize their members and resources for the 2006 protests and that organized labor was instrumental in ensuring that the rallies were peaceful.</p>
<p>Milkman makes the case for continued collaboration between immigrant rights groups and organized labor. She outlines how the Los Angeles labor-Latino coalition has been influential in the election of pro-labor officials, the passage of pro-labor living-wage ordinances and community benefit agreements, and the success of workplace organizing for low-wage immigrant workers. Following the 2006 protests, several organizations and unions devoted resources to naturalization and voter registration efforts. Milkman suggests that if the coalition of organized labor and immigrant rights groups can be expanded to a national scale, organized labor could provide the infrastructure to leverage Latino voting power for further prounion progressive change.</p>
<p><italic>Rallying for Immigrant Rights</italic> provides a multifaceted study of the historic 2006 mobilizations that prompts the reader to consider the potential of alliance building with immigrant communities. This book provides labor educators with a thought-provoking jumping-off point to explore the mechanisms of large-scale mobilization and the role of alliance building in social movements.</p>
