<abstract>
<p>Despite a continued recognition of the importance of relational aspects of quality of life for people with dementia, little research has examined environmental influences on informal social interaction in dementia care settings. The purpose of this ethnographic study was to identify and explore key elements of the physical and social environments that act as facilitators or barriers for social interaction among people with dementia living in special care units. We conducted in-depth interviews with staff members and completed a series of resident observations. Findings suggest that social factors such as staff work roles and resident group size, and physical factors such as a non-institutional character, the nursing station location, and adequate seating and sightlines are influential for prompting or supporting informal social interactions. Design recommendations are provided with the intent to create physical environments that foster informal social interactions among people in dementia care environments.</p>

<p>Engaging in meaningful social interaction with others plays a crucial role in terms of positively influencing well-being and quality of life in people with dementia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1471301211421189">Brod, Stewart, Sands, &amp; Walton, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1471301211421189">Kitwood &amp; Bredin, 1992</xref>). Unfortunately, institutionalized people with dementia are susceptible to decreased social engagement as they spend very little time interacting with others outside of planned activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1471301211421189">Schroll, Jonsson, Mor, Berg, &amp; Sherwood, 1997</xref>). Despite this, the social and physical environments within residential care settings have the potential to facilitate informal social interaction among residents. Along these lines, it is important to develop, as others have noted, dementia care environments which support the needs and preferences of the individuals living within these facilities (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1471301211421189">Davis, Byers, Nay, &amp; Koch, 2009</xref>). In response to the complex needs of people with dementia, special care units (SCUs) have gained increased prominence in recent years. SCUs were created to provide people with dementia with a therapeutic environment through the implementation of various social and physical environmental design features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1471301211421189">Day &amp; Calkins, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1471301211421189">Kovach, Weisman, Chaudhury, &amp; Calkins, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1471301211421189">US Congress, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1471301211421189">Ziesel et al., 2003</xref>). For example, these features include a non-institutional or homelike ambiance, the availability of continuous walking paths, various public spaces available to residents, smaller groups of residents and smaller scale living and dining arrangements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1471301211421189">Day &amp; Calkins, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1471301211421189">Schwarz, Chaudhury, &amp; Tofle, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1471301211421189">Ziesel et al., 2003</xref>). However, research in SCUs tends to focus on the clinical outcomes of residents (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1471301211421189">Gruneir, Lapane, Miller, &amp; Mor, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1471301211421189">Nobili et al., 2008</xref>) despite one of the main objectives being to enhance social interaction and encourage communication among residents within these settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1471301211421189">Stevens, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1471301211421189">US Congress, 1992</xref>). While this is one of many desired outcomes, it is somewhat surprising that there is relatively little research available that provides comprehensive and specific insight into the environmental factors that shape the social dynamics within SCUs. Accordingly, the purpose of this investigation was to identify and explore the physical and social environmental characteristics that support or hinder informal social interaction among people with dementia who reside in SCUs.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1471301211421189"><title>Defining informal social interaction</title>
<p>Within a SCU setting, the meaning of social interaction is varied and nuanced given the range of social behaviors exhibited by residents as a result of their cognitive and physical functional status. At its essence, social interaction is a dynamic interplay between two or more individuals, where the participants interpret and react to one another's actions. In people with dementia, these may include verbal expressions such as short conversations, and to a much greater extent, non-verbal behaviors such as adjustments in body posture, eye contact, facial expressions, and touching or coming into physical contact with others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1471301211421189">Hubbard, Cook, Tester, &amp; Downs, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1471301211421189">Hubbard, Tester, &amp; Downs, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1471301211421189">Kelley, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>Although facilitating social interaction in long-term care has traditionally focused on engaging residents in planned social activities, this investigation is focused on the informal relations that occur among people with dementia residing in SCUs. We believe that it is through these more casual, day-to-day interactions among residents and others, as opposed to interactions during formal care practices or recreational activities, that individuals are able to derive meaning from these actions and realize the therapeutic benefits of social interaction including well-being (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1471301211421189">Kitwood &amp; Bredin, 1992</xref>). This is not intended to suggest that the benefits of recreational activity are diminished, as there is evidence to suggest that this type of programming does indeed serve a meaningful purpose in promoting social interaction within residential care settings (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1471301211421189">Buettner, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1471301211421189">Romack, 2004</xref>). Instead it attempts to draw our attention towards understanding how to provide opportunities for social interaction, not only on a regular basis throughout the daily activities of people residing in SCUs, but across a more diverse population of residents. Nevertheless, for the purpose of this investigation, the term ‘informal social interaction’ was defined as any spontaneous contact between two or more individuals, outside of planned activities and formal care practices, which includes interpreting and reacting to others in a verbal or non-verbal capacity.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-1471301211421189"><title>Environmental attributes associated with social interaction in long-term care</title>
<p>The social and physical environments in SCUs are important considerations in terms of facilitating informal social interaction as they provide the context and parameters in which social behaviors can occur. Accordingly, exploring some of the existing research literature within these domains provides some preliminary insight into the factors relevant for facilitating informal social interaction.</p>
<sec id="sec4-1471301211421189"><title>Organizational policies and social environment</title>
<p>The philosophy of care implemented in a care setting exerts a significant influence on residents in terms of creating opportunities for informal social interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1471301211421189">Hubbard et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1471301211421189">McKee, Harrison, &amp; Lee, 1999</xref>). This overarching value system guides the policies employed and the practices of both management and care staff within a care environment. Most notably, a medical model of care which emphasizes residents' safety in regards to physical health or well-being and efficiency from a nursing perspective has been shown to have a negative influence on social engagement between residents with Alzheimer's disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1471301211421189">Diaz Moore, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1471301211421189">McAllister &amp; Silverman, 1999</xref>). In contrast, there is some consensus among researchers that a social or resident-centered model of care, that promotes residents’ autonomy and ability to exercise choice, positively affects social interaction and community formation among people with dementia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1471301211421189">Diaz Moore, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1471301211421189">McAllister &amp; Silverman, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1471301211421189">Yee, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>Staffing patterns and staff activities within SCUs also have the potential to influence opportunities for informal social interaction among residents. Compared with traditional long-term care facilities, SCUs tend to have more consistency in staff assignment, higher nursing assistant and activity-aide to resident ratios, and more specialized training for care staff (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1471301211421189">Grant, Potthoff, &amp; Olson, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1471301211421189">Grant, Potthoff, Ryden, &amp; Kane, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1471301211421189">Reid &amp; Chappell, 2003</xref>). Collectively, these features may enable staff to facilitate informal social interactions between residents by acquiring the necessary time, flexibility in work roles, understanding of the dementia experience, and by gaining familiarity with residents in order to effectively attend to the social care needs of people with dementia. For example, in considering the relationship between staff roles and the hierarchical structure within long-term care organizations, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1471301211421189">McAllister and Silverman (1999)</xref> suggest that staff in non-hierarchical organizations are afforded more flexibility with regards to pursuing the social and emotional needs of residents. Here, each staff person takes on numerous roles and shares responsibilities with other team members in the social, emotional, physical and medical care of residents. In contrast, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1471301211421189">McAllister and Silverman (1999)</xref> describe staff work roles as more task-oriented in hierarchical organizations, where each staff member has a specific role that they must perform such as medication administration for nursing staff or activities of daily living for residents in the case of care aides. The task-oriented nature of care work may hinder informal social interaction within SCUs as time pressures to perform these may limit the flexibility of staff to socialize and promote informal social interactions among residents.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1471301211421189"><title>The physical environment</title>
<p>Several physical environmental locations and attributes have been found to be associated with social interaction. In the public sphere of residential care settings, people with dementia spend a majority of their time in the dining room, living room, and in corridors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1471301211421189">Diaz Moore &amp; Verhoef, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1471301211421189">Ice, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1471301211421189">McKee et al., 1999</xref>). Within dementia care environments, the dining room is typically the hub of social interaction, which is facilitated by key design features such as small-scale seating and table arrangements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1471301211421189">Day, Carreon, &amp; Stump, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1471301211421189">Diaz Moore, 1999</xref>). Corridors, but more specifically the availability of a continuous walking path with appropriate way-finding cues, may play a role in decreasing social isolation in people with dementia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1471301211421189">Passini, Rainville, Marchand, &amp; Joanette, 1998</xref>). Passini and colleagues also suggest that alcoves along walking paths may help to facilitate social interaction as they provide small gathering places for residents. However, at a fundamental level, walking paths and corridors may encourage social interaction by increasing the frequency that residents come in contact with one another because individuals within SCUs spend a smaller proportion of their time in bedrooms and more time in hallways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1471301211421189">Kovach et al., 1997</xref>). Comparatively, the amount of time spent in activity rooms, outdoor space, or in other spaces is relatively minimal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1471301211421189">Diaz Moore &amp; Verhoef, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1471301211421189">Ice, 2002</xref>). At a broader level, there are some common characteristics that are conducive to social interaction in many types of public spaces. For example, incorporating well-defined social spaces as well as a variation in the qualities and quantity of social spaces to ensure that there are options between smaller semi-private and larger semi-public spaces for residents to use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1471301211421189">Hauge &amp; Heggen, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1471301211421189">Marsden, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1471301211421189">Rule, Milke, &amp; Dobbs, 1992</xref>). In addition, arranging furniture around small tables or in a sociopetal position, instead of rows, also assists in facilitating social interaction in long-term care facilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1471301211421189">Brawley, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1471301211421189">Perez, Proffitt, &amp; Calkins, 2001</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1471301211421189"><title>Conceptual framework</title>
<p>The conceptual framework for this study draws primarily upon Lawton and Nahemow's competence-environmental press model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1471301211421189">Lawton, 1982</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1471301211421189">Moos’ (1979)</xref> social ecological model of health-related behavior and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1471301211421189">Gibson's (1977)</xref> concept of ‘affordances’. According to the competence-press model, behavioral outcomes are influenced by a person's capacity to function and the demand that the environment exerts on the individual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1471301211421189">Lawton, 1982</xref>). In addition, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1471301211421189">Moos’ (1979)</xref> social ecological model emphasizes the importance of the individual and their surrounding milieu within the context of four environmental categories: (1) the physical environment; (2) the organizational environment; (3) the individuals inhabiting the environment (human aggregate); and (4) the social norms with a setting (social climate). The concept of ‘affordances’ complements these models as it highlights the contribution of an environment in guiding the behaviors individuals are able to perform within them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1471301211421189">Gibson, 1977</xref>). Understanding the interconnectedness between persons and their environment is at the crux of developing a more holistic representation of informal social interaction within SCUs. Taking into consideration the varying levels of cognitive and functional impairments typically found in people residing in an SCU, each of these concepts is beneficial in providing insight into the theoretical basis of this inquiry as they highlight the importance of the individual and their surrounding physical and social environments in regards to facilitating or hindering informal social interaction.</p>
<p>The role of the individual and situational factors must also be regarded in terms of facilitating informal social interaction. In particular, considering social behavior from a life-course perspective sheds light on the importance of one's life-history. According to this perspective, human development is a dynamic process whereby behaviors and experiences during previous stages of one's life helps shape subsequent behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1471301211421189">McPherson, 1998</xref>). Thus, the degree to which one socializes with others may be a result of previous experiences and behaviors. However, situational factors also influence informal social interaction as they call attention to the importance of a person's desire to engage in an interaction. In the model presented, this desire may be influenced by several factors, such as having common interests with others, opportunity to engage with others or simply the proximity of others within the setting.</p>
<p>Taking into account each of the aforementioned factors provides a useful framework for studying informal social interaction within SCUs. Collectively, this framework predicts that meaningful informal social interaction is a result of a dynamic interplay between physical environmental, social environmental, one's past history, situational, and individual level factors including functional and cognitive abilities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1471301211421189">Figure 1</xref>).

</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-1471301211421189"><title>Study setting</title>
<p>Two SCUs located in Vancouver, British Columbia were the sites for this study. Greater variety in the types of common spaces within SCUs is associated with reduced social withdrawal among residents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1471301211421189">Zeisel et al., 2003</xref>). Similarly, environments that are more homelike in character, as well as those with private and personal spaces for residents, are more conducive to social interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1471301211421189">Bourgeois &amp; Hickey, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1471301211421189">Zeisel et al., 2003</xref>). Accordingly, the two facilities chosen for this study were selected with purposive sampling criteria based on the quality (e.g. homelike character, small-scale living arrangement) and quantity (e.g. variations in the types) of common spaces available to residents.</p>
<p>An assessment of the physical environment of each SCU was conducted in order to provide a set of baseline observations which can be used to compare each of the SCUs and highlight key environmental features which may be crucial in facilitating social interactions. This was completed by using walk-through observation-based instruments including the Therapeutic Environment Screening Scale for Nursing Homes (TESS-NH) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1471301211421189">Sloane et al., 2002</xref>) and the Professional Environmental Assessment Protocol (PEAP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1471301211421189">Norris-Baker, Weisman, Lawton, Sloane, &amp; Kaup, 1999</xref>). Both TESS-NH and PEAP are complementary environmental assessment instruments and are beneficial when used in conjunction with one another as they provide insight into how the discrete features (e.g. available furniture, lighting, quality of maintenance) and global dimensions of the physical environment (e.g. facilitation of social contact, awareness, and orientation) influence the residents’ experiences. In this study, PEAP achieves this by evaluating how well social contact and interaction is facilitated within a SCU, whereas TESS-NH surveys environmental features relevant to social interaction such as the provision of seating throughout activity areas and the non-institutional character of the SCU. The environmental information collected with these tools was used by the authors to familiarize themselves with the SCUs, as well as to guide observations, interviews and the analysis of this study.</p>
<p>Meadowcrest Lodge (pseudonym) is a 26-bed unit within a 117-bed residential care facility (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1471301211421189">Table 1</xref>). This SCU contained double loaded corridors with single-seat alcoves at each end of the two hallways. The main common area was segregated into several spaces including a kitchen, dining room, and two lounges. The nursing station and a small quiet room for residents was located in the hallway near the main entrance into the SCU. Based on an assessment using TESS-NH and PEAP, we rated Meadowcrest Lodge to be ‘somewhat homelike’ in character. Specifically, the homeliness of the seating and furnishings, low noise levels, larger unit size, double loaded corridors, and lack of lighting in hallways contributed to this evaluation. Twenty-six residents including 5 males and 21 females resided in Meadowcrest Lodge. The age range of residents was between 68 and 102 years, with the mean age of 85 years old. Overall, residents in this unit were in moderate health according to care staff and were fairly mobile, with or without assistive devices.

<p>Guildwood Village (pseudonym) is an 18-bed unit within a 72-bed residential care facility (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1471301211421189">Table 1</xref>). This unit incorporated a continuous walking path along the perimeter of the SCU, a medium-sized dining area, a small lounge, and a quiet room for residents' use. The nursing station was located centrally within the SCU, outside the dining room. Overall, Guildwood Village was rated as ‘moderately homelike’ in character based on our assessment using TESS-NH and PEAP. Particularly, the overall ambiance including the quiet common spaces and extensive carpeting throughout, smaller unit and dining room size as well as the lack of a kitchen (in lieu of a serving area) contributed to this evaluation. Seventeen residents including nine males and eight females resided within Meadowcrest Lodge. All residents within this unit were diagnosed with some form of dementia or dementia-like symptoms except for two residents who had other mental health diagnoses. Overall, the health of residents within this unit was described as poor as many residents within this unit required heavy care and assistance moving throughout the unit according to care staff. The age range of residents was between 30 and 90 years, with the mean age of 82 years old.</p>

<p>Given the complex nature of informal social interaction patterns among people with dementia and the difficulty in constructing meaning from these patterns, the opportunity for prolonged engagement within a long-term care setting was required for the purpose of this investigation. As a result, we employed a multi-method approach to data collection in this study, including ethnographic observations and interviews with key informants. This process of triangulation not only enriched the understanding of the phenomenon at hand, but also assisted in strengthening the study by increasing its rigor, validity, and reliability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1471301211421189">Taylor &amp; Bogdan, 1998</xref>). Data were collected over a 9-week period between July and September 2009. Ethical approval for this research was obtained from the Research Ethics Board at Simon Fraser University.</p>
<sec id="sec9-1471301211421189"><title>Resident observations</title>
<p>A series of observations in Meadowcrest Lodge and Guildwood Village were completed to provide insight into the role of the SCU environment in facilitating or hindering informal social interaction. These observations documented informal social interactions occurring within public spaces of each SCU including dining areas, activity areas, walking paths, and any other common space. Residents’ bedrooms and bathrooms were excluded. Observations were recorded at various times each day, with the earliest beginning at 8:00 am and the latest ending at 9:00 pm on weekdays and weekends. In addition, these were completed concurrently at both facilities such that significant observations made within one facility were used to inform subsequent observations at the other and vice versa, while controlling for the influence time. In total, 70 hours of observation were completed during the study period (35 hours per facility). Social interactions occurring during personal care or planned activities were not documented in detail as this was outside the scope of the current study.</p>
<p>Our observations in this study were aided through the use of a behavioral mapping tool (adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1471301211421189">Copeland, Crosby, Sixsmith, &amp; Stilwell, 1990</xref>) to document the activities of each resident, care staff person and visitor within a particular space and time. More specifically, each person in the space being observed was documented along with his or her location, a description of what they were doing, and with whom they were interacting. To supplement the information collected with the behavioral mapping checklist and to increase the salience between each interaction and the physical environment, architectural floor plans of the care settings were annotated, documenting the location of residents, care staff, and visitors during informal social interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1471301211421189">Zeisel, 2006</xref>). A behavioral mapping entry was completed over 10–15 minute time periods, approximately once every hour during observation sessions. This method was beneficial as it allowed for data to be collected in a more structured and systematic fashion and provided insight into new avenues of observation through the data-reflection process.</p>
<p>In addition, open-ended field notes were taken to document informal social interactions between residents, residents and staff, and residents and visitors. Particular attention was paid to documenting the context of each interaction and how residents were using or interacting with the physical environment. At the end of each observation day, field notes were reviewed and memos along with concept maps were appended. These highlighted key observations and the relationships between them for consideration and development during subsequent observation days.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec10-1471301211421189"><title>Key informant interviews</title>
<p>In depth, semi-structured interviews were conducted using an interview guide in order to gain an insider's perspective on informal social interaction in SCUs, the organization's role in facilitating social interaction, the spaces in which these interactions occur, and how the physical design of the SCU helps facilitate informal social interaction among residents. For example, informants were asked to describe any policies and procedures they were aware of within their facility that were geared towards facilitating informal social interaction. In addition, they were asked about the aspects or characteristics of the built environment that were critical in providing opportunities for residents to interact with each other, descriptions of interactions between themselves and residents as well as interactions between residents that they observed, including the context in which these occurred. This semi-structured approach allowed for conversation to be guided by key questions, yet offered a degree of flexibility to the participant and researcher with regard to permitting opportunities to explore new or unexpected issues as they arose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1471301211421189">Hesse-Biber &amp; Leavy, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Five frontline staff members, including nurses, care aides, and housekeeping staff members from each SCU participated in face-to-face interviews. Each interview was audio recorded, transcribed, and field notes were taken during and after the interview process. In total, these lasted approximately 25 minutes and were scheduled after 15 hours of observations had been conducted. This sequencing allowed the investigators to build a rapport with facility staff, allowed emergent themes generated from observations to guide interviews and conversely allowed for issues explored within the interviews to be investigated further during subsequent observations.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec11-1471301211421189"><title>Data analysis</title>
<p>Data analysis was an ongoing and iterative process that occurred both during and after data collection. Throughout this investigation, data were analyzed to identify key concepts and themes through a process of constant comparison (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1471301211421189">Glaser &amp; Strauss, 1999</xref>). This involved continuously looking for similarities and differences between observations to help categorize and understand each event. Accordingly, observation field notes and interview transcripts were frequently reviewed to identify key concepts and direct further observations and interview questions. For example, social and physical environmental factors identified during the initial observations were clarified during interviews with informants and further explored in subsequent observations.</p>
<p>Procedurally, all field notes and interview recordings were transcribed and subsequently analyzed using qualitative analysis software NVivo 8. Data collected were analyzed using a thematic analysis approach. This involved an initial phase of line-by-line coding of the interview transcripts and field notes, where each line was labeled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1471301211421189">Charmaz, 2006</xref>) to identify any relevance to the role of the social and/or physical environments in residents’ social interactions. This process was followed by a focused coding procedure that involved organizing, synthesizing, and developing key themes from these categories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1471301211421189">Charmaz, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition, the behavioral mapping tool provided a means of quantifying the levels and types of informal social interactions occurring across various spaces within the two SCUs. Documenting what each resident in a space was doing constituted a single ‘observation’. Each observation was coded to identify the behavior of each resident and her/his participation in any informal social interaction. An observation where a resident sat alone was coded as ‘sitting’, whereas an observation where two or more residents were interacting with each other, would receive a code describing the type of informal social interaction, e.g., ‘gesturing’, ‘active verbal communication’, ‘brief verbal communication’, and ‘eye contact’. Frequencies were calculated that represent the proportion of individuals engaging in any informal social interaction within the various spaces.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec12-1471301211421189"><title>Study findings and discussion</title>
<p>Various social and physical environmental characteristics were found to have an influence on informal social interactions that occurred within each of the SCUs studied. It is important to note that for the purpose of this investigation, the two care units were treated as unique entities. Although several similarities and differences emerged between the two facilities, it was not the intention of this investigation to compare the two SCUs. Nevertheless, three social environmental factors and three physical environmental attributes were identified as key themes within this investigation. These included: (1) the philosophy of care and the role of care staff; (2) group size; (3) time of day; (4) residential character and ambiance; (5) nursing station location; and (6) the presence of adequate seating and sightlines.</p>
<sec id="sec13-1471301211421189"><title>Philosophy of care and the role of care staff</title>
<p>Although it was not the purpose of this investigation to assess how effectively the philosophy of care was implemented at Meadowcrest Lodge or Guildwood Village in relation to social interactions, the importance of the staff's acceptance and implementation of the facility's care philosophy became salient and was an important finding within this study. This appeared to be the case in both facilities where staff in various positions (e.g. management, nursing staff, care aides, housekeeping staff, recreational staff) truly believed that their main obligation was to see to the well-being of the residents. Among their responsibilities, care staff agreed that interacting with residents outside of their formal care practices was of utmost importance. For example, during an interview one housekeeper noted:
<disp-quote>
<p>‘[it] doesn't matter what job title you do, we're all here for the residents. We can all spend time interacting with them. So, if you're a housekeeper, dietary nurse, doesn't matter what your job title is, we're all here […] to spend time with the residents.’ (Interview, Housekeeper, Meadowcrest Lodge)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>The above example highlights the culture of care within both SCUs, where staff appeared to value socializing with residents and took on an active role to do so. This is a noteworthy finding in light of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1471301211421189">McAllister and Silverman's (1999)</xref> research regarding staff roles and the hierarchical structure of long-term care organizations. Our findings indicate that it is not necessarily hierarchical organization of staff roles that limits opportunities for informal social interaction in SCUs, instead it is the culture within an organization that motivates staff members to take into account the social care needs of people with dementia. Within both Meadowcrest Lodge and Guildwood Village there was hierarchical organization evident, with care staff, nursing staff, and housekeeping staff all having a unique and well-defined role in terms of their day-to-day activities. However, as the previous excerpt suggests, many staff members within these SCUs embodied a ‘resident first’ value that includes interacting with residents and creating opportunities for residents to socialize.</p>
<p>Importantly, these perceptions were actually translated into practice, whereby staff would frequently initiate interactions and routinely facilitate informal interactions between residents throughout the day. For example, during a series of observations, a staff member successfully encouraged residents to interact and converse with one another by sitting with a small group of individuals and initiating a conversation:
<disp-quote>
<p>‘A care aide and several of the residents are at the table after the evening snack. This staff member has decided to sit with residents while having a snack of her own and converses with them. They all enjoy it! And gravitate towards the table as the chatter increases quite a bit. Anita chimes in, Anne looks on, even Claire who is seated at another table turns and tries to engage in the conversation by speaking. Several others look on […] even after the staff member has left the conversation continues for approximately 10 minutes afterwards' (Field Notes, Meadowcrest Lodge)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>This example highlights the issue of flexibility, whereby the philosophy of care within Meadowcrest Lodge permitted the care aides to be flexible in their daily work routines. Accordingly, opportunities were created by and were available for care staff to both initiate and participate in spontaneous interactions with residents. This finding suggests that although the philosophy of care in SCUs is important in enabling staff to be flexible in how they engage with residents, the degree to which facility staff ‘buy in’ into this philosophy is perhaps of greater importance in order to create opportunities for residents to engage in informal social interaction.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec14-1471301211421189"><title>Group size</title>
<p>In considering previous research indicating that SCUs housing a fewer number of residents are generally more conducive to social interaction, it was expected that informal social interaction within Guildwood Village (18 residents, smaller unit size) would be more commonly observed compared to Meadowcrest Lodge (26 residents, large unit size). However, this did not appear to be the case as both the frequency and the overall number of social interactions that occurred were, in fact, greater in Meadowcrest Lodge. This discrepancy may be due to several reasons. First, having a greater number of people in a defined space increases the probability that individuals will come into close contact with each other and consequently interact. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1471301211421189">Morgan and Stewart (1999)</xref> also suggest that this may be the case as they also found fewer opportunities for social interaction as a result of a lower density of residents within SCUs with increased privacy and private spaces.</p>
<p>In addition, unit-specific factors pertaining to the health and lifestyle of residents within SCUs may provide an alternate explanation. For example, residents in Guildwood Village tended to be less mobile and in the later stages of dementia compared with those at Meadowcrest Lodge. Accordingly, individuals who were less mobile, albeit using an assistive mobility device or not, were unable to navigate the space around them without the assistance of care staff and rarely occupied social spaces such as the lounge or dining table outside of mealtimes. These individuals tended to rely on others to come in close contact with them in order to socialize. For example, Carrie, a resident at Guildwood Village who sat in a reclining wheelchair would spend much of her time throughout the day seated in the dining room along the sidewall, facing the center of the unit. She was in the later stages of dementia, never spoke, and would often be alone. However, on multiple occasions, she would reach out in front of her towards a staff member or other resident who was passing by. This reaching behavior was viewed as an attempt to socialize with others, however oftentimes this would be an unsuccessful attempt. Similarly, Peyton, a resident in Meadowcrest Lodge was also limited to his wheelchair and was often confined to a space in between the lounge and dining room tables. As other residents would pass by, he too would watch others, reach out or at times speak up to capture the attention of these individuals. In one instance, as Sue Ann (another resident) rose and proceeded to walk across the room, she passed by Peyton (seated at a pillar, facing the lounge), who watched her as she walked near. In noticing this, Sue Ann smiles at Peyton and bows slightly as a way of acknowledging Peyton's reply, a quick smile back. Both of these examples highlight that individuals within SCUs, regardless of cognitive decline or mobility issues, do attempt to socialize with others. However, being unable to navigate one's environment or move to social spaces, limits the opportunities for informal social interaction for those who do desire to socialize with others. Thus, for residents who are not mobile, there is a delicate balance here in terms of having the opportunity to socialize with others and the opportunity to have privacy.</p>
<p>In terms of lifestyle at Guildwood Village, several of the residents would spend a great deal of time in their bedrooms, whereas others would frequently participate in recreational activities outside the unit. This suggests that a minimum number of residents within a given space are required in order to maximize potential opportunities for informal social interaction in SCUs. Consequently, in terms of group size, perhaps the most important factor with regard to facilitating informal social interaction is not the total number of people within a particular unit, but rather how individuals congregate and, consequently, how the setting supports these behaviors. For example, although there were more residents in Meadowcrest Lodge, one unique feature of this unit was that people would congregate throughout the unit in small clusters, typically in groups of four at a dining room table and pairs within the hallway. Collectively, it appeared that groups of between four and six residents were most conducive to social interaction between residents. This was especially relevant in the dining room, where residents seated in such groupings engaged in informal social interactions more often than those seated at tables with fewer than this number. In contrast, within Guildwood Village, group sizes in the dining room tended to be quite small, with the maximum number of people at the dining table typically being three people at any given time. Even with this number of people in a given cluster, informal social interaction was found to be minimal. Consequently, with regard to informal social interaction within SCUs, it may be more conducive to informal social interaction to have fewer tables with more seats filled as opposed to an overabundance of tables with only one or two residents seated at each.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec15-1471301211421189"><title>Time of day</title>
<p>Residents at Guildwood Village and Meadowcrest Lodge appeared to be more social during certain times of the day in comparison with others. Mealtimes generated the greatest amount of informal social interaction between residents and between residents and staff. In assessing these interactions, mealtimes were broken down into three segments: prior to meal, during the meal, and after the meal. In both SCUs, residents were brought or encouraged to sit at their respective dining tables approximately 30 minutes prior to a meal being served. It was during these times that informal social interaction within the unit was at the peak level. Having residents seated in close proximity to each other for an extended period of time helped to facilitate these interactions. In contrast, social interaction during the meal was very minimal, as residents were focused on eating their meal. Finally, residents did interact with others after meals, but not as frequently as prior to them. While some residents would stay at their table after eating, others would quickly leave their table setting, especially those who were more mobile than others. Overall, social interaction peaked prior to meals being served, decreased while residents were eating and then increased moderately in the time after these meals. Similar to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1471301211421189">Diaz Moore's (1999)</xref> research on social interaction in the dining room of SCUs, these findings emphasize the importance of creating a social atmosphere and space in the dining room, especially prior to and after meals are served.</p>
<p>Throughout other times in the day, interaction between residents and others occurred sporadically. Aside from mealtimes, these interactions appeared to increase significantly among residents between 3:00 pm and 4:00 pm. This was much more pronounced at Meadowcrest Lodge, but did occur to a lesser extent at Guildwood Village. Social interaction during these times may be attributed to several circumstances. First, care staff members were very quick to identify the cause of this increased activity as being a result of sundowning. Sundowning has been described as the exacerbation of behavioral symptoms associated with dementia and is characterized by confusion and agitation in the afternoon or early evening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1471301211421189">Little, Satlin, Sunderland, &amp; Volicer, 1995</xref>). While this puts the focus on the individual with dementia, it is important to recognize the environmental influences on such behavior. In particular, this increased level of activity coincided with changes in staff that occurred at both facilities at approximately 3:00 pm. This factor, in conjunction with increased noise levels associated with this time period, may provide insight into both the increased level of social activity and the staff's reported identification of sundowning behaviors. Accordingly, this increased activity during this time may simply be a reaction to the staff shift change and increased commotion during these times, as opposed to sundowning.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec16-1471301211421189"><title>Location of informal social interaction</title>
<p>The behavioral mapping tool used in this investigation provided a resource for quantifying the proportion of informal social interaction that occurred during these structured observations. Using this tool, we found that informal social interaction occurred in only 32% and 38% of all observations taken at Guildwood Village (<italic>N</italic> = 356) and Meadowcrest Lodge (<italic>N</italic> = 481), respectively. Of these observations (Guildwood Village, <italic>N</italic> = 114; Meadowcrest Lodge, <italic>N</italic> = 182), the location where informal interactions occurred varied considerably (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1471301211421189">Figure 2</xref>). Overall, residents engaged in informal social interactions within the dining room most frequently as 73% and 64% of all informal social interactions observed within Guildwood Village and Meadowcrest Lodge, respectively, occurred within this space. These findings were not surprising, especially given that residents spent a majority of their time in this space. The lounge area accounted for the second greatest proportion of informal social interactions observed. Throughout the day, residents at both SCUs occupied the lounge area as this space offered many comfortable seats, a television (Guildwood Village only) and large windows. In total, 20% of all informal interactions between residents observed at Guildwood Village and 16% in Meadowcrest Lodge occurred here. In addition, corridors were found to be the third most frequent location where residents interacted with others. Within Meadowcrest Lodge, 15% of informal social interactions observed took place in the hallway. These would typically occur when residents would inadvertently encounter one another while walking. For example, in one scenario, Herman was walking in the hallway and he came into contact with Pauline:
<disp-quote>
<p>‘Pauline is standing in the hallway. As Herman turns the corner, Pauline makes eye contact with him and mumbles something. Herman approaches her, mumbles something back and continues around the hallway. When he returns several minutes later, Pauline approaches him again. Herman acknowledges her with a friendly head nod and once again carries on.’ (Field Notes, Meadowcrest Lodge)</p></disp-quote>
<fig id="fig2-1471301211421189" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>The proportion of informal social interactions observed within common areas.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1471301211421189-fig2.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>Many of these hallway interactions were quite brief, and included gestures, short glances or brief verbal communication. However, within Guildwood Village, only 3% of all informal social interactions observed occurred in the hallways. This low proportion may be attributed to some of the unique characteristics of Guildwood Village including a fewer number of residents inhabiting public spaces during the day, greater limitations in mobility among residents, and overall less use of the walking path. Last, informal social interaction in other spaces such as the quiet room, alcoves and second lounge area (Meadowcrest Lodge only) occurred infrequently. Within Guildwood Village and Meadowcrest Lodge, only 3% and 4% of all informal social interactions occurred in this secondary living space. Once again, these findings were not surprising when considering that residents spend the least amount of time in these spaces.</p>
<p>Collectively, these findings are consistent with existing literature, where similar frequencies of informal social interaction compared with space use have been reported (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1471301211421189">Diaz Moore &amp; Verhoef, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1471301211421189">Ice, 2002</xref>). However, it is important to highlight the corridors as a hub where residents socialize with one another. Traditionally, corridors are not thought of as social spaces, yet the findings in Meadowcrest Lodge highlight that SCU residents do indeed come into contact and interact with others in this space. Accordingly, greater attention and future research should be focused on the design of corridors so to understand how to better support meaningful informal social interactions within these locations. For example, neither of the two SCUs in this investigation had seating available in the corridors. Perhaps providing seating for residents in key areas where these individuals tend to congregate or cross paths may encourage the process of informal social interaction by providing further opportunities and more comfortable spaces for residents to engage with one another.</p>
<sec id="sec17-1471301211421189"><title>Homelike character and ambiance</title>
<p>Providing a homelike setting that is pleasant, intimate, and comfortable for SCU residents appeared to be of importance in terms of stimulating opportunities for informal social interactions. Staff members at both SCUs agreed that the degree to which a SCU exhibited homelike qualities is an important factor for facilitating these interactions. For example, when asked about the importance of the built environment and the homelikeness of Meadowcrest Lodge, the care aide being interviewed responded as follows:
<disp-quote>
<p>‘I would say [it is] … critical … for me, personally, I like [a] more homelike [environment as they are] very important for [informal social] interaction, yeah. You feel more like laughing, you feel at home. You don't feel … isolated’ (Interview, Care Aide, Meadowcrest Lodge)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>However, while there was agreement among staff members in terms of the importance of a homelike atmosphere, care staff found it very difficult to articulate the specific features within the environment that contributed to social interaction, as they tended to focus on the environment at a general or unit-wide level. Despite this, spaces that were smaller and contained objects that maintained some continuity to ‘home’ or a resident's past life (e.g. musical instruments) were two features highlighted during interviews that were thought to contribute to both a homelike setting and socialization opportunities. For example, one care aide at Guildwood Village noted that this unit was ‘homelike because it's small. And then there are enough, for me, enough stuff’. Here she is referring to both the size of the unit and objects distributed throughout the unit (e.g. pictures, wall hangings, murals, knick-knacks, etc.) which contribute to its atmosphere. Furthermore, this highlights the importance of having objects within SCUs that are familiar to residents and create some degree of interest where social interaction can be initiated from the presence of objects. For example, a piano in Guildwood Village played a role in the attempted interaction between two residents, Meghan and Daniel, who were seated beside each other on a sofa in the lounge:
<disp-quote>
<p>‘Daniel was closest to the piano and Meghan was on his left. He looked over at Meghan a few times and then reached over to gently touch a couple of the piano keys (to get Meghan's attention). In between notes (every 3–5 seconds) he would peek over and smile at Meghan’ (Field Notes, Guildwood Village)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>While this did not result in a successful informal social interaction, this example highlights how familiar objects within an SCU environment have the potential to encourage residents to interact with one another.</p>
<p>However, there appears to be a delicate balance in SCUs with regards to the number of objects (e.g. wall hangings) placed within public spaces when attempting to create a homelike atmosphere. Too many of these objects may cause overstimulation for some residents, thus inhibiting positive social interactions. For example, when asked about the surrounding environment at Meadowcrest Lodge as it is related to informal social interaction among residents, one care aide replied:
<disp-quote>
<p>‘I think … the physical [environment is] … very important because when a specific place is very conducive without much distraction I think it helps in the well-being of a resident … As much as possible a place should look like a home, but it should not be over done to the point where unnecessary things should be in there because it's a contributing factor for sensory overload …’ <bold>(</bold>Interview, Care Aide, Meadowcrest Lodge)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>This excerpt highlights that the presence of clutter can be distracting to residents and may be a potential deterrent to informal social interaction among residents. Similarly, excessive ambient noise, from residents, staff, or technology (e.g. television or radio), appeared to agitate residents, hence leading to more negative social interactions within both SCUs.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, creating a setting that is homelike, yet not overly decorated, appears to facilitate informal social interaction by providing residents not only with a setting in which they feel comfortable and have a sense of familiarity, but one that provides opportunities for residents to initiate interactions through the objects and furnishings within the facility (e.g. books, musical instruments, wall-hangings).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec18-1471301211421189"><title>Nursing station location</title>
<p>The location of the nursing station relative to the main activity space of Meadowcrest Lodge and Guildwood Village also emerged as a potential design feature that influences informal social interactions. This is not in terms of the location of these interactions, but more so with regards to how these environmental features shape the behavior of staff, who in turn create opportunities for informal social interaction. Although this investigation primarily focuses on interactions between people with dementia in SCUs, resident-staff interactions did appear to be a noteworthy source of informal social interaction for residents.</p>
<p>The nursing station at Meadowcrest Lodge was hidden within the main corridor, near the unit entrance. Visual access from this nursing station to the main activity area was obstructed as care staff could only see down one side of the corridor from this space. As a result, care staff members were forced to circulate constantly throughout the main activity space of the unit to monitor residents. This affected the social dynamics within Meadowcrest Lodge and translated into more frequent informal interactions between staff and residents as well as between residents. In contrast, the nursing station at Guildwood Village was located adjacent to the dining room and encompassed a large wall cut out in the middle of this space that enabled staff to maintain visual contact with residents throughout the lounge, dining room and portions of the hallway. In many instances when staff members were not involved in administering care, they would retreat to the nursing station to complete other work and observe residents from a distance.</p>
<p>Despite the differences described in the nursing station locations, there is evidence to suggest that integrating the nursing station into the main activity space such that it is not a separate entity within the SCU may facilitate social engagement between residents and between residents and staff. For example, on several occasions, one of the care aides at Guildwood Village would complete her administrative responsibilities at a dining room table as opposed to within the nursing station. This appeared to attract residents' attention and provided an additional opportunity for residents and staff to interact with one another on an informal basis. For example, Neil stops to chat briefly with this care aide on his way to the lounge:
<disp-quote>
<p>‘As Neil passes through the dining room, he stops beside Hannah [Care Aide] who is completing some documentation at a table adjacent to the nursing station in the dining room. Neil starts a conversation with her and Hannah takes a few moments to reply. After approximately 1-minute, Neil continues on to the lounge.’ (Field Notes, Guildwood Village)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Similarly, increased engagement was also observed between residents and staff at Meadowcrest Lodge when staff integrated themselves into the unit, outside of formal care activities. For instance, in our above discussion regarding the flexibility of staff work patterns, the example of a care aide beginning a conversation with residents and the residents continuing this conversation after she has left is given. Accordingly, not having a nursing station or a space for care staff to retreat to in the vicinity of where residents spent most of their time afforded residents the opportunity to engage with care staff and other residents in informal social interactions. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1471301211421189">McAllister and Silverman's (1999)</xref> findings also suggest that staff rooms, similar in function to the nursing station in our study where staff would sometimes eat and complete paperwork, may limit informal social interaction as these staff-specific locations may encourage community formation among staff that is separate from residents. As a result, our findings indicate that integrating a nursing station area into the main activity spaces within SCUs may be one design modification beneficial in terms of facilitating informal social interaction between staff and residents as well as between residents, with the assistance of staff.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec19-1471301211421189"><title>Adequate seating and sightlines</title>
<p>Yet another important physical environmental consideration in terms of influencing informal social interaction is the availability of adequate seating throughout the facility. Overall, both Meadowcrest Lodge and Guildwood Village did have ample seating available in all spaces except for in the corridors. This was somewhat surprising given the amount of time residents with dementia spend walking in hallways. As a result, there was some evidence that suggests that benches or chairs in the hallways would be an asset for facilitating informal social interaction. In particular, residents in both SCUs appeared to circumvent the walking paths by cutting through the dining area, where they would occasionally take a seat at one of the dining room tables. Support for the inclusion of seating in the hallways was also indicated by some care staff, when asked about the public spaces at Guildwood Village and their influence on informal social interaction:
<disp-quote>
<p>‘… only 18 residents, this is good enough. But still, if they had more space, even better … You see, by the end of the hallway, they have no place to sit, they [should] have a couple of chairs, a bench, some flowers, a setting …’ (Interview, Care Aide, Guildwood Village)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>This staff member suggests that creating a social space within the hallway, by providing seating and a scenic environment would help to increase informal social interaction.</p>
<p>In addition, it is important to highlight the importance of sightlines in terms of facilitating informal social engagement within SCUs. In particular, transition spaces and intersections such as entranceways proved to be unique locations within Meadowcrest Lodge and Guildwood Village. These spaces not only connected rooms to each other, but also provided access points through which residents had visual access to other spaces within the facility from these locations. These spaces became important in providing opportunities for residents to engage in informal social interactions, as residents who would frequently occupy and congregate around these areas when walking throughout the unit were able to see the happenings in other areas within the SCU and engage with others when inclined to do so. In both SCUs, residents had a tendency to slow down or stop as they would pass by a transition area. For example, one of the Meadowcrest Lodge residents, William, would regularly walk in the hallways and would often slow down once approaching the kitchen entranceway. Once there, he would either take a few steps in or poke his head through the entrance and take a glimpse into the dining room, kitchen, or lounge prior to walking again or entering the space to socialize with others. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1471301211421189">Danes (2002)</xref>, this area constitutes a ‘fringe zone’ where residents may become aware of the happenings of the unit and decide whether or not and how passively or actively to engage with others in the nearby spaces. Consequently, it is important to recognize that these spaces serve an important purpose for residents in terms of informal social interaction. Aside from providing a space for residents to gather and to reach other areas in the facility, these spaces also provide residents an opportunity to observe activities in these other areas and to engage with others as they see fit.</p>
<p>However, perhaps the importance of sightlines was best exemplified within the dining room at Meadowcrest Lodge where one dining table, dubbed the ‘VIP table’ by care staff, was a frequent hub for social activity. The five female residents who typically occupied this table were the most social of all residents within Meadowcrest Lodge, a close-knit group particularly due to their repeated interaction in this location, and were quite adamant about sitting here during non-mealtimes.</p>
<p>While at the VIP table, it was not uncommon for these residents to interact and converse collectively as one large group. In comparison with other tables and spaces within Meadowcrest Lodge, social engagement at this table was much higher. Features unique to this table were observed in order to delineate any potential physical environmental factors contributing to this discrepancy. First, in comparison with most of the other tables in Meadowcrest Lodge, the VIP table was the only table that was both round and accessible from all sides. This enabled a greater number of residents to be seated here (five or six residents) compared with all other tables in the dining room (maximum of four). However, the increased proportion of informal social interaction at this table was not solely due to the table shape or the number of residents occupying the space. For example, staff indicated that the table at this location had been changed recently to accommodate the large number of residents who enjoyed sitting in this area:
<disp-quote>
<p>‘We put the round table there because … it was a VIP table no matter what. It was square [before]. But you had people double seating, like this way and that way … how can you fit two people on one side, on each side? … it was just beginning to be too much.’ (Interview, Care Aide, Meadowcrest Lodge)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Instead the table's positioning within the dining room appeared to play an influential role in facilitating informal social interaction between residents. Specifically, the VIP table was centered along the perimeter of the dining room within a space where residents could enjoy an unobstructed line of sight into other sections of the main activity area including the lounge, kitchen, hallway entrances on both sides of the unit and the outdoors. Possessing a wide array of sightlines was crucial as it attracted residents to this location and provided them with an opportunity to interact with others who were also brought together by this location. Care staff agreed with this assessment and the importance of sightlines within Meadowcrest Lodge:
<disp-quote>
<p>‘I remember Joe … And he sat right there at the head of the table kind of thing … because he could … he sat there so that he could see everything. He didn't want to sit any other place at the table. It had to be there so that he could see every section of [the unit] …’ (Interview, Care Aide, Meadowcrest Lodge)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>In addition, the VIP table was located near large windows surrounding the lounge. This allowed the space to be well lit with natural light throughout the day. This may have also contributed to the experience of residents at this table.</p>
<p>Collectively, the popularity and effectiveness of the VIP table in terms of facilitating social interaction between residents appears to be due to a multitude of factors including the vast array of sightlines afforded by this space, a table which seats a greater number of people, and adequate natural lighting surrounding this space.</p>

<sec id="sec20-1471301211421189"><title>Implications for practice</title>
<p>The findings from this investigation highlight the complexity of physical and social environmental factors within SCUs that appear to influence informal social interaction within these settings. From a social environment perspective, we can implement policies that recognize the importance of and promote informal social interaction within SCUs by creating a culture that values these goals as important. Accordingly, providing adequate training opportunities for staff such that they are able to embody the essence of these policies may assist in this process. Similarly, being cognizant of the nuances that affect social engagement among residents when making care decisions, including the impact of group size and time of day, is also valuable. Likewise, there are several environment components built within SCUs that warrant consideration in terms of facilitating informal social interaction. In particular, there is a responsibility to attend to the relational needs of people with dementia by constructing social spaces within SCUs. Such space would take into account the importance of factors highlighted in this investigation including sightlines, transition spaces, scale, seating, and the overall ambiance in an attempt to optimize SCUs for informal social interaction.</p>
<p>Taking into consideration the issues and recommendations discussed here, an opportunity surely exists that allows residents to flourish and engage with others meaningfully and frequently during informal social interactions. In considering the theoretical foundations of this investigation and the conceptual framework presented previously, the findings of this study demonstrate that a multitude of built and social environmental factors are indeed important determinants of meaningful informal social interaction in SCUs. However, it is important to note that these findings reflect only the influence of certain physical environmental (e.g. space use, density of residents, residential character, nursing station location, seating, sightlines, and transition spaces) and social environmental factors (e.g. internalizing the philosophy of care, staff roles, group size, and time of day) within this framework. Other factors that may be important in presenting opportunities for informal social interaction were not explored in any great detail. For example, aside from briefly discussing how the number of residents within a space may influence these opportunities, situational factors such as understanding the circumstances through which individuals come into contact and whether or not they socialize with one another requires additional research. Similarly, the health and mobility levels of residents appear to influence how residents are able to immerse themselves within the social world of both SCUs, however how other individual-level factors such as one's sensory or cognitive abilities shape the social experience of people with dementia and how these individuals use the spaces within SCUs to interact with others is also an important consideration not explored here. Furthermore, other key issues which may affect the opportunity for informal social interaction, such as organizational factors (e.g. implementation of policies, staff culture, organizational dynamics), were not explored extensively and warrant further investigation.</p>
<p>While the findings discussed in this investigation may inform the design of new facilities for people with dementia, it is also imperative to provide insight into what can be done within the context and realities of existing SCUs to facilitate informal social interaction among people with dementia. For example, having adequate seating throughout the facility emerged as an important issue. This refers to not only the quantity of seats available, but also to their strategic positioning, that is, positioning these seats in a way which maximizes contact between individuals (e.g. having ample seating in areas where residents congregate: lounges, dining room, corridors, entrances to other spaces) and positioning seating to maximize lines of sight to other spaces (e.g. appeared to encourage residents to visit other spaces, engage with other residents, or simply discuss the happenings of the unit at a particular point in time). Thus, recommendations for existing SCUs are as follows.</p>
<sec id="sec21-1471301211421189"><title>1. Include seating areas in the hallways and transition spaces.</title>
<p>This would allow residents who congregate in these areas to be comfortable, define the space as a social setting, and give residents an opportunity to engage passively or actively with others as they pass by.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec22-1471301211421189"><title>2. Arrange seating areas such that they maximize visual access to other areas of the facility.</title>
<p>This includes seating in the dining rooms, lounges, corridors, and in all other spaces as social interaction can be fostered by seating which allow multiple lines of sight for residents. These seats can be arranged to provide residents with the opportunity to see or interact with others. For example, positioning seats such that residents face the center of the unit allows them to see what is happening in other spaces. This provides residents with the opportunity to move to adjoining spaces and interact with those who are there, communicate with other individuals already around them about the happenings or objects in the nearby spaces, or not interact with anyone. SCUs may also adopt an open concept design within the main activity spaces in an attempt to maximize sightlines. This should limit objects and structures that may cause large visual obstructions for residents. Wall cutouts, particularly in those walls adjacent to hallways or walking paths, may be a possibility in some SCUs as this would provide residents with greater visual access to other social spaces while walking in the hallway.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec23-1471301211421189"><title>3. Incorporate a series of public and private spaces, homelike decorations and furniture, adequate lighting, and attempt to reduce ambient noise</title>
<p>In recognizing that not all residents prefer to engage in social activities and that those who do enjoy socializing with others may not like to socialize at all times, SCU environments should incorporate areas that provide levels of privacy for residents. It is important to also ensure that there are a variety of social spaces that cater to residents’ varying social needs. Larger spaces may be converted into more private sections through the integration of movable half-walls or screens. This will create spaces that provide a sense of enclosure, yet maintain the openness required to provide lines of sight from other spaces on the unit.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec24-1471301211421189"><title>4. Ensure congruence between the physical and social environments</title>
<p>Finally, this investigation highlights the importance of maintaining congruence between the physical and social environments. For example, while the findings here suggest that integrated nursing stations may be beneficial to facilitate informal social interaction, care staff must have the flexibility in their work schedules in order to both facilitate informal social interactions between residents, but also the appropriate amount of time to socialize with residents as these opportunities emerge. Similarly, the inclusion of additional seating, new spaces, half-walls, and other design features within SCUs may require staff (both care staff and housekeeping staff) to adapt to these new environments and routines. Thus, ensuring that organizational goals are aligned with physical environment modifications to meet the needs of care staff and residents alike is of great importance in terms of facilitating informal social interaction in SCUs.</p>
