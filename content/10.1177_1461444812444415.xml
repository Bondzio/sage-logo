<p>This text by Tony Wilson is a strong critique of the traditional media effects approach to understanding how audiences respond to advertising. Wilson deconstructs ‘the inductivist-causalist theory wherein consumer attitude formation is a (passive) consequence of’ media content (p. 118) by advancing a new perspective on reception theory. The book’s key theoretical contribution is the seven-step process by which consumers experience and interpret branding. These steps include: absorbing marketing screen content, anticipating the content narrative, articulating (or integrating content), aligning with narrative agents, appropriating, alienation, and analysis.</p>
<p>Wilson argues that <italic>Global Advertising</italic> is not ‘an argument against statistical methods in marketing’ but rather the argument is against the inductivist ‘focus on the conceptual presuppositions of using those methods’ (p. xi). Wilson counters the idea that audiences are passive consumers of marketing content, instead suggesting consumers make conscientious decisions to either reject (alienate) or appropriate marketing narratives. Wilson also writes in starkly critical terms about the ‘pseudo-science’ flaws in trying to prove a ‘mythical causal chain’ among variables (p. 12). Understanding audiences should be about engaging in readings of texts and looking at how active media consumers interpret advertising and how they are immersed in brandscapes.</p>
<p>From this reviewer’s perspective, appropriation and alienation are the two most important steps in Wilson’s seven-step cognitive response model. Major subsections in Chapter 2 examine these steps and they are referenced numerous times throughout the remainder of the book. These steps further explain the methodological concerns that are raised about quantitative audience studies.</p>
<p>In focusing upon the advertising-attitude-action nexus, we hold that advertising does not cause audiences to form <italic>attitudes</italic> (whatever they are). For a more conceptually plausible view is that consumers <italic>appropriate</italic> meaning from marketing in their lives – or distance themselves in criticism. (p. 24, ital. in orig.)</p>
<p>In other words, active consumers either ‘appropriate advertising to form beliefs about themselves and their circumstances’ (p. 9) or they alienate themselves from narrative advertising content and critically engage with content. Both responses to advertising are seen as crucial for identity-formation among audience members.</p>
<p>Undergirding these arguments about consumer identity are discussions of two related concepts: agora and ludic life-worlds. Agora ‘is a space and time primarily on screen and secondarily in material reality of consumer citizen communication’ (p. 133). Branding and advertising materials are agora that serve as sites for projected stories of self confirmation. Place (agora) and ludic activities are paramount for advertisers. Occurring at agoric sites, advertising is effective when it encourages consumers to participate in a playful ‘ludic life-world where product use is familiar’ (p. x).</p>
<p>Wilson is the primary author of the book, although he writes most of the book’s seven chapters with co-researchers. This authorship arrangement gives the text a continuity in voice that a fully edited volume might otherwise lack; chapter after chapter Wilson seeks to break down the inductivist model for marketing and posit his own interpretivist view. The authorship arrangement gives appropriate recognition for Wilson’s research partners and also enables a full discussion of a handful of co-authored studies (including <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1461444812444415">Wilson and Thang’s, 2007</xref> article on cell phone use in Malaysia that appeared in <italic>New Media &amp; Society</italic>). Chapter 2 with Khor Yoke Lim discusses Malaysian bloggers’ interactions with five brandscapes (Malaysia’s Coffee Bean, Kentucky Fried Chicken, McDonald’s, Pizza Hut, and Starbucks) and four focus groups’ interactions with websites and television advertising from these brands. Chapter 3 with Azizah Hamzah discusses findings from focus groups of Indian, Chinese, and Malays on branding. Chapter 4 with Kiranjit Kaur discusses how participants in two mixed gender focus groups considered university websites. Chapter 5 with Norsita Lin Binti Ahmad discusses findings from a study involving Malaysian cell phones users. Chapter 6 with Tan Huey Pyng and Rabaah Tudin examine how people who visited Malaysian malls interpreted their mall-visiting experiences and advertising.</p>
<p><italic>Global Advertising</italic> is itself a narrative, with Wilson and his co-researchers using the lens of reception theory to reconsider advertising’s influence on audiences. This book emerges from a phenomenologically-based hermeneutic tradition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1461444812444415">Borgerson and Schroeder, 2002</xref>) and is noteworthy for several reasons. The book casts advertising in a new light and the discussion of agora is an interesting look at the role of place in shaping consumer attitudes. This is a major contribution and readers of this text will find Chapter 2 relevant in this respect. The book’s global focus is also crucial as it discusses localized advertising for a host of Western brands (Pizza Hut, McDonald’s, and Starbucks). We see how varied audience responses are to advertising and these international brands.</p>
<p>One final mention is made about the book’s treatment of new media. Wilson and his co-researchers grant considerable attention to blogs. It is observed that, ‘[c]itizens and consumers blog upon brandscapes: people engage with their values politically and as sites of valuable products’ (p. 72). Elsewhere, the text examines how audiences appropriate blogs and it is argued that blogs signal consumer immersion in media. Unfortunately, the book pays little attention to social networking sites, professional networking sites, or Twitter. The discussion of blogs is interspersed in such a way that key points on this topic are somewhat lost. This is less a weakness and more of a sign that Wilson and his co-researchers address other topics. It is hoped that other researchers and theorists will advance the discussion about how audience-produced social media content involving brands impact audience attitudes and identities. Alienation and appropriation could be critical in shaping audience members’ relationships with other forms of social media, and scholars should pick up where this book leaves off.</p>
<p>In summary, <italic>Global Advertising</italic> is a rich text that advances reception theory with respect to advertising. Whether one agrees with him or not, Wilson seeks to systematically demonstrate the weaknesses of the inductivist approach to studying advertising. The book is a nuanced look at advertising in its current form and how audiences experience advertising messages. With its focus and examples, this book can be utilized in a wide range of graduate classroom settings and for future theorizing.</p>
