<abstract>
<p>This study investigates whether positive educational experiences in midadolescence mitigate the impact of exposure to substantiated maltreatment and reduces young adult antisocial behavior. While there is theoretical and empirical support for the mediating or moderating role of educational experiences on maltreatment and antisocial outcomes, few prospective studies exist. In this exploratory study, data are from the Rochester Youth Development Study (RYDS), a longitudinal panel study of 1,000 adolescents. The original sample included 73% males, and 85% African American or Hispanic youth of whom about 20% were maltreated. Measures in this study are from a combination of interview data and official records collected through age 23. Outcomes include self-reported crime and violence, arrest, and partner violence perpetration. Educational variables include midadolescent self-report of high school graduation, educational aspiration, college expectation, school commitment, teacher attachment, self-reported grades, school GPA, attendance, and an additive index of all school assets. Multivariate path analysis controlled for gender, race/ethnicity, poverty, and early antisocial behavior. Path analysis examined whether educational experiences mediated the impact of maltreatment on antisocial outcomes. Although maltreatment was significantly predictive of criminal and violent behaviors, it only was weakly associated with educational experiences. The impact of maltreatment on arrest was weakly mediated (reduced) by educational GPA and by high school graduation. The additive index also mediated the impact of maltreatment on crime and violence. Maltreatment’s impact on partner violence was also weakly mediated by school GPA. Interaction terms were used to test for moderation: only one significant effect was found: school GPA protects maltreated youth from perpetration of partner violence as young adults. Although there are few significant effects in a number of models, the research is consistent with a focus on promoting school achievement and completion among urban youth in general, in conjunction with addressing earlier antisocial behavior problems.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Progress in the advancement of a society is intrinsically linked to successful efforts to understand and minimize barriers to individuals’ normative adaptation and productivity. Child maltreatment is an extensive public health problem that poses significant barriers to healthy development as has been noted in many contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0886260512448845">Gilbert et al., 2009</xref>). It is also an expensive problem whose multiple sequelae endure into adulthood and include long-term economic impact exceeding 100 billion dollars annually (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0886260512448845">Currie &amp; Widom, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0886260512448845">Wang &amp; Holton, 2007</xref>). Among the identified consequences of maltreatment are crime and violence in early adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0886260512448845">Maxfield &amp; Widom, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0886260512448845">Smith, Ireland, &amp; Thornberry, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0886260512448845">Thornberry, Henry, Ireland, &amp; Smith, 2010</xref>), which also present as major public health threats and carry extensive costs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0886260512448845">McCollister, French, &amp; Fang, 2010</xref>). Furthermore, young adult criminal and violent behavior is of concern because it indicates a more serious and persistent developmental trajectory that is likely to continue into adult life, and across generations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0886260512448845">Ireland, Rivera, &amp; Hoffmann, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0886260512448845">Moffitt, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0886260512448845">Smith, Ireland, Park, Elwyn, &amp; Thornberry, 2011</xref>). Thus identifying ways to deflect problematic behavioral outcomes in adulthood, in the presence of a known risk factor—in this case maltreatment—is critical for later adult life course well-being.</p>
<p>Studies show that many individuals exposed to intense stressors such as child maltreatment prosper and succeed despite these adversities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0886260512448845">Collishaw et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0886260512448845">Haskett, Nears, Ward, &amp; McPherson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0886260512448845">McGloin &amp; Widom, 2001</xref>). The term resilience has been applied to this phenomenon, signifying “a relative resistance to environmental risk experiences, or the overcoming of stress or adversity” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0886260512448845">Rutter, 2006</xref>, p. 1). Resilience has been operationized in various ways, often across several domains of functioning (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0886260512448845">DuMont, Widom, &amp; Czaja, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0886260512448845">Masten, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0886260512448845">McGloin &amp; Widom, 2001</xref>). Others, however, argue that within domain or domain specific measures of resilience may be more useful since affected individuals may function well in some areas and not others (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0886260512448845">Herrenkohl, 2010</xref>). Here we examine a within domain measure of resilience in the context of the relationship between maltreatment and subsequent crime and violence. Considering within domain measures instead of across domain measures of resilience helps to clarify those factors that contribute to protection.</p>
<p>The study of resilience focuses attention on protective factors and mechanisms that mitigate and compensate for risk. The protective factors under consideration in this manuscript involve aspects of school performance and school connectedness. Recently, there has been considerable policy focus on fostering academic achievement in primary and secondary education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0886260512448845">Klein, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0886260512448845">Ripley, 2010</xref>). However, the negative influence of maltreatment on academic performance has not been emphasized, nor has the potential for school-related experiences to positively change the life course of maltreated youth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0886260512448845">Slade &amp; Wissow, 2007</xref>). In fact, with respect to maltreated children, “the potential protective role of school . . . deserve[s] far more consideration” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0886260512448845">Haskett et al., 2006</xref>, p. 806). Thus we explore whether and how positive school experiences might protect maltreated youth from the risk of criminal behavior and violence in early adulthood.</p>

<title>Conceptual Background</title>
<p>The rise of research on risk and resilience in child development and child psychopathology has provided a promising window into developmental diversity and into general processes that might promote positive outcomes for at risk youth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0886260512448845">Masten, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0886260512448845">Rutter, 2006</xref>). However, the spectrum of processes through which adversity might be mitigated is rather broad. A number of specific developmental models in psychology and criminology indicate how movement toward and away from specific trajectories of behavior might occur. An example is the life course interactional theory that guides the Rochester Youth Development Study (RYDS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0886260512448845">Thornberry, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0886260512448845">Thornberry &amp; Krohn, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0886260512448845">2005</xref>). From this and similar developmental perspectives (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0886260512448845">Masten et al., 2005</xref>), exposure to experiences like family violence can bring about cascading consequences that may lead from initial short-term negative cognitive, emotional, or behavioral responses to entrenched longer term negative consequences in early adulthood and adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0886260512448845">Smith et al., 2011</xref>). A developmental history of this nature increases the chances of continuing involvement in problem behavior, including crime and violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0886260512448845">Ireland &amp; Smith, 2009</xref>); however protective factors and remedial experiences in different life arenas, such as school, may create turning points in this trajectory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0886260512448845">Haskett et al., 2006</xref>). A variety of protective or supportive experiences come into play at different life stages as age-graded roles and social settings are patterned increasingly into the life course (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0886260512448845">Caspi &amp; Elder, 1988</xref>), and the adolescent life stage is associated with increasing opportunities and experiences beyond the family, including in school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0886260512448845">Jessor, Donovan, &amp; Costa, 1991</xref>). Research has broadly supported the relevance of groupings of protective factors or assets at the individual, family and environmental levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0886260512448845">Garmezy, Masten, &amp; Tellegen, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0886260512448845">Werner, 2005</xref>). School experiences are often defined at the individual level in terms of skills, achievements, planning, and motivation, and can include feeling bonded to school or being connected to teachers or other mentors in the school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0886260512448845">Haskett et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0886260512448845">Loukas, Roalson, &amp; Hererra, 2010</xref>). Thus a cluster of interrelated educational experiences including indicators of academic performance and school engagement or connectedness are hypothesized to influence young adult outcomes in a normative direction. The protective impact of various factors is characteristically explored through examining the indirect effect of maltreatment on outcomes through hypothesized intervening processes (mediation), or else through investigating whether high risk children are more likely to be positively impacted by protective factors than those not at risk (moderation); (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0886260512448845">Eckenrode, Rowe, Laird, &amp; Brathwaite, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0886260512448845">Masten, 2007</xref>). We explore both here.</p>

<title>Review of the Empirical Literature</title>
<p>Several empirical literatures are relevant. First are studies of maltreatment’s impact on crime and violence, especially in late adolescence and early adulthood. Second are studies of maltreatment and its impact on educational experiences, notably in adolescence. The third related literature involves the impact of educational experiences on crime and violence. Finally, a few studies explore the role of school factors when considering the maltreatment-crime relationship.</p>
<sec id="section4-0886260512448845">
<title>The Effects of Maltreatment on Crime and Violence</title>
<p>A well-developed literature with longitudinal data predicts that maltreatment elevates the risk for later delinquency and crime, starting with the seminal study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0886260512448845">Widom (1989)</xref>. Research from the RYDS starting in 1995 has also underlined the importance of maltreatment as a risk factor for antisocial outcomes in adolescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0886260512448845">Ireland, Smith, &amp; Thornberry, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0886260512448845">Smith &amp; Thornberry, 1995</xref>), and early adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0886260512448845">Smith et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0886260512448845">Thornberry et al., 2010</xref>). In addition, a recent review identifies maltreatment outcomes of aggression, violence and crime as having the strongest research support from a wide range of prospective and retrospective studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0886260512448845">Gilbert et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The link between maltreatment and partner violence has been much less explored. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0886260512448845">White and Widom (2003)</xref> found that partner violence was significantly more prevalent among previously abused and neglected young adults, compared to nonmaltreated participants. RYDS studies of partner violence have also determined that physical abuse—a subset of maltreatment experiences—continues to have a main direct effect on partner violence outcomes in adulthood, when other predictors are included (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0886260512448845">Smith et al., 2011</xref>). However, little of the maltreatment/partner violence research has examined mediators and we could find no study that focused on the role of school experiences or school connectedness as protective factors.</p>

<sec id="section5-0886260512448845">
<title>The Effects of Maltreatment on Educational Experiences</title>
<p>Studies of maltreatment in young children suggest that childhood maltreatment impacts emotional, behavioral and social development in ways that would be expected to impair academic performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0886260512448845">Cicchetti, Rogosh, Lynch, &amp; Holt, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0886260512448845">Haskett et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0886260512448845">Shonk &amp; Cicchetti, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0886260512448845">Slade &amp; Wissow, 2007</xref>). In addition, well designed studies indicate that maltreated children have lower educational attainment and lower school commitment (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0886260512448845">Leiter, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0886260512448845">Haskett et al., 2006</xref> for reviews). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0886260512448845">Leiter and Johnsen (1997)</xref> found that officially recorded maltreatment elevates the subsequent risk of lower grades, grade retention, poor attendance and adverse behaviors in elementary school. However, some studies suggest the educational impact of earlier maltreatment does not persist into adolescence (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0886260512448845">Rowe &amp; Eckenrode, 1999</xref>). Compared to the link between maltreatment and antisocial behavior, fewer studies have looked at educational outcomes in adolescence, or used longitudinal data to establish the long-term maltreatment effect on educational outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0886260512448845">Leiter, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0886260512448845">Slade &amp; Wissow, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>A complication of the literature is that various aspects of educational experience are examined in different studies. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0886260512448845">Slade and Wissow (2007)</xref> found that grade point average (GPA) and homework completion were particularly affected for maltreated compared to nonmaltreated participants, while problems with teachers and school absence were unrelated to maltreatment. Several studies indicate that maltreated children drop out of school at higher rates (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0886260512448845">Currie &amp; Widom, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0886260512448845">Fang &amp; Tarui, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0886260512448845">Leiter, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0886260512448845">McGloin &amp; Widom, 2001</xref>). However, other studies are more nuanced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0886260512448845">Thornberry, Ireland, &amp; Smith, 2001</xref>). Poorer grade attainment was found among maltreated participants in several studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0886260512448845">Kelley, Thornberry, &amp; Smith, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0886260512448845">Leiter, 2007</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0886260512448845">Eckenrode and colleagues (1995)</xref> found that grades, test scores and test repetitions were negatively affected among maltreated, compared to control group children, although some of this impact was accounted for by school mobility. Generally research suggests that the relationship between maltreatment and poor academic performance is stronger in prospective studies than in retrospective studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0886260512448845">Gilbert et al., 2009</xref>), and although the relationship is solidly established, “. . . how and when [school] performance and engagement shift after maltreatment is an uncharted territory” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0886260512448845">Leiter, 2007</xref>, p. 363).</p>
<p>A related area of research is found in the resilience literature rather than in the maltreatment literature. School concepts in this literature are framed more positively, and include terms such as cognitive ability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0886260512448845">Collishaw et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0886260512448845">Haskett et al., 2006</xref>), school connectedness or engagement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0886260512448845">Loukas et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0886260512448845">Monahan, Oesterle, &amp; Hawkins, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0886260512448845">Stout &amp; Christenson, 2009</xref>), and positive educational outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0886260512448845">Plunkett, Henry, Houltberg, Sands, &amp; Abarca-Mortenson, 2008</xref>). Although most of this literature is not confined to maltreatment risk specifically, two reviews emphasize the potential for educational experiences to mitigate maltreatment’s impact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0886260512448845">Haskett et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0886260512448845">Veltman &amp; Browne, 2001</xref>). Veltman and Browne for example, note that
<disp-quote>
<p>[t]he school environment is one of the most important places where maltreated children could find support and positive influences on their lives, leading to feelings of optimism about their futures. It may provide positive and secure relationships with adults and peers and a place where teachers may foster accomplishments, boost self-esteem and provide new opportunities for personal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0886260512448845">Veltman &amp; Browne, 2001</xref>, p. 230).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Thus it is reasonable to expect that school experiences could mitigate negative developmental experiences deriving from maltreatment, although findings about the impact of specific educational experiences are mixed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0886260512448845">
<title>The Effects of Educational Experiences on Crime and Violence</title>
<p>Another large body of research consistently links negative school performance/experiences to delinquency and crime. Adult crime is, in particular, predicted by school dropout in a number of studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0886260512448845">Jajoura, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0886260512448845">Thornberry, Melanie, &amp; Christenson, 1985</xref>). A recent RYDS article (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0886260512448845">Henry, Knight, &amp; Thornberry, 2012</xref>) indicates that a school disengagement warning index is robustly related to dropout as well as serious problem behaviors in three developmental periods. High school dropout also mediates the effect of the warning index on serious problem behaviors in early adulthood.</p>
<p>Prior risk, including maltreatment, is of course implicated in the relationship between offending and school experiences such as dropping out, since both may be attributed to prior risk rather than being themselves causally related (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0886260512448845">Sweeten, Bushway, &amp; Paternoster, 2009</xref>). Thus dropping out as a defining school experience in predicting later crime, compared to a range of other experiences, might be important to explore for maltreated versus nonmaltreated youth. Longitudinal studies of the impact of educational experiences on partner violence are few, but among them it appears that a history of poor educational attainment predicts young adult partner violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0886260512448845">Fergusson, Boden, &amp; Horwood, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0886260512448845">Magdol, Moffitt, Caspi, &amp; Silva, 1998</xref>).</p>

<title>The Role of Educational Experiences in Understanding the Maltreatment-Crime/Violence Relationship</title>
<p>A large number of studies consider multiple protective factors (i.e., family, peers, school, and community) but do not focus uniquely on school factors as mediators or moderators for the maltreatment-criminal involvement relationship. In addition, some studies consider exposure to family risk more generally as a predictor of antisocial behavior that may be mediated by school performance or connectedness. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0886260512448845">Smith, Lizotte, Thornberry, and Krohn (1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0886260512448845">1997</xref>) investigated the effect of protective factors on delinquency and drug using RYDS data and included maltreatment in a family risk index. A number of factors differentiated high risk resilient and nonresilient youth, but the strength of the school protective factors as a group in distinguishing delinquent from nondelinquent high risk youth was notable (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0886260512448845">DuMont et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0886260512448845">Resnick, Ireland, &amp; Borowsky, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>One of the earliest longitudinal studies to specifically investigate the impact of school performance on the relationship between maltreatment and delinquency was conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-0886260512448845">Zingraff, Leiter, Johnsen, and Myers (1994)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-0886260512448845">Zingraff and Leiter (1995)</xref>. They examined whether good school performance in elementary school (as indicated by outcome and process variables including good attendance, grades, California Achievement Test (CAT) scores, years retained and school behavior problems) reduced the impact of maltreatment on official delinquency. Attendance, grades, and school behavior problems mediated the impact of maltreatment on delinquency. Another study focusing on adolescent antisocial outcomes among harshly disciplined youth investigated the role of a range of protective factors including school commitment and importance but also factors relating to family and peers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0886260512448845">Herrenkohl, Tajima, Whitney, &amp; Huang, 2005</xref>). School commitment and school importance were among the protective factors associated with reduced antisocial outcomes for both abused and nonabused youth.</p>
<p>Only one longitudinal study was located that focused on adult outcomes. Data from the Chicago Longitudinal Study was used to investigate adult criminal outcomes at age 24 in maltreated and nonmaltreated participants with a special focus on educational mediators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0886260512448845">Topitzes, 2006</xref>). Education mediators included attendance, reading achievement, high school graduation, days absent, and school commitment. Among school factors, only reading achievement and high school graduation mediated the impact of maltreatment on adult crime. No moderation effects were found. A related study indicated that the impact of high school completion mediated the impact of maltreatment on adult offending for both males and females, and reading score was an addition mediator for females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0886260512448845">Topitzes, Mersky, &amp; Reynolds, 2011</xref>).</p>

<title>Summary</title>
<p>Research has established that maltreatment has a consistent main effect on crime and violence in late adolescence and, to a lesser extent, in early adulthood. In addition, a less developed literature indicates that maltreatment depresses school performance. Research also links measures of weak school achievement and engagement to delinquency and crime. A few studies indicate that school experiences (performance and connectedness) may mediate the relationship between maltreatment and crime and violence in early adulthood, thereby having the potential to influence a fairly negative behavioral trajectory in a more positive direction, but the role of educational experiences as a protective factor in the context of maltreatment and crime is not well understood or researched.</p>
<p>In particular, few studies address whether educational achievements and school connectedness mediate or moderate the effect of maltreatment on crime and violence, and thus contribute to behavioral resilience for affected youth. Studies have not generally examined a wide range of potential school mediators and do not include a range of criminal and violent outcomes, including intimate partner violence. No studies were found in which positive educational experiences interacted with or moderated the impact of maltreatment on crime or violence. This is consistent with the general resilience literature which indicates that factors that contribute to resilience among high risk youth show a main effect for all children, rather than a specific—or moderating—impact on high risk youth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0886260512448845">Masten, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0886260512448845">Werner, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>Therefore, this study contributes to the literature by using data from a prospective community sample that has a measure of substantiated maltreatment, and a range of measures of school experiences (performance and connectedness) as reported by adolescent participants, as well as the schools. In addition, self-reported measures of crime and violence, an official measure of arrest, and self-reported perpetration of intimate partner violence in early adulthood are considered as dependent variables. Here, our general and exploratory aim is to investigate whether educational experiences mediate or moderate the impact of maltreatment on young adult antisocial outcomes. Our research questions are as follows:</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>Data from the RYDS, an ongoing longitudinal study of the causes and correlates of delinquency and drug use, are used here to illuminate the pathways from maltreatment to behaviorally resilient outcomes specifically addressing the role of positive educational experiences as protective factors. The RYDS was designed to investigate the development of delinquency/crime and other problem behaviors in a representative urban community sample. The study design and sampling procedures are detailed elsewhere (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0886260512448845">Smith &amp; Thornberry, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0886260512448845">Thornberry, Krohn, Lizotte, Smith, &amp; Tobin, 2003a</xref>) and are summarized here. The RYDS is a multiwave panel study of youth (Generation 2 or G2) and their primary caregivers (Generation 1 or G1)—a biological mother or mother figure 95% of the time. The participants (both G1 and G2) were initially interviewed every 6 months, then at three annual interviews in G2 early adulthood. During phase 1 of data collection, youth participants were on average 14 to 18 years old (waves 1 through 9); during phase 2, they were on average 21 to 23 years old (waves 10 through 12). The initial sample of 1,000 adolescents was selected from the population of seventh and eighth graders (average age 14) in the Rochester, NY, public schools in 1988. To obtain a sufficient number of youth at high risk for serious delinquency and drug use, males and those who resided in high-crime areas of the city were oversampled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0886260512448845">Krohn &amp; Thornberry, 1999</xref>). The original panel included 68% African American, 17% Hispanic and 15% White participants, and 72.9% of the sample was male. At the end of phase 2, 85% (<italic>n</italic> = 846) of the original participants had been reinterviewed. A comparison of those retained and not retained at the end of phase 2 revealed no significant differences in demographic characteristics and delinquency between the original panel and those retained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0886260512448845">Thornberry et al., 2003a</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section10-0886260512448845">
<title>Measurement</title>
<p>For this study, measures are from youth and parent/caregiver interviews during Phase 1 and Phase 2, as well as from the Rochester public school files, the Rochester Police arrest files, and Monroe County Child Protective Service (CPS) data.</p>
<sec id="section11-0886260512448845">
<title>Outcomes</title>
<sec id="section12-0886260512448845">
<title>Self-reported general crime</title>
<p>A set of self-reported delinquency/crime questions asks whether or not the respondent has committed a particular offense in the interval between the last and current interview and, if so, the frequency of those behaviors are reported. Indexes of self-reported offending have been used in many publications and their validity is well established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0886260512448845">Thornberry et al., 2003a</xref>). The general crime index includes 25 offenses ranging from minor offenses like public rowdiness and petty theft to serious offenses like robbery and assault with a deadly weapon. A variety index was constructed across the three phase 2 waves of data gathered at 1-year intervals. The potential range of this measure is thus 0-25, but the actual range is 0 to 11. The mean of criminal acts endorsed is 1.68. <italic>Self-reported violent crime</italic>: The violent crime index is a subscale of the general crime index, which contains six questions about violent interactions with others, including gang fights, robbery, and assault. Again, a variety score was constructed across the three waves of data collection in early adulthood. The range of this measure is 0 to 6 but actual responses ranged from 0 to 5. The mean of violent criminal acts endorsed is .62. <italic>Arrest</italic>: Official crime or arrest data, collected from the files of the Rochester Police Department, covers all police agencies in Monroe County, as the Rochester Police Department maintains a countywide registry. We also searched the files of the New York State Division of Criminal Justice Services to identify arrests outside of Monroe County. Since arrest dates are known, we can parallel the self-report periods utilized here by constructing a measure of official crime during early adulthood. An arrest is counted each time the participant was arrested, but since this measure is highly skewed, a prevalence measure is utilized. Thus 34% of participants were arrested at least once in early adulthood.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0886260512448845">
<title>Perpetration of intimate partner violence</title>
<p>During early adulthood (ages 21 to 23), focal youth participants were asked about partner violence with married, cohabiting and long-term dating partners (dating at least 6 months). The Conflict Tactics Scale (CTS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0886260512448845">Straus, 1979</xref>), a scale in wide use with considerable documentation of reliability and validity (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0886260512448845">Straus, 1990</xref>), was administered at each of three 1-year intervals. The CTS contains questions on the prevalence and frequency of tactics employed during partner conflict that range from discuss issues calmly to use of a weapon. The violence subscale used here is comprised of nine items that range from throwing something at a partner to actually using a weapon against a partner. The value of intimate partner violence is set to “0” (no violence) for those with no partner, to indicate no evidence of partner violence. This results in a conservative estimate of exposure since some with intermittent partners may have experienced violence. We utilize a variety score of perpetrated acts of partner violence summed across the same three year time span. Actual scores on this measure ranged from 0 to 9. The mean number of acts endorsed is approximately 1.</p>

<sec id="section14-0886260512448845">
<title>Protective School Measures</title>
<p>Education measures are taken from self-reports of the participants at interview waves 4 and 5 of the study, just prior to the age when students can legally stop attending school in New York. The measures use the mean of the two data points where two are available (fall 1989 and spring 1990), otherwise information from a single wave is used. <italic>Educational aspirations</italic> are measured using adolescents’ self-report about their educational aspirations in response to three questions that include “How important is it to you (a) to graduate from high school; (b) to go to college; (c) to graduate from college.” The scores across the two waves were averaged, with a range from 1 (<italic>not important</italic>) to 4 (<italic>very important</italic>) and a mean of 3.59. Alpha reliabilities for the two waves are .79 and .80. <italic>College expectation</italic> is a single-variable measure assessing participant responses to the question “do you really think you will go to college,” for which response choices are <italic>yes</italic> (3) <italic>depends/maybe</italic> (2) or <italic>no</italic> (1). The measure ranged from 1 to 3 with a mean of 2.62. <italic>Attachment to teacher</italic> is measured using adolescent self-reports on a 4-question scale, utilizing a 4-point response scale ranging from <italic>strongly disagree</italic> (1) to <italic>strongly agree</italic> (4). The questions include “if you need advice, you would go to one of your teachers,” and “you feel very close to at least one of your teachers.” Final scale scores averaged across two waves ranged from 1 to 4 with a mean of 2.86. Alpha reliabilities for the scales at the two waves were .63 and .65 respectively. <italic>School commitment</italic> is measured using adolescents’ self-reports on a 9-item scale with a 4-point response scale ranging from <italic>strongly disagree</italic> (1) to <italic>strongly agree</italic> (4). Respondents were asked nine questions such as “you like school a lot,” “you do really belong at school,” “you try hard at school,” and “getting good grades is very important to you.” The scores on this measure range from 1.7 to 3.9, with a mean of 3.1 averaged across two waves. Alpha reliabilities on this measure are .84 and .85 at each wave.<italic>Self-reported grades</italic> are measured using adolescents’ self-report about their overall letter grades at each interview and these were translated into a 5-point numeric scale where a grade of A was scored as 5, B as 4, C as 3, D as 2 and E and F combined as 1. The mean of self-reported grades is 3.27. <italic>School attendance</italic> is measured through adolescents’ self-report of how many times they “skipped classes without an excuse” during the two semesters, fall 1989 and spring 1990. If they answered “yes”, then they were asked to report the frequency of the behavior, and this was added across the two waves. The score ranging from 0 to 95 days of skipped classes is reverse coded into five categories: 5 (<italic>no missed days</italic>); 4 (<italic>1 or 2 missed days</italic>); 3 (<italic>3-9 missed days</italic>); 2 (<italic>10 to 19 missed days</italic>); and 1 (<italic>20 or above</italic>). The mean is 3.71. <italic>High school diploma</italic> is included as an important marker of school persistence. At the first interview of phase 2, when respondents were past the graduation age, they were asked if they had received a high school diploma, General Educational Diploma (GED) or neither. This variable denotes those who had received a high school diploma or not: 59% of participants had achieved a diploma. One measure—<italic>School GPA</italic>—comes from the Rochester School data and is available from the year when the self-reported measures were gathered (1989). Mean GPA on this measure is 1.84. Educational measures in the RYDS are similar to those utilized in other criminological studies, and have construct validity as demonstrated in their consistent (negative) relationship to problem outcomes (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0886260512448845">Thornberry et al., 2003a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0886260512448845">Thornberry, Lizotte, Krohn, Smith, &amp; Porter, 2003b</xref>). We constructed a measure a measure that represents overall educational protective experiences: a <italic>school protective index</italic> (SPI). The index is an additive count of all eight school variables described above. Previous studies suggest that a protective factor count reflects the additive effect of several positive experiences which may link more strongly to lower risk of outcome behaviors (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0886260512448845">Herrenkohl et al., 2005</xref>).</p> <p>The continuous school variables were dichotomized on or around the top 25th percentile and those with scores in the top quartile (or nearest available proportion) were coded as “1,” designating the protective factor end of the distribution, with others coded as “0” (For discussion of the convention of considering the top quartile of a continuous variable as the “protective” end see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0886260512448845">Stouthamer-Loeber et al., 1993</xref>). For example, on school GPA, good grades were considered to be the equivalent of B- or above on the scale. So if a student has a B- or higher average, he or she is assigned a value of “1” or else the student is assigned a value of “0.” Then, a count of school protective factors yielded an overall score that could range from 0 to 8, with an 8 meaning that the respondent is performing at B- or better, is regularly in attendance, has relatively high educational aspirations and expectations, has relatively high attachment and commitment to school, reports earning a diploma, and self-reports relatively high academic performance.</p>

<title>Substantiated Maltreatment</title>
<p>Maltreatment measurement is based on data obtained from the substantiated child protective service (CPS) records of Monroe County, the adolescents’ county of residence at the start of the RYDS. From records of substantiated cases affecting our participants, details on each maltreatment incident, including type(s) of maltreatment from birth to age 17, were coded according to the classification system developed by Cicchetti (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0886260512448845">Cicchetti &amp; Barnett, 1991</xref>). Official substantiation in CPS records involves an initial report, an investigation, and a substantiation decision according to state law. It represents a relatively objective record indicating that an investigative threshold has been passed, and that maltreatment has occurred (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0886260512448845">Barnett, Manly, &amp; Cicchetti, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0886260512448845">Stockhammer, Salzinger, Feldman, Mojica, &amp; Primavera, 2001</xref>). Official records are relatively contemporary, following on the heels of documented events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0886260512448845">Barnett et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0886260512448845">Smith &amp; Thornberry, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0886260512448845">Widom &amp; Morris, 1997</xref>). We use a dichotomous measure of any substantiated maltreatment from birth through approximately age 17.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0886260512448845">1</xref></sup> The measure of maltreatment is based on at least one substantiated incident including any of the following types of maltreatment: physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional abuse, and neglect (itself including lack of supervision, physical neglect, educational neglect, and moral/legal abuse). Among sample participants, 19.8% have one or more substantiated incident of maltreatment. The most frequent type of maltreatment in the RYDS is neglect—119 adolescent participants were neglected. A considerable number of adolescent participants were involved in other types of maltreatment—85 experienced physical abuse; 79 experienced emotional abuse; and 21 experienced sexual abuse. Also, about half of maltreated participants experienced one or more types of maltreatment.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-0886260512448845">
<title>Control Variables</title>
<p>We include the following covariates in each estimated model since their effects have typically been controlled in other multivariate studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0886260512448845">Grogan-Kaylor &amp; Otis, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0886260512448845">Herrenkohl, Huang, Tajima, &amp; Whitney, 2003</xref>). <italic>Race/ethnicity</italic> includes two dummy variables, African American (68%) and Hispanic (17%), with non-Hispanic White (15%) as the omitted category. <italic>Gender</italic> has females coded as the omitted category, and 27% are female. <italic>Chronic family poverty</italic> measures the number of waves in poverty in the first four waves when adolescent participants were approximately 14 to 15.4 years old. Any one of three indicators was used to measure poverty: income below the federal poverty line, unemployment, or receipt of public assistance. Waves spent in poverty ranged from 0 to 4. The mean of waves in poverty among sample members is just over 2. <italic>Any early adolescent general delinquency</italic> is employed as a covariate to control for an existing trajectory of antisocial behavior potentially unrelated to maltreatment. Just over half of the participants (53%) reported early delinquency.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-0886260512448845">
<title>Analytical Strategy</title>
<p>To examine research questions, we first conduct bivariate analysis to check whether positive school experiences are associated with maltreatment and outcome behaviors without considering other covariates. We then employ path model analysis to test mediating and moderating roles of positive school experiences in the relationships between maltreatment and outcome variables. Path analysis is an appropriate method to model mediation, as it solves an entire set of regression equations simultaneously and enables calculation of direct, indirect, and total effects between measures. Path analysis also allows for tests of moderation effects using either product terms or multiple group comparisons. The software used for multivariate path analysis is Mplus Version 4.21. For models with continuous dependent variables, the estimator used is a maximum likelihood estimator with a chi square test statistic and standard errors that are robust to nonnormal distributions. For the dichotomous outcome variable, arrest, a weighted least squares estimator is used to conduct probit regression. Path model analysis provides a number of indices that can be used to determine the goodness of fit of the model to the data. Overall model fit is assessed using global fit indices including the model chi square (χ<sup>2</sup>), Comparative Fit Index (CFI), and Root Mean Squared Error of Approximation (RMSEA), and component model fit is assessed using modification indices.</p>
<p>The proportion of missing values across variables in the multivariate analysis ranges from 0% (race/ethnicity, gender) to 28% (school GPA) and also varies due to differential attrition and different data sources. Mplus employs full information maximum-likelihood estimation (FIML) that enables use of cases with incomplete data thus providing maximum available sample size for each model. The likelihood is computed for the observed portion of each case’s data and then accumulated and maximized over all available cases. FIML parameter estimates involve less bias and are more efficient than use of other missing data techniques such as list-wise deletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0886260512448845">Enders &amp; Bandalos, 2001</xref>). As do most techniques that address missing data, FIML assumes that data are missing at random (MAR).</p>

<title>Mediation</title>
<p>Mediation indicates that the effects of one variable on another are transmitted, either partly or completely, through a third variable. The current convention to assess the presence of mediation is joint significance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0886260512448845">MacKinnon, Lockwood, Hoffman, West, &amp; Sheets, 2002</xref>). In other words, significant relationships between the original predictor (any maltreatment) and the mediator (a school variable) (path a in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0886260512448845">figure 1</xref>), and between the mediator and the final outcomes of interest (early adult crime and violence measures) (path b in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0886260512448845">figure 1</xref>), are indicative of mediation. A direct effect is the association between the original predictor and the final outcomes controlling for the mediating variable. The magnitude of the estimated regression coefficient for an indirect effect can be calculated by multiplying the coefficients for each portion of the indirect path (path a × path b).</p>
<p>Path analysis was conducted with the five educational variables that were significantly related to maltreatment. Each of these education variables was entered into separate models as a mediator in the relationship between maltreatment and each of the four outcome variables (5 × 4 = 20 mediation models). Because this is an exploratory study we report marginal significance at <italic>p</italic> &gt; .10 to indicate trends in the data. Furthermore only findings that achieve this level of significance are reported in the figures. When control variables were entered into the model, there is evidence of weak mediation by school GPA, earning a high school diploma, and the school protective index. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0886260512448845">Figures 1</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0886260512448845">3</xref> present a summary of these findings.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0886260512448845">Figure 1</xref> contains estimates from two models that employ the same mediator, school GPA, and two different outcomes: arrest (Model 1) and partner violence (Model 2). Both models provide a good fit to the data: Model 1: χ<sup>2</sup>(3) = 2.19, <italic>p</italic> = .53, CFI = 1.0, RMSEA = .00; Model 2: χ<sup>2</sup>(3) = 4.18, <italic>p</italic> = .22, CFI = .99, RMSEA = .02. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0886260512448845">Figure 1</xref> indicates that school GPA only marginally mediates the association between maltreatment and both outcomes. As seen in the notation below <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0886260512448845">Figure 1</xref>, maltreatment is marginally associated with school GPA (<italic>b</italic> = –.17, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .10), and path (a) is the same in Model 1 and Model 2. School GPA is then significantly associated with both outcomes (mediation path b). In Model 1, higher GPA significantly links to a reduced risk of arrest (<italic>b</italic> = –.38, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), and in Model 2, higher GPA significantly links to a reduced risk of partner violence (<italic>b</italic> = –.29, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). In Model 1, the resulting indirect effect (a × b) of maltreatment on arrest through school GPA is small and marginally significant (<italic>b</italic> = .06, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .10).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0886260512448845">3</xref></sup> The indirect effect of maltreatment on perpetration of partner violence in Model 2 is also small and marginally significant (b = .05, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .10). The direct effect of maltreatment on arrest is shown along the top of the figure and indicates a significant direct effect between maltreatment and arrest (<italic>b</italic> = .25, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) and between maltreatment and partner violence (<italic>b</italic> = .41, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). Thus, the direct path between maltreatment and outcomes is strong, and school GPA partially mediates the relationship between maltreatment and outcomes in early adulthood.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0886260512448845">4</xref></sup> However, the mediating effects are only marginally significant.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0886260512448845">Figure 2</xref> shows a path model that employs a different mediator, high school diploma and one outcome—arrest (Model 3). We utilize a probit regression model for the binary arrest outcome. The fit indices indicate that the model has an acceptable fit: Model 3: χ<sup>2</sup>(3) = 14.0, <italic>p</italic> = .003, CFI = .95, RMSEA = .07. The figure indicates that maltreatment is negatively associated with high school diploma at a marginal level of significance (<italic>b</italic> = –.21, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .10). High school diploma is significantly and negatively associated with the binary measure of arrest during early adulthood (<italic>b</italic> = –.51, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). The resulting indirect effect (a × b) of maltreatment on arrest through high school diploma is marginally significant (<italic>b</italic> = .11, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .10). Also, the direct effect of maltreatment on arrest is marginally significant and positive (<italic>b</italic> = .20, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .10). Thus marginal direct and indirect effects are observed.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0886260512448845">5</xref></sup></p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0886260512448845">Figure 3</xref> employs a third mediator, the school protective index with two different outcomes: general crime (Model 4) and violent crime (Model 5). Model 4 provides a good model fit to the data, χ<sup>2</sup>(3) = 2.11, <italic>p</italic> = .55, CFI = 1.0, RMSEA = .00, as does Model 5, χ<sup>2</sup>(3) = 5.80, <italic>p</italic> = .12, CFI = .99, RMSEA = .03. Maltreatment negatively predicts the school protective index at a marginal level of significance (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .10), and path (a) is the same in both models (<italic>b</italic> = –.27). The index is then significantly associated with reduced general crime (Model 4, <italic>b</italic> = –.16, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) and violent crime (Model 5, <italic>b</italic> = –.08, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). The resulting indirect effect (a × b) of maltreatment on both outcomes through the index is marginally significant. On the top of the figure, the direct effect in Model 4 predicting general crime is significant (<italic>b</italic> = .38, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) as is the direct effect in Model 5 predicting violent crime (<italic>b</italic> = .18, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). The direct path between maltreatment and outcomes is still strong and there is a partial mediating effect of the school protective index on the relationship between maltreatment and adult crime and violence.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0886260512448845">6</xref></sup> However, the mediating effects are only marginally significant. There was no evidence of mediation between maltreatment and the remaining two variables, educational aspirations and college expectation.</p>

<title>Moderation</title>
<p>Another goal of this article is to investigate whether any of the measured school experiences moderate the impact of maltreatment on crime and violence. To examine whether school experiences protect against risks for maltreatment, we created nine product terms between maltreatment and each of our school variables. Each product term was entered into a series of regression or probit regression models and all four outcomes were regressed on maltreatment and controls (9 × 4 = 36 moderation models). We first tested product terms using continuous measures of all school variables, with the exception being high school diploma, which is a binary variable.</p>
<p>Interactions were only significant in one of the 36 models <sup>7</sup>—Maltreatment × School GPA in the partner violence model. In this analysis, any maltreatment, school GPA, and the interaction between maltreatment and school GPA were significant predictors of perpetration of partner violence in early adulthood. Maltreatment was positively related to partner violence (<italic>b</italic> = 1.38, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) and higher school GPA was negatively related to later partner violence (<italic>b</italic> = –.16, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). Of particular interest is the interaction between maltreatment and school GPA: maltreated children with a higher school GPA had a lower level of partner violence during early adulthood than nonmaltreated children (<italic>b</italic> = –.53, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). The model shows that males are less likely to perpetrate partner violence than females. Also, family poverty and early delinquency are significantly and positively related to perpetration of partner violence during young adulthood.</p>
<p>To more clearly illustrate the meaning of this one significant interaction effect between maltreatment and school GPA in relation to partner violence, we created two groups based on their school GPA score and conducted a multiple group comparison. The group with a school GPA of B- or more was defined as the high GPA group and those with a school GPA below a B- were defined as the low GPA group. We then regressed partner violence on maltreatment and covariates allowing estimates of path coefficients to vary between the two GPA groups. The results for the two groups are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0886260512448845">Figure 4</xref>. For the group with a low school GPA (the solid line and positive slope), maltreatment increased the probability of early adult perpetration of intimate partner violence controlling for covariates and this was statistically significant (<italic>b</italic> = .58, <italic>p</italic> = .01). For the group with a high GPA (dashed line and flat slope), maltreatment did not increase the probability of early adult perpetration of intimate partner violence controlling for covariates (<italic>b</italic> = –.05, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .10). Given the number of interaction models investigated, we note that finding one significant effect could be found by chance.</p>

<title>Summary and Discussion</title>
<p>Utilizing longitudinal data from the RYDS, we investigated whether a number of midadolescent educational performance and connectedness measures mediated or moderated the relationship between substantiated maltreatment and self-reported crime, self-reported violence, self-reported perpetration of intimate partner violence, or arrest.</p>
<p>Bivariate results indicate that all aspects of a positive educational experience examined here are associated with reduced crime and violence in early adulthood. Therefore, we add to the general body of studies that suggest that the better the school experiences overall, the more likely there is a positive outcome in early adulthood. In addition, substantiated maltreatment was associated with a poorer school experience in midadolescence on five of the nine measures. Maltreatment was negatively related to educational aspirations, college expectation, school GPA, receiving a high school diploma, and the school protective index. Yet, maltreatment was not significantly associated with attendance, school commitment, teacher attachment, or self-reported grades.</p>
<p>In a multivariate context, maltreatment is a significant predictor of adult crime and violence after controlling for covariates and educational experiences. However, educational experiences are not very powerful or consistent mediators of the relationship between maltreatment and negative behavioral outcomes in early adulthood. Of the 20 different mediation models estimated, only five suggest that measures of educational experiences marginally (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .10) mediate the relationship between maltreatment and outcomes of interest. Although this exploratory study only identifies a few effects, there is some consistency in the identification of school mechanisms which might be more important in mediating antisocial trajectories. Good grades marginally mediate the impact of maltreatment on arrest and perpetration of partner violence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0886260512448845">Figure 1</xref>); we find that earning a high school diploma partially mediates the impact of maltreatment on arrest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0886260512448845">Figure 2</xref>), and we find that our school protective index partially mediates the relationship between maltreatment and general and violence crime (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0886260512448845">Figure 3</xref>). In addition, we considered moderation rather than mediation. We built multiplicative interaction terms for each of the school measures and maltreatment. Only one significant moderator effect was found, and in view again of the number of models run, it is possible that this relationship was significant by chance, and we do not further elaborate it at this point pending further research. It is likely from our results that improved school experiences will reduce problem outcomes for all youth, not just those maltreated.</p>
<p>Our findings are to some extent consistent with prior literature that finds inconsistent mediation between maltreatment and school experiences, and negative behavioral outcomes in either adolescence or early adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0886260512448845">Topitzes et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-0886260512448845">Zingraff et al., 1994</xref>). In our analysis, school connectedness measures did not mediate the impact of maltreatment on behavioral outcomes (and no moderation was found). This null effect is similar to other studies that also found that school commitment does not prospectively impact outcomes in the presence of other risk and protective factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0886260512448845">DuMont et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0886260512448845">Herrenkohl et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0886260512448845">Topitzes, 2006</xref>). However, along with others, we find some indication that school performance matters. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0886260512448845">Topitzes (2006)</xref> found that among several school factors examined only reading achievement and high school graduation mediated the impact of maltreatment on adult crime. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-0886260512448845">Zingraff and colleagues (1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-0886260512448845">1995</xref>) found that school measured achievement variables were linked more strongly than absences, retention and other ‘process variables’ that played no mediating role.</p>
<p>Our findings are somewhat consistent with developmental theories that predict cascades of social, cognitive and behavioral development that may unfold in different ways depending on additional risk factors, intervening experiences or protective factors (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0886260512448845">Seifer, Sameroff, Baldwin, &amp; Baldwin, 1992</xref>). However, we are confronted with the finding that school measures taken from adolescents predominately in their first or second year of high school, have inconsistent and rather limited effects on mediating or moderating the relationship between maltreatment and crime and violence in early adulthood.</p>
<p>Developmental theories, for example, do highlight the notion that self-control impairments—including behavior control, social maladjustment and cognitive deficits—may cascade out from exposure to risk, and, especially in combination with high risk environments, reduce the overall possibility of resilient (positive) outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0886260512448845">Haskett et al., 2006</xref>). Therefore, our rather limited findings that school performance and connectedness measures are not very powerful protective factors may be in part attributed to the possibility that for many children maltreated earlier in the life course, normative development may already be heavily compromised by the time they enter high school. Thus, any protective impact of high school connectedness or performance must influence already established nonnormative behavior—quite a high hurdle to overcome. For many of the study participants in the RYDS, their school and behavioral trajectories may already be firmly established, making it challenging to deflect adolescents from negative behavioral trajectories. We note that earlier antisocial behavior was a consistent and significant predictor of all outcomes in our analyses.</p>
<p>Almost none of the educational experiences investigated had a moderating effect on the impact of maltreatment on crime and violence. Moderation has not been found in any prior studies of which we are aware. Finding moderating effects in general is a challenge in resilience research given its nonexperimental nature and difficulty in interpreting effects (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0886260512448845">McClelland &amp; Judd, 1993</xref>). Power to determine moderating effects may also be lacking. Perpetration of partner violence is often not considered as a violence outcome in criminological studies, and is rarely studied with longitudinal data. Several literatures are relevant: research on sequelae of maltreatment suggests that youth exposed to family violence have difficulties forming and maintaining good interpersonal relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0886260512448845">Collishaw et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0886260512448845">Colman &amp; Widom, 2004</xref>). The research on assortative partnering indicates that disengaged and antisocial youth are likely to partner with similar peers and romantic partners, thus increasing chances for concordance in problem behaviors, and reducing chances for resilient outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0886260512448845">Capaldi &amp; Crosby, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0886260512448845">Knight, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0886260512448845">Krueger, Caspi, Moffitt, &amp; Silva, 1998</xref>). Thus, for maltreated youth who are doing particularly well in school, this may enable them to maintain a positive peer and mentoring network that keeps them on course for nonviolent partnerships in early adulthood. We do not want to overinterpret the single significant moderation finding in this study that positive grades are linked with reduced partner violence for maltreated youth in particular. However, this bears further investigation.</p>
<p>We note that measurement of partner violence through the CTS, as in this study, is controversial, although quite standard. Particularly controversial is that community studies using this instrument often show, as does our study, that women report more violence, even serious violence, than men (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0886260512448845">Morse, 1995</xref>). This has led to an examination of the appropriate definition of intimate partner violence, and limitations of the measure, for example in highlighting the context of fear and control that is hard to capture in a count of behaviors. However, modern approaches to measurement using the revised scales show that examination of more nuanced patterns of intimate partner violence are possible, and that women can be conceptualized as engaging in levels of partner aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0886260512448845">Ansara &amp; Hindin, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The implications of this cascade of difficulties among maltreated youth are certainly for increasing effective youth protection. Programs that have been developed to focus on high risk parents and young children show effectiveness in prevention of maltreatment, and a number of later child risk behaviors (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0886260512448845">Olds, Henderson, Chamberlin, &amp; Tatelbaum, 1986</xref>). There are a number of evidence-based programs in use that are associated with children’s improved performance and skills in school as well as with violence reduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0886260512448845">Taub &amp; Pearrow, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-0886260512448845">Winslow, Sandler, &amp; Wolchik, 2005</xref>). There is also some evidence that maltreated children can recover in school, potentially through ameliorative services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0886260512448845">Leiter &amp; Johnsen, 1997</xref>), but such intensive services and the collaboration required to implement them are not readily available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0886260512448845">Jonson-Reid et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0886260512448845">Larson, 2006</xref>). In general, implications are for attention to high risk students with behavior problems as well as educational difficulties, given that early antisocial behavior is consistently the most powerful predictor of later problems.</p>
<p>Strengths of this study include probability based sampling, a prospective design, temporal order between variables of interest and outcomes, and a wide range of measured constructs from multiple data sources.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0886260512448845">8</xref></sup> However, a number of issues potentially limit the findings in this study. Notable in our study there is a large and variable time interval between maltreatment and school experiences. Many studies exploring the effects of maltreatment on educational outcomes follow adolescents over a short time span (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-0886260512448845">Zingraff &amp; Leiter, 1995</xref>) or use retrospective data on maltreatment that may involve misperception of time intervals (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0886260512448845">Boden, Horwood, &amp; Fergusson, 2007</xref>). Although maltreatment may be solidly associated with school experiences during elementary school, during the fluid experiences of adolescence when many transitions and new contexts are present, its impact on school connectedness and performance may wane.</p>
<p>Also, for this sample, not only are general risk indicators high, but there is considerable homogeneity in participants’ school experiences. All participants were selected from an urban public school system (there are three public high schools in Rochester), a considerable proportion of the children have lived in poverty, and the majority are either African American or Hispanic. The graduation rate (with high school diploma) is quite low at 59%, and the mean school GPA is around a C-. Although their school commitment and educational aspirations are relatively high, this does not match their general achievement. Thus, our focus on the impact of maltreatment on school experiences for this sample overlooks the structural and institutional barriers that youth in this sample more than likely face in making progress in the educational mainstream.</p>
<p>Like all measures, official maltreatment records have limitations as measures of maltreatment and are subject to biases: Not all instances of maltreatment are reported and not all reported cases are substantiated. However, these cases have passed a strict screen based on state law, and are unlikely to be false positives. The pattern of results based on official maltreatment data, in our study and other studies that use them (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0886260512448845">Widom, 1989</xref>), argues strongly for their construct validity. In addition, the design of the study precludes consideration of the immediate impact of maltreatment on school experiences, as most maltreated participants had already experienced maltreatment by the time they were in the study. Also, the report date of maltreatment may not accurately capture the timing or experiences of maltreatment. Comprehensive, detailed and contemporaneous assessments of child maltreatment, especially in relation to proximal school experiences, would clarify the findings and development of such measurement approaches is advancing (e.g., the Juvenile Victimization Questionnaire; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0886260512448845">Finkelhor, Hamby, Ormrod, &amp; Turner, 2005</xref>). Although we have found as have other researchers that dimensions of maltreatment are similarly linked to delinquency and crime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0886260512448845">Smith &amp; Thornberry, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0886260512448845">Thornberry, Smith, Rivera, Huizinga, &amp; Stouthamer-Loeber, 1999</xref>), possibly they might have differential impacts on educational experiences and this possibility awaits future research.</p>
<p>We did not investigate the role of gender, which has been linked in some studies with differential processes linking maltreatment and outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0886260512448845">DuMont et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0886260512448845">Topitzes et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-0886260512448845">Zingraff et al., 1994</xref>). While research consistently upholds the equivalent impact of major risk factors on males and females, the way that development unfolds may differ by gender (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0886260512448845">Moffitt, Caspi, Rutter, &amp; Silva, 2001</xref>). This study focuses on one domain of potential protection for maltreated youth and other protective factor domains may be more salient for females. Relatedly, it must be noted that there are a number of omitted variables that researchers might suggest would operate on the links between the constructs in our study, including substance use problems and mental health problems (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0886260512448845">Widom, Schuck, &amp; White, 2006</xref>). Finally, we note that the nature of our sample may limit the generalizability of our findings to other community samples. This study, nevertheless, moves toward filling gaps in the literature as it specifically considers whether aspects of the educational experience are possible protective factors, mitigating the long term consequences of substantiated maltreatment in terms of crime and violence in early adulthood.</p>

<p>Several past studies have found that any adolescent maltreatment is a stronger predictor of later crime than maltreatment that starts and ends in childhood (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0886260512448845">Ireland et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0886260512448845">Smith et al., 2005</xref>); however, there has been little exploration of maltreatment timing in relation to schooling so we use the expanded measure here.</p>

<label>2.</label>
<p>Maltreatment significantly predicts each of early adult crime and violence outcomes. This is consistent with prior RYDS publications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0886260512448845">Smith et al., 2005</xref>).

<p>We utilized a probit regression model for the binary arrest outcome and therefore coefficients for Model 1 and Model 2 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0886260512448845">Figure 1</xref> are not comparable.</p>

<p>All the covariates were significantly related to school GPA in the models presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0886260512448845">Figure 1</xref>. Males showed lower GPA score than females, and African American and Hispanic youth had lower GPA scores than white youth, for example. Also, youth who were involved in early antisocial behavior had, on average a lower GPA. Family poverty was negatively related to school GPA. Also while males were more likely to be arrested females were more likely to report perpetration of partner violence in early adulthood. Finally, early delinquency was significantly positively related to both partner violence and arrest.</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn5-0886260512448845">
<label>5.</label>
<p>We controlled for gender, race/ethnicity, family poverty and early delinquency for Model 3. While gender and race/ethnicity were not associated with earning a high school diploma, family poverty and early delinquency were significantly and negatively associated to earning a high school diploma. In addition, early delinquency was significantly and positively related to arrest and males were more likely to be arrested in young adulthood compared to females.</p>
</fn>
<fn fn-type="other" id="fn6-0886260512448845">
<label>6.</label>
<p>For Model 4 and Model 5, we controlled for gender, race/ethnicity, family poverty and early delinquency. Findings were consistent with those reported in Model 1 and Model 2, except for race/ethnicity. African Americans showed higher counts on the school protective index compared to whites. However, Hispanics were not significantly different from Whites. In addition, males were more likely to be involved in general crime than females and youth who were involved in early antisocial behavior were more likely to be involved in general and violent crime in early adulthood than those who did not.</p>

<p>We note that for 13 students, the first incident of maltreatment could be very close to or even subsequent to the school experience measures. However, for the majority of substantiated maltreatment, the first occurrence of substantiated maltreatment occurs prior to the measurement of the school performance and connectedness measures.</p>
