<body>
<p>This article is concerned with the uses to which Shakespeare put legal subject matter and with the related question of what it means for a piece of writing by Shakespeare to be characterized as “legal.” I focus on three sonnets – 35, 49, and 88 – which have in common a peculiar legal conceit. In all three, the speaker acknowledges himself as the victim of a crime committed by the young man, but pledges to testify against himself on the young man’s behalf. This role reversal connects to no known legal principle or procedure in Shakespeare’s time. To read sonnets 35, 49, and 88 as <italic>legal</italic>, then, requires that we depart from the critical orthodoxies of Shakespeare studies and embrace a wider range of philosophical and theological understandings of law and justice than are afforded by early modern legal history. Specifically, I shall argue that the justice presented in sonnets 35, 49, and 88 belongs to the philosophical tradition of hospitality, as exemplified in a range of writings from Leviticus to St. Paul’s Epistle to the Romans, and including work by Jacques Derrida and, especially, Emmanuel Lévinas. Returning Shakespeare’s sonnets to this strand of intellectual history is useful not only as part of the ongoing project of mapping out the contours of a philosophical Shakespeare, but also, as we shall see, because it equips us with a language and a set of concepts ideally suited to making sense of the curious way in which Shakespeare uses law in these sonnets to reflect upon the nature of selfhood. What we discover, finally, is that law was not simply something Shakespeare thought <italic>about</italic>, it was also something he thought <italic>with</italic>.</p>
<sec id="section1-1743872111407450">
<title>I. Particularity and Universality</title>
<p>A philosophical approach to legal subject matter of the sort I am taking here inevitably jars with the dominant concerns of the field of literature and law as it has come to manifest itself within Shakespeare studies. Rebecca Lemon, Subha Mukherji, Lorna Hutson, and Bradin Cormack, to take four recent examples, have extracted a mine of information from Tudor and Stuart literature about how early modern men and women experienced the law, the juridical habits of thought they employed, and the various cultural ligatures that existed between the theater and the courtroom.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1743872111407450">1</xref></sup> For each of these critics, “law” is something understood primarily in the particular. It is approached largely at the local level of its various historical, political, and institutional instantiations – as particular laws, particular crimes, and particular procedures which are refracted through or encoded in the literature in particular ways.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1743872111407450">2</xref></sup> Law takes on characteristics similar to social or political history: it is constituted by a tightly wrought constellation of specific things people did and believed, and the specific artifacts (especially, though not exclusively, texts) which they produced. This way of thinking about law – law as history, or law as culture – is with us for good reasons. Ever since its emergence in the 1970s, the field of literature and law has been characterized by a predilection for the political real.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1743872111407450">3</xref></sup> If in the early days of the sub-discipline literary studies offered law a “hermeneutics of suspicion”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1743872111407450">4</xref></sup> through which legal thinkers could acquire critical insight into juridical issues and perhaps even a reprieve from the sense of bureaucratic complicity that always threatened to make their domain more of a profession than an area of humanistic inquiry, then law offered literary studies the opportunity to be topical, politically engaged, and finally to achieve that real, immediate sense of significance that always seemed to elude it.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1743872111407450">5</xref></sup> More practically, law-in-the-particular brings focus and clarity to a large, unwieldy, and abstract topic. It would certainly seem a necessary prerequisite to making any sort of solid historical argument, something all four of the critics I mention do admirably. Finally, engagement with the historical particulars of law can itself open up compelling philosophical questions, as demonstrated, for example, by Luke Wilson’s work on the legal history of the sudden and Lorna Hutson’s work on the history of evidence, both of which are rooted in primary historical documents while also broaching issues of temporality and epistemology, respectively.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1743872111407450">6</xref></sup> Law-in-the-particular, then, makes good sense. But it is of limited use, nevertheless, for thinking about sonnets like 35, 49, and 88 which so pointedly depart from the historical particulars of law as we understand them. In reading these sonnets from the perspective of hospitality, I am choosing to relinquish law-in-the-particular in favor of a fuller embrace of the universal dimension of law, that aspect which privileges ideas and concepts over texts and practices. Jacques Derrida calls this law’s “mystical foundation,” a zone of meaning where professional and institutional discourse “meets its limit.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1743872111407450">7</xref></sup> Beyond that limit – in the realm of the non-particular, the mystical, the universal – one grapples with questions which are transhistorical and essential: for whom am I responsible? What is properly mine? What is fundamentally just and what is fundamentally not? Sonnets 35, 49, and 88 respond to all of these questions, and in doing so they end up telling us something important about what it means to be human.</p>

<sec id="section2-1743872111407450">
<title>II. Three Legal Sonnets</title>
<p>Two key moves will be made in this article. First, I want to situate sonnets 35, 49, and 88 in the context of hospitality. Then, I want to show how this context helps us connect the ideas of law and selfhood in a way that is markedly different from the mainstream of Western metaphysics and legal philosophy. To begin, though, we should establish a clear sense of how exactly sonnets 35, 49, and 88 invoke law and how they configure legal relationships. I quote sonnet 35 in full:<disp-quote>
<p>No more be grieved at that which thou hast done:</p>
<p>Roses have thorns, and silver fountains mud.</p>
<p>Clouds and eclipses stain both moon and sun</p>
<p>And loathsome canker lives in sweetest bud.</p>
<p>All men make faults, and even I in this,</p>
<p>Authorizing thy trespass with compare,</p>
<p>Myself corrupting salving thy amiss,</p>
<p>Excusing thy sins more than thy sins are;</p>
<p>For to thy sensual fault I bring in sense–</p>
<p>Thy adverse party is thy advocate–</p>
<p>And ‘gainst myself a lawful plea commence.</p>
<p>Such civil war is in my love and hate</p>
<p> That I an accessory needs must be</p>
<p> To that sweet thief which sourly robs from me. (1–14)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1743872111407450">8</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In the opening line – “no more be grieved at that which thou has done” – two things happen: the speaker announces the young man’s crime and he offers a pardon for it. This explodes into a veritable galaxy of forgiveness with the speaker “authorizing thy trespass,” “salving thy amiss,” and “excusing thy sins.” The status of the unnamed wrong as a “sensual fault,” along with the reference to the self-corrupting nature of minimizing the transgression in line 7, tells us that the speaker is pardoning an offense of which he has been the victim. This skewed relationship between speaker and friend is placed within an overtly legal context in the last six lines of the poem when the speaker declares, “Thy adverse party is thy advocate” and will “a lawful plea commence” against himself. As plainly juridical as the relationship between the speaker and the friend is, it is also juridically preposterous. And so we are confronted with a distinct tension at the end of the sonnet between recognition and defamiliarization, neither of which seem quite capable of subsuming the other.</p>
<p>Sonnet 49 distinguishes itself from sonnet 35 by focusing on a future offense rather than a past one. The poem fashions itself as written,<disp-quote>
<p>Against that time when thou shalt strangely pass</p>
<p>And scarcely greet me with that sun, thine eye,</p>
<p>When love converted from the thing it was</p>
<p>Shall reasons find of settled gravity; (5–8)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The poem concludes, however, in a vein very similar to sonnet 35, with speaker and friend entering into an asymmetrical juridical relationship founded upon the speaker’s unconditional abandonment of self–interest:<disp-quote>
<p>And this my hand against myself uprear</p>
<p> To guard the lawful reasons on thy part.</p>
<p>  To leave poor me thou hast the strength of laws,</p>
<p>  Since why to love I can allege no cause. (11–14)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Like sonnet 49, sonnet 88 anticipates bad news in the future, a time “When thou shalt be disposed to set me light / And place my merit in the eye of scorn” (1–2). Undeserved as this may be, the speaker vows that when the moment arrives, “Upon thy side against myself I’ll fight, / And prove thee virtuous though thou art forsworn” (3–4). In the second quatrain this role reversal is articulated in terms of evidence, testimony, and incrimination as the speaker assures the young man of his ability to win his case for him:<disp-quote>
<p>With mine own weakness being best acquainted,</p>
<p>Upon thy part I can set down a story</p>
<p>Of faults concealed wherein I am attainted,</p>
<p>That thou in losing me shall win much glory; (5–8)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>What can be said for sure is that all three of these sonnets are “legal” in a lexical sense. They set up broadly juridical relationships through the use of legal terminology: “party,” “advocate,” “lawful,” “laws,” “plea,” “commence,” “audit,” “accessory,” “cause,” “allege,” “attainted.” But substantively, sonnets 35, 49, and 88 resist being situated within a legal context since, from the perspective of practiced law, the main thrust of the conceit – a man testifying against himself on the part of his accuser – is nonsense.</p>
<p>Consequently, the critic confronting these sonnets is presented with two options. One is to remark the sonnets’ legal language as part of an argument about a non-legal matter. When Michael Spiller, for instance, points to the use of legal terminology in sonnet 35 it is to demonstrate how “for the first time in the history of the sonnet, the desired object is flawed.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1743872111407450">9</xref></sup> Paul Innes, on the other hand, posits that what is important about the legal vocabulary in sonnets 35 and 49 is the way it underlines a drastic difference in social rank between the speaker and the young man.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1743872111407450">10</xref></sup> Alternatively, one might choose to focus on a rhetorical characteristic of the sonnets which accommodates the legal motifs but is not legal <italic>per se</italic>. Stephen Booth takes this approach when he identifies sonnet 35 as “a variation of Shakespeare’s habits of damning with fulsome praise . . . and making flattering accusations,” as does Dympna Callaghan when she cites sonnet 35 as an example of <italic>paradiastole</italic>, a figure of speech which transforms negative characteristics into positive ones.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1743872111407450">11</xref></sup> I have no qualms with any of these readings. They are all persuasive. But a third way remains open: we can evaluate the legal trappings of sonnets 35, 49, and 88 on their own terms as exemplifying a coherent vision of justice, even if that justice is not one that was instantiated institutionally and procedurally in early modern England. Doing this requires contextualization but not of the sort afforded by social and political history. The complete relinquishing of self-interest, the absolute accommodation of an other, the unconditional commitment to overlooking offences: if this is justice it would not have been recognized as such by the likes of Christopher Hales, Thomas Fleming, and Edward Coke. The question we are presented with, then, is if Shakespeare’s justice is not the justice of the early modern courtroom, what kind of justice is it? Might we link it with the <italic>lex amatoria</italic>, or laws of love, described so eloquently by Peter Goodrich?<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1743872111407450">12</xref></sup> It does, after all, seem to represent a triumph of the affective over the rational. The troubadour and courtly love poetry that comprise key sources for the <italic>lex amatoria</italic> resemble the sonnets in two important ways: both grant love legal standing, a certain jurisdictional authority, and both assume love to involve a set of binding obligations among the parties involved in a relationship. But none of the traditions Goodrich is concerned with include the motif of arguing against oneself which is so crucial to sonnets 35, 49, and 88. This extreme act of self-effacement exceeds the <italic>lex amatoria</italic> and even exceeds love itself. That is to say, while it issues from within the generic and rhetorical confines of love poetry, the speaker’s lack of self-interest is not strictly a performance of personal, particularized adoration, but rather, as I will argue in more detail below, a literary iteration of a more general ethics of otherness. This pulls the sonnets out of the world of the <italic>lex amatoria</italic>, where love constitutes its own body of law, and asks us, equally, to resist reading the sonnets as poems which ironically juxtapose law and love in order to show the impossibility of the former in the realm of the latter.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1743872111407450">13</xref></sup> Shakespeare’s strange justice may be born of both personal love and positive law, but it cannot finally be reduced to either.</p>

<title>III. Hospitality and Law</title>
<p>As perplexing as the selfless law of sonnets 35, 49, and 88 would have been to early modern jurists, it probably would have made perfect sense to Lot and St. Paul, and it certainly would have made sense to Emmanuel Lévinas. The genealogy that unfolds when we connect these dots is that of the idea of hospitality. Tracy McNulty describes hospitality as “coextensive with the development of Western civilization, occupying an essential place in virtually every religion and defining the most elementary of social relations: reciprocity, exogamy, potlatch, ‘brotherly love,’ nationhood.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-1743872111407450">14</xref></sup> McNulty’s definition is useful because it speaks to both the cultural ranginess and conceptual unwieldiness of hospitality. It also captures hospitality’s doubleness as at once a theo-philosophical concept and a social practice. In the world of theology and philosophy, hospitality embodies a singular, absolute law, an ethical imperative to welcome and serve the Other regardless of one’s own needs or desires. The Biblical injunction to “love your neighbor as yourself” is in part a command to be hospitable. More arresting Biblical parables of hospitality can be found in the story of Lot and his daughters and the Levite of Mount Ephraim.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-1743872111407450">15</xref></sup> Both of these stories feature hosts offering their virgin daughters to a violent, sexually ravenous mob in order to protect the strangers who are guests in their home. For Lot as for the old man who welcomes the Levite, hospitality is a law without condition, adherence to which is closely bound up with godliness. Clerical literature and conduct manuals in early modern England frequently reminded readers of the angels Abraham hosted unaware, admonishing readers never to “forsake strangers . . . for the Lord loveth them and goeth with them.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-1743872111407450">16</xref></sup> Abraham’s act of hospitality pays off when he gets advance warning about the fate of Sodom and Gomorrah. But pay-off is not typically the measure of a successful hospitality relationship. The essence of hospitality is that it begins in earnest at the point where your interests end, a founding paradox which Tina Chanter has argued takes its darkest form in the “forced hospitality” experienced by women and Palestinians.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-1743872111407450">17</xref></sup> Thus to be hospitable – to embrace the law of hospitality – is also, in a sense, to be injured. As St. Paul instructs, “[Be] given to hospitality. Bless them which persecute you,”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-1743872111407450">18</xref></sup> or, in the words of Jacques Derrida – the thinker who more than anyone else has been able to see the long, complex tradition of hospitality whole – it is “the one who invites, the inviting host, who becomes the hostage.” The Latin word <italic>hostis</italic>, he reminds us, could mean either “guest” or “enemy.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-1743872111407450">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>Hospitality has a social history, too, of course, though one which in our own time segues paradoxically into the commercially driven world of the so-called hospitality industry. In early modern England hospitality was a moral principle, an integral part of the social and political fabric. The virtues of domestic benefice were repeatedly proclaimed from the pulpits with heads of independent households, in particular, being expected to “keep hospitality” for travelers and elite visitors.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-1743872111407450">20</xref></sup> As this tradition begins to erode with the movement of landed aristocracy into the city, we find King James issuing royal proclamations ordering all noblemen out of London and back to their country seats so as to maintain the time-honored practice of rural hospitality.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-1743872111407450">21</xref></sup> In all cases, whether lauded by king or cleric, hospitality was framed rhetorically in terms of the famous Biblical exemplars, as free, selfless, absolute. But in reality it was very much implicated in a system of reciprocity which, though non-monetary, was energized by the equally valuable assets of honor and alliance. The practice of hospitality, in Shakespeare’s time as in our own, is dictated by laws of exchange, rank, and custom and ultimately conditional upon all parties’ adherence to those particular laws. Hospitality within the theo-philosophical tradition, on the other hand, is absolute and non-contingent. Derrida opposes the Law of “absolute hospitality” (singular, universal) to the laws of practiced hospitality (plural, particular), concluding that hospitality in general is best understood as a “legal antimony.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-1743872111407450">22</xref></sup> Sonnets 35, 49, and 88 epitomize one side of this antimony. In presenting justice as something that accrues from the fulfillment of a primary, unconditional commandment to accommodate the not-you, they stand as literary iterations of the theo-philosophical tradition of absolute hospitality: “<italic>The</italic> Law, in its universal singularity.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-1743872111407450">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>This commandment, this absolute and unassailable duty, is what the French philosopher Emmanuel Lévinas termed, “responsibility.” In Lévinas’s account, responsibility for the Other is the founding relationship; prior to contract, prior even to Being. It is pre-juridical and pre-ontological, the bedrock on which all other forms of obligation stand. Lévinas’s ethics of responsibility, which have in recent years skirted seductively around the outskirts of the philosophy of law,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-1743872111407450">24</xref></sup> offer a particularly compelling vocabulary for addressing Shakespeare’s hospitable justice and, in particular, for mapping out intersections between questions of law and questions of selfhood. In the broadest sense, Lévinas’s philosophy can be understood as an attempt to formulate a non-ontological account of Being. That is to say, an account of Being which is open and social rather than bounded and inward looking. His two most influential books, <italic>Totality and Infinity</italic> (1961) and <italic>Otherwise Than Being</italic> (1974), present a radical ethics of selfhood founded on the idea that subjectivity is relational, a property not of hermetic cognitive experience but of the self’s encounter with, extension towards, and welcoming of an absolute Other.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-1743872111407450">25</xref></sup> Selfhood, to put it another way, is not a form of enclosed dwelling or sealed off at-homeness, as Heidegger envisioned it, but a state of homelessness, a form of hospitality so complete that it calls into question what, if anything, is properly mine.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-1743872111407450">26</xref></sup> Lévinas makes this argument in opposition not only to Heidegger, but to Western philosophy from Plato to Kant, more generally. While the mainstream of metaphysics explores Being from the perspective of the singular, self-identical ego – “I think therefore I am”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-1743872111407450">27</xref></sup> – Lévinas, by contrast, proposes a mode of inquiry which prioritizes hospitality and neighborliness. “Philosophy,” he famously averred, “is an egology,” and as such, he was convinced, a dangerous intellectual manifestation of precisely the sort of systematized egotism that led to the horrors of the Second World War.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-1743872111407450">28</xref></sup> Lévinas, by investing himself in exteriority rather than interiority, in ethics rather than ontology, expresses a radical hope that we might dislodge the deeply ingrained habit of thought that prioritizes the one over the many, the same over the different, the self over the other, and which ultimately leads to violence. The kernel of Lévinas’s ethics, his core challenge to “the egoist spontaneity of the same,”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-1743872111407450">29</xref></sup> is his assertion of an elemental responsibility we bear to the Other, understood simultaneously in personal and non-personal terms as that which is different from and outside of ourselves. This, for Lévinas, is the most basic and pure relationship, an original and non-negotiable duty towards the not-you.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-1743872111407450">30</xref></sup> In the political realm, Lévinas’s ethics have proved problematic. As Simon Critchley points out, in Lévinas’s world “the ethical subject is . . . a <italic>split subject</italic> divided between itself and a demand that it cannot entirely fulfill,” and thus pragmatic political action is “always usurped by the heteronomous experience of the other’s demand.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-1743872111407450">31</xref></sup> For legal philosophy, though, Lévinas’s vision of absolute and infinite obligation remains alluring. It is the fulfillment of this primary responsibility that Lévinas calls <italic>justice</italic>. The term, for him, describes a moral event rather than an institutionally enforced principle. If the latter kind of justice constitutes the <italic>body</italic> of law, then the former type of justice – Lévinasian justice – might be thought of as the <italic>soul</italic> of law.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-1743872111407450">32</xref></sup></p>
<p>There are two primary fronts on which Lévinas’s philosophy intersects with Shakespeare’s sonnets. First, as I have just pointed out, Lévinas conceived of hospitality as a form of justice. Derrida called Lévinas’s justice “a sort of essential quasi-ahistorical law” and, similar to his own distinction between the Law and the laws, distinguished Lévinasian justice from culturally and institutionally embedded forms of regulation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-1743872111407450">33</xref></sup> Lévinasian justice, therefore, shares with sonnets 35, 49, and 88 a reliance upon a sense of law which is universal rather than particular. Second, Lévinas’s ethics – unlike, say, Aristotle’s or Kant’s – is more about who you are than what you do or who you should be. Lévinas saw the hospitality relationship as issuing a challenge to the ontological bias of metaphysics and, consequently, as offering an opportunity to reformulate selfhood as a state of openness rather than enclosure. The speaker of sonnets 35, 49, and 88, likewise, coheres as a literary subject, paradoxically, through an act of self-abandonment. Sean Hand’s description of Lévinasian subjectivity as “absolutely persecuted … a subjectivity that is hostage to the other” could as easily be applied to the speaking subject of Shakespeare’s sonnets.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-1743872111407450">34</xref></sup> This is not to say that Shakespeare is a philosopher or even that he in any straightforward way predicts Lévinasian ethics. It is to underscore how Shakespeare shares with philosophy an understanding of law which is not historically or institutionally derived, and how he shares with Lévinas, in particular, an awareness that conceptualizing justice always brings with it a set of assumptions about what it means to be human. Ultimately, Shakespeare and Lévinas speak different languages: Lévinas poses his questions with the systematic rigor of philosophy while Shakespeare poses his through the more intuitive and speculative forms of thought germane to art; Lévinas imagines an absolute duty to a generalized other while Shakespeare, working within the literary conventions of love poetry, begins by imagining a particular duty to a particular other. But Lévinas and Shakespeare have similar things to tell us, all the same. Both redefine justice as hospitality and in doing so drag justice out of the realm of the juridical and into the realm of the existential. For Shakespeare as for Lévinas, hospitable justice entails not only a reevaluation of law, but also a reevaluation of selfhood. It is to this reevaluation of selfhood as Shakespeare undertakes it that I want to turn now.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1743872111407450">
<title>IV. Law and Selfhood</title>
<p>If Lévinas’s critique of egocentrism is direct and polemical, Shakespeare’s is oblique and suggestive. Sonnets 35, 49, and 88 are not about selfhood <italic>per se</italic>. They are about the distorted way in which power and accountability are distributed between two people. The scene these people inhabit, however – the scene of hospitable justice – is constitutive of selfhood since it creates an environment in which literary subjectivity must obtain in a specific way. The scene of hospitable justice is what Lévinas would have called an “inter-subjective world,” one in which “denucleated” selves exist relationally in something we might think of as an ecology of Being.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-1743872111407450">35</xref></sup> From the self-identical “I am that I am” of sonnet 121, sonnets 35, 49, and 88 bring us into the relational world of I-am-that-I-am-not. In sonnet 35, the “I” manifests itself at the very moment of self-abandonment: “All men make faults, and even I in this, / Authorizing thy trespass with compare” (5–6). The “authorizing” act is at once charitable and demeaning, an invitation to persecute which fashions the speaking “I” as both host and hostage. This subject, the only kind of subject that can inhabit the scene of hospitable justice, is foreign to itself and to its own interests. It is important, though, that we recognize it as a fully constituted subject, nonetheless. The substitution of roles whereby “Thy adverse party” becomes “thy advocate” (10) is only “an erosion of subjectivity,” as Heather Dubrow puts it, if subjectivity is conceived of in ontological terms as self-identical and integral.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-1743872111407450">36</xref></sup> This is not the case in sonnet 35. This poem imagines subjectivity as a hospitable encounter and thus as an inherently lop-sided mode of relationality. Desmond Manderson describes the Other in the hospitality relationship as “a neighbor who cannot properly be classed as friend or enemy.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-1743872111407450">37</xref></sup> The young man in sonnet 35 is precisely this friend-enemy, just as the speaker is the consummate host-hostage. Sonnet 35 is not a poem where subjectivity erodes, nor is it quite right to identify its language as “the rhetoric of self-hate.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-1743872111407450">38</xref></sup> Rather, it is a poem that produces a form of selfhood marked above all by the way it renders traditional distinctions between love and hate, host and hostage, friend and enemy meaningless.</p>
<p>Within the ambit of hospitable justice, then, selfhood is built from the outside in, not from the inside out. It is phenomenological rather than metaphysical. Hannah Arendt describes how the Romans used the terms for <italic>being alive</italic> and <italic>being amongst men</italic> interchangeably, recalling for us a way of thinking about sentience as collective experience.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-1743872111407450">39</xref></sup> Sonnets 35, 49, and 88 belong very much to this same thought-world. For in them, selfhood is constituted by and as a social scene. This, the sociality of Being, has been obviated by criticism devoted to these sonnets, the majority of which has focused on issues of interiority: the speaker’s “self-division” and “heterogeneous internality,”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-1743872111407450">40</xref></sup> his “masochism” and “depersonalization,”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-1743872111407450">41</xref></sup> his “intestine … civil war,”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-1743872111407450">42</xref></sup> or the “sudden uncoiling of the self.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-1743872111407450">43</xref></sup> Hospitable justice, by contrast, asks that we privilege <italic>exteriority</italic> as the field of self-actualization. While self-denial is intrinsic to hospitality, and psychoanalysis has for over a century offered sophisticated ways to account for different forms of self-denial,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-1743872111407450">44</xref></sup> we are at no point in sonnets 35, 49, and 88 presented with something we would now call mental experience. When in sonnet 49, for example, the speaker vows to “uprear” “this my hand against myself” (11), we learn less about a state of mind than about a configuration of bodies in space. The upreared hand is at once a synecdoche for the ritual act of oath-taking in the courtroom and for the infliction of violence.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-1743872111407450">45</xref></sup> Both referents cast the promise as a physical reply to external acts: namely, the friend “frown[ing] on,” “strangely pass[ing],” and “scarcely greet[ing]” the speaker. The basic unit of meaning in sonnet 49 is the social interaction, not the individual thought. The speaking subject is assembled through a process of address and response, and so the self is not so much divided as it is distributed. Selfhood has more to do with relationality – the space, physical and ethical, between persons – than it does with individuality. This is underscored in all three sonnets by the legal conceit. The “lawful reasons” (12) and “strength of laws” (13) which have the final say in shaping the relationship between the speaker and the friend are criteria whose very existence is intimately bound up with the conditions of collectivity. And in sonnet 88, the speaker’s offer to testify against himself on the young man’s behalf, to “set down a story / Of faults concealed, wherein I am attainted” (6–7), is less a movement inwards than a holding forth, a public act of divulging. Self-denial is front-and-center in these sonnets. It is urgent and powerful and demands a readerly response. As Helen Vendler observes of sonnet 35, “<italic>myself corrupting salving thy amiss</italic> is the line of the poem that reaches deepest, poetically as well as morally, and we must ask ourselves why.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-1743872111407450">46</xref></sup> But to describe the self-denial we find in these sonnets in psychological terms, to approach it from the perspective of interiority, runs counter the poems’ staunch refusal to invite us in, what I would characterize as their unswerving exteriority. Sonnets 35, 49, and 88 are not in the business of making windows into men’s souls. Instead, our attention is everywhere directed outwards towards the scene of hospitable justice.</p>
<p>When Shakespeare thinks about the self through law, and vice versa, he crosses into intellectual territory that would be visited by a range of legal philosophers in England and Germany who made understanding the essentials of selfhood foundational to legal theory. The final point I want to make in this article is that Shakespeare’s hospitable justice makes one of its strongest claims to our attention by departing from the model of selfhood dominant within the Western legal-philosophical tradition, a model of selfhood very similar to the egocentric one which Lévinas associated with transcendental philosophy and Cartesian metaphysics. Manderson observes that criminal law, contract law, property law, and even constitutional law all start “with the assumed primacy of <italic>I</italic>,” the <italic>I</italic> which is independent and autonomous, born with a set of natural, unassailable rights to life, liberty, and property.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-1743872111407450">47</xref></sup> Whereas the hospitable justice of Shakespeare and Lévinas is founded upon self-abandonment and disenfranchisement, the <italic>me</italic> and the <italic>mine</italic> are at the very core of the liberal tradition of legal-philosophy and political theory. We can trace this back at least as far as the natural law theories of Thomas Hobbes and John Locke, both of whom assumed that we can best ascertain the value of specific legal principles if we first understand clearly the nature of the self. Hobbes and Locke believed that humans were born into a natural state of independence and self-governance and that the first and most basic duty of any legal system should be to protect this primary freedom.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-1743872111407450">48</xref></sup> Hobbes, in <italic>Leviathan</italic> (1651), referred to this as the “Right of Nature,” defining it as:<disp-quote>
<p>The Liberty each man hath, to use his power, as he will himselfe, for the preservation of his own Nature; that is to say, of his own Life, and consequently of doing any thing, which in his own Judgement, and Reason, hee shall conceive to be the aptest means thereunto.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-1743872111407450">49</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>What makes a human a human is an essential right to self-preservation and a unique mental capacity – “Judgment,” “Reason” – to know how to exercise that right. This includes self-defense when absolutely necessary, but also, more mundanely, the possession of various objects and consumables necessary for the perpetuation of life and well-being. Contract, for Hobbes, is merely the agreed-upon shifting of that right from one individual to another: “The mutual transferring of Right,” he explains, “is that which men call Contract.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50-1743872111407450">50</xref></sup> Locke’s account of selfhood is laid out in his <italic>Second Treatise</italic> (1690) where he describes “what state all men are naturally in.” He concludes that they occupy “a state of perfect freedom to order their actions, and dispose of their possessions and persons, as they think fit . . . without asking leave, or depending upon the will of any other man.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn51-1743872111407450">51</xref></sup> For Locke, then, the right to property is integral to what it means to be human: humans are individuals and, as such, own themselves and the products of their labor. Selfhood and self-possession go hand-in-hand.</p>
<p>Individualism is at the center of modern German legal-philosophy, too, especially that of Kant and Hegel. In the “Doctrine of Right” (1797), Kant defines the “juridical state” as “that relationship among human beings which contains the conditions solely under which each can enjoy his rights.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn52-1743872111407450">52</xref></sup> Kant is ostensibly concerned with collectivity here, but his “juridical state” is rapidly disassembled into a panoply of fervently uncompromising individuals. A proper collective, the somewhat circular logic runs, creates the conditions under which no one has to conduct themselves in a spirit of collectivity. Individuality provides the only secure ground upon which a just form of collectivity may be built. It is not surprising, in light of such a premise, that Kant has been called “<italic>the</italic> philosopher of freedom” by modern legal thinkers.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn53-1743872111407450">53</xref></sup> Hegel critiques Kant, but he does so from within the liberal tradition of individual rights. Kant’s legal theory is based on abstract universals: each person is born with a natural set of incontrovertible rights. Hegel argues that at such a level of abstraction, the state of nature within which Kant locates his legal subjects becomes apolitical and, consequently, of limited use for thinking through the juridical impasses of the real world. Hegel focuses instead on mediums of integration <italic>between</italic> the individual and the state, such as morality, social values, and the family. He wants to think of freedom in terms of carefully orchestrated interactions between rights and responsibilities, the one and the many.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn54-1743872111407450">54</xref></sup> This alternative model of freedom is not designed as a replacement for liberalism, but rather as a further development of earlier contributions to the liberal tradition. Far from doing away with the closed, autonomous individual, Hegel’s aim is to rethink the individual in terms of its social and historical situatedness so as to better facilitate the effective and responsible exercise of individual rights.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn55-1743872111407450">55</xref></sup> There remains for Hegel a basic acceptance of the primacy of the <italic>I</italic>, of the individual’s right to property and prosperity, self-preservation and self-ownership. This basic acceptance of the primacy of the <italic>I</italic> has continued to occupy the mainstream of legal and political thought in our own time, finding support in the otherwise very different work of legal theorists from John Rawls to Robert Nozick and Ernst Weinrib.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn56-1743872111407450">56</xref></sup> The grammar of Shakespeare’s hospitable justice is considerably different. As in the writings of Lévinas or the story of Lot and his daughters, the legal thought-worlds of sonnets 35, 49, and 88 are based upon the primacy of the <italic>him</italic>, not the <italic>I</italic>; and, so, selfhood – like justice itself – becomes closely bound up with sacrifice. In his recent, masterfully orchestrated book, <italic>Shakespeare’s Individualism</italic>, Peter Holbrook makes a case for Shakespeare as “an author for a liberal, individualistic culture,” arguing that he “is profoundly committed to the values of individuality, freedom and authenticity.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn57-1743872111407450">57</xref></sup> If this is so then sonnets 35, 49, and 88 show us the limits of Shakespeare’s individualism. They mark a conceptual threshold beyond which submission to the ethical demands of the Other becomes the shaping force behind self-actualization.</p>
<p>Sonnets 35, 49, and 88 rediscover the experience of loss as a central juridico-ethical principle. Justice, Shakespeare seems to tell us, is not about what you get, but what you give. It is not about what is rightfully yours, but about what is somebody else’s, rightfully or not. This simple insight removes these sonnets from the main current of legal-philosophy, just as it removes them from the legal culture of Shakespeare’s time. That they find an alternative intellectual home within the theo-philosophical tradition of hospitality is significant, first, because it situates Shakespeare within a genealogy of ideas to which he has not typically been seen as contributing, and this opens up for scholars of Shakespeare a range of new paths into his writing. It is also significant because hospitality itself, especially as treated in the work of Emmanuel Lévinas, challenges the egocentric model of selfhood which dominates Western philosophy and legal thought alike. Sonnets 35, 49, and 88 thus become heuristic models for the exploration of the nature of selfhood and ask us, finally, to take seriously a vision of the self which is fundamentally self<italic>less</italic>. And here, I think, we encounter the most important point of all, a point which cuts to the heart of what law was for Shakespeare and what it might mean to characterize a piece of writing by Shakespeare as “legal.” For in witnessing how Shakespeare’s hospitable justice hosts non-juridical questions about the nature of selfhood, we discover that law was not simply something Shakespeare thought about, it was also something he thought with. It can be understood as a mode of critical thinking, a particular way of seeing; not something to look at so much as a lens to peer through. It provided a pretext for posing questions and a vehicle for creative enquiry. Far from being merely a subject to probe, law for Shakespeare was a tool in its own right, ideally formed for the task of intellectual excavation.</p>

<p>Rebecca Lemon, for instance, approaches “treason as a textual phenomenon” in “trial transcripts, scaffold speeches, and political polemic” (<italic>Treason</italic>, pp. 3–4), as well as in contemporaneously produced “classical translations, domestic prose histories, and stage plays” (<italic>Treason</italic>, p. 4). She centers her analysis on two particular historical case studies in treason: the Essex rebellion and the Gunpowder Plot. Subha Mukherji is interested in illuminating “the nature and extent of the engagement between the disciplines and cultural practices of the stage and the court in early modern England” (<italic>Law and Representation</italic>, p. 2) and observes that “the perception of structural affinity between theatrical and legal practice allowed playwrights to address actual legal issues of evidence, interpretation, and judgment” (<italic>Law and Representation</italic>, p. 3). Her study of plays, legal treatises and official legal documents “constructs a history of law as lived experience” (<italic>Law and Representation</italic>, p. 7). Lorna Hutson looks at the deployment of forensic rhetoric within plays written in the late 1580s and 1590s, linking it not only to the conventions of Roman New Comedy, but also to “the rapidly developing sophistication of evidential concepts in English common law” (<italic>Invention</italic>, p. 3). This contributes to a larger argument in Hutson’s book about the way cultural and historical changes have the power to affect the formal development of literature and theater (<italic>Invention</italic>, p. 4). Bradin Cormack untangles the “cultural meaning of ‘jurisdiction’” (<italic>Power</italic>, p. 1), a concept which, as he points out, becomes particularly volatile in sixteenth- and seventeenth-century England where the relationship between common law courts, ecclesiastical courts, equity courts, the High Court of Admiralty, duchy courts, manorial courts, and guild courts was notoriously contentious.
