<abstract>
<p>The use of video for research purposes is something that has attracted ethical attention and debate. While the usefulness of video as a mechanism to collect data is widely agreed, the ethical sensitivity and impact of recording equipment is more contentious. In some clinical settings the presence of a camera has a dual role, as a portal to a reflecting team and as a recording device to obtain research data. Using data from one such setting, family therapy sessions, this article shows how the role played by recording equipment is negotiated in the course of talk and other activities that constitute sessions. Analysis reveals that members of the therapy interaction orient in different ways and for different purposes to the value of recordings. The article concludes that there are layers of benefit to be derived from recording of clinical interactions, including for members themselves, and this has wider implications for the ways in which qualitative research designs in health sciences are evaluated.</p>

<body>
<p>Recent years have seen a number of analyses of the ethical, practical and interactional dimensions of the use of recording devices (audio and, especially, video) for qualitative data collection in naturalistic settings. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1461445612457487">Lomax and Casey (1998)</xref>, for example, argued for a reflexive approach in which the use of a video recorder is seen as a constitutive part of the interaction that the researcher has available for analysis. This was set against the standard responses in social science methodology to the observer’s paradox (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1461445612457487">Labov, 1972</xref>) or one-way mirror dilemma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1461445612457487">Speer and Hutchby, 2003</xref>): the notion that participants’ awareness of the recording of their behaviour inevitably distorts that very behaviour, thus contaminating the research object. Typical responses to this have included the recommendation of covert recording (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1461445612457487">Eibl-Eibesfeldt and Hass, 1974</xref>), a data collection technique which has become ethically problematic in contemporary methodology, especially in healthcare and other professional settings; or relying on post hoc participant validation of observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1461445612457487">Vuchinich, 1986</xref>), which is problematic because it relies on fallible memory and also risks eliding accounts ‘of’ with accounts ‘for’ behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1461445612457487">Drew, 1989</xref>).</p>
<p>Other studies have investigated the ways that participants themselves observably orient to the presence of a recording device and how this can play a facilitative, as opposed to a negative or constraining, part in the interaction. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1461445612457487">Hutchby (2001)</xref> explored the ways in which the researcher’s tape recorder, openly positioned within a child counselling clinic, was utilized by both counsellor and child to facilitate the introduction of topics and the further pursuit of talk about fears and concerns. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1461445612457487">Speer and Hutchby (2003)</xref> presented a more general analysis of how the ethical dimensions of recording talk are iteratively negotiated by participants, as well as how their displayed orientations towards the device and its functions play a practical role in the unfolding of talk. In situations of covert recording, this included reactions to the revelation that a recording was being made. Such revelations, usually made towards the end of conversations, elicited reactions which, rather than anger or dismay, tended to involve surveillance-related joking behaviour by both participants. In overtly recorded settings, on the other hand, a notable feature was the recurrence of negotiations about what should go ‘on’ or ‘off’ the tape; features that are replicated in the present analysis.</p>
<p>A common theme in these studies is that the one-way mirror dilemma derives from too restrictive a notion of what can constitute ‘naturally occurring’ behaviour:
<disp-quote>
<p>Concerns about the problem of reactivity or researcher effect are based on the idea that there is a realm of social interaction that is pristine and natural, but that the presence of a researcher, or, more seriously, of recording devices, can only disturb, distort, or otherwise contaminate. ‘Natural’ interaction, it is implied, could only be captured for research purposes if the researcher could stand behind a one-way mirror or become, in a literal sense, the proverbial fly-on-the-wall. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1461445612457487">Speer and Hutchby, 2003</xref>: 317; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1461445612457487">Speer, 2002</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>By contrast, whilst acknowledging that there may be certain environments where the open presence of a recording device may indeed inhibit or otherwise negatively affect the talk, such as interviews concerning illicit or illegal activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1461445612457487">Hammersley, 2003</xref>), the studies above aim to situate the recording technology <italic>within</italic> and as <italic>part of</italic> the natural setting. Rooting analysis in the participants’ perspective, these studies maintain, makes it possible to treat ‘interaction involving a tape/video recorder’ as one among the many different types of behavioural setting which humans competently negotiate.</p>
<p>Turning to the topic of the present article, there are certain social situations in which the presence of a recording device is in fact integral to the setting. One example is the family therapy consultation. Like many forms of professional counselling (though usually not psychoanalytic therapy), family therapy takes place in a dedicated space which incorporates a variety of observational technologies, such as one-way mirrors (actual rather than metaphorical), behind which a team of therapists will observe the progress of a given session and often provide advice and guidance to the worker(s) dealing face-to-face with family members; and video cameras, which record the session for purposes such as reflective analysis by the family therapy team or training of novice therapists. Family members who enter into therapy must consent to the observation of their talk and behaviour by these means, implicitly acknowledging, so it seems, that their awareness of being observed will not affect their ability to engage effectively in the therapy programme. Whilst ethically constrained to make explicit the recording technology’s presence, therefore, therapists might be thought to rely on an assumption that those whose behaviour is being recorded will ultimately ‘acclimatize’ to and hence ignore that very presence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1461445612457487">Bottorff, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>In this article, we show that this is not the case. Both therapists and family members make frequent reference to the setting’s observational technologies throughout their sessions. However, rather than viewing this simply as a methodological problem, we analyse how those references are part of the overall praxis of the family therapy session, as the camera is oriented to as a mediating, facilitating and observing presence in the interaction. This is so both in the iterative negotiation of consent which is managed by the therapist and, in various ways, within the therapeutic exchange itself. We show how different categories of participant (therapist, parents and children) manifest their awareness of being recorded in different ways and for different interactional purposes.</p>
<sec id="section1-1461445612457487">
<title>Data</title>
<p>The study was carried out with the cooperation of a systemic family therapy team based in the UK. We were provided with video-taped data of naturally occurring family therapy sessions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1461445612457487">1</xref></sup> The tapes comprise approximately 22 hours of family therapy. The data involve work by two therapists who organized and provided consent, and four families with various presenting difficulties involving children of varying ages and genders. All names used in data extracts below are changed to protect anonymity.</p>
<p>The family therapy team are a group of systemic family therapists who specialize in families with children who have diagnosable disorders (such as Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, and other forms of behavioural and learning difficulty). This approach to therapy is language-based and directs clients to concentrate on a relational process rather than step-by-step operations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1461445612457487">Larner, 2004</xref>). The aim of systemic family therapy, therefore, is to modify the aspects of the family system that are judged by the therapist to require change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1461445612457487">Masson and O’Byrne, 1984</xref>).</p>
<p>The research was conducted in accordance with the British Psychological Society (BPS) code of practice for ethical research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1461445612457487">BPS, 2005</xref>). After securing informed consent from management, consultations with family therapists took place and their cooperation and consent was obtained. It was agreed at the outset that the therapists would take responsibility for acquiring consent from families. Videotaping for training and research purposes was routinely collected but additional consent for conducting this particular project was agreed between the therapist and parents. As will be seen in some of the extracts below, the consent process in this particular study was iterative; that is, it was not something simply agreed at the start of a therapy series and never mentioned again (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1461445612457487">O’Reilly et al., 2011</xref>). This fact plays a part in the present analysis.</p>

<sec id="section2-1461445612457487">
<title>Analysis</title>
<p>Data analysis revealed that the camera may be a more positive aspect of clinical work than is often assumed; certainly not being treated as necessarily problematic, or as something to become ‘acclimatized’ to and ignore, by participants. There are three key ways in which members orient to and consider the recording in clinical practice. First, the camera is oriented to in what we call ‘procedural’ terms: its functions are linked to the procedures of the therapy session, including treating it as a conduit to a ‘team’ of observers; but also oriented to its recording function as linked to the family therapist’s (FT) presence in the consulting room (data extracts 1–8). Second, the camera’s functions are treated in playful terms, including the kind of jokes about surveillance that we find in other contexts of ‘being recorded’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1461445612457487">Speer and Hutchby, 2003</xref>). Children in particular tend to orient to the camera in playful terms by overtly noticing or ‘acting up’ for the camera (data extracts 9–11). Third, adult family members especially negotiate the camera’s mediating presence in terms of things being spoken, shown or demonstrated to be ‘on’ or ‘off’ record. Children also treat it as an observer linked to a different form of surveillance associated with the power structures of family therapy: checking if it is on; being concerned to ‘find’ possibly hidden cameras; seeking to ‘move’ to avoid appearing on camera (extracts 12–15). In different ways, each of these patterns shows an overarching orientation to the relationship between the camera and ‘the record’, though not, as previously noted, always in a negative sense.</p>

<title>‘Procedural’ orientations to the video camera</title>
<p>One of the therapist’s tasks early on in any session is to negotiate the family’s consent to the recording of the session. In this context, the presence of the video camera is foregrounded in procedural terms: both the procedures of the family therapy session as an interactional event, and also the procedures concerning how the tapes will be used following therapy:</p>
<graphic id="img1-1461445612457487" position="anchor" xlink:href="10.1177_1461445612457487-img1.tif"/>
<p>Here, FT initiates the topic of video recording using the third-person ‘institutional voice’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1461445612457487">Silverman, 1987</xref>), ‘we’ (line 1). The specific formulation, ‘we do ↑often like t’ &gt;video&lt; the sessions’, presents the recording not as a compulsory requirement, but as a preference; something that ‘we’ ‘often like’ to do. This is followed by two accounts also designed to mitigate the threat of compulsion: the recording of sessions is used merely as an aide memoire (line 4) or as a training tool (line 16). On both counts, FT further provides the family (or at least, the parents) with a power of veto (lines 9 and 19). Thus, while foregrounding the presence of the video camera, FT seeks to normalize its presence, rendering its functions as non-threatening.</p>
<p>In the above extract, we find the video camera being referred to under the constraints of ethical practice in the health services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1461445612457487">Grimandi, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1461445612457487">Lee, 2007</xref>). There are, however, further ways in which the camera is made relevant in procedural terms, having to do more centrally with the nature of family therapy as a specific form of institutional interaction. First of all, we find the therapist referring indirectly to the camera in its role as a conduit enabling the participation of other, non-co-present members of the family therapy team:</p>
<graphic id="img2-1461445612457487" position="anchor" xlink:href="10.1177_1461445612457487-img2.tif"/>
<graphic id="img3-1461445612457487" position="anchor" xlink:href="10.1177_1461445612457487-img3.tif"/>
<p>FT’s turns here avoid direct reference to the camera, but imply its presence as it acts to enable other, non-co-present members of the therapy team to play their part in ‘thinkin’ about’ what is being said in the consulting room. The camera’s presence is again normalized through selected forms of reference: positioning the existence of a reflecting team behind the camera as ‘what we usually do’ (extract 2, line 1) or referring to consultations with the non-co-present observers as a ‘routine’ (extract 3, line 1). Similarly, referring to the reflecting team by their first names, ‘Hannah and Dawn’ (extract 3, line 2), functions to personalize them for the family. This can also perhaps shift awareness beyond the camera itself to the people ‘behind’ it. Thus, while implicitly acknowledging the presence of the camera, the therapist simultaneously elides it: the camera is treated as a conduit which both mediates, and renders complete, the therapy ‘pool’.</p>
<p>Moving beyond the preliminary stages of sessions, we find that FTs continue to refer to the camera in various procedural guises. For example, the therapist will explicitly relate the camera’s ‘observing’ functions to their own physical co-presence with the family. Thus, they are often at pains to stress that the camera only operates while they are in the therapy room:</p>
<graphic id="img4-1461445612457487" position="anchor" xlink:href="10.1177_1461445612457487-img4.tif"/>
<graphic id="img5-1461445612457487" position="anchor" xlink:href="10.1177_1461445612457487-img5.tif"/>
<graphic id="img6-1461445612457487" position="anchor" xlink:href="10.1177_1461445612457487-img6.tif"/>
<p>In the course of stating that the video camera is off when he is not in the room, FT brings into play, and simultaneously seeks to neutralize, a further possible interpretation of the camera as a surveillance technology; that is, one by which persons might be ‘listenin’ or <underline>reco</underline>rdin’’ (extract 4, line 2) without the family’s awareness. In response to the FT’s attempt to neutralize this possible interpretation, parents in extracts 4 and 5 actively pick up the ‘surveillance’ frame by jokingly referring to illicit activities (that is, talking about the therapist behind his back) that can be engaged in without the mediating presence of the camera (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1461445612457487">Speer and Hutchby, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, therapists will sometimes negotiate the functioning of the camera with family members themselves. In extract 7 FT topicalizes the ‘particularly sensitive’ nature of the discussion they are engaged in (a member of the extended family who is involved in the sessions, referred to here as ‘Joe’, has reasons for being under special surveillance by the social services):</p>
<graphic id="img7-1461445612457487" position="anchor" xlink:href="10.1177_1461445612457487-img7.tif"/>
<p>In the second part of this extract (lines 6–10), FT establishes a procedural separation between the functions of the recording device (whether it is switched on or off) and the process of family therapy itself, which carries on even if the parents indicate that they ‘want it s<underline>wit</underline>ched off now’.</p>
<p>This procedural separation between what might be said in the therapy room and what is recorded or observed via the video device also appears in the following extract, though this case is more complex. In the course of a discussion, FT asks the parents whether, at this stage, they ‘want the <underline>cam</underline>era on or off’ (line 1). This results in an extended exchange in which the functions of the video camera become bound up with therapy talk as a whole, in terms of the clinical relevance of topics that need to be spoken about:</p>
<graphic id="img8-1461445612457487" position="anchor" xlink:href="10.1177_1461445612457487-img8.tif"/>
<p>In response to FT’s question in line 1, Dad turns to Mum to ask if she is happy; in context, it seems, he is asking if she is happy to leave the camera on. Mum’s next turn performs two actions: an assent (‘Yeah &gt;I’m fine&lt;’) followed by an indication that she had been hoping for a break at this point (‘I jus’ wanted a fag heh heh’). FT responds to the second action by announcing that they will ‘finish’ the session, or at least that part of it, and that he will ‘knock on the wall’ to instruct the observing team to turn off the video link.</p>
<p>There follows a spate of overlapping talk, initiated by Dad’s disagreement with FT on line 5. While Dad indicates that there are things he intends to say at this point that FT needs to hear (lines 7–8, 10), FT and Mum engage in an overlapping exchange about the current status of the video camera. FT checks again whether she wants the camera off (line 6), while Mum exhibits uncertainty about whether or not it is, in fact, on (line 9); a fact confirmed by FT in line 11.</p>
<p>There thus arise competing agendas around what can be referred to as a) the <italic>session</italic> as a bounded event with its own procedural structures (e.g. the occasional need for breaks), and b) the <italic>record</italic> of the session which is intimately linked to the presence of the FT and, on this occasion it seems, the active function status of the video camera. On both levels, albeit in slightly different ways, the recording technology plays a central but negotiable role.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1461445612457487">
<title>‘Playful’ orientations to the video camera</title>
<p>We have already seen some indication of the role played by parents and carers in determining the clinical status of the video camera. The two primary modes of orientation to the technology adopted by adult family members are one of playfulness (‘&gt;we can talk about ya&lt; when yo(h)u’re go(h)ne’, extract 4, line 4, earlier) and one of a concern with what can usefully be placed ‘on’ or ‘off record’. This concern with ‘the record’ is something that recurs throughout the data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1461445612457487">O’Reilly et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>The following extract is another example of playfulness:</p>
<graphic id="img9-1461445612457487" position="anchor" xlink:href="10.1177_1461445612457487-img9.tif"/>
<p>Here the therapist begins by referring to a request from the family to finish the session earlier than usual. He acknowledges this with ‘we are limited by time today’ (line 1); then subsequently indicates that this poses a difficulty for him: ‘I actually .hh have <underline>no</underline> idea what time ↓it ↓is’ (lines 1–2). The absence of time-keeping devices by all parties having been established (lines 4–6), a possible solution is constructed by the father orienting towards the camera lens (line 8). Fixing his gaze on the device, he actually directs a request to the reflecting team in a separate room: ‘you couldn’t bring us the time?’.</p>
<p>At the same time as demonstrating playfulness, Dad’s turn in line 8 also demonstrates how not only the therapist but also the family orient to the camera as a routine device in the interaction and recognize the presence of the team of persons ‘behind’ it. In this way the camera is constructed not only as unintrusive to the interaction, but actually integral to it.</p>
<p>Children too interact with the camera on playful terms. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1461445612457487">Sparrman (2005)</xref> previously examined how and when children interact with the video camera in settings such as family therapy. She noted that verbal comments on the camera were rare, but there were many more non-verbal acknowledgements. In our data corpus, we note something slightly different; namely children will use verbal mechanisms for making relevant the video camera and non-verbal mechanisms for attempting to interact with it, or with the observing team ‘behind’ it:</p>
<graphic id="img10-1461445612457487" position="anchor" xlink:href="10.1177_1461445612457487-img10.tif"/>
<graphic id="img11-1461445612457487" position="anchor" xlink:href="10.1177_1461445612457487-img11.tif"/>
<p>In both of these extracts the same kind of sequence can be observed. In the course of an exchange between FT and one of the parents regarding problematic behaviour by a particular child, another child interjects to verbally orient to the presence of the video camera (arrowed lines). These interjections seek to draw attention to the camera as it relates to this conversationally ‘absent’ child (i.e. one not currently being referred to in the therapy talk): ‘I’m on the camera’ (extract 10, line 6) and ‘loo::k, ↑look up there’ (extract 11, line 2). In both instances non-verbal behaviour follows which mimics an interaction with the camera, or possibly with the absent members of the reflecting team. In extract 10, Lee waves at the camera and in extract 11, Ron sticks his tongue out. In normal face-to-face conduct gestures of this kind made by a child may be mirrored or responded to in some way by the recipient; however, in this instance any response of the team behind the camera cannot be available to the child. Notably, though, the child’s gesture takes for granted the possibility of such normative responses, again both treating the camera’s presence as unproblematic (as conduit) and eliding it (as mediator).</p>
<p>When children interrupt adults during family therapy, particularly during discussions of sensitive topics, the interruption is often conversationally downgraded or ignored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1461445612457487">O’Reilly, 2008</xref>). Although in both these cases the child’s turn is disattended by the parent, who continues on-topic talk, it is positively attended to by another adult. In extract 10, the therapist actively takes Lee’s wrist and initiates the first wave; while in extract 11, uncle Joe’s statement, ‘it’s no good pullin’ your tongue out jus’ in case they’re watchin’ ya’ (lines 5–6), corroborates Ron’s action by making relevant the possibility of activities being attended to from behind the camera, while implying that this particular activity, being outside the central therapeutic action, may not in fact be attended to. In each case, playful orientations to the camera are both validated and treated as non-threatening to the ongoing therapeutic work of the session.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1461445612457487">
<title>Orientations to the video camera as observer</title>
<p>On occasion, children’s overt references to the camera are treated as topicalizing its functions by other members within the session. This can also reveal ways in which the camera’s functions are viewed in positive terms by family members:</p>
<graphic id="img12-1461445612457487" position="anchor" xlink:href="10.1177_1461445612457487-img12.tif"/>
<p>Again in this extract it is the child who first draws attention to the camera, both with a verbal and non-verbal reference (line 1). Following receipt from FT, Dad takes up the topic of the presence of the camera by noting the availability of the camera for family use. He describes an event in which the parents utilized the video link as a portal to view their child, Phillip, in order to gain a sense of how he behaves when not in their presence. Dad thus positively situates the camera within his and his wife’s experience of family therapy, even though here he is referring to what might be described as covert uses of the camera. Covert observation is not usually supported in contemporary models of informed consent in research ethics. However, Dad in this extract seems to support its role in rendering the problematic behaviours of children accessible and viewable by those positioned behind it (see also extract 15 later).</p>
<p>A further dimension of the technology’s role as an observer is shown in cases where family members orient to their awareness of being ‘on’ or ‘off’ record in the course of sessions. Although as we have already seen, sometimes participants do request the device to be turned off or are given the option to turn it off, extracts such as 13 below demonstrate that ‘going on record’ can actually be treated in a positive sense at certain stages in a consultation:</p>

<p>The insertion of a reference to the session being video-recorded in Dad’s first turn here is bound up with his management of face (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1461445612457487">Goffman, 1955</xref>) in the context of presenting a version of how he relates to his stepson. In discussing such a topic, Dad has at stake his identity as ‘good parent’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1461445612457487">Hutchby and O’Reilly, 2010</xref>), and he seeks to protect that identity by stressing equality of treatment between stepchildren and biological children. He manages this through an acknowledgement of the possible interpretation that he is having ‘a go’ at his stepson (line 2). The disclaimer ‘I don’t mean t’. . . I don’t mean t’ ’ave &lt;a go&gt;’ is modified by the inserted phrase ‘&gt;I ↑know we’re bein’ video’d now&lt;’ (lines 1–2). This insertion does the work of acknowledging not only the presence of the video camera, but the father’s awareness that what he is now saying is ‘on record’. In a similar way to the examples discussed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1461445612457487">Speer and Hutchby (2003)</xref>, therefore, this displays that a manifest awareness that a recording device is currently recording does not necessarily mean that participants refrain from stating things that they feel need to be stated; in fact they may use the presence of a recording device as support for their case by overtly ‘going on record’.</p>
<p>Children, however, particularly those categorized within the therapy session as suffering from emotional or behavioural difficulties – and hence at the centre of the ‘therapeutic gaze’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1461445612457487">Hutchby, 2007</xref>), can orient to the record created by the recording device in more problematical and sometimes negative terms. This can involve resisting the surveillance-related affordances of the camera:</p>
<graphic id="img14-1461445612457487" position="anchor" xlink:href="10.1177_1461445612457487-img14.tif"/>
<p>In this extract family members themselves are involved, with the FT, in negotiating the positioning of the camera vis-a-vis the observability of particular participants. Here, Steve is the child whose behaviour is the reason for the family’s attendance in therapy, and as the extract begins FT is engaged in choosing his own seating position from which to begin the session. Following an observation by one of the siblings (Lee) that another has just spilled a drink (line 2), Steve’s sister Nicola produces a turn that orients to an ongoing question of Steve’s observability for the camera: her utterance ‘or you could &lt;move the camera&gt; so it faces ↑there’ is worded as an alternative to an earlier proposal. There follows agreement by both FT and Mum. This indicates that the family, as well as the therapist, view the presence of the camera as important and can work collaboratively to position Steve as viewable by the reflecting team through the camera. However Steve, in line 7, appears to indicate that if the camera <italic>is</italic> moved to focus on him, he will move seats, thereby attempting resistance to this family hierarchy. Thus the camera is an integral part of the therapy for the family in a positive sense, but also in the sense that its role can be resisted.</p>
<p>In our final extract, these two ‘positive’ and ‘negative’ aspects of the role of technology in placing statements and behaviours on record are demonstrated in a dispute between Steve and his stepfather:</p>
<graphic id="img15-1461445612457487" position="anchor" xlink:href="10.1177_1461445612457487-img15.tif"/>
<p>In lines 1–6 Dad proposes to the therapist that a camera could be set up inside the family home in order to facilitate covert observation or recording of Steve’s behaviour. Dad is concerned to emphasize that this would be a hidden camera (lines 4–5). However, as in extract 12 earlier, he also indicates that such covert observation would be beneficial, enabling the therapist to ‘see what ‘e’s like’ (line 5).</p>
<p>Steve, in response, exhibits a negative orientation to the proposed hidden camera, interjecting in line 7 with the statement ‘I’ll find it’. This occasions a shift in the mode of address as Dad moves from directing his talk towards FT and instead addresses Steve: ‘yeah but how you gonna know?’ (line 8). There follows a reiteration of the previous exchange, with Dad indicating that though he would give permission, only ‘mum and John [FT] know where the camera is ↑right (.) so John can monitor what you’re doing at ’ome’ (lines 11–12). After a 1.4-second pause, Steve reiterates his resistance to this idea, repeating ‘I’ll <underline>find</underline> it’ (line 14).</p>
<p>This extract demonstrates the ambivalence that can emerge between parents and children regarding the camera’s role as an observer and a record-maker. Parents can treat the camera as a positive clinical aid, even in its guise as a covert observer, as it puts problematic behaviour of children on record. Notably, at the end of extract 15, not only does Nic (a sister) seek to collaborate in the observation of Steve by suggesting they should put a camera in every room (line 15), but Dad, continuing his direct address to Steve, indicates that Steve himself would find it useful to observe his own behaviour objectively: ‘and then you’ll see (.) what causes the trouble . . . with you’ (lines 16–17). By contrast, Steve’s insistence that he would seek out and ‘<underline>find’</underline> any hidden camera shows the negative orientation to the camera’s ‘observer’ function often adopted by those children categorized in the therapy session as behaviourally challenging.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our analysis has demonstrated that the presence of a camera in clinical settings can have a range of values for the participants. Far from seeking to ignore the observational technology that operates integrally to the setting, family members and therapists frequently refer to the video camera. They negotiate the role that the camera plays, and what its presence means for the conduct of family therapy, in and through the course of their therapy talk. We identified different registers in which such negotiation takes place and drew out varying patterns of orientation towards the affordances and the situational relevance of the observational technology.</p>
<p>We showed that there are both differences and an overarching similarity in the ways that different categories of participant orient in their behaviour towards the presence and functions of the video camera. The family therapist orients to the camera in largely ‘procedural’ terms: linking its functions to the procedures of the therapy session, orienting to the camera as a conduit to a ‘team’ of observers; also orienting to its recording function as linked to the therapist’s physical presence in the consulting room. Parents may seek to present themselves as ‘at ease’ with the video camera by jokingly referring to the possibilities of surveillance or illicit behaviours, in a similar way to some of the examples discussed in other contexts of ‘being recorded’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1461445612457487">Speer and Hutchby, 2003</xref>). More commonly, adult family members display a concern to negotiate the camera’s mediating presence in terms of things being spoken, shown or demonstrated to be ‘on’ or ‘off’ the record. This includes negotiations about turning the camera off at certain points. Depending on their role in the therapy, children in the family tend to orient to the camera in two types of way. Co-present siblings occasionally produce overt displays of ‘noticing’ or acting up for the camera, while children categorized with Emotional Behavioural Disorder (EBD) and hence at the centre of therapeutic interventions are more likely to treat it as an active observer linked to a different form of surveillance associated with the power structures of family therapy (checking if it is on; being concerned to ‘find’ possibly hidden cameras; seeking to ‘move’ to avoid appearing on camera). Although different, one similarity between these patterns is that each of them shows an overarching orientation to the relationship between the camera and ‘the record’.</p>
<p>Our analysis has wider implications for the debates around the ethics of video- recording for qualitative research in sensitive settings such as family therapy consultations. Vast amounts of research into the effectiveness of such professional services focus on providing quantitative evidence, drawn mostly from clinical trials or, in the case of therapy and mental health, from various patient outcome measurement systems. While this is essential for our knowledge and understanding of health policy and practice, quantitative research mainly focuses on outcomes and gives little information regarding process. Qualitative work based on recordings of consultations is able to address that knowledge gap, but ethical concerns persist and can sometimes place obstacles around gaining access to research funds.</p>
<p>As one way of responding to the concerns of research ethics committees, we have provided empirical evidence for the ways in which actual families undergoing therapy deal with the presence of the video camera. Much of the debate regarding the potentially intrusive nature of video-recording in sensitive settings has been based on assumptions regarding psychological reactions taking place within the individual being filmed. Our analysis demonstrates that in clinical settings such as family therapy, the camera and the subsequent recording are treated as at least unproblematically present, and at best clinically valuable, to those participating. In many cases members of the therapy session offer positive acknowledgement of the usefulness of the camera and the recording can be viewed as beneficial to themselves and others.</p>
<p>For qualitative research to have outcomes and impact, some methods rely heavily on the use of video for analysis. Our evidence suggests that this may not be a significant concern of those captured on tape, even in potentially sensitive settings such as family therapy.</p>
