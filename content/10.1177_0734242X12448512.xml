<abstract>
<p>In theory, glass diverted or recovered from the municipal solid waste (MSW) stream can be used as feedstock (glass cullet) in the production of new glass containers. However, post-consumer glass typically contains a mixture of clear and coloured material and is often contaminated with other wastes; characteristics that are impediments to the production of new containers. Sorting and cleaning of glass diverted from MSW to make it feasible for use in bottle industries are also time consuming and costly tasks. There is, however, the potential to use recycled glass as a sub-base material for road pavement construction. Geotechnical investigations to date suggest that use of recycled glass as a roadway sub-base could be cost-effective, and thus preclude the need for expensive sorting. There is, however, the necessessity to further investigate the potential short- and long-term toxicity, health hazards, and/or environmental pollution associated with use of mixed glass cullet as an aggregate, considering conditions during stockpiled storage and after placement. The results of laboratory tests on recycled glass regarding its potential to release pollutants to the environment via leaching are presented herein. Five random samples of crushed glasses were collected from a recycling company in Melbourne, Australia. The parameters tested for each sample were total organic matter, heavy metals, sulfates, chlorides, conductivity, pH and surfactant levels. It wais found that in most cases, the contamination levels were within the State of Victoria’s Environmental Protection Agency-specified limits for manual handling, thus indicating that recycled glass could probably be safely used in pavement sub-bases.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Recycled coloured glass typically is recovered from municipal solid waste at recycling facilities. This material consists of broken glass bottles and other containers of clear and coloured glass which is normally too costly to sort by colour. (Only clear glass cullet can be used to produce new clear glass containers so cullet with a mixture of colours has a relatively low market value. In fact, when market prices fall too low for a prolonged period of time it is not uncommon for glass that a city has diverted from the waste stream for subsequent recycling to be sent to a landfill instead because storage space is limited or costly.) Consequently, alternative uses of post-consumer glass are being sought. In some countries, crushed recycled glass from recycling industries is being used as a substitute for soil and/or an aggregate in the construction industry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0734242X12448512">Disfani et al., 2012</xref>). Typical uses are as a drainage layer and daily cover material in landfills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0734242X12448512">Reindl, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0734242X12448512">Tsai et al., 2009</xref>). However, municipalities and the recycling industries are interested in finding broader, higher quality and more cost-effective beneficial uses of mixed cullet. One of the additional potential uses is as construction aggregate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0734242X12448512">CWC, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0734242X12448512">Tsai et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0734242X12448512">Wartman et al., 2004</xref>). In various construction projects, the use of mixed recycled glass (glass cullet) requires a sufficient volume of cullet to be stored on-site. On many occasions cullet is stockpiled without any cover for from several months to years, which may lead to release of contaminated leachate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0734242X12448512">Tsai et al., 2009</xref>). That is, if incident precipitation and/or uncontrolled stormwater is allowed to percolate into the stockpiled cullet, the resulting leachate could become contaminated with chemicals present on the surface of the glass; unless collected and treated, this leachate has the potential to pollute local ground and surface water.</p>
<p>There have been some studies of the leaching of heavy metals from recycled glass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0734242X12448512">CWC, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0734242X12448512">Wartman et al., 2004</xref>). Testing conducted by the Clean Washington Center (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0734242X12448512">CWC, 1996</xref>) reported a higher level of lead concentration (&gt; 5 mg L<sup>−1</sup>) in one out of 50 samples when tested per the toxic characteristic leaching procedure (TCLP). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0734242X12448512">Wartman et al. (2004)</xref> investigated leaching of heavy metals from recycled glass under landfill and soil conditions. They reported trace amounts of lead, chromium, barium and mercury under landfill conditions in very few samples. Although the exact source of these heavy metals was unknown, it was surmised that colouring ingredients in some commercial glassware, thermometer glass materials, printing pigments in labels, and bottle-capping material were likely sources. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0734242X12448512">Disfani et al. (2011b)</xref> classified recycled crushed glass into three categories: fine recycled glass (&lt; 4.75 mm), medium recycled glass (&lt; 9.5 mm) and coarse recycled glass (&lt; 19 mm). They have presented detailed geotechnical properties as well as some chemical properties of those different sized recycled glasses.</p>
<p>Crushed recycled glass has the potential to be used as filler in applications such as cement and concrete manufacture or aggregates in road construction. It may also be mixed with virgin materials in the manufacture of whole glass products. However, use of such recycled glass may cause concern, if these materials are not washed properly and contain chemical and/or biological contaminants. There are potential risks of safety of the workers involved in the manufacture/construction of anything involving contaminated recycled glass. Moreover, there are risks of leaching of contaminants from the construction site and to the integrity of the final product itself should the contaminants act as a spoilage agent. To avoid any potential occupational health and safety concern for the workers involved with using recycled glass and to overcome any risk of contaminants leaching to the surrounding environment, it is necessary to thoroughly test the recycled glass, before its use as an aggregate in pavement sub-bases or other engineering applications.</p>
<p>Leachable chemicals from recycled glass stems mainly from contamination on the surface of glass particles rather than dissolution of chemicals entrained in the glass itself. Heavy metals may be inherently part of the glass crystal structure (when present as impurities or additives), but these normally remain permanently locked within the solid glass phase even after substantial mechanical processing and size reduction. Thus, these entrained chemicals are not considered threats to public or environmental health. However, it is possible that glass materials can come into contact with water and in particular acidic water, both of which are likely to extract surface and soluble impurities from the crushed glass diverted via recycling programmes.</p>
<p>For the above reasons, testing usually involves extracting impurities with distilled water, often with acidic water and very occasionally with alkaline water to simulate the leaching of contaminants in different realistic conditions. Although there are some advanced standardized testing methodologies, due to various laboratory and equipment limitations, tests were performed through a simplified process.</p>

<title>Sources of recycled glass</title>
<p>Recycled glass is the mixed coloured glass fragments produced from the breakage of coloured glass containers, such as empty soft drink, food, wine, beer and liquor containers that cannot be reused by bottle manufacturers. Currently over 250 000 tonnes of recycled glass is stockpiled annually in the state of Victoria in Australia and these stockpiles are growing. Recycled crushed glass (nominal size 5 mm) used in this research was collected from a recycling site, located approximately 20 km to the west of Melbourne. Samples were collected from stockpiles, following the Australian standard procedures AS 1141-1996 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0734242X12448512">Standards Australia, 1996</xref>), and were transferred to the laboratory in sealed plastic bags for chemical testing. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0734242X12448512">Figure 1</xref> is a photograph of recycled glass used in this study.</p>

<title>Sample preparation and general methodology</title>
<p>Concentrated extracts were obtained by soaking glass samples, with an initial inversion mixing and further mixing by a magnetic stirrer during equilibrium in water, 1 mol L<sup>−1</sup> HNO<sub>3</sub> solution and 1 mol L<sup>−1</sup> KOH solution. The ratio used was 10 : 1 w/w ratio of solution to glass and the equilibration was at room temperature for approximately 24 h. The 10 : 1 w/w ratio was selected to allow dilution, mixing ease and well extraction of all the impurities from crushed glass surface. The three resultant samples are designated in the following sections as water, acid and base extracts, respectively.</p>
<p>Selected testing showed that the amount extracted was not strongly dependent on the above conditions and variations of up to 10% in, for example the length of time equilibrated, had no effect on the results. In general, testing was performed at least in triplicate. In many cases two experimenters were used and they each performed the results in triplicate. If the values varied by more than 10% then they were further repeated until a reliable result was obtained. Note that most results were well below any critical contamination threshold and some were below detection levels. Thus a 10% variation in results is of little concern.</p>
<p>To study the organic content in the crushed glass, a portion of the glass sample was air dried (to constant mass) for 2 days at 120 °C, then heated for approximately 30 min at 540 °C. Tests indicated that this was a suitable time and temperature to obtain constant mass (i.e. the value did not change if longer heating periods were used).</p>

<title>pH values</title>
<p>Leachate from glass cullet (used as pavement layer) is likely to percolate to the surrounding environment or water bodies. If the released leachate has a high pH value, it may cause environmental damage to nearby streams, lakes and groundwater. Furthermore, the presence of high ion concentrations can accelerate corrosion of metal pipes buried in the vicinity of the pavement layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0734242X12448512">AASHTO, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0734242X12448512">Concrete Paving Technology, 1993</xref>). Therefore to be able to take suitable preventive measures, the presence and concentration of pH in glass cullet is important to be ascertained.</p>
<p>The pH value of the water extract was 7.65. Prior to contact with recycled glass, the pH of water was 7.93. This indicates an insignificantly small amount of acid leaching from the glass samples. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0734242X12448512">Disfani et al. (2011a)</xref> obtained a pH value of 9.9 from fine recycled glass. According to the federal regulatory limit, a solid material is designated as hazardous waste when it contains a pH less than or equal to 2.0 or greater than or equal to 12.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0734242X12448512">CWC, 1998</xref>). As the pH value of the recycled glass was outside these limits, it can be concluded that it will not produce any potential harm to water bodies.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0734242X12448512">
<title>Conductivity</title>
<p>Conductivity can be used to represent a crude estimate of soluble salts. The conductivity of water before contact with the glass was 7.1 mS and following contact was 26.4 mS. Although this indicates presence of a slight amount of soluble salt, it would only take approximately 1 × 10<sup>−5</sup> mol L<sup>−1</sup> NaCl to produce a similar conductivity and this would correspond to less than 0.01% (by weight) of salt in the recycled glass. This value is well below acceptable limits (100~500 mS) as specified by EPA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0734242X12448512">EPA Victoria, 2003</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section7-0734242X12448512">
<title>Heavy metals</title>
<p>Metal concentrations were determined in each of the extracts. EPA Victoria expressed hazard classification and limits in two different units (EPA Victoria, 2009): (i) mg kg<sup>−1</sup> of total solid waste material, which is measured in milligrams contaminants per kg of solid waste material and (ii) mg L<sup>−1</sup>, which is weight (mg) of contaminants per litre of solution (as per Australian Standard Leaching Procedure). As in the current study a simplified procedure was used, results are expressed as mg kg<sup>−1</sup> and compared with available EPA Victoria standard. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0734242X12448512">Table 1</xref> summarizes the tested results with EPA Victoria-specified limits and tested results for some parameters (for fine recycled glass) by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0734242X12448512">Disfani et al.

<p>As per the EPA Victoria (Australia) specified limits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0734242X12448512">EPA Victoria, 2007</xref>) except iron, all the metals in the recycled glass samples are well below the threshold limit. However, limits for magnesium and manganese are yet to be set. The acid washed samples exhibited iron content above the limit, indicating that the material could be problematic if used in acidic conditions. It is to be noted that the total metal content, as opposed to the extractable portion only, must be well above the required value so the samples could be problematic if used with any solvent which completely dissolves the glass. However, such conditions are rarely encountered and it is the water extract only which is of importance for the purpose contaminants in the leachate.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0734242X12448512">
<title>Inorganic material content</title>
<p>Sulfate and chloride are often considered the major inorganic contaminants in crushed glass, or at least certainly the major extractable contaminants. For this study chloride and sulfate contents in the recycled glass samples were determined.</p>
<sec id="section9-0734242X12448512">
<title>Chloride</title>
<p>The chloride content is most often used as an indication of whether or not the glass cullet leachate is contaminated by detrimental salt. If the presence and concentration of chlorides is known, suitable preventive measures can be taken in the design and construction of buried or underwater-reinforced concrete structures.</p>
<p>The classic way of measuring chloride is to acidify the solution (water, acid or base) containing chloride slightly with dilute nitric acid and add excess AgNO<sub>3</sub> (any silver salt) which will precipitate the chloride as white silver chloride (AgCl). The precipitated AgCl is filtered, dried and weighed. Applying the above-mentioned method, chloride was determined gravimetrically by adding silver nitrate to the acidified extract and weighing (at dryness) the AgCl formed. The weight proportions of chloride in the samples were found to be:</p>
<list id="list1-0734242X12448512" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>water wash: 300 mg kg<sup>−1</sup></p></list-item>
<list-item><p>acid wash: 80 mg kg<sup>−1</sup></p></list-item>
<list-item><p>base wash: 350 mg kg<sup>−1</sup>.</p></list-item>
</list>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0734242X12448512">
<title>Sulfate</title>
<p>Measurement of the sulfate content enables the foundation conditions to be classified according to potential sulfate attack. Appropriate precautionary measures, such as the use of sulfate-resisting cement of a richer, denser concrete mix, can be taken during construction.</p>
<p>The classic way of measuring sulfate is to add a soluble barium salt (e.g. barium chloride or barium nitrate) in excess in the solution (water, acid or base) containing sulfate with slight dilute hydrochloric acid. This will form a white dense barium sulfate precipitate, which is then filtered, dried and weighed. Following the above-mentioned procedure, sulfate concentration was determined gravimetrically by heating an acidified sample to boiling point (driving out CO<sub>2</sub>) and precipitating with 2 mol L<sup>−1</sup> BaCl<sub>2</sub>. The weight proportions of sulfate in the samples were found to be:</p>
<list id="list2-0734242X12448512" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>water wash: 290 mg kg<sup>−1</sup></p></list-item>
<list-item><p>acid wash: 110 mg kg<sup>−1</sup></p></list-item>
<list-item><p>base wash: 420 mg kg<sup>−1</sup>.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The standard specifies a maximum limit of 3000 mg kg<sup>−1</sup> for inorganics. None of the samples tested exceed this limit. However, the Australian Standards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0734242X12448512">Standards Australia, 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0734242X12448512">1998</xref>) also requires chloride or sulfate levels in aggregates which exceed 0.01% to be reported if used for any practical applications. This indicates that the levels measured would be of concern if the recycled glass concentration as filler was very high.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0734242X12448512">
<title>Organics</title>
<p>Organic material is usually easily extracted by either acid or alkaline extracts (and sometimes just by water). It is then difficult to quantify once extracted into solution. Commonly, therefore, the assumption is made that total organic content is required, not just the amount extracted. It is also commonly assumed that total organic content can be estimated by the weight loss on heating of a dried sample.</p>
<p>The weight percent mass loss of the glass was 0.29%. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0734242X12448512">Disfani et al. (2011a)</xref> reported an organic content of 1.3% for fine recycled glass. The Australian Standard (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0734242X12448512">Standards Australia, 1997</xref>) is for weight loss on heating to be less than 5%, thus the glass sample is well within the standard.</p>
<p>An alternative test for organics is to ensure that the colour of the extract is not darker than the colour of the solution being used to perform the extraction. Since the blank water, acid and base solutions were all colourless, this means that none of the extracts should show any colour. Testing of the extracts by ultraviolet spectroscopy against the water blanks showed zero colour in all three extracts indicating the absence of any extractable organic material.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0734242X12448512">
<title>Surfactant</title>
<p>Surfactants are compounds that lower the surface tension of a liquid, allowing easier spreading, and lowering of the interfacial tension between two liquids, or between a liquid and a solid. Australian Standards does not require measurement of surfactant content for recycled crushed glass; however the presence of surfactants can be particularly problematic as they can act as enhancers for other contaminants. The surfactant level of water prior to contact with the samples was 72 mN m<sup>−1</sup> and the same value was obtained in all the water, acid and base extracts; indicating that there was no significant surfactant levels extracted from the recycled glass samples.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Recycled crushed glass is a waste material that can be used for different engineering applications, particularly as a construction aggregate. In this paper the authors report on a study of possible environmental impacts from storing and using glass cullet in construction in the state of Victoria, Australia. Leachate from waste glass stockpiles was sampled and analyses conducted of selected contaminants; results were compared with state EPA Victoria Guidelines or national Australian Standards (wherever available). Furthermore, due to limited availability the test results for some parameters were compared with other relevant published test results.</p>
<p>Conductivity, pH values, most heavy metals, organic and inorganic material (sulfate and chloride) contents were found to be within acceptable limits for extracts into water, acid and base. However, iron content in acid-extracted samples was above the acceptable limits and should be monitored if crushed glass is used for any practical applications where there is potential to contaminate the ambient environment. Iron content in normal water extracts remained well under acceptable limits. The inorganic content (chloride and sulfate) was also within the acceptable limits. There is no specified limit in Victoria for surfactant levels within crushed glass. However, surfactant levels of extracts (acid, water and base) after leaching were found to be same as surfactant levels of raw extracts before mixing. Therefore, there will be no issue with the use of recycled glass in regards to surface tension property of the ambient environment. A few of the measured values are noted to be near to the specified limits. The authors conclude that this does not necessarily mean that the same concentrations of contaminants will be leached out to the ambient environment, as often contaminants present are being diluted (as it spreads to a wider area/volume). Moreover, these levels of contaminant are expected only from the first flush. After couple of flushes, levels of contaminant are expected to be much lower because of wash-off effects. Therefore it can be concluded that recycled crushed glass is a viable material to be used as an aggregate in pavement sub-base without posing an undue risk of environmental contamination.</p>
