<p>Jean Baptiste Girard once said, “By words we learn thoughts, and by thoughts we learn life.” Sociologists have studied words to understand social life for a long time, more or less since the beginning of the discipline. Efforts to analyze words and narratives systematically and rigorously, however, are much more recent. Such efforts often involve using computers to assist analyses, with computer programs collectively known as Qualitative Data Analysis Software (QDAS) or Computer Assisted Qualitative Data Analysis Software (CAQDAS). However, words and narratives can also be analyzed beyond using mere interpretive methods via Quantitative Narrative Analysis (QNA). By “words and narratives” we mean responses from open-ended, ethnographic interviews and writings in newspapers and other forms of publications that often help form part of collective memory.</p>
<p>The lead section in Volume 42 presents a symposium titled “Words, Narratives, Analyses, Agency” that deals with the twin themes of assessing the efficacy of CAQDAS and the measurement of agency. Human agency is an important, and hot, sociological concept, popping up with regular frequencies in hallway conversations among graduate students and in formal academic presentations and writings. Agency is typically understood interpretively in the social sciences, subject to possible confusions among interpreters. In “Ways of Measuring Agency: An Application of Quantitative Narrative Analysis to Lynchings in Georgia, (1875–1930),” Roberto Franzosi, Gianluca De Fazio, and Stefania Vicari propose an actor-centered, relational understanding of agency, with its operationalization and measurement assisted by QNA. As an empirical example, they apply the approach to newspaper lynching stories in Georgia and contrast this quantitative method of analysis with discourse analysis—a popular qualitative method of analyzing narratives.</p>
<p>If QNA is one approach to analyzing words and narratives more systematically and, shall we say, more rigorously, CAQDAS represents another, even though its core is not quantitative in nature. Versions of CAQDAS have been around for the past three decades for assisting content analysis, discourse analysis, grounded theory analysis, and mixed-method projects (e.g., the first version ATLAS, 1989; the first version NUD*DIST, 1981; the first version of winMAX, 1989). Many of these have evolved into more developed forms (e.g., winMAX into MAXQDA, ATLAS into ATLAS.ti, and NUD*DIST into NVivo). Given its longevity, how successful or effective is CAQDAS as an analytic tool? Michael White, Maya Judd, and Simone Poliandri examine in “Illumination with a Dim Bulb? What Do Social Scientists Learn by Employing Qualitative Data Analysis Software (QDAS) in the Service of Multimethod Designs?” both gains and pitfalls in the application of QDAS in mixed-method research through their own low fertility project in Italy and offer some insights and recommendations for the application of QDAS/CAQDAS in mixed-methods research.</p>
<p>These two articles are indeed ambitious contributions to sociological methodology. To help gauge the contributions and initiate a healthy dialogue on these important topics, we invited scholars who have expertise in the various areas of narrative analysis, agency, and other aspects of the two papers to offer comments. We are fortunate to have gathered some commentaries for each—by Andrew Junker, Roel Popping, and Stewart Tolnay on the paper on the measurement of agency via QNA and by Pat Bazeley, Roberto Franzosi, Graham Gibbs, and Andrew Junker on the paper on QDAS for mixed-methods research. The section concludes with the authors’ responses to the commentaries. It is my hope that, through the articles, commentaries, and rejoinders, our collective understanding of text/narrative analysis and of agency measurement will be richly enhanced.</p>
<p>The second section, “Neighborhoods and Structures,” comprises three articles. Spatial units such as neighborhoods create a social context that conditions and clusters individual choices and behaviors. The first paper in the section, “Methodological Issues in the Analysis of Residential Preferences, Residential Mobility, and Neighborhood Change” by Elizabeth Bruch and Robert Mare, assesses methods for analyzing residential preferences and choices, discusses problems with residential mobility data, and examines the link between residential mobility and neighborhood change. The second paper in the section, “Macrostructure from Microstructure: Generating Whole Systems from Ego Networks” by Jeffrey Smith, is also about linked individuals, though in this case they are related by social networks instead of neighborhoods. The paper presents a simulation method to make global network inference from sample data by using exponential random graph models. These models, as the author suggests, allow the modeler to reconstruct features of the true, unmeasured network. Network samples contain substantively illuminating information about network structures. It is particularly useful to sample from a network when traditional sampling approaches fail, using methods such as respondent-driven sampling (RDS), a topic discussed in the previous two volumes of <italic>Sociological Methodology</italic>. Ted Mouw and Ashton Verdery, the authors of the final paper in the section, “Network Sampling with Memory: A Proposal for More Efficient Sampling from Social Networks,” propose an alternative method to more conventional methods including RDS, with the benefit of reduced design effect.</p>
<p>Three papers are included in the third section, “Inference and Causality.” Log-linear models are sociology’s contribution to statistical methodology. While these models are typically applied to cross-classified data summarized by contingency tables with only associations between variables analyzed, Kazuo Yamaguchi, in “Log-linear Causal Analysis of Cross-classified Categorical Data,” introduces a causal analysis based on an adjusted cross-classified frequency table that reflects the effects of categorical variable <italic>X</italic> on categorical variable <italic>Y</italic> that would be realized after eliminating selection bias in the effects of <italic>X</italic> on <italic>Y</italic> generated by confounding covariates <bold>V</bold>. It is a common practice to compare nested logit and probit models to see whether their coefficient estimates change significantly. However, the change in the estimate of the variable of interest in such models, unlike linear models, cannot be straightforwardly attributed to confounding variables. In “Comparing Regression Coefficients Between Same-sample Nested Models Using Logit and Probit: A New Method,” Kristian Karlson, Anders Holm, and Richard Breen describe a solution allowing researchers to assess the influence of confounding relative to that of rescaling and to assess the significance of confounding. Much sociological research is concerned with the differential effects of individual background. However, treatment effects may systematically differ by the propensity of treatment. The third article, “Estimating Heterogeneous Treatment Effects with Observational Data” by Yu Xie, Jennie Brand, and Ben Jann, examines a practical approach to studying such heterogeneous treatment effects as a function of the treatment propensity, under the same ignorability assumption commonly underlying regression analysis.</p>
<p>The final section, titled “Measurement,” contains two papers. Coding and reliability are important measurement issues in sociological analysis. Group interaction presents a challenge for intercoder reliability. In “Developing and Assessing Inter-coder Reliability in Studies of Group Interaction,” D’Lane Compton, Tony Love, and Jane Sell discuss how pretesting can solve many coding and reliability issues prior to researchers’ embarking on data collection and analysis. Inequality and stratification are two prominent features of society, past and present. They are related but distinct conceptually and phenomenally. Thus, it is desirable to measure them separately. Xiang Zhou, in “A Nonparametric Index of Stratification,” develops a new nonparametric index of stratification that distinguishes itself from an inequality measure and shows that there exists a general measure of differentiation under which both the Gini and the proposed stratification index can be subsumed as special cases. This section completes an exciting selection of important contributions to sociological methodology published in Volume 42.</p>
<p>The editorial office and I are grateful to the authors who submitted papers to us whether or not their papers are included in the volume as well as to the reviewers whose careful, hard, and thankless work guaranteed the high quality of the published work that appears in this volume. I would like to thank in particular my managing editor Lisa Savage for her consistency and reliability. My thanks also go to student editorial assistants Andrea Wilbon Hartman and Stephanie Rieder, copy editor Stephanie Magean and the copy editors of SAGE, and Athena Liao, whose design graces the cover. My appreciation is due as well to Jim Ballinger and Jennifer Stephenson of SAGE, who assisted us with the publisher transition, and to Janine Chiappa McKenna, Karen Edwards, and the Publications Committee of the American Sociological Association for their continuing support. Finally, we wish to acknowledge the material support from the Department of Sociology and the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign where our editorial office is housed.</p>
