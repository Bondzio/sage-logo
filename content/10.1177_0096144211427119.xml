<p>Using the post-war industrial landscape of metropolitan Philadelphia as a case study, this special section of the <italic>Journal of Urban History</italic> examines the making and meaning of residentially integrated space in the latter half of the twentieth century. These three projects (Abigail Perkiss’ “Managed Diversity;” James Wolfinger’s “The American Dream for All Americans;” and Cheryl Greenburg’s “Liberal NIMBY”) look at racial integration not as an idealized form of racial justice, nor as a fleeting notion of residential life doomed for failure. Writing at the intersection of the historiographies on the American urban experience and the northern civil rights struggle, these scholars push beyond the historic notion that integration was the period between the first black family moving into a neighborhood and the last white family moving out, to examine residential integration as an historic process, a political objective, and a cultural experience.</p>

<p>In May 1967, George Schermer, a specialist in urban social problems, came to Philadelphia to participate in a panel discussion on the future of racial integration. The trip took the Washington, D.C.–based consultant back to the place he had called home for more than ten years. Schermer had moved to Philadelphia from Detroit, Michigan, in 1953 to serve as the director of the city’s newly formed Commission on Human Relations. At the same time, he began working in his own neighborhood as part of a grassroots movement to implement a liberal vision of an economically stable, racially integrated community. Reflecting on the success of that integration project they had embarked on nearly fifteen years earlier, he spoke of the way his community elected to allocate financial resources and residential muscle. “The amount of busing it would take would be beyond belief,” he said of the prospect of integration. “Instead,” said Schermer, “we did it with moving vans.”</p>
<p>There was a moment in the middle of the twentieth century where the conversations over the meaning of racial justice coalesced into a widespread liberal consensus. As World War II faded into the country’s collective memory and Americans entered a new postwar culture, fresh conceptions of racial identity swirled through the national imagination. The war had pushed the fight for racial justice into the public consciousness in unprecedented ways. The publication of Gunnar Myrdal’s <italic>An American Dilemma</italic> came on the heels of calls from African Americans for a “Double V” Victory against fascism abroad and racism at home. Quickly, discussions moved beyond the rhetoric of abstract racial equality toward a concrete conception of racial integration. In the wake of the Second World War, there emerged a widespread coalition of liberal middle-class Americans who believed that integration was to become synonymous with racial justice.</p>
<p>As a national Civil Rights Movement came together, however, this notion of integration became bound by regional, economic, and racial boundaries. Southerners watched the fight for integration play out in the courts, where parties vied for control over the racial landscape of public space. In the North, liberal whites and African Americans worked to craft a spatial and cultural definition of integration that would be effectuated residentially, socially, and politically. As Americans watched this experiment spread unevenly across the urban North, interracial living became hotly contested terrain. Quickly, groups of white homeowners rose up, decrying neighborhood integration as antithetical to the American ideal; people should have the right to choose their neighbors, they maintained. A push toward integration in the private sphere called into question the historic primacy of property rights and the national mythology of liberty and freedom. At the same time, groups of African Americans arose condemning a reality of integration that had become bound by economic contingency; class-based exclusivity, it seemed, had become a necessary precursor to racial inclusivity.</p>
<p>Using the postwar industrial landscape of metropolitan Philadelphia as a case study, the three works in this special section of the <italic>Journal of Urban History</italic> seek to examine the making and meaning of integrated space in the latter half of the twentieth century. These projects look at racial integration not as an idealized form of racial justice, nor as a fleeting notion of residential life doomed for failure. Writing at the intersection of the historiographies on the American urban experience and the northern civil rights struggle, these scholars push beyond the historic notion that integration was the period between the first black family moving into a neighborhood and the last white family moving out, to examine residential integration as an historic process, a political objective, and a cultural experience.</p>
<p>Abigail Perkiss, in “Managed Diversity: Contested Meanings of Integration in Postwar Philadelphia,” examines the implications for the disparate understandings of integrated space among black and white homeowners even in northwest Philadelphia’s West Mount Airy, a community that professed residential integration as its institutional mandate. James Wolfinger, in “The American Dream—For All Americans,” uses efforts to break down Levittown’s racial barriers as a lens through which to explore conflicting notions of suburban space, civil rights, and the limited utility of liberalism to address racial discrimination. Finally, Cheryl Greenberg’s “Liberal NIMBY: American Jews and Civil Rights” looks at residential patterns of American Jews to analyze the tensions between integration as political action and integration as lived experience for a quintessentially liberal white community.</p>
<p>Taken together, these articles serve to push open the field of integration studies, examining the problem of integration within the context of race, class, urbanity, political orientation, and ethnic identity. By positioning integration broadly within the postwar landscape, these pieces work to understand how the potential for integrated space interacted with broader cultural and institutional forces that came together to create structural change. These works seek to begin to explore how scholars might use the framework of racial integration—rather than of segregation, alienation, violence, or flight—to understand the relationship between race and power in American cities.</p>
