<abstract>
<p>Endō Shūsaku and Rowan Williams offer us crucial insights into the meaning of being truly human by paying special attention to the vulnerability and fallibility of human existence. They show that everyday human experience, albeit fragmented and ambiguous, can be conceived as windows through which God’s light shines upon the dark chamber of our self-centred ego. For Endō, God’s grace is not sought apart from the chores of ordinary life, but with and through the traces engraved in the web of relationships and contingencies in this material world. Williams’ <italic>kenotic</italic> ontology of social exchange provides us with a wider theological background in which our experience of contingencies in the material world can be understood as God’s gift. Their rich reflections do indeed show us a way to live as corporeal creatures in the world of agony, ambiguity and uncertainty.</p>

<title>I. Introduction</title>
<p>This article will survey the way in which multifaceted webs of human relationships can serve as vessels of God’s grace and as <italic>loci</italic> for transforming the whole human self. By finding oneself within a corporeal pattern of mutual giving and receiving, one can be freed from the illusion of the autonomous self and experience God’s presence within the boundary of daily life. I will approach this theme by reading a Japanese Catholic novelist, Endō Shūsaku (1923-1996), alongside Rowan Williams (1950- ). This is not a mere comparative study between them; rather, I will pay more attention to Endō’s literature, and then enrich his view in light of William’s theology, seeking a proper language and grammar for unfolding the riddle of life.</p>
<p>Compared to Williams, Endō is less well-known to English-speaking countries, although his novels have a worldwide reputation and many have been translated into English.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0014524612470347">1</xref></sup> Because of his engagement with Catholicism and his distinctive view of the complexity of human existence, Endō has often been called the Japanese Graham Green, who himself praised Endō as the finest of living writers at the time.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0014524612470347">2</xref></sup> Endō’s books, such as <italic>Silence</italic> and <italic>Deep River</italic>, show his endeavour to do justice to both the Christian faith and his Japanese heritage, presenting a unique view of God’s grace and human experience of it. Endō’s genius can be found in his presentation of these rather overtly religious themes through the protagonist’s soul-seeking journey in ordinary life, thereby drawing readers to look deeply into their inner self.</p>
<p>Among living theologians, Williams pays special attention to human vulnerability and seeks God’s grace within the boundary of the fragmented life. His hesitation to offer a systematic account of theology, and the priority of life over idea in his thought, must be connected to his love for novels in the sense that this genre of writing is good at describing, and providing flexible tools for interpreting, the particularity and diverse modes of human living. However, despite his interest in non-theological genres of writing, as Rupert Shortt observes, Williams has a conviction that ‘theology should avoid endorsing any one kind of contemporary reasoning or intellectual system.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0014524612470347">3</xref></sup> This enables Williams to have a novelist’s insight into life with a theologian’s eye.</p>
<p>This article will show that Endō’s view of the gradual process of learning the complexity of human life, as related to the other and structured by grace, finds common affinity with Williams’ theology. It will further demonstrate that a new vision of moral agency is possible when one takes the corporeal connection to other people within a material world as the <italic>locus</italic> wherein a person <italic>kenotically</italic> moves out of the self-centred ego and comes to live a life of a ‘wonderful fool.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0014524612470347">4</xref></sup> I will finally show that this vision of the selfhood is accompanied by joy when seen within a wider framework of God’s taking up of humanity into the life of the Trinity.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0014524612470347">
<title>II. The Indelible Mark on the Body in Endō’s Literature</title>
<p>It is widely accepted that Endō’s <italic>oeuvre</italic> focuses on ‘how to make far-away Christianity something close.’ He often describes this task as ‘retailoring with my own hands the Western suit… into a Japanese garment that would fit my Japanese body.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0014524612470347">5</xref></sup> What previous commentary on Endō has not sufficiently emphasized, however, is that, in his retailored Christianity, sin is conceived in a remarkably new way, and that this difference serves as a crucial literary instrument for unfolding his idea of God’s grace. Endō has a deep interest in the evilness, fallibility and weakness of human beings, and thus the notion of sin and the idea of a potential brutality in the human condition play a vital role in constituting his narratives.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0014524612470347">6</xref></sup> The early Endō is especially concerned about the lack of sin-consciousness within Japanese culture, even questioning whether Christianity could bring a new moral sensitivity into Japan. Accordingly, his earlier work, such as <italic>Yellow Man</italic> (1957) and <italic>The Sea and Poison</italic> (1957), is characterized by a rather clear cut East/West dichotomy. Endō’s mature writing, however, undergoes a notable shift as he realized that it is nearly impossible to introduce the Christian idea of the transcendent God to polytheistic Japanese culture, in which images of caring and intimate gods are more dominant.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0014524612470347">7</xref></sup> Accordingly, he painstakingly shapes a new image of Jesus, not as a glorious victor, but as the eternal companion,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0014524612470347">8</xref></sup> who understands our weakness and shares our agony in his equally, or even more, inept and vulnerable life. It follows that human fallibility and weakness are key themes for depicting both the human tragic situation and the possibility of salvation.</p>
<sec id="section3-0014524612470347">
<title>The Wound of Memory and the Scar on the Body</title>
<p>Most of Endō’s protagonists initially strive for what is socially successful, ethically right or religiously orthodox. However, they go on to discover what being truly human is by exploring their situatedness within multi-layered webs of relationships in which their judgment of what is right and wrong is seriously called into question. It follows that salvation cannot be understood in separation from the discovery of one’s location within the mutual influence and dependence upon the other.</p>
<p>It is noteworthy that this relational nature of humanity is often described in Endō’s novels by the image of wound, spot or scar. These marks embody the memory of one’s irreducible relationship with the other, serving as a constant reminder of one’s own traces left on others and also of the others’ impact on oneself. By realizing through these marks that the life of a person can never be completely self-contained, his protagonists probe the riddle of ordinary experience, and eventually open themselves to radically new possibilities of life. For example, Suguro, the protagonist of Endō’s short story <italic>A Forty-Year-Old Man</italic> (1964), has an affair with his wife’s cousin, while his wife is hospitalized, and they secretly abort the pregnancy. Oppressed by guilt, Suguro even goes to church to make a confession, but it does not help to make sense of his fractured life. Before having a risky lung surgery, he reflects deeply on his life and his relationship with the two women.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0014524612470347">9</xref></sup> He then says in his extreme weakness and anxiety: ‘I don’t want to die!… I still don’t know what life means, what is to be a human being…. But… I have finally learned that when one person comes into contact with another, it is no simple encounter – there is always some sort of scar left behind.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0014524612470347">10</xref></sup> During the operation his heart stops for a few seconds, but he miraculously returns to life, symbolizing the death of his old self and the initiation of a new life. This illuminating story ends with Suguro’s conversation with his wife when he is discharged from the hospital. He acknowledges that she has been aware of his affair, but goes back home with her without any comment on it. The conclusion hints at his appreciation of ineradicable guilt and uncertainty he has to endure throughout his newly given life. His wounds after surgery bear this perplexity of life, reminding that he could be truly human when he was completely broken and vulnerable.</p>
<p>When Suguro is eagerly seeking an answer to his own anxiety and guilt, however, God does not interrupt his life to save him. For Endō, the idea of silence is used to capture our ambiguous existence within the boundary of finite and even meaningless life. Although God’s silence has been understood as a central theme in his writings, Endō himself noted that God never remained silent in his literature; rather, there was a ‘voice in the silence,’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0014524612470347">11</xref></sup> and this silence is God’s unique mode of talking to and accompanying humanity. Especially, indelible marks which are left on their bodies are what commonly drive Endō’s protagonists to be attentive to God’s voice in silence. In other words, God’s silence is Endō’s key metaphor for describing the eruption of God’s grace in everyday life, and the image of the scar is that of God trying to break though the mortal silence.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0014524612470347">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>Endō’s novels offer various images of the trace, wound, or scar, a doorway into which the protagonist goes deeply into his/her undiscovered self, discovering there a complex web of relation and hearing God’s silent voice. The mark not only prevents the protagonist from retreating into one’s own secure self or conventional understanding of humanity. It also shows that God’s grace operates within embodied patterns of self-giving and self-receiving, freeing us from the fantasy of self-centeredness. The genius of Endō can be found in his skilful reinterpretation of central ideas of Christianity – especially Christ’s salvific work, by using the varied metaphor of the mark.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0014524612470347">
<title>The Ineradicable Mark Left by Christ</title>
<p>For Endō, fundamental sociality precedes one’s own deliberative decision and act. The protagonists’ acknowledgement of their irreducible relationality is initiated by Christ-like figures, whom Endō visualizes as ordinary, powerless and even ugly. Their ineptness and unattractiveness challenge and subvert the protagonists’ self-destructive longings for beauty, success and security.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0014524612470347">13</xref></sup> These Christ-like figures exert a continued influence, albeit most of them die or disappear in unexpected manners, in that they leave indelible marks on others’ life.</p>
<p>Endō’s novel, <italic>The Girl I Left Behind</italic> (1964), presents a beautiful example of a Christ-like person. The main character, Yoshioka, is a poor but success-oriented person, but through his encounter with Mitsu, the way to conceive of the meaning of life slowly changes. He first meets this ugly and poor girl as merely fulfilling his sexual desire, and then marries a daughter of a wealthy man. Yoshika, however, is often haunted by the memory of a dark spot near Mitsu’s wrist which he discovered when they first slept together. Yoshika later receives a letter which reports Mitsu’s self-sacrificing love and death for people with Hansen’s disease. Reflecting the presence of this totally strange girl in his life, Yoshika says: ‘If Mitsu had taught me anything at all, it was that every single person with whom we cross paths during our journey through life leaves an indelible mark on us. So does loneliness stem from such marks? Furthermore, if [God]… truly exists, does He speak to us through these marks? But still I have to ask, what was the source of my loneliness.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0014524612470347">14</xref></sup> Here Endō captures the uncertainty and insecurity caused by one’s experience of grace through a Christ-like figure. This is not a dramatic moment of enlightening, but a slow progress of realization characterized by lonesomeness. Yoshika, nevertheless, cannot be simply despairing in the face of this mystery of life, because while God’s grace does not come to us to eradicate our anxiety or loneliness, it enables us to embrace and live with them.</p>
<p>As shown, the main role of a Christ-like figure in Endō’s novels is to leave behind an ineradicable trace through some continued failure or meaningless sacrifice, thereby bringing about a vision of a totally different existence and increasing an awareness of a greater complexity in being human.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0014524612470347">15</xref></sup> Endō’s Christ-like figure is usually someone who is betrayed or abandoned because of his or her ugliness, ineptness and unsocial behaviour. A Christ-like character, thus, evokes a consciousness of guilt which Endō understands as essential to being truly human. He explains one of his earliest Christ-figure as follows: ‘Mitsu can be seen as modelled on Jesus, abandoned by his own disciples; she is modelled on the Jesus whom all Christians are guilty of abandoning on a daily basis in their everyday lives.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0014524612470347">16</xref></sup> Our uneasy relationship with others is generally crystallized in Endō by the protagonist’s betrayal or mistreatment of a Christ-like person, who has ‘no beauty that we should desire him’ (Isaiah 53:2).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0014524612470347">17</xref></sup> However, the sorrow, grief and suffering of a Christ-like person leave a deep-seated mark on others. Thus, an encounter with a Christ-like figure evokes a transformative sense of guilt, a sensitive wound which displaces the self-centred ego, makes a person susceptible to the brokenness of life, and changes him or her to be a recipient of grace.</p>
<p>The process of appreciating grace through one’s vulnerable body, perplexing relationships and guilty memory is somewhat painful, unwelcoming, and even humiliating. Nevertheless, it is a crack in our conventional lifestyle that is made by God’s silent voice in our encounter with someone’s Christ-like life. This gracious voice enables us to gradually realize solidarity with others, especially those who suffer, thereby constituting a <italic>pre-reflexive</italic> basis for Christ-like being and act. In this respect, to be guilty is another aspect of being responsible, and this duality constitutes Endō’s unique view of a sanctified life.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0014524612470347">
<title>Acknowledging Responsibility through the Mark</title>
<p>Endō’s literature is in some sense his study of how to live a truly human life. His moral reflection is based on one’s concrete and non-reducible relation to a specific other, as realized by one’s <italic>kenotic</italic> dethronement of the ego. In this way, his mature work increases his concern for an ethically oriented life as one embodying the fate and life of Jesus. Especially, he links moral sensitivity with guilt in a remarkable way, using the image of the mark.</p>
<p>The Christ-like figure of <italic>The Girl I Left Behind</italic>, Mitsu, is a poor girl from the countryside who works hard at a factory to buy new clothes to date a selfish college student, Yoshioka. On the way to a shop, however, she meets the wife and children of her colleague, Taguchi, an irresponsible person who usually spends his income on gambling. Although they urgently need money, Mitsu tries to ignore them at first. When dust in the wind blurs her vision, the sad face with compassionate eyes appears in her unclear sight. She, then, hears the voice of this man:
<disp-quote>
<p>Won’t you turn back? That money you’ve got would really help those children and that mother.</p>
<p>But…. Mitsu tried desperately to resist that voice. But, I worked hard every night….</p>
<p>I know. The voice replied sadly. I know. I know just how much you want that cardigan and how hard you’ve worked for it. And that is why I’m asking you….</p>
<p>Why should I? After all, it’s Taguchi-san’s responsibility.</p>
<p>There’s something more important than responsibility. The important thing in this life is to link your sadness to the sadness of others. That is the significance of my cross.</p>
<p>Mitsu could not fully understand the meaning of this last comment. But the image of the small red spot on the side of the mouth of that child…tore at her heart…. Slowly but surely, that red spot was proving more than she could bear.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0014524612470347">18</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The voice persuades Mitsu to appreciate her unbreakable connectedness to others, especially those who are in need and agony. It does not clearly explain why she has to sacrifice herself, but it still demands a completely different mode of life seen from the viewpoint of Christ’s self-sacrificial life and death. Moral agency is possible here by the crucifixion of the self-centred ego and by extending the self towards the suffering other. A possibility of ethically oriented life arises from this christologically perceived web of self-giving and -receiving; this possibility is beyond one’s logical understanding of moral ground, or a legal conception of responsibility. It is the image of the spot that communicates a sort of unconditional ethical demand to Mitsu in a form of gracious persuasion. It encourages her to make the sadness of the other as her own, to transcend her own wish and desire, to embody Jesus’ unconditional love in her life, and to be transformed into a Christ-like person. Accordingly, although nearly every episode of Mitsu is marked by tragic events, one may find indelible traces of hope she ‘left behind’ in this novel.</p>
<p>Endō’s famous novel, <italic>Silence</italic> (1966), adds a new tone to the idea of a responsible act in relation to sin. Rodrigues is a young Portuguese Jesuit missionary in the 17<sup>th</sup> century. He sneaks into Japan in the time of systematic persecution, but he is soon captured by soldiers. He is required to apostatize by stepping on the <italic>fumie</italic>, a small copper plank on which Christ’s countenance is portrayed, but he sternly refuses it and awaits the martyrdom. Alluding to the night when Jesus was captured, Endō depicts Rodrigues’ struggle to pray as Jesus did, but his prayer remains totally empty. This young priest, then, slowly realizes that life is a complex web of relation, and thus ‘“[s]in… is not what it is usually thought to be; it is not to steal and tell lies. Sin is for one man to walk brutally over the life of another and to be quite oblivious of the wounds he has left behind.” And then for the first time a real prayer rose up in his heart.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0014524612470347">19</xref></sup> Rodrigues’ acknowledgment of the mark he has left on innocent and poor Japanese peasants eventually results in his public apostasy in order to save their lives. Here one may see the paradox of sin: Rodrigues commits the sin of apostasy by evading the sin of forgetting the scar on others’ lives.</p>
<p>This radical re-conception of sin allows Rodrigues to encounter Jesus for the first time at the moment of his public apostasy. The renewed realization of being truly human is accompanied by the experience of grace, but grace comes to him as a total negation of his lifelong desire to be a faithful servant of the Lord and to perceive Christ’s glorious face. As he steps his foot on the ugly image of Jesus, he hears the voice: ‘Trample! Trample! I more than anyone know of the pain in your foot. Trample! It was to be trampled on by men that I was born into this world. It was to share men’s pain that I carried my cross.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0014524612470347">20</xref></sup> However, this permission is only heard by Rodrigues,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0014524612470347">21</xref></sup> and thus other people can never understand that his apostasy is a way to participate in Jesus’ self-sacrificing ministry. Instead, what awaits Rodrigues is a life marked by humiliation and suspicion. After apostasy, Rodrigues has to work for the Japanese government and marries a Japanese widow, using her ex-husband’s name. Noteworthy, however, are the indelible scars on his ears, which imply that he must have reasserted his faith and then been tortured to renounce it again.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0014524612470347">22</xref></sup> Rodrigues has to continue his life journey by bearing these indelible wounds. The apostate priest, nevertheless, says without any hesitation that he could love Christ in a different way than he had before.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0014524612470347">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although Rodrigues encounters Jesus by reflecting the mark he left behind, can we simply say his apostasy is a responsible act?<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0014524612470347">24</xref></sup> Unlike Mitsu, Rodrigues does not have a chance to finish his life in a culmination of self-sacrificial love; rather, his transfiguration into a Christ-like person turns out to be his transformation into a renegade priest. In this sense, the real challenge of Endō is not merely his radical vision of the vulnerable Godhead as the eternal companion, but a disturbing possibility that even the renouncing of one’s faith can be ethical and faithful. Endō’s redefinition of sin demands us to re-think what is virtuous, responsible and moral, not from a dogmatic viewpoint, but from a question as to what the cross truly means in one’s own specific time and space. Endō makes us more sensitive to the tragic limitation of our thought and action, yet he still urges us to act positively within the world of mutual influence and to recommit ourselves to the brokenness of human existence. The experience of grace does not liberate the protagonist from guilt, doubt and ambiguity. One has to suffer rejection, failure and humiliation, but this is a way to live according to the embodied patterns of God’s <italic>kenotic</italic> accompaniment with vulnerable and fallible human beings.</p>
<p>To conclude, Endō’s main characters begin as satisfied individuals with conventional, power-seeking or success-oriented lives, so they at first resist and ignore abrupt changes caused by others. Indelible marks, however, constantly disturb them, gradually disarming their fantasies of success and security, and increasing their moral sensitivity. It eventually leads to their discovering themselves interwoven in a network of vulnerable creatures, and enables them to free their suppressed responsible and caring <italic>personas</italic>. For Endō, accordingly, God’s grace is not sought apart from the chores of everyday life, but with and through the traces engraved in the web of relationships and contingencies in this material world. In my eyes, nevertheless, a weakness of Endō’s view can be found in his excessive emphasis upon sadness and ambiguity to the extent of silencing ‘joy’ that arises from genuine fellowship and solidarity. It is little wonder that, despite Endō’s rich reflection upon the corporeal nature of relationship, his work links sexuality mostly with guilt, rather than a source of joy.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0014524612470347">25</xref></sup> I now turn to Williams’ theology of grace, in which a more robust theological ontology of social exchange makes room for conceiving our broken existence as <italic>gift</italic>.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0014524612470347">
<title>III. The Fragility of Grace and the Joy of Creatureliness in Rowan Williams</title>
<p>It is beyond this essay’s purpose and scope to thoroughly investigate this living theologian, so I will mainly focus on how Williams’s thought can complement and improve Endō’s idea on the experience of grace within the world of wounds, marks, and spots. For Williams, in a similar vein to Endō, grace generates true life by stripping away the illusion of the self-contained self and frees one from the fear of losing oneself. Grace draws men and women into an economy of giving and receiving that mirrors the intra-divine fellowship and God’s self-giving in Jesus Christ. This <italic>theological</italic> ontology of social exchange proposes that being fully human is a process of lifelong learning through gradual discovery of oneself within the life of the Trinity as well as within a complex network of corporeal relationships.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0014524612470347">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>Like Endō, Williams conceives of the finiteness of human existence as the boundary within which grace shapes our identity as God’s creatures.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0014524612470347">27</xref></sup> As Shortt says, for Williams, ‘[H]oliness is often prosaic… The reverse of this is the fantasy of always wanting to be elsewhere or to transform one’s circumstances.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0014524612470347">28</xref></sup> As bodily beings in a finite world, our thinking and acting are inevitably constrained, but God’s grace does not make us escape from our materiality, but accept our <italic>incompleteness</italic>, pointing to the wholeness of our existence as a unity of soul and body and to a deeper background in which our seemingly meaningless life can make a better sense. In this sense, salvation does not mean that the soul is liberated from its body, but that the body becomes more besouled and thus fully relational in this material world. God enters into a material world of confusion and ambiguity, as revealed in Christ’s incarnation, working in and through the contradictions and brokenness of God’s beloved creatures.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0014524612470347">29</xref></sup></p>
<p>At this point, I propose, Williams’s connection between creation, incarnation and grace offers a deeply suggestive and positive view of the corporeal nature of redemption. God’s creation of humanity and Christ’s incarnation illustrate a corporeal pattern of redemption, through which a human person ‘enters into the body’s grace.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0014524612470347">30</xref></sup> Grace draws us into God’s <italic>desired</italic> world and makes us realize that we are <italic>desired</italic> by someone who is greater and more attractive than we are alone. This is the basis upon which we reach and connect to each other, giving and receiving our corporeal life as a source of mutual joy. Williams writes:
<disp-quote>
<p>The whole story of creation, incarnation and our incorporation into Christ’s body tells us that God desires us <italic>as if we were God</italic>….We are created so that we may be caught up in [the life of the Trinity], so that we may grow into the wholehearted love of God by learning that God loves us as God loves God…. The life of the Christian community has… the task of teaching us this: so ordering our relations that human beings may see themselves as desired, as the occasion of joy.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0014524612470347">31</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Here the language of desire not only shows the relational structure of humanity, but also constitutes the context in which our desire is educated, purified and rightly directed.</p>
<p>A human person takes a ‘risk’ when dislocating the ego and entering into the body’s grace. Grace’s disarmament of the illusory view of the self may appear as a kind of forced resignation of what a person wills, but it is in fact the sanctification of desire by the triune God, resulting in ‘a life of <italic>repentance in hope</italic>.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0014524612470347">32</xref></sup> If one’s body is to be desired, one needs to ‘bring the body into the shared world of language and (in the widest sense) “intercourse”.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0014524612470347">33</xref></sup> Although this dangerous disposition opens oneself to the eruption of grace and discloses one’s solidarity with others, it obviously involves vulnerability and real risk at the heart of one’s embodied existence. This danger is none other than, as Mike Higton says, “a willingness to be corrected and judged, and to find that our seeing has hitherto been distorted by our own selfishness and the selfishness of others.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0014524612470347">34</xref></sup> However, insofar as we are enslaved by the illusory viewpoint of the ego, we attempt to avoid this strangeness of grace.</p>
<p>At this point, for Williams, the Spirit’s salvific presence is particularly important in this material world, where we are under God’s gracious attack. While one is exposed to the other’s intrusion, the Spirit accompanies each person in contingencies, not abolishing horror and frustration, but enabling one to endure suffering and to live with ambiguity without illusion.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0014524612470347">35</xref></sup> Williams writes, ‘the Spirit’s witness is not a pointing to the Son outside the human world, it is precisely the formation of ‘Son-like’ life in the human world.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0014524612470347">36</xref></sup> The Spirit’s work is to call us into a Christ-like life not by transcending the limit of creaturely existence, but by accepting that limit as God’s gift and enjoying it as the cause of joy. In this respect, Williams’ theology does not impose an alien source of hope on one’s life,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0014524612470347">37</xref></sup> but invites one to discover hope embedded in one’s corporeal connection to the others and to the outer world, in which God’s grace calls us to be fully human.</p>
<p>In short, Williams’s theology pays special attention to how to overcome the fantasy of the autonomous and self-satisfied ego. Instead of using grace as an abstract conceptual weapon to attack the fantasy, he conceives of it in a <italic>therapeutic</italic> way by placing human desire within an integrative framework of God’s creation, incarnation and salvation. As Benjamin Myers rightly captures, this vision is Williams’s attempt to respond to the problem of his time and place– ‘the poison of a ruthless and decadent self-centredness.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0014524612470347">38</xref></sup> For this, Williams offers an ontology of <italic>kenosis</italic> to appreciate life as the economy of mutual giving and receiving. In this web of sociality, God’s self-sacrificing love transforms a person into a participant of the body of Christ by emptying one’s own selfish desire and letting oneself to be an occasion of the other’s joy. This <italic>kenotic</italic> social exchange certainly involves spontaneous joy, but it is not aroused by the gratification or projection of one’s own desire; rather, it can be found when one’s self-satisfying desire extinguishes and thus one achieves a sanctified capacity to listen and to see the objectivity of the other.</p>

<title>IV. Conclusion: Holy Living as Self-emptying Attentiveness to the Mark</title>
<p>Endō and Williams offer us invaluable insights into the meaning of being truly human. Endō suggests in a remarkable way that our memory is engraved on our vulnerable body as the <italic>locus</italic> where God’s grace enters into and transforms our daily life. Williams provides us with a wider theological background in which our experience of contingencies in the material world can be understood as God’s gift. In particular, his view of the body’s grace convincingly shows that the experience of grace is often accompanied by sadness, unintelligibility, or suffering, a <italic>costly</italic> price one has to endure to show how one can be truly human. It, nevertheless, allows us to understand grace in terms of process, relation and joy.</p>
<p>Seeing grace in this way, everyday human experience, albeit fragmented and ambiguous, can become windows through which God’s light shines upon the dark chamber of our self-centred ego. Of course, it is a risky and unpleasant business to behold the brokenness of our life without veiling it with the fantasy of security, success and self-satisfaction. But there is no justifiable way to keep us safe from this reality. By becoming more attentive to the corporeal pattern of social exchange, which Endō’s metaphor of the mark beautifully expresses, and which Williams’ <italic>kenotic</italic> ontology insightfully demonstrates, we can realize our relational natures and become responsible <italic>personas</italic> on the one hand, and open ourselves to the eruption of God’s grace which comes to our daily life in an unexpected manner on the other. These writers’ rich reflections do indeed show us a way to live as corporeal creatures in the world of agony, ambiguity and uncertainty.</p>

<title>The Genre and Interpretation of Paul’s Letters</title>
<p>Patrick Gray, <italic>Opening Paul’s Letters: A Reader’s Guide to Genre and Interpretation</italic> (Grand Rapids: Baker Academic, 2012. $19.99. pp. x + 176. ISBN: 978-0-8010-3922-5).</p>
<p>The premise of Patrick Gray’s book is that before readers can be in a position to understand Paul’s theology, they must understand something very basic about the Pauline writings: they are letters. Serious study of Paul as a letter-writer began only in the last century or so, and a large amount of the work published in this area has been quite technical. Gray addresses subjects and strategies germane to the interpretation of Paul’s letters, and his precision and clarity make this work perhaps the first one in this specific field that is suitable for the beginning student.</p>
<p>The work is composed of an introduction that highlights the importance of literary analysis, six primary chapters, a brief epilogue on letters in early Christianity that Paul did not write, and two helpful appendices: one on dating the Pauline letters and one on defining authorship. Each of the primary chapters concludes with a short list of discussion questions and a select bibliography for those who desire to pursue the topic of the chapter further.</p>
<p>In chapter one, Gray surveys a small selection of concepts from the Greco-Roman milieu in which Christianity emerged and demonstrates their significance for understanding Paul’s letters. While showing that the broader cultural background can clarify Paul’s letters, he also warns that ‘it is possible to read too much into the similarities and points of contact between Paul and his contemporaries’ (p. 34). In the following chapter, Gray surveys the range of letter genres and subgenres available to Paul and considers possible classifications for each of the Pauline letters. Chapter three focuses on the rhetoric and formal structure of Paul’s letters. Again, Gray offers a balanced discussion; he points to the advantages of some types of rhetorical analysis, while insisting that some interpreters ‘go overboard in their “discovery” of elaborate rhetorical or structural patterns that purportedly hold the key to unlocking Paul’s arguments’ (p. 90). In the fourth chapter, Gray suggests that paying attention to the original audience of a letter gives the modern reader sharper insights into what Paul was attempting to communicate. Chapter five highlights how Paul’s habits as a reader of the OT influenced his writing. Gray argues that Paul again and again dipped his pen in the OT well, and that understanding the apostle’s technique is crucial for rightly interpreting his letters. The final chapter looks at the complex issue of pseudonymity and the senses in which one’s view of authorship affects interpretation.</p>
<p>Gray’s work contributes to the field of Pauline studies, not primarily because he breaks new ground, but because he makes essential hermeneutical matters more accessible to the nonspecialist. This is a lucid, student-friendly volume.</p>
