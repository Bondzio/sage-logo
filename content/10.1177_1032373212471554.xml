<p>It is rare for a French writer or writers to publish a book on accounting history in the English language and this phenomenon deserves to be underlined. <italic>French Accounting History: New Contributions</italic> concerns what is least characteristic of most discussions of French accounting, which are usually focused on financial accounting and the main model of the chart of accounts. Instead, this work foregrounds management accounting and some of the more general questions of accounting pedagogy and vocabulary. Yves Levant, one of the two editors, specializes in the field of management accounting and cost computing. Olivier de la Villarmois, who is also an experienced public accountant, did not contribute to any chapter, but is co-editor. Although with financial accounting largely absent from this work there is merit in this diversity, the diversity is, perhaps, too extensive.</p>
<p>The first chapter, written by Marie Catalo and Nicole Azema-Girlando, on “Lady Accounting, an analogy using blood circulation to popularise an accounting view of the health of the firm”, examines the attempt by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1032373212471554">Deuwez (1933)</xref> to explain accounting concepts and ideas to non-specialists through the analogy of human blood circulation and organs such as blood vessels, the stomach and the intestines. Many readers will find that, in spite of this humorous appeal, it is easier to explain accountancy and bookkeeping in a traditional way than through the deforming prism of the human body and blood circulation – mainly because the human vital system involves not only the circulation of the blood, but also the lymphatic system, and because the heart is unable to function without the contribution of oxygen from the lungs and without the fuel provided by the digestion of food. The metaphor is undoubtedly pushed too far to be to convincing.</p>
<p>In the second chapter, Yves Levant and Marc Nikitin look at the Bedaux case. The question is “Charles E. Bedaux: Cost killer or Utopian socialist?” The Bedaux method was a great success with some firms and groups, and, at the same time, was violently contested by employees and unions, resulting in many strikes and protests. His project was inspired by industrial societies during the interwar period. Apart from the historical knowledge of a man (and a work) of character, Bedeaux did not leave a method that could be used nowadays. The quality of this second chapter is particularly based on the meticulousness of the references and their articulation with the context of a period of time very different from our own.</p>
<p>It is always interesting to learn of early sources of a particular technique of management. In the following chapter, Anne Pezet recalls the history of the French balanced scorecard (in French: <italic>tableau de bord</italic>). Pezet used the files of several large international companies having their general headquarters in France as a historical source of material. She tries to revisit the myth of the French balanced scorecard, the promotion of which was driven by engineers, and that has been a symbol of an ordered organization for a long time, before the Kaplan and Norton’s balanced scorecard introduced further nuances. The relationship between scorecards and budgets is very well analysed in this chapter.</p>
<p>The fourth chapter, “Accounting and the words to talk about it” by Pierre Labardin and Marc Nikitin, is undoubtedly badly situated in the book and would have been far better at the beginning, since it examines the development of the use of particular accounting terminology. In the French language, the word accounting (<italic>comptabilité</italic>) appeared at a considerably later date compared to the term bookkeeping (<italic>tenue des livres</italic>). Beginning in the eighteenth century, the authors show how the word accounting (<italic>comptabilité</italic>) was variously applied and modified over time to indicate particular types of accounting (e.g. agricultural accounting) and domains of accounting services, as well as to describe the “accounting department”. The chapter provides interesting insights into how this word has evolved.</p>
<p>After a remarkable article published in 2001 in <italic>Accounting, Organizations and Society</italic>, “Understanding social closure in its cultural context: Accounting practitioners in France”, Carlos Ramirez, well known for his opinions regarding critical accounting and sociology, once again shows his talent in the following chapter of the book, devoted to the “Professionalization of the auditing profession in France”. One of the French cultural exceptions is that there are two accounting professions instead of one: the first is the public or chartered accountant (<italic>expert-comptable</italic>), and the second takes charge of the legal audit of different kinds of companies (statutory auditor). After 99 years, to the day, of the passing of an important company law (24 July 1867), a new law on companies, France’s 1966 <italic>Companies Act</italic> (enacted 24 July), largely reformed the legal and contractual audit of companies and led to the legalization of a profession which only came into being incidentally, by a decree in 1935 following financial scandals in 1934. Chapter 5 describes in a meticulous way this history of the auditing profession from a French perspective. It is a history which, globally, has witnessed many dramatic episodes, including the Enron scandal and the introduction of the <italic>Sarbanes-Oxley Act</italic>.</p>
<p>Chapter 6 is more exotic and concerns accountancy and slavery, discreetly referred to in France as the “trade of Guinea” or “triangular trade”. In this chapter, Canadian author Cheryl McWatters and French author Yannick Lemarchand use, discuss and supplement the “Commercial Guide” by Gaignat de l’Aulnais, a work particularly difficult to find in French libraries. The subject of slavery is an almost prohibited and taboo topic in France, and it is unfortunate that this chapter never refers to the “Black Codes” (French laws concerning slaves and slavery). The research employs 21 cases concerning the economic rationalizations and institutionalization of slavery, taking into account the owners, the ship-owners, the vessels, the voyages and the captains, and provides a convincing demonstration, as well as a call for further analysis, of this vast and scandalous topic.</p>
<p>In Chapter 7, Nicolas Berland studies the relationship between turbulent environments and the techniques of budgetary control and management control. The principal quality of this research is to show how it is possible to reduce uncertainty by specific mechanisms and realistic forecasts, and to appreciate the difference between stable environments and chaotic environments in the use of budgetary devices and controls.</p>
<p>Last of all, the final chapter, drawn from Henri Zimnovitch’s PhD thesis, examines how a particular manager, Marius Berliet, in the early twentieth century in the French car industry could not implement a range of cost and management accounting changes. The case illustrates how this manager had to reconcile the requirements of his era, and its context, with his desire to apply adequate costing techniques.</p>
<p>This edited book explores and clarifies many points related to French accountancy, but what makes French accounting idiosyncratic and different, and yet also makes it similar to German or Italian accountancy, is not treated: namely financial accounting founded on the unique practice of the French chart of accounts, which exhibits a preference for rules, models and practices over more broadly based accounting principles or theory. If French accountancy is clearly different from accountancy in other parts of the world, it is more through the exposition of financial accounting adapted to the French culture, than by understandings of management accounting, where English, American and Japanese systems make much more realistic and much more systematic projections than the French. But as it is, this book provides ideas on the work and methods used by the historians concerned and constitutes an interesting perspective on French accounting history.</p>
