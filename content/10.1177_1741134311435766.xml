<p>This article discusses the new post-grant review of a patent, a process which will become available on September 16, 2012 pursuant to the America Invents Act – but for non-business method patents, applies only to patents having an effective filing date on or after March 16, 2013. In particular, this article sets forth various factors to be considered by a generic pharmaceutical company in deciding whether to petition for post-grant review of a patent or proceed with a standard Hatch-Waxman litigation.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1741134311435766" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Much has been said, and will continue to be said, about what effect the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (‘AIA’) will have on the practice of patent law in the USA. This article focuses on certain issues that a generic pharmaceutical company might consider in deciding whether to petition for post-grant review (‘PGR’) of a patent once the PGR process will become available on September 16, 2012.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1741134311435766">1</xref></sup> Specifically, this article addresses whether to petition for PGR on a patent that might eventually be listed in the Orange Book for an as-yet unapproved New Drug Application (‘NDA’) product, whether to petition for PGR on a patent listed in the Orange Book for an already approved NDA product but before submission of an Abbreviated New Drug Application (‘ANDA’), and whether to petition for PGR on a patent listed in the Orange Book after an ANDA has been submitted.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1741134311435766">2</xref></sup> More specifically, this article considers the ramifications on litigation resulting from a generic pharmaceutical company’s paragraph IV certification<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1741134311435766">3</xref></sup> against an Orange Book patent that was, or is, the subject of a PGR by that company.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec2-1741134311435766"><title>Post-grant review</title>
<p>A PGR proceeding is a new provision of the AIA, whereby a ‘petitioner may request to cancel as unpatentable 1 or more claims of a patent on any ground that could be raised under paragraph (2) or (3) of [35 U.S.C.] section 282(b) (relating to invalidity), i.e. §§ 101, 102, 103, 112 (except best mode)’. AIA Frequently Asked Questions at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.uspto.gov/aia_implementation/faq.jsp#heading-8">http://www.uspto.gov/aia_implementation/faq.jsp#heading-8</ext-link>, Question PGR1. The AIA provides that ‘a person who is not the owner of the patent may file with the Office [i.e. the Patent and Trademark Office (“PTO”)] a petition to institute a PGR of the patent.’ AIA section 321(a). Such a petition must be filed within 9 months of the grant of the patent. AIA section 321(c).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1741134311435766">4</xref></sup> The petition must identify</p><disp-quote>
<p>in writing and with particularity, each claim challenged, the grounds on which the challenge to each claim is based, and the evidence that supports the grounds for the challenge to each claim, including –</p></disp-quote><disp-quote>
<p>(A) copies of patents and printed publications that the petitioner relies upon in support of the petition; and</p></disp-quote><disp-quote>
<p>(B) affidavits or declarations of supporting evidence and opinions, if the petitioner relies on other factual evidence or on expert opinions…</p></disp-quote>
<p>AIA section 322(a)(3). The Director<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1741134311435766">5</xref></sup> may then institute a PGR. However, the AIA provides that the Director may not authorize a PGR ‘unless the Director determines that the information presented in the petition … if such information is not rebutted, would demonstrate that it is more likely than not that at least one of the claims challenged in the petition is unpatentable.’ AIA section 324(a).</p>
<p>Once the PTO issues a final written decision regarding an instituted PGR proceeding, the AIA further provides that the petitioner or the real party in interest ‘may not assert either in a civil action … or in a proceeding before the International Trade Commission under section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930 that the claim is invalid on any ground that the petitioner raised or reasonably could have raised during that post-grant review.’ AIA section 325(e)(2).</p>
<p>A final determination of a PGR must issue within 1 year from the date on which the Director provided notice that a PGR proceeding was being instituted (subject to a 6-month extension for good cause). AIA section 326(a)(11).</p></sec>
<sec id="sec3-1741134311435766"><title>PGR or Hatch–Waxman litigation: some considerations</title>
<p>Several considerations might influence whether a generic pharmaceutical company decides to petition for a PGR or seek to resolve patent invalidity in a Hatch–Waxman litigation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1741134311435766">6</xref></sup> These considerations include the evidentiary burden, the timing of patent issuance and the possibility of being estopped from later challenging a patent that was the subject of a PGR proceeding.</p>
<sec id="sec4-1741134311435766"><title>Evidentiary burden</title>
<p>According to the AIA, in a PGR proceeding, ‘the petitioner shall have the burden of proving a proposition of unpatentability by a preponderance of the evidence.’ AIA section 326(e). This contrasts with the higher burden of proving patent invalidity in court by ‘clear and convincing evidence.’ <italic>See Microsoft Corp. v. i4i Ltd. Partnership</italic>, 131 S. Ct. 2238, 2243 (2011). Thus, strictly from an evidentiary standpoint, it would be easier to render a claim unpatentable in a PGR proceeding than to invalidate that same claim in litigation. However, since a PGR proceeding can only address issues of patentability, see AIA section 321(b), other issues (such as non-infringement and unenforceability) would still need to be resolved in litigation.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec5-1741134311435766"><title>Timing</title>
<p>In choosing between filing a petition for a PGR versus litigating invalidity after submitting a paragraph IV certification, a generic pharmaceutical company needs to consider the date of issuance of the patent in question relative to when the generic pharmaceutical company would be filing its ANDA. Three scenarios are considered below.</p>
<sec id="sec6-1741134311435766"><title>Patent issues before NDA approval</title>
<p>A patent claiming a new chemical entity (‘NCE’) often will issue years before approval of an NDA product covered by that patent.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1741134311435766">7</xref></sup> At this early stage, such a patent might not be on a generic pharmaceutical company’s ‘radar screen’ because that patent is not yet associated with a commercial product. Accordingly, a generic pharmaceutical company will likely not expend the time and money to petition for a PGR proceeding within 9 months of patent issuance because the company does not know how that patent might impact its future business. As a result, a generic pharmaceutical company will more likely challenge an NCE patent in the traditional manner, i.e., by waiting until it can file an ANDA for a generic version of an already commercialized NDA product, submitting a paragraph IV certification with respect to the patent listed in the Orange Book, serving notice of that paragraph IV certification to the NDA holder/patentee and then being sued on the Orange Book patent pursuant to 35 U.S.C. section 271(e)(2).</p></sec>
<sec id="sec7-1741134311435766"><title>Patent issues after NDA approval and before filing of an ANDA</title>
<p>If a patent issues after NDA approval and is listed in the Orange Book with respect to the NDA product, then a generic pharmaceutical company that is considering filing an ANDA for a generic version of the NDA product might have that Orange Book patent on its ‘radar screen’ within 9 months of patent issuance. At this stage, the patents are less likely to cover NCEs and are more likely directed to formulations or polymorphs. Instead of waiting to challenge the Orange Book patent via a paragraph IV certification and subsequent Hatch–Waxman litigation, a generic pharmaceutical company may elect to petition for a PGR, because a decision from the PTO may well be obtained in advance of the filing of the ANDA. Under this scenario, the PGR process provides a generic pharmaceutical company with an avenue to pursue before an ANDA is filed. However, a generic pharmaceutical company might not want to petition for a PGR if a decision from the PTO invalidating the claims at issue in the PGR might jeopardize its ability to be the first company to file an ANDA containing a paragraph IV certification which would entitle it to 180-day generic exclusivity.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1741134311435766">8</xref></sup> For example, if there is only one Orange Book patent and all claims are canceled after a successful PGR proceeding, then the generic drug company would have no Orange Book patent against which to make a paragraph IV certification and thus would not have a basis for 180-day exclusivity (to which it would have been entitled if it had been the first ANDA applicant with a paragraph IV certification).</p></sec>
<sec id="sec8-1741134311435766"><title>Patent issues after filing of an ANDA</title>
<p>If a new patent issues and is listed in the Orange Book after the ANDA filing, then a generic pharmaceutical company will most certainly have that newly issued and listed Orange Book patent on its ‘radar screen’ within 9 months of patent issuance. If the generic pharmaceutical company had previously been the first ANDA applicant with a paragraph IV certification against another Orange Book patent, then the choice of a PGR proceeding versus a paragraph IV certification (and attendant Hatch–Waxman litigation) would not impact that company’s entitlement to 180-day generic exclusivity.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1741134311435766">9</xref></sup> Indeed, it might be feasible for a generic pharmaceutical company to petition for a PGR of the newly issued Orange Book patent and to certify against that patent at the same time. Under such a scenario, a PGR proceeding might simultaneously proceed with a Hatch–Waxman litigation on the same patent, although it is likely that the PGR proceeding (to be completed within 1 year) would end before conclusion of the Hatch–Waxman litigation.</p>
<p>If the concurrent PGR proceeding resulted in cancellation of all claims, then the Hatch–Waxman litigation would likely be dismissed since no claims remain to be litigated.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1741134311435766">10</xref></sup> Conversely, if the PGR proceeding resulted in all the claims being found to be patentable, then there would be an issue of whether the generic pharmaceutical company could at that point maintain its defenses in the Hatch–Waxman litigation. However, if the PGR were requested by a generic pharmaceutical company and the claims were found to be patentable before a Hatch–Waxman litigation were brought (even if the company could make a paragraph IV certification), the company would be estopped from then challenging the validity of the patent in question on the basis of any challenge that was raised or could have reasonably been raised before the PTO at the PGR. This issue of estoppel is addressed below.</p></sec></sec>
<sec id="sec9-1741134311435766"><title>Estoppel</title>
<p>In addition to issues of timing discussed above, a generic pharmaceutical company must consider the consequences of petitioning for a PGR. The AIA provides that once the PTO decides a PGR, the petitioner may not assert in a civil action ‘that the claim is invalid on any ground that the petitioner raised or reasonably could have raised during that post-grant review.’ AIA section 325(e)(2). Thus, for example, if the PGR petition argued that claim 1 of a patent were unpatentable as anticipated by references X or Y, then the petitioner would also be precluded from arguing in litigation that claim 1 were anticipated by references X or Y or obvious in view of reference X combined with reference Y because these are arguments that the petitioner ‘raised or reasonably could have raised’ during the PGR. Thus, if a generic pharmaceutical company petitioned for a PGR (for example, when the patent issues after filing of an ANDA, as discussed above) and the patent claims were found patentable by the PTO, then the generic pharmaceutical company would be estopped from raising the same arguments in support of an argument of patent invalidity in any ensuing litigation relating to said patent.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1741134311435766">11</xref></sup> Of course, if there were a basis for arguing non-infringement and/or unenforceability, those arguments could still be made even if the generic pharmaceutical company did not succeed in rendering unpatentable the patent claims in the PGR proceeding.</p></sec></sec>
<sec id="sec10-1741134311435766" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The PGR provisions of the AIA provide a new alternative for a generic pharmaceutical company to attack patents outside of the Hatch–Waxman litigation context. However, a decision to proceed in this direction should be made only after careful deliberation. While the instance in which the patent issues after filing of an ANDA, discussed above, may be a likely candidate for a PGR petition in terms of the timing, the PGR estoppel provisions must be taken into account.</p>
<p>As can be seen above, there are numerous factors to be considered by a generic pharmaceutical company in deciding whether to file a petition for a PGR or proceed according to the standard Hatch–Waxman process. Both approaches will have advantages and disadvantages. Only time will tell if there is truly an advantage to one path versus the other.</p></sec>
