<abstract>
<p>This article, part two in a three-part series on the meaning of <italic>Ioudaios</italic> (‘Jew’ or ‘Judaean’), examines the use of ethnic terminology in scholarship on <italic>Ioudaios</italic> over the last seventy-five years, with a focus on representative studies from the 1930s–1950s as a point of comparison with more recent developments. The article traces shifts in the meaning of ethnic terminology after World War II and explores why ‘ethnicity’ eventually came to more-or-less supplant other terms such as ‘race’ and ‘nation’. Part one, which appeared in 2010 in <italic>CBR</italic> 9.1, examined the relationship between <italic>Ioudaios</italic> and other group labels in ancient Judaism, such as ‘Israel’ and ‘Galilaean’. The final article will analyse the relationship between ethnicity and religion in scholarship on the meaning of <italic>Ioudaios</italic>, and evaluate the debate over the term’s English translation.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>How to translate the Greek word Ἰουδαῖος (<italic>Ioudaios</italic>) and its Latin, Hebrew and Aramaic cognates is a pressing question in contemporary scholarship on ancient Judaism (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1476993X11428924">Miller 2010</xref>: 98-99). Those who favour ‘Judaean’ over the more traditional translation, ‘Jew’, typically argue that during the Second Temple Period <italic>Ioudaios</italic> meant a member of an ethnic group comparable to ‘Egyptian’ and ‘Parthian’, not an adherent of a religion, and that the modern religious connotations implied by ‘Jew’ are anachronistic. ‘Ethnicity’, however, is also a modern concept that can be imposed anachronistically on ancient sources. Although ethnic terminology is now standard in discussions of <italic>Ioudaios</italic>, its meaning is notoriously difficult to pin down. As Chapman, McDonald and Tonkin explain, ‘ethnicity’ is complex partly because of its etymology, and partly because the subject resists definition:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>‘Ethnicity’, then, is an abstract noun, derived by non-vernacular morphological processes from a substantive that does not exist … a term that only makes sense in a context of relativities, of processes of identification, and that nevertheless aspires to concrete and positive status both as an attribute and as an analytical ‘concept’. No surprise, then, that the question ‘What is ethnicity?’ might often be asked, and that the answers should be less than lucid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1476993X11428924">Chapman, McDonald and Tonkin 1989</xref>: 16).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The purpose of this article is not to define ‘ethnicity’ or to decide between ‘Jew’ and ‘Judaean’ or even between ‘religion’ and ‘ethnicity’—these larger questions about the meaning and translation of <italic>Ioudaios</italic> will be the subject of the final article in this three-part series. Before dealing with these questions, another broader question about modern terminology requires attention first: Why use ‘ethnicity’ instead of other terms such as ‘race’ or ‘nation’, and what difference does it make? Historical inquiry, according to Buell, must attend not only to the evidence but also to our own contexts and interests, and to ‘the history of the interpretive frameworks we are using to make sense of the ancient sources’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1476993X11428924">Buell 2005</xref>: 20). My intention in this article is to explore why the interpretive framework of ‘ethnicity’—as opposed to ‘race’ or ‘nation’—has become the main alternative to ‘religion’ as the category within which <italic>Ioudaios</italic> belongs, and to examine how changes in modern terminology have affected analysis of <italic>Ioudaios</italic>. (Since the translation of the label is contested, I will employ <italic>Ioudaios</italic> in the singular and <italic>Ioudaioi</italic> in the plural instead of ‘Jew[s]’ or ‘Judaean[s]’ for the Greek Ἰουδαῖος [<italic>Ioudaios</italic>] and the corresponding Latin, Hebrew and Aramaic terms <italic>Iudaeus</italic>, ידוהי [<italic>Yehudi</italic>] and יאדוהי [<italic>Yehudai</italic>].)</p>
<p>It is commonly assumed that ‘[e]thnicity … is a term coined in the mid-twentieth century specifically as an alternative to biologically based understandings of race’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1476993X11428924">Buell 2005</xref>: 17; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1476993X11428924">Chapman, McDonald and Tonkin 1989</xref>: 14; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1476993X11428924">Hall 2002</xref>: 13-14; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1476993X11428924">Esler 2003</xref>: 372 n. 1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1476993X11428924">Goodblatt 2006</xref>: 6). ‘Ethnicity’, therefore, is often regarded as an improvement. According to Esler, replacing ‘race’ with ‘ethnicity’ marks an advance against both racism and anti-Semitism because the language of ‘race’ is linked to the discredited race theories of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1476993X11428924">Esler 2003</xref>: 52). Since the theory on which racism is based ‘was invented only in the nineteenth century’ neither racism nor anti-Semitism existed in the ancient world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1476993X11428924">Esler 2003</xref>: 53; contrast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1476993X11428924">Schäfer 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1476993X11428924">Isaac 2004</xref>). Esler maintains that the modern concept of ethnicity correlates well with ancient perceptions of human difference, and is the best available model to describe how the <italic>Ioudaioi</italic> and other related groups functioned (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1476993X11428924">Esler 2009</xref>: 74; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1476993X11428924">2003</xref>: 52). In sharp contrast to Esler, Buell employs ‘race’ and ‘ethnicity’ interchangeably in order to combat modern racism and Christian anti-Semitism. Against those who maintain that the language of ‘race’ has been irrevocably tainted by the Holocaust, Buell observes that ‘ethnicity’ sometimes amounts to no more than a euphemism for a simplistic use of ‘race’ as a ‘biological category’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1476993X11428924">Buell 2005</xref>: 12, 18, 20). She argues that merely abandoning the term will solve nothing:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Far from seeking to rehabilitate the concept, I use it precisely because of the damage this modern concept has wrought and continues to wreak. If we want to get beyond race, we have to grapple with how it informs historical interpretation even when it is excluded. By provocatively using race interchangeably with ethnicity … I am challenging readers to be accountable to the terms we use for interpreting cultural differences in antiquity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1476993X11428924">2005</xref>: xi).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>I share Buell’s interest in the contemporary ethical implications of scholarly work, and welcome her summons to attend to ways in which past scholarship and conceptual models ‘haunt’ the present. My concern is that—whatever its other merits—using ‘race’ and ‘ethnicity’ interchangeably may obscure our understanding of the very conceptual history that Buell insists is necessary to ‘get beyond race’. Although ‘ethnicity’ and ‘race’ were sometimes used interchangeably after World War II, the claim that ‘ethnicity’ was coined as a replacement for ‘race’ lacks direct evidence; even the suggestion that ‘ethnicity’ replaced ‘race’ rests on a superficial understanding of the term’s history. In fact, ethnic terminology was distinguished from racial terminology in the 1930s, and during the mid-twentieth century the most common alternative to ‘race’ in scholarship on <italic>Ioudaios</italic> was ‘nation’ rather than ‘ethnicity’ or ‘ethnic group’. A transition from ‘race’ to ‘ethnicity’ is visible in hindsight, but as Dodds observed, ‘when hindsight enables us to cut … through [history] at a critical point, there is always a time-lag and an overlap’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1476993X11428924">Dodds 1965</xref>: 3; quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1476993X11428924">Buell 2009</xref>: 187). The messy details of this particular ‘time-lag’ are a cautionary tale about the dangers of confusing modern and ancient perspectives on group identity, and of failing to distinguish between different modern meanings of the same technical term.</p>

<title>Race and Ethnicity in the Social Sciences</title>
<p>No doubt reactions to the scientific racism associated with Nazi Germany contributed to the eventual transition to ethnic terminology in the social sciences (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1476993X11428924">Jones 1997</xref>: 40-55). The terminology itself, however, did not originate as a response to the Holocaust. On the one hand, opposition to biologically-based understandings of ‘race’ began earlier (see, e.g., the essays in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1476993X11428924">Boas 1982</xref>). In 1933, Childe recommended using ‘people’ instead of ‘race’ for groups that share ‘common traditions, common institutions and a common way of life’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1476993X11428924">Childe 1933</xref>: 198); instead of ‘racial’ Childe proposed the adjective ‘ethnic’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1476993X11428924">1933</xref>: 199). Two years later Huxley and Haddon published their ‘calculated demolition of the idea of race’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1476993X11428924">Fenton 2010</xref>: 54) and recommended the replacement of ‘race’ by ‘the descriptive and non-committal term <italic>ethnic group</italic>’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1476993X11428924">Huxley and Haddon 1935</xref>: 268; cf. 108, 164). On the other hand, the choice of ‘ethnic’ was no innovation, for Childe, Huxley and Haddon were selecting a term that was already in use (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1476993X11428924">Deniker 1900</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1476993X11428924">Kallen 1915</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1476993X11428924">Weber 1922</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1476993X11428924">Woofter 1933</xref>) whose meaning at that time was similar to but not synonymous with ‘race’ (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1476993X11428924">Fenton 2010</xref>: 51-59). Although the noun, ‘ethnicity’, was apparently first used by Warner in 1941 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1476993X11428924">Sollors 1981</xref>: 259-60), it is Sollors, not Warner, who suggests that ‘ethnicity’ was chosen because ‘“Race” was discredited by the emergence of fascism’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1476993X11428924">Sollors 1981</xref>: 260). Warner actually held that ‘an ethnic group was a subdivision of a racial group’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1476993X11428924">Banton 2007</xref>: 31). Instead of a response to fascism, ‘ethnicity’ appears as a variation on the more common adjective ‘ethnic’, which according to Warner ‘does not refer simply to foreign birth’:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>An individual was classified as belonging to a specific ethnic group if (1) he considered himself or was considered by the . . . community as a member of the group, and (2) if he participated in the activities of the group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1476993X11428924">Warner and Lunt 1941</xref>: 211; see 212 and 220 for occurrences of ‘ethnicity’).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Huxley and Haddon’s recommendation to replace ‘race’ with ‘ethnic group’ was repeated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1476993X11428924">Montagu (1942</xref>: 72-73) and popularized further in UNESCO’s First Statement on Race, which Montagu drafted (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1476993X11428924">Keane 2007</xref>: 105). Usage, however, is not changed merely by fiat of the UN, and the transition from ‘race’ to ‘ethnicity’ was gradual. According to Fenton, ‘up until the 1960s, the terms “races” and “ethnic groups” continued to be used, in large measure interchangeably’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1476993X11428924">Fenton 2010</xref>: 56). The degree to which ‘race’ remains in use in academic circles today depends on region and field of study. In the USA, for example, continued use of ‘race’ in the US Census has helped keep the term in circulation, whereas in other parts of the English-speaking world it has been largely replaced—at least in scholarly usage—by ‘ethnicity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1476993X11428924">Fenton 2010</xref>: 24-50).</p>
<p>The remainder of this article examines changes in terminology for <italic>Ioudaios</italic>. Analysis of this particular corner of scholarship offers a glimpse into the period of overlap between ‘race’, ‘nation’ and ‘ethnic group’ during the mid-twentieth century. As we will see, a shift in terminology intended to transform a conceptual framework may initially lead to a blurring of distinctions between related terms rather than conceptual clarity. First, however, it will be necessary to show that the blurred categories were distinct at an earlier point.</p>

<title>Racial and Ethnic Categories in Kittel’s <italic>Wörterbuch</italic></title>
<p>The entries on <italic>Ioudaios</italic> by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1476993X11428924">Von Rad (1938)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1476993X11428924">Kuhn (1938)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1476993X11428924">Gutbrod (1938)</xref> in Kittel’s <italic>Theological Dictionary</italic> provide indirect confirmation that racial and ethnic categories were distinguished during the 1930s. The matter is complicated, however, by differences between German and English terminology. In particular, the meaning of the German words ‘Volk’ and ‘völkisch’ need to be examined before any conclusions can be reached about the relationship between ethnic terminology and conceptions of race. Both Kuhn and Gutbrod often referred to the people designated by ‘Israel’ and <italic>Ioudaios</italic> as ‘Volk’, a word that can be translated into English by ‘race’, ‘nation’ or ‘ethnic group’ among other options; ‘völkisch’ was the standard adjective. Bromiley’s English translation normally employed ‘people’ or ‘nation’ for ‘Volk’ and ‘people’ or ‘national’ for ‘völkisch’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1476993X11428924">Kuhn 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1476993X11428924">Gutbrod 1965</xref>), but this may say more about 1960s English conventions than about the meaning of the German words during the 1930s. Koonz argues that within Nazi-era Germany, ‘Volk’ and ‘völkisch’ should be translated by ‘ethnicity’ and ‘ethnic’ because they carried positive connotations and were used in contrast with the more derogatory-sounding ‘Rasse’ and ‘rassisch’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1476993X11428924">Koonz 2003</xref>: 9-10). The negative connotations of ‘Rasse’ and ‘rassisch’ may explain why Kuhn and Gutbrod avoided ‘Rasse’, and why ‘rassisch’ only occurs twice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1476993X11428924">Gutbrod 1938</xref>: 371 n. 84, 383), but the positive—or neutral (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1476993X11428924">Morgan 2010</xref>: 483 n. 88)—connotations of ‘völkisch’ do not mean that ‘ethnic’ is its best translation here. If translating ‘Volk’ by ‘race’ obscures the semantic relationship between ‘völkisch’ and ‘rassisch’, translating ‘Volk’ by ‘ethnicity’ overlooks the fact that the adjective ‘ethnisch’ (a German equivalent for ‘ethnic’) was also current in 1930s German scholarship (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1476993X11428924">Weber 1922</xref>: 216-26; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1476993X11428924">Von Rad 1938</xref>), as was the German adjective ‘national’—and, in modern German at least, the semantic range of ‘Nationalität’ closely parallels the English word ‘ethnicity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1476993X11428924">Goodblatt 2006</xref>: 6).</p>
<p>However ‘Volk’ and ‘völkisch’ are translated, it is hard to avoid the conclusion that Kuhn and Gutbrod’s discussion was influenced by the racially-charged ideology of Nazi Germany. According to Kuhn, both ‘Israel(ite)’ and <italic>Ioudaios</italic> were ‘völkisch’ terms that designate people as members of the Jewish ‘Volk’ on the basis of their ‘blutmäβigen Abstammung’—their physical descent—without reference to their national affiliation (staatliche Zugehörigkeit) or their place of residence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1476993X11428924">Kuhn 1938</xref>: 360). The mention of ‘blood’ (Blut) is significant, as is the fact that at least by 1935 the Third Reich was tracking members of Judaism (Judentum) on the basis of their ‘blutmäβigen Abstammung’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1476993X11428924">Vienne 2004</xref>: 153; on Kuhn’s membership in the Nazi party see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1476993X11428924">Casey 1999</xref>: 283-85; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1476993X11428924">Heschel 2008</xref>: 187-89). In this context, translating ‘völkisch’ by ‘racial’ seems appropriate. Kuhn went on to say that these racial terms (diesem Völkischen) also conveyed the religious affiliation of the <italic>Ioudaioi</italic>. Indeed, according to Kuhn, race and religion—‘Die Volks- und die Religionszugehörigkeit’—always went together, and all Jews by birth shared in salvation merely ‘on the basis of their physical descent’ (lediglich auf Grund seiner blutmäβigen Abstammung) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1476993X11428924">Kuhn 1938</xref>: 360). Common ancestry was not always stressed in connection with ‘Volk’, however, for Kuhn also allowed that proselytes could become members of the ‘Volk’ by circumcision and so share in salvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1476993X11428924">Kuhn 1938</xref>: 360; on circumcision see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1476993X11428924">Kuhn 1968</xref>). Still, physical descent was central to Kuhn’s definition of <italic>Ioudaios</italic>. Cultural features of the <italic>Ioudaioi</italic>, such as language and other ‘national characteristics of the Palestinian Jews’ (dem palästinischen Juden national Eigentümliche), were either included under the category of religion, or treated as optional characteristics, which the Hellenized Jews of the Diaspora could abandon while still remaining Jews (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1476993X11428924">Kuhn 1938</xref>: 368, 370).</p>
<p>Gutbrod adopted a broader meaning of <italic>Ioudaios</italic>, perhaps because he treated a broader range of evidence. While Kuhn focused on Palestinian Judaism and the Apocrypha and Pseudepigrapha, Gutbrod surveyed ‘pagan’ Hellenistic literature, as well as Philo, Josephus, and the New Testament. Gutbrod agreed with Kuhn that <italic>Ioudaios</italic> had a dual meaning, but described the alternative to the primary religious meaning variously as the ‘political-historical’ or, more often, as the ‘national’ or ‘völkisch’ side of the term (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1476993X11428924">Gutbrod 1938</xref>: 371-72). The German adjective ‘national’ appears to have been a larger category than ‘völkisch’ that could include physical descent and political elements as well as national customs (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1476993X11428924">1938</xref>: 382, 384). Identifying the meaning of ‘völkisch’ in Gutbrod is more difficult. Sometimes the word appears to overlap with ‘national’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1476993X11428924">1938</xref>: 381); the ‘völkisch’ element that Gutbrod found in Matthew’s statement that ‘Jesus was born king of the Jews’ seems to be more political than genealogical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1476993X11428924">1938</xref>: 377-78). In other cases, however, the narrower sense of ‘race’ or common ancestry is clear from the context, and was most likely intended in other passages as well (see especially <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1476993X11428924">1938</xref>: 372, 381, and the juxtaposition of ‘rassisch’ and ‘völkisch’ in 383). In any case, according to Gutbrod, common ancestry was even more basic to membership in the Jewish ‘Volk’ than national or ethnic customs. Gutbrod explained that when Christ-followers were identified as <italic>Ioudaioi</italic> in Acts it was often to show that they were <italic>Ioudaioi</italic> by birth (die geburtsmäßige Zugehörigkeit) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1476993X11428924">1938</xref>: 382). Paul, too, would have admitted to being a <italic>Ioudaios</italic> only with respect to his birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1476993X11428924">1938</xref>: 383). The term ‘Israel’ in Rom. 9.6, similarly, denoted people who were members of the ‘Volk’ of Israel by birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1476993X11428924">1938</xref>: 386). Like the rabbis who argued that physical descent (die bloße Abstammung von Israel) was enough to make one a real Israelite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1476993X11428924">1938</xref>: 391 n. 134), Paul could not separate the name, ‘Israel’, from those who were descended from Israel (blutmäßig zu Israel gehören) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1476993X11428924">1938</xref>: 391). While ancient anti-Semitism was, according to Gutbrod, primarily a response to Jewish religious standoffishness, he did not deny that there was a racial (rassisch) element in Jewish identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1476993X11428924">1938</xref>: 371 n. 84, 383). Like Kuhn, then, Gutbrod distinguished a religious meaning of <italic>Ioudaios</italic> from other national or ethnic meanings, and highlighted the distinctive role that common ancestry played in conceptions of Jewish identity.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1476993X11428924">Von Rad’s (1938)</xref> entry on the terms ‘Israel’, ‘Judah’ and ‘Hebrew’ in the Hebrew Bible demonstrates that the German adjective ‘ethnisch’ could be used without the racial connotations of ‘völkisch’ that are present in Kuhn and Gutbrod’s companion entries on post-biblical Jewish literature. Von Rad used ‘ethnisch’ and ‘Ethnikon’ interchangeably with the Latin word ‘Gentilicium’. According to Von Rad, the term ‘Hebrew’ is completely different from ‘Israel’ and ‘Judah’ because <italic>Habiru</italic> (ירבע) was originally a designation for a legal-social status; the peoples the term encompassed were not an ethnic unity (ethnische Einheit) like the Mesopotamians and Egyptians. Von Rad maintained that ‘Hebrew’ eventually took on a broader meaning as a more-or-less derogatory term for Israel, and that late biblical usage at least prepares for the use of ‘Hebrew’ as a designation for ethnicity (eine ethnische Zugehörigkeit) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1476993X11428924">1938</xref>: 359). In contrast to Kuhn and Gutbrod, both of whom avoided ‘ethnisch’, ‘völkisch’ does not appear in Von Rad’s article. Apart from references to Israel as a tribal league (Stämmebundes) and to Judah as a tribal name (Stammesname), where common ancestry is no doubt implied, explicit references to physical descent are conspicuously absent.</p>
<p>We may conclude that the German terms, ‘rassisch’, ‘ethnisch’ or ‘national’, and ‘religiös’—to use the closest parallels to the English terms, ‘racial’, ‘ethnic’, and ‘religious’—were used with distinctive meanings during the 1930s. Kuhn, Gutbrod and Von Rad’s articles also show that in Germany during the 1930s the concept of race was distinguished from nationality in the narrow sense of citizenship, and distinct (or at least distinguishable) from what we would call ethnicity.</p>

<title>‘Race’, ‘Nation’, and Ethnic Terminology in Solomon Zeitlin</title>
<p>Zeitlin makes an excellent case study because his essays on <italic>Ioudaios</italic> in the <italic>Jewish Quarterly Review</italic> span the decades around World War II. In 1936 Zeitlin asked whether Second Temple period Jews were a race, nation or a religion. He repeated, expanded, and modified the gist of his 1936 essay in a six-part series published between 1943 and 1945, and revisited the subject yet again in 1953 and 1959 in response to developments in the new state of Israel. Although Zeitlin’s central argument—that <italic>Ioudaios</italic> was almost exclusively a religious label by the end of the Second Temple period—remained constant, his use of ‘race’ and ‘nation’ changed over time from clearly demarcated terms with distinct meanings to terms that were used interchangeably with ‘ethnic group’.</p>
<p>In 1936 Zeitlin distinguished between ‘race’ and ‘nation’ much like Kuhn and Gutbrod had done. According to Zeitlin, ‘race’ referred to a group defined by common descent. One could change their religion, but race was immutable—it could only be ‘mixed’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1476993X11428924">1936</xref>: 332-33). Although he sometimes listed ‘race’ and ‘nation’ together as alternatives to ‘religion’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1476993X11428924">1936</xref>: 329 n. 56, 335, 338) and quoted a dictionary entry that defined one meaning of ‘nation’ as ‘a people connected by ties of blood’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1476993X11428924">1936</xref>: 313), Zeitlin normally used ‘nation’ in the sense of political independence (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1476993X11428924">1936</xref>: 316, 338, 341), and maintained that ‘nation’ and ‘race’ corresponded to different Greek words. While ‘race’, according to Zeitlin, translated γένος (<italic>genos</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1476993X11428924">1936</xref>: 325 n. 39, 328), ‘nation’ worked well as the translation for a political meaning of ἔθνος (<italic>ethnos</italic>). Zeitlin found that the political meaning of <italic>ethnos</italic> was common in Josephus, who, for example, ‘could not apply the term Jewish <italic>Ethnos</italic>’ to the Idumaeans even though they were Jews by religion, since ‘they continued to live as separate states’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1476993X11428924">1936</xref>: 327). According to Zeitlin, because Diaspora Jews of the Second Temple period ‘were not controlled politically by those of Palestine’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1476993X11428924">1936</xref>: 325) and were subject to different foreign rulers, they ‘did not constitute one nation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1476993X11428924">1936</xref>: 321). Only Palestinian Jews could rightly be regarded as ‘the Jewish nation’ because only they formed an independent state during this period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1476993X11428924">1936</xref>: 345-47). Indeed, since Jews had different nationalities and did not form a single <italic>ethnos</italic> in the political sense, the only thing that united everyone ‘was their religion, their culture’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1476993X11428924">1936</xref>: 344; cf. 326, 341). In 1936, then, the English terms, ‘race’, ‘nation’ and ‘religion’ were distinct.</p>
<p>By 1959, however, Zeitlin could equate Sadducean belief in ‘a national God, an ethnic God’ with Sadducean belief in a ‘racial God’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1476993X11428924">1959</xref>: 248; cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1476993X11428924">1953</xref>: 376)—the distinction between ‘race’ and ‘nation’ was lost completely. The term ‘ethnic group’ appears to have contributed to this shift in usage. In 1936, the word ‘ethnic’ only appeared once, in Zeitlin’s discussion of the Idumaeans, who ‘did not assimilate with the Jews so as to become one <italic>ethnic group</italic> and … continued to live as separate states’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1476993X11428924">Zeitlin 1936</xref>: 327; original emphasis). ‘Ethnic group’ was apparently common enough in other contexts that Zeitlin saw no need to define it. It was presumably introduced here because of its etymological relationship to the Greek word <italic>ethnos</italic>, but perhaps also because contemporary instances of ethnic assimilation were familiar to his readers. In any case, Zeitlin implied that the <italic>Ioudaioi</italic> of Judaea were an ethnic group like the Idumaeans and allowed for Agrippa I’s full assimilation from the Idumaean <italic>ethnos</italic> to the Judaean <italic>ethnos</italic> despite his Idumaean ancestry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1476993X11428924">1936</xref>: 332). ‘Ethnic group’ had become more common by the 1940s. (The term occurs 9 times in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1476993X11428924">Zeitlin 1943b</xref>; 8 times in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1476993X11428924">1944b</xref>; and 11 times in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1476993X11428924">1945</xref>.) The frequent use of italics indicates that Zeitlin was still conscious of the term’s relative novelty in scholarship on ancient Judaism. There are, however, differences in how the term was applied, for in contrast to his 1936 essay, Zeitlin avoided the term in his discussion of Judaea, and denied that Jews in the Diaspora were an ethnic group at all (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1476993X11428924">1943b</xref>: 217, 221-22).</p>
<p>During the 1940s Zeitlin associated ‘ethnic group’ more closely with physical descent than he appears to have done in its solitary occurrence in 1936. A universal religion could be described as one that accepted everyone ‘regardless of race and status’ and as one ‘not bound to a particular <italic>ethnic</italic> group’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1476993X11428924">1943b</xref>: 221; original emphasis). ‘Ethnic group’ and ‘national’ terminology also coincided. According to Zeitlin, ‘The Jews in the early days did not segregate themselves as an <italic>ethnic unit</italic>. They were … designated by the <italic>nationality</italic> of their respective countries’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1476993X11428924">1945</xref>: 339; emphasis added). ‘Ethnic group’ also reappeared in Zeitlin’s discussion of later perceptions of the Jews from the church fathers to the modern era, and is there connected to both racial terminology and ‘nation’. Zeitlin claimed that ‘With the coming of Christianity into power … Only those who were born Jews were allowed to remain Jews’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1476993X11428924">1943b</xref>: 236). This could be described as the church’s theory ‘that the Jews are an <italic>ethnic</italic> group’ or a ‘nation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1476993X11428924">1943b</xref>: 238; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1476993X11428924">1944b</xref>: 91-94, 98; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1476993X11428924">1945</xref>: 307, 315, 318 for the juxtaposition of racial, national and ethnic terminology in Zeitlin’s discussion of medieval and post-Enlightenment Jewish thought). Thus, despite Zeitlin’s repeated assertions that ‘race’ and ‘nation’ corresponded to the Greek words <italic>genos</italic> and <italic>ethnos</italic>, and that the latter were distinguished in the ancient world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1476993X11428924">1944a</xref>: 321-22; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1476993X11428924">1944c</xref>: 181), the boundary between ‘race’ and ‘nation’ was beginning to collapse.</p>
<p>The connection between ‘ethnic group’ and ‘nation’ was doubtless aided by the fact that both terms can translate the Greek word <italic>ethnos</italic> (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1476993X11428924">1944b</xref>: 91, 115). Wider trends probably also contributed to Zeitlin’s eventual willingness to extend the meaning of ‘nation’ beyond a nation-state. (Consider Zeitlin’s survey of modern nationalism in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1476993X11428924">1944c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1476993X11428924">1945</xref>; as well as his comments on the emergence of the modern nation of Israel in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1476993X11428924">1953</xref>: 377-79; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1476993X11428924">1959</xref>: 241.) In the absence of an etymological connection, the link between ‘ethnic group’ and ‘race’ most likely also reflects broader changes in usage during the 1940s and 1950s. There are signs that ‘race’ acquired negative connotations and that ‘nation’ and ‘ethnic group’ were sometimes adopted as more neutral-sounding substitutes. In 1936, Zeitlin could declare without embarrassment that Second Temple Jews were ‘a purer race than any other of that time’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1476993X11428924">1936</xref>: 333). In 1944 a similar statement substituted ‘nation’ for ‘race’: ‘Judaism did not absorb other nationalities. It is the product of the genius of one people’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1476993X11428924">1944c</xref>: 225; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1476993X11428924">1943a</xref>: 38-39). A decade later, Zeitlin rephrased this conclusion with an emphasis on ethnicity: ‘Since Judaism represents the genius of one people there is also the ethnic element which unites them’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1476993X11428924">1959</xref>: 269). Nevertheless, ‘race’ did not immediately fall out of use—Zeitlin still used the term interchangeably with ‘nation’ and ‘ethnic group’ in 1959.</p>
<p>Minor adjustments to Zeitlin’s overall argument for a religious meaning of <italic>Ioudaios</italic> parallel these terminological changes. (Whether modifications to Zeitlin’s argument responded to his changing terminology or contributed to it is hard to say.) According to Zeitlin’s first essay, the national meaning of the Jewish <italic>ethnos</italic> persisted vestigially, but only in Judaea. After the successive defeats of 70 and 135 <sc>ce</sc>, when Jewish hopes for national independence were finally abandoned, the people ‘segregated themselves as a religious group’ defined neither by race nor nationality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1476993X11428924">1936</xref>: 347; see 341). During the 1940s Zeitlin once again restricted the scope of a national meaning of <italic>Ioudaios</italic> to Judaea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1476993X11428924">1943a</xref>: 16; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1476993X11428924">1944a</xref>: 363; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1476993X11428924">1945</xref>: 304), but he also attempted to push the religious-only view of the Jews farther back into the Second Temple period with the additional claim that by 70 <sc>ce</sc>, the Romans already regarded <italic>Ioudaios</italic> as a religious rather than a national designation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1476993X11428924">1943b</xref>: 227). Zeitlin also added the new argument that the religious-only view of Judaism was forcibly altered during the third and fourth centuries <sc>ce</sc> as a result of Christian anti-Semitism: ‘The term <italic>nation</italic> was coined by the Church to designate the Jewish people as an <italic>ethnic group</italic>, to show that Judaism was not a universal religion but the religion of that group’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1476993X11428924">1944b</xref>: 92; original emphasis; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1476993X11428924">1945</xref>: 348). Zeitlin’s use of ‘nation’ at a time when there was no question of political independence conflicts with his earlier claim that ‘nation’ could only be used in connection with the political entity of Judaea. It is not surprising, then, that the political-only use of ‘nation’ was later abandoned. By 1959, instead of arguing that the Jews of Judaea were a nation, Zeitlin attributed this view to the Sadducean minority (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1476993X11428924">1959</xref>: 248), and claimed that the more popular Pharisees, like the Romans, already regarded the term correctly as a religious label (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1476993X11428924">1959</xref>: 259-60).</p>
<p>In sum, Zeitlin’s essays depict multiple shifts in terminology and meaning between the 1930s and 1950s. Using his 1936 article as a baseline, we can see that ‘ethnic’ terminology became more common over time. By 1959 ‘ethnic group’ occurred more frequently than ‘race’, which may reflect a move away from ‘racial’ terminology. ‘Nation’, however, was still more common than ‘ethnic group’. There was therefore no linear development from ‘race’ to ‘ethnicity’. Despite Zeitlin’s initial insistence that the terms were separate, ‘nation’ eventually emerged as an alternative to ‘race’. Only ‘race’ and ‘nation’ (and cognate terms) occur in all nine Zeitlin articles that I examined for this study. If his discussion of modern nationalism is included, ‘national’ terminology is much more common than ‘ethnic group’. We may conclude that ethnic terminology contributed to a transition between racial and national terminology rather than replacing racial terminology on its own.</p>

<title>From Nation to Ethnicity</title>
<p>The mid-twentieth-century scholarship on <italic>Ioudaios</italic> that I consulted tends to avoid ‘race’ and shows a marked preference for ‘nation’ over ‘ethnic group’. Bromiley’s use of ‘nation’ and ‘national’ for ‘Volk’ and ‘völkisch’ in his English translation of Kuhn and Gutbrod is one example (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1476993X11428924">Kuhn 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1476993X11428924">Gutbrod 1965</xref>). Cuming, similarly, defined the ‘normal meaning of the word <italic>Ioudaios</italic>’ as ‘a member of the Chosen People, the worshippers of Jehovah, the <italic>nation</italic> of Israel, as distinguished from all other <italic>nations</italic>’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1476993X11428924">Cuming 1948/1949</xref>: 290; emphasis added). Lowe attempts to show that <italic>Ioudaios</italic> usually bears a geographical rather than a religious meaning, but works with ‘nation’ as a larger category, noting that ‘any nationality-word has a variety of stronger and weaker senses’, and that ‘in the ancient Mediterranean world almost every people had its own <italic>national</italic> religion, so that to be a member of that religion was in a sense to have that <italic>nationality</italic>’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1476993X11428924">Lowe 1976</xref>: 107, emphasis added; cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1476993X11428924">1981</xref>: 56-57).</p>
<p>Within the social sciences ethnic terminology was not widespread until the 1970s when ethnicity emerged as a burgeoning field of study in its own right, ‘with journals, conferences and research units devoted entirely to the subject’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1476993X11428924">Jones 1997</xref>: 51; cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1476993X11428924">Sollors 1981</xref>: 257-58). Scholarship on <italic>Ioudaios</italic> followed suit after a slight delay. I identified a few occurrences of ethnic terminology in the 1970s (M. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1476993X11428924">Smith 1971</xref>: 83, 85, 87; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1476993X11428924">Meeks 1975</xref>: 182; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1476993X11428924">Von Wahlde 1979</xref>: 234). By the 1980s the term is common (J. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1476993X11428924">Smith 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1476993X11428924">Kraabel 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1476993X11428924">Amir 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1476993X11428924">Solin 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1476993X11428924">Ashton 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1476993X11428924">Green 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1476993X11428924">Tomson 1986</xref>), and a transition is underway. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1476993X11428924">Von Wahlde (1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1476993X11428924">1982</xref>), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1476993X11428924">Segal (1986)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1476993X11428924">Cohen (1990)</xref> still prefer ‘national’ terminology to ‘ethnic’ language, but employ both; Mendels explains that ‘the issue of ethnicity … will for convenience be called here “nationalism”’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1476993X11428924">1992</xref>: 13). In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1476993X11428924">Goodman (1989)</xref>, the frequency is reversed, with ‘ethnicity’ more common than ‘nation’—and this trend continues (compare, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1476993X11428924">Cohen 1990</xref>: 204-209; with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1476993X11428924">Cohen 1999</xref>: 69-82). The growing dominance of ethnic terminology is illustrated by Schwartz, who refers to the <italic>Ioudaioi</italic> as members of a ‘race’ in 1992 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1476993X11428924">Schwartz 1992</xref>: 8-10); a decade later, the language of ‘race’ has been dropped with ‘ethnic’ appearing in its stead (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1476993X11428924">Schwartz 2005</xref>: 76). It is fair to say that by the late 1990s ethnicity had usurped the place previously occupied by ‘race’ and ‘nation’ (see also the overview in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1476993X11428924">Goodblatt 2006</xref>: 1-5). Around the same time, scholars of ancient Judaism as well as historians of the Greco-Roman world began paying increasing attention to the implications of studying the <italic>Ioudaioi</italic> and other ancient peoples as ethnic groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1476993X11428924">Jones 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1476993X11428924">Cohen 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1476993X11428924">Janowitz 2000</xref>; in Classics see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1476993X11428924">Hall 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1476993X11428924">2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1476993X11428924">Malkin 2001b</xref>). Goodblatt’s monograph on <italic>Jewish Nationalism</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1476993X11428924">2006</xref>) is an exception that proves the rule because he is obliged to defend his choice of ‘nationalism’ over ‘ethnicity’ in an introductory chapter. Although he can justify his use of ‘nationalism’ because his study focuses on life in Judaea and because of his special interest in ‘mass mobilization and action’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1476993X11428924">2006</xref>: 27; cf. 11, xiii), Goodblatt, like Mendels, concludes that it is ‘not helpful to distinguish ethnicity from nationality’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1476993X11428924">2006</xref>: 26). By the turn of the millennium, all major discussions of <italic>Ioudaios</italic>—including Goodblatt’s—employ ethnic terminology as a matter of course.</p>
<p>The transition from ‘nation’ to ‘ethnic group’ reflects the growing popularity of ethnic terminology, but it also responds to limitations in the contemporary meaning of ‘nation’. Zeitlin’s assumption that a nation requires an independent state is crucial to his argument that only residents of Judaea could be defined as a ‘nation’ because they alone were independent, while Diaspora Jews and the Jews after 70 <sc>ce</sc> were united by religion alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1476993X11428924">Zeitlin 1945</xref>: 338-40, 343-45). Here Zeitlin’s modern categories and conceptions control the evidence. Lowe’s understanding of ‘nationality’ is more sophisticated, but he repeats the idea that a religious as opposed to a geographical meaning of this nationality word is in view whenever <italic>Ioudaios</italic> is used in connection with Diaspora Jews or whenever Jews are contrasted with Gentiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1476993X11428924">Lowe 1976</xref>: 104, 107-109; cf. similarly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1476993X11428924">Schwartz 1992</xref>: 10, 14-15). Given the modern connotations of ‘nation’, Jewish existence outside the land appears anomalous. Mendels clarifies that there is no necessary ‘identity between the <italic>ethnos</italic> (people, nation) and a political state’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1476993X11428924">1992</xref>: 15), but persists in using ‘nation’. ‘Ethnicity’ avoids the problem of conflating ‘nation’ with independent state altogether because ‘ethnic groups’, in common discourse, often refer to immigrant groups who maintain their identity in foreign contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1476993X11428924">Chapman, McDonald and Tonkin 1989</xref>: 15); it is probably no coincidence that several early references to the <italic>Ioudaioi</italic> as an ethnic group occur in studies of Jews in the Diaspora (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1476993X11428924">Kraabel 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1476993X11428924">Green 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1476993X11428924">Goodman 1989</xref>).</p>
<p>While ‘ethnicity’ is normally an improvement over ‘nation’, the danger of anachronism remains. The switch from ‘nation’ to ‘ethnic group’ was encouraged by the etymological link between ethnicity and the Greek word <italic>ethnos</italic>, and the use of ‘nation’ as its standard English translation. The connection between <italic>ethnos</italic> and ‘ethnic’ group is transparent in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1476993X11428924">Zeitlin (1936</xref>: 327). M. Smith, similarly, regards occurrences of <italic>ethnos</italic> in Josephus as evidence that the Judaeans and Idumaeans comprised distinct ethnicities (M. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1476993X11428924">Smith 1999</xref>: 205, 218-19, 230-32; cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1476993X11428924">Horsley 1995</xref>: 44). For Cohen, the terms are equated: ‘The Jews (Judaeans) of antiquity constituted an <italic>ethnos</italic>, an ethnic group’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1476993X11428924">Cohen 1999</xref>: 7). It should be obvious, however, that an identification between <italic>ethnos</italic> and modern concepts of ethnicity cannot be established on the basis of etymology alone (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1476993X11428924">Goodblatt 2006</xref>: 4-5). Although the meanings of <italic>ethnos</italic> and ‘ethnic group’ may well overlap, such overlap is not inevitable; the terms must be examined on their own before they are equated with each other. In fact, the semantic range of <italic>ethnos</italic> is broad: ‘The Greek term <italic>ethnos</italic> … simply designates a class of beings (humans or animals) who share a common identification’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1476993X11428924">Hall 2002</xref>: 17; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1476993X11428924">Hall 1997</xref>: 35; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1476993X11428924">Østergard 1992</xref>: 31-32; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1476993X11428924">McInerney 2001</xref>: 55-57). After Homer the word came to be used frequently, but not exclusively, for ‘collectivities of people who came from the same place’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1476993X11428924">Esler 2003</xref>: 54); the standard Classical Greek lexicon proposes the English glosses ‘nation’ and ‘people’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1476993X11428924">Liddell <italic>et al</italic>. 1996</xref>: s.v). Some overlap therefore exists between <italic>ethnos</italic> and groups we would identify as ‘ethnic groups’, but this does not mean that ancient Greek speakers would define the boundaries of the group in the same way modern ethnicity theorists do. Nor can we assume that the ancient term was always used in the same way—as if the use of <italic>ethnos</italic> in connection with Idumaeans (Jos. <italic>JW</italic> 1.123; 4.270-83) means that the Idumaeans could not also be <italic>Ioudaioi</italic> (compare Jos. <italic>JW</italic> 1.155-56; <italic>Ant</italic>. 17.250-54).</p>
<p>Disagreement about the meaning of ‘ethnicity’ complicates the discussion further, for even when <italic>ethnos</italic> is appropriately translated by ‘ethnic group’ we must still determine how the English term is understood. Sometimes ‘ethnic group’ is equivalent to a group defined by physical descent. According to M. Smith, for example, ‘the ethnic history’ of Palestine is a history ‘of deportations of native stock and importations of aliens … To suppose that throughout such a history the native population retained its ethnic purity … would be fantastic’ (M. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1476993X11428924">Smith 1971</xref>: 87). The context makes clear that ‘ethnic purity’ is, for Smith, only retained by endogamy; ethnicity is a substitute for race. Meeks, on the other hand, emphasizes culture rather than physical descent:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>When pagan authors speak of <italic>Ioudaioi</italic> … the term denotes the visible, recognizable group with their more or less well-known customs, who have their origin in Judea but preserve <italic>what we would call their ‘ethnic identity’</italic> in the diaspora (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1476993X11428924">Meeks 1975</xref>: 182; emphasis added).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Meeks is also conscious of applying a modern concept to another historical context (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1476993X11428924">Tomson 1986</xref>: 120-26). In subsequent scholarship, this move is often taken for granted, and ethnic terminology is employed with no attempt at definition, as if its meaning is self-evident (e.g., J. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1476993X11428924">Smith 1982</xref>: 17-18; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1476993X11428924">Amir 1982</xref>: 38, 40; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1476993X11428924">Goodman 1989</xref>: 40-41; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1476993X11428924">Kraemer 1989</xref>: 51-52; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1476993X11428924">Harvey 1996</xref>: 84; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1476993X11428924">Williams 1997</xref>: 255, 257).</p>
<p>Even where the discussion is explicitly grounded in social-scientific literature on the theory of ethnicity, there is disagreement between those who argue that a belief in common ancestry is the <italic>sine qua non</italic> of ethnicity (A. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1476993X11428924">Smith 1981</xref>: 66; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1476993X11428924">Cohen 1999</xref>: 7; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1476993X11428924">Malkin 2001a</xref>: 10; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1476993X11428924">Hall 2002</xref>: 9-19; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1476993X11428924">Fenton 2010</xref>: 3) and those who argue that all aspects of ethnicity are potentially variable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1476993X11428924">Esler 2003</xref>: 44; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1476993X11428924">Buell 2005</xref>: 6-10). It is important to recognize that this debate concerns definitions of our modern concept of ethnicity, not ancient conceptions of what it meant to be a people. That a particular group jettisons what we consider essential to ethnicity does not mean that they conceived of their identity as fundamentally different. Conversely, that a modern theory of ethnicity allows for flexibility and the easy incorporation of outsiders does not mean that <italic>ethnos</italic>, or ancient self-conceptions regardless of terminology, were as fluid.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>An examination of the meaning of <italic>Ioudaios</italic> must therefore be attentive not only to the term itself but also to the shifting meanings of other ancient and modern terms that are used to define it, such as ‘race’, ‘nation’, ‘ethnicity’ and <italic>ethnos</italic>—all the while taking care to avoid inadvertently confusing modern concepts with ancient perceptions of ‘groupness’. Needless to say, it gets complicated. Buell correctly observes that ‘ethnicity’ is sometimes used as a more neutral-sounding synonym for ‘race’—given the negative connotations of ‘race’, employing ‘race’ rather than ‘ethnicity’ highlights problematic ethical issues both in ancient texts and in their modern interpreters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1476993X11428924">Buell 2005</xref>: 21). Yet employing ‘race’ and ‘ethnicity’ interchangeably can create a misleading impression of uniformity over time. As my analysis has shown, ‘race’ and ‘ethnic group’ were distinguished in the 1930s; the movement away from ‘racial’ terminology after World War II was gradual, creating an extended period of semantic overlap. Within scholarship on <italic>Ioudaios</italic> ‘nation’ served as a middle term between ‘race’ and ‘ethnicity’. More recent scholarship typically treats ‘ethnicity’ with greater sophistication and distinguishes it—once again—from ‘race’. This may be because scholars of ancient Judaism have tended to ignore scholarship on race that demonstrates that ‘race’, no less than ‘ethnicity’, is a malleable social construction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1476993X11428924">Buell 2005</xref>: 13-21; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1476993X11428924">2009</xref>: 174-77). But the scholarly perception that ‘ethnicity’ differs from ‘race’ remains nonetheless—and even Buell acknowledges that they are not entirely synonymous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1476993X11428924">2005</xref>: 14; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1476993X11428924">2009</xref>: 164). While Buell wants to expose the overlap between ‘race’ and ‘ethnicity’ and ‘to keep modern readers alert to the contemporary stakes of historical work’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1476993X11428924">2005</xref>: 21), my purpose is, in the first place, to describe the changing ways that the ancient term <italic>Ioudaios</italic> has been understood in modern scholarship. From a descriptive standpoint, it is better to distinguish ‘ethnicity’ and ‘race’ because they have often functioned in distinct ways; using them interchangeably obscures the conceptual history of each term.</p>
<p>This history is important. Shifts in meaning over the last seventy-five years have resulted in a confusing assortment of meanings for the same technical terms. To follow the scholarly debate over time without misconstruing or talking past other contributors, it is necessary to have some awareness of the variety of ways ‘race’ and ‘ethnicity’ have been used. We can also learn from the past. Although wider trends in scholarship certainly influenced the transition within biblical scholarship first from ‘race’ to ‘nation’, and then from ‘nation’ to ‘ethnicity’, the final shift from ‘nation’ to ‘ethnicity’ was most likely also prompted by a recognition that the idea of the modern nation-state does not correspond well to ancient perceptions of group identity. Any modern model runs the risk of confusing ancient and modern categories. Since conceptual frameworks can distort as well as illuminate, obscuring the wider field of vision while bringing new details into focus, it is important not to be too attached to a single approach. If the object of our inquiry is ancient perceptions of ‘groupness’, then insights from modern scholarship on race, nationalism, ethnicity—perhaps even religion—are all welcome. Of course, one must still decide on a term for ‘groupness’. In my view, ‘ethnicity’ remains a better alternative to ‘race’ or ‘nation’ for group labels, such as ‘Egyptian’ and ‘Parthian’, with which <italic>Ioudaios</italic> is often compared. Although both ‘race’ and ‘ethnicity’ are social constructions, ‘ethnicity’ is a broader term that generally includes other cultural and geographical characteristics, while ‘race’ has tended to be more narrowly associated with a belief in common ancestry both in popular thinking as well as in scholarship.</p>
<p>Whatever it originally meant, <italic>Ioudaios</italic> and its foreign cognates (<italic>Iudaeus</italic>, Jew, Juden, Juif, etc.) eventually came to designate, at least in part, an adherent of the religion of Judaism. Determining when this transition occurred and, especially, whether it had begun by the late Second Temple period, lies behind recent debate over the term’s translation. This debate will be the subject of the final article in this series.</p>
