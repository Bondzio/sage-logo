<p><italic>Objective</italic>. To investigate how ways of coping and traditional factors (age, sex, time postlaryngectomy, stage of disease, radiation, alaryngeal speech method) predict global quality of life, head and neck cancer–specific quality of life, and voice-related quality-of-life outcomes after total laryngectomy.</p>
<p><italic>Study Design</italic>. Cross-sectional survey.</p>
<p><italic>Setting</italic>. University-based laboratory and speech clinic.</p>
<p><italic>Subjects and Methods</italic>. Sixty-seven individuals who underwent total laryngectomy secondary to cancer were recruited from support groups and professional contacts. Individuals were at minimum 9 months postlaryngectomy. All outcomes were patient reported and included demographic data as well as a number of validated questionnaires: the Ways of Coping–Cancer Version (WOC-CV) scale, the Voice-Related Quality of Life (V-RQOL) scale, and the University of Washington Quality of Life (UW-QOL) composite and global QOL scores.</p>
<p><italic>Results</italic>. Fifty-three individuals identified a stressful aspect of their laryngectomy. As a set, traditional variables (age, time postlaryngectomy, alaryngeal speech method) accounted for only 5% of global QOL scores but between 25% and 30% of the variance of composite UW-QOL and V-RQOL scores. Time postlaryngectomy was the strongest traditional predictor. Ways of coping accounted for 23% to 32% of all QOL scores. Avoidant coping strategies (both cognitive and behavioral escape) were among the strongest predictors of poorer QOL. When traditional variables were combined with ways of coping, they together accounted for 26% to 46% of the variance of QOL outcomes.</p>
<p><italic>Conclusion</italic>. Coping is important to consider when evaluating postlaryngectomy outcomes, above and beyond traditionally investigated factors.</p>

<body>
<p>Total laryngectomy continues to be a primary method of treatment for those diagnosed with laryngeal cancer. After total laryngectomy, individuals must learn a new method of verbal communication and cope with changes to breathing and swallowing. Thus, one common outcome measure includes consideration of quality of life (QOL). Outcome studies have found that QOL is generally affected during the first few months postlaryngectomy, but after 12 months, many patients adapt.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599812437315">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599812437315"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599812437315">4</xref></sup> While these results are optimistic, there is still a portion of this population who experience a long-term impact on QOL.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0194599812437315">5</xref></sup> As a result, it is important to identify factors that predict QOL so that targets for rehabilitation may be identified.</p>
<p>While the vast amount of literature in QOL after total laryngectomy has focused on traditional outcome predictors such as the patient’s age, sex, alaryngeal speech type, or disease severity, most studies have revealed only weak to moderate relationships between these factors and QOL.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599812437315">4</xref></sup> Few studies have examined psychosocial variables and their relationships with QOL.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0194599812437315">6</xref></sup> Investigating how factors such as coping relate to QOL is critical because coping has been shown to relate more strongly to QOL in other health conditions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0194599812437315">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>Coping strategies are cognitive and behavioral efforts used to manage the internal and external demands of stressful circumstances.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0194599812437315">8</xref></sup> An encounter is considered stressful when it is perceived as potentially dangerous to one’s physical or psychological well-being. Once an experience is deemed stressful, the degree of threat is assessed, and coping strategies are used to reduce potential harm. Rather than being a static component of personality, coping is multidimensional; individuals cope in different ways depending on the context and stressors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0194599812437315">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>A variety of frameworks have been proposed to explain coping.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0194599812437315">8</xref></sup> Dunkel-Schetter et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0194599812437315">10</xref></sup> found that 5 patterns of coping emerged among cancer survivors, including (1) seeking and using social support, (2) focusing on the positive, (3) distancing, (4) cognitive escape avoidance, and (5) behavioral escape avoidance. Seeking and using social support includes behavioral strategies such as asking for advice or talking to others about feelings. Rediscovering what is important in life or feeling as though a challenging experience (eg, cancer diagnosis) has resulted in personal growth are examples of focusing on the positive. Distancing refers to separation from the stressful event by using strategies such as refusing to think about it. Cognitive escape avoidance uses thoughts to escape from the stressful event, such as wishing it would go away. Finally, behavioral escape avoidance includes behaviors such as avoiding being with people or trying to feel better by drinking or using drugs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0194599812437315">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>Coping patterns may be adaptive or maladaptive depending on the context. For example, using cognitive escape-avoidance strategies may be adaptive when dealing with short-term stressors but maladaptive when faced with more chronic stressors, such as ongoing cancer treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0194599812437315">11</xref></sup> In cancer patients, cognitive and behavioral escape-avoidance strategies predict elevated levels of distress,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0194599812437315">10</xref></sup>chronic disease progression, depression,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0194599812437315">12</xref></sup> mortality, and poor QOL outcomes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0194599812437315">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0194599812437315">14</xref></sup> In contrast, optimism, seeking social support, and focusing on the positive are inversely related to pain and distress and relate directly to fewer comorbid health conditions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0194599812437315">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>While these results have been investigated in other cancer survivors, very few studies have examined these relationships after total laryngectomy,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0194599812437315">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0194599812437315">16</xref></sup> and no study has examined how coping strategies predict QOL compared with traditional variables. This study investigated the following: (1) What is the relationship between traditional variables (eg, stage of disease, age, sex, time posttreatment, presence of radiation, communication method) and QOL after total laryngectomy? (2) What is the relationship between patterns of coping and QOL? and (3) How much do traditional variables and coping patterns together predict QOL after total laryngectomy?</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section2-0194599812437315">
<title>Subjects</title>
<p>Subjects were recruited through support groups, professional email lists, and professional contacts. All subjects had undergone total laryngectomies at least 9 months prior to participation to avoid the fluctuation of QOL scores that occur immediately postsurgery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599812437315">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599812437315">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599812437315">4</xref></sup> Subjects included adults with no additional medical conditions (beyond head and neck cancer treatment) that affected speech and were able to complete questionnaires in English. Individuals were paid for their participation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0194599812437315">
<title>Data Collection</title>
<p>The University of Washington Institutional Review Board approved the procedures in this study. Subjects were either sent a login to a secure Web site or mailed a packet and were given 3 weeks to complete the questionnaires before being contacted once for follow-up.</p>
<sec id="section4-0194599812437315">
<title>Demographic measures</title>
<p>Demographic information included age, sex, primary language, marital status, ethnic background, education, and work status. Medical history included site of cancer diagnosis, stage of cancer, date of diagnosis, type(s) and length of treatment, date of laryngectomy, and primary communication method.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0194599812437315">
<title>University of Washington Quality of Life (UW-QOL) questionnaire</title>
<p>The UW-QOL (V4) was used to measure disease-specific QOL.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0194599812437315">17</xref></sup> The UW-QOL consists of 12 items measuring health-related domains that are averaged to derive a composite QOL score ranging from 0 (worst health-related QOL) to 100 (best health-related QOL). The second part of the UW-QOL consists of 3 questions related to global QOL. Each item is calculated independently to represent a global QOL score, ranging from 0 (worst QOL) to 100 (best QOL). Because the first 2 global questions measure health-related QOL and relate to the composite health-related QOL score, only the general QOL question was included for analysis in this study. Global QOL was therefore derived from the question, “Considering everything in your life that contributes to your personal well-being, rate your overall quality of life during the past 7 days.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0194599812437315">
<title>Voice-Related Quality of Life (V-RQOL) scale</title>
<p>The V-RQOL<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0194599812437315">18</xref></sup> is a 10-item questionnaire that measures the impact of voice disorders, including total laryngectomy, on voice-related QOL.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0194599812437315">19</xref></sup> Participants respond to each item using a 5-point Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (<italic>not a problem</italic>) to 5 (problem is as <italic>bad as it can be</italic>). Responses are added to determine a total score (0-50), and then scores are transformed (0-100), with higher scores representing better voice-related QOL.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0194599812437315">
<title>Ways of Coping–Cancer Version (WOC-CV) questionnaire</title>
<p>The WOC-CV was adapted from the Ways of Coping–Revised questionnaire, resulting in a 51-item questionnaire, which has been published previously.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0194599812437315">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0194599812437315">14</xref></sup> Subjects were first asked to identify a stressor they had experienced in the past 2 weeks related to their laryngectomy and then rate it on a 5-point Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (<italic>not stressful</italic>) to 5 (<italic>extremely stressful</italic>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0194599812437315">10</xref></sup> Participants then responded to 51 statements consistent with various coping strategies and indicated the degree to which a strategy was used; response options ranged from 0 (<italic>not used</italic>) to 3 (<italic>used a great deal</italic>). Scaled scores for each item result in summary scores (averaged across particular items) that represent the frequency of engagement for each coping pattern: (1) seeking or using social support, (2) focusing on the positive, (3) distancing, (4) cognitive escape avoidance, and (5) behavioral escape avoidance. Higher scores represent higher frequency of engagement.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0194599812437315">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>First, descriptive data were calculated for all of the traditional variables, as well as QOL scores. To determine relationships among traditional variables and QOL measures, χ<sup>2</sup>, Spearman ρ, and Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated. Next, the 5 WOC-CV coping pattern scores were determined. WOC-CV subscales were summarized in terms of both mean and proportional scores (ie, proportion of total coping effort by type). Relationships among coping strategies and QOL were determined using Pearson correlation coefficients.</p>
<p>To determine the variance predicted in QOL scores by coping patterns, by traditional variables, and by both, a number of regression analyses were performed. Only individuals who identified a “stressful situation related to laryngectomy” (ie, a score of 2 or more) were included because coping is used to regulate stressful events. Patient and disease demographic variables were entered into multiple linear regression analyses as predictor variables, and QOL scores (composite and global UW-QOL scores and V-RQOL scores) were entered as predicted variables. Next, the 5 coping pattern summary scores were entered into multiple linear regression analyses, with the coping patterns as predictor variables and QOL scores as predicted variables. Finally, both coping patterns and traditional variables were entered into linear regression analyses, with coping strategies and traditional variables as predictor variables and UW-QOL and V-RQOL scores as predicted variables.</p>

<title>QOL and Traditional Variables</title>
<p>Overall, moderate QOL scores were found, with the mean UW-QOL composite score being 76.62 (SD, 13.53); the UW-QOL global score was somewhat lower (mean, 68.66; SD, 18.16). The mean voice-related QOL score also was moderate (mean, 68.42; SD, 19.61).</p>
<p>To investigate relationships between QOL and traditional variables, a number of correlation analyses were performed (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0194599812437315"><bold>Table 2</bold></xref>). Results showed a mostly moderate relationship between time postlaryngectomy and QOL; those who were more distant survivors had better QOL. A significant, but weak, relationship was found between age and composite UW-QOL, with older individuals having better scores. Communication method also had a significant, but weaker, relationship with V-RQOL. Post hoc tests revealed no significant differences across alaryngeal speech methods: electrolarynx (mean, 77.28; SD, 9.29), tracheoesophageal (mean, 66.45; SD, 19.31), and esophageal speech (mean, 72.94; SD, 24.33). V-RQOL was significantly worse for those who used writing/augmentative devices (mean, 40.50; SD, 21.02).</p>

Forty-two percent of subjects (n = 28) indicated limitations in physical ability, appearance, or lifestyle due to cancer were the most stressful aspects of their total laryngectomy. The second most frequent stressor was fear of uncertainty about the future due to cancer, reported by 28% (n = 19). Acute pain symptoms or discomfort from illness or treatment and problems with family or friends related to cancer were indicated for 9% (n = 6). The mean stressfulness rating was 2.3, or somewhat stressful (SD, 0.90), with 53 individuals reporting at least a somewhat stressful event (&gt;2) related to their laryngectomy.</p>

<p>Age, time postlaryngectomy, and communication method first were used to predict QOL scores. Traditional variables were entered independently and as a simultaneous set. In general, time since total laryngectomy predicted the most amount of variance (equivalent to percentage predicted) of all QOL scores, and speech method was the strongest predictor of V-RQOL (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0194599812437315"><bold>Table 5</bold></xref>). Next, the 5 patterns of coping were entered independently and as a set. Behavioral escape avoidance and cognitive escape avoidance were the strongest predictors, particularly for the composite UW-QOL and V-RQOL. Finally, traditional variables and the 5 patterns of coping (WOC-CV) scores were entered as predictors of QOL. Together, the traditional variables accounted for 25% to 30% of the symptom-specific QOL scores, with weaker prediction for global QOL (4.5% variance). The 5 patterns of coping predicted a similar, albeit a somewhat stronger, amount of the variance (range, 23%-32%). When all demographic variables were combined with all 5 patterns of coping as a set, they accounted for 26% to 46% of the variance (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0194599812437315"><bold>Table 5</bold></xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study investigated how traditional variables compared with patterns of coping in predicting QOL after total laryngectomy. As a set, traditional variables accounted for 25% to 30% of the variance of symptom-specific QOL scores but not global QOL. Ways of coping accounted for 23% to 32% of all QOL scores. When traditional variables were combined with ways of coping, together they accounted for 26% to 46% of the variance. The results reveal the unique contribution of ways of coping to QOL outcomes after total laryngectomy and have implications for research and clinical practice.</p>
<sec id="section18-0194599812437315">
<title>Traditional Variables and QOL</title>
<p>The sample in this study was representative of the laryngectomy population and was comparable to demographics found in other research.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599812437315">2</xref></sup> Most participants in this study were recruited through an online support group, and all participants were paid. Thus, results related to coping and QOL need to be interpreted with these demographics and potential biases in mind.</p>
<p>Overall, results from this study revealed moderate QOL scores after total laryngectomy, consistent with previous literature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0194599812437315">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0194599812437315">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0194599812437315">20</xref></sup> The relationship between traditionally investigated variables (eg, TNM stage of disease, age, sex, time postlaryngectomy) and QOL revealed that most variables were weak predictors. For example, although previous research has shown a relationship between increased severity of disease (higher T-stage) and lower QOL,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599812437315">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0194599812437315">13</xref></sup> no significant relationship was found in this study between these variables. This result is consistent with more recent studies indicating that treatment type may override stage when relationships are examined.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599812437315">1</xref></sup> The weak relationship with radiation also needs to be interpreted with caution since 84% of participants had received radiation; this limits the strength of this finding.</p>
<p>In the present study, significant relationships were found between communication method and QOL. In fact, communication method was the strongest predictor of V-RQOL. These results need to be interpreted with caution because of the small sample size of the nonspeech group (n = 5). Among those who used alaryngeal speech methods, no significant differences were found with regard to speech type.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0194599812437315">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>As predicted, increased time postlaryngectomy was associated with higher QOL scores and was the strongest independent predictor of all traditional variables.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599812437315">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0194599812437315">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0194599812437315">4</xref></sup> Subjects in the present study were on average 84 months postlaryngectomy. Terrell et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0194599812437315">1</xref></sup> found that even 10 years after treatment for head and neck cancer, patients reported problems in specific domains related to QOL. Thus, while QOL may fluctuate during the first few months posttreatment, it may improve over time.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-0194599812437315">
<title>Ways of Coping and QOL</title>
<p>In this study, the most frequently reported stressful problem related to having a laryngectomy was limitations in physical ability, appearance, or lifestyle (42%), followed by uncertainty about the future due to cancer (28%). Overall, subjects rated their problems as somewhat stressful (mean rating, 2.3). These stressors are consistent with those reported by cancer survivors in general, although the degree of stress has been reported higher, particularly among those who were recently diagnosed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0194599812437315">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0194599812437315">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the present study, distancing was the coping pattern used most frequently, while behavioral escape and cognitive escape avoidance were used least. List et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0194599812437315">14</xref></sup>also found that behavioral escape avoidance was used least among recently diagnosed head and neck cancer patients; however, their sample engaged in seeking social support most frequently. How these patterns of coping change over time and how they differ between different types of cancer patients should be further examined.</p>
<p>In this study, mostly negative correlations were found between coping patterns and QOL. These results contrast with previous research, which has identified certain coping patterns as adaptive (ie, associated with positive outcomes) or maladaptive.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0194599812437315">16</xref></sup> The only exception to this trend was the modest correlation showing that those who engaged in focusing on the positive also reported increased global QOL scores. Yet this strategy did not contribute significantly to symptom-specific QOL scores (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0194599812437315"><bold>Table 5</bold></xref>). The results suggest that individuals who used any coping strategy, particularly behavioral and cognitive escape avoidance, demonstrated poorer outcomes and that these relationships may have overridden any so-called positive coping strategies. Use of these particular strategies has predicted poorer QOL in previous studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0194599812437315">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0194599812437315"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0194599812437315">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>The present study was the first to examine how traditionally investigated variables compared to coping in predicting QOL after total laryngectomy. The traditional variables accounted for only a modest (4.5%) amount of the global QOL score but predicted about a quarter of the variance in the composite UW-QOL and V-RQOL scores (range, 25%-30%). The 5 patterns of coping predicted a similar amount of the variance in QOL scores (range, 23%-32%), including global QOL. Results suggest that coping patterns may influence QOL at least as much as traditional factors, particularly for overall QOL. Together, traditional variables and coping patterns predicted 26% of the global QOL scores, 39% of V-RQOL, and 46% of the composite UW-QOL.</p>
<p>Results from this study are consistent with the literature, which has revealed that coping strategies may uniquely contribute to QOL.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0194599812437315">6</xref></sup> However, a stronger contribution of coping patterns for predicting outcomes was found in this study compared to other populations. For example, Aarstad et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0194599812437315">13</xref></sup> found that only 10% of the common variance of QOL was related to coping in other head and neck cancer patients. However, when psychological factors (coping/personality trait) were combined, they accounted for about 30% of the variance in QOL. How factors such as personality and coping independently contribute to QOL need further study.</p>

<title>Future Research and Clinical Implications</title>
<p>The WOC-CV was used in this study to investigate patterns of coping after total laryngectomy. However, results may be interpreted only at the group level to reveal patterns of coping in large populations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0194599812437315">9</xref></sup> Scales appropriate for measuring individual coping patterns should be studied before results are applied clinically. If certain ways of coping are found to result in poorer outcomes, these strategies may be targeted for intervention, resulting in improved QOL.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0194599812437315">22</xref></sup> Future studies investigating how coping and other psychosocial factors affect QOL are warranted to optimize rehabilitation and improve QOL postlaryngectomy.</p>
