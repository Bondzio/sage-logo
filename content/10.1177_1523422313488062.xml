<title>The Problem</title>
<p>Incivility, also referred to as bullying, emotional abuse, and mobbing, has increasingly become an issue in today’s workplace. It is widely recognized that workplace incivility has significant negative impact on both individuals and organizations. Nevertheless, there is a lack of general research attention to this topic within the human resource development (HRD) community. Such lack of essential understanding may hinder HRD practitioners’ capability of recognizing uncivil behaviors at work and designing effective HRD interventions to address them. Further, within the HRD practitioner community, there is a dearth of knowledge of how to use findings of research on workplace incivility to inform practice and help creating a civil work environment.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1523422313488062">
<title>The Solution</title>
<p>This study presents a real-life case in which scholarship has informed and enhanced practice. It demonstrates how Estes and Wang’s (2008) research on workplace incivility has been used to assist one college in the United States to address issues related to civility. This scholarly informed initiative resulted in the inclusion of workplace civility in the College’s strategic plan, as well as development and delivery of workplace civility training workshops to over 800 employees across the College. Due to the success of the initial program, more efforts are being made to develop additional trainings.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1523422313488062">
<title>The Stakeholders</title>
<p>Findings of this case study will benefit multiple stakeholders. This case of success provides valuable lessons which can be helpful to organizational leaders, policy makers, and human resource developers in their own endeavor to identify/address incivility related issues and foster a civil and healthy work environment for employees. In addition, this case study demonstrates how research can be applied to enhance practice, therefore showing both scholars and practitioners one way to bridge the gap between research and practice.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Incivility, also referred to as bullying (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1523422313488062">Glendenning, 2001</xref>), emotional abuse, and mobbing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1523422313488062">Davenport, Schwartz, &amp; Elliott, 2002</xref>), has increasingly become a prevailing phenomenon in the workplace (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1523422313488062">Estes &amp; Wang, 2008</xref>). Workplace incivility is now widely recognized to have significant impact on both individuals and organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1523422313488062">Cortina, Magley, Williams, &amp; Langhout, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1523422313488062">Estes &amp; Wang, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1523422313488062">Lutgen-Sandvik, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1523422313488062">Pearson, Andersson, &amp; Porath, 2000</xref>; Pearson &amp; Porath, 2004, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1523422313488062">2005</xref>). It is costly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1523422313488062">Pearson &amp; Porath, 2005</xref>), widespread (Pearson &amp; Porath, 2004), and may be a precursor to workplace aggression and violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1523422313488062">Lutgen-Sandvik, 2003</xref>). At the individual level, experiencing workplace incivility may result in reduced work effort or job resignation from employees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1523422313488062">Lim &amp; Cortina, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1523422313488062">Pearson &amp; Porath, 2005</xref>) and adverse psychological effects such as anxiety, confusion, low self-esteem, depression, and even suicide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1523422313488062">Cortina et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1523422313488062">Davenport et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1523422313488062">Estes &amp; Wang, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1523422313488062">Pearson &amp; Porath, 2005</xref>). In addition, sexual harassment was found to be more likely to occur in an uncivil work environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1523422313488062">Lim &amp; Cortina, 2005</xref>). As a result, employees experiencing incivility may engage in retaliation and sabotage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1523422313488062">Skarlicki &amp; Folger, 1997</xref>). This phenomenon is described as “spirals of incivility” by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1523422313488062">Andersson and Pearson (1999)</xref>, meaning individuals replay incivility with increasingly intense forms of incivility, even to the level of outright aggression.</p>
<p>Individual-level effects also have important implications for group process (e.g., conflict, communication, cohesion) and performance through emotional contagion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1523422313488062">Barsade &amp; Gibson, 2007</xref>). When individuals disrespect one another, these uncivil interchanges can spiral out of control toward outright aggression, or even get misdirected toward innocent bystanders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1523422313488062">Andersson &amp; Pearson, 1999</xref>). If this happens frequently over time, an organizational culture of conflict may emerge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1523422313488062">Pearson &amp; Porath, 2005</xref>). For organizations, incivility can lead to an organizational culture of dissatisfaction and conflict (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1523422313488062">Estes &amp; Wang, 2008</xref>), higher turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1523422313488062">Kane &amp; Montgomery, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1523422313488062">Tepper, 2000</xref>), lost productivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1523422313488062">Gonthier, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1523422313488062">Pearson et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1523422313488062">Pearson &amp; Porath, 2005</xref>), absenteeism, and financial losses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1523422313488062">Cortina &amp; Magley, 2009</xref>).</p>

<title>Problem and Significance</title>
<p>Given the detrimental consequences workplace incivility can cause on multiple levels, this phenomenon demands serious, continuous attention (Pearson &amp; Porath, 2004) from both researchers and practitioners. Nevertheless, while “recent years have seen increasing scholarship on subtle, nonphysical manifestations of interpersonal mistreatment in the workplace” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1523422313488062">Cortina, 2008</xref>, p. 55), workplace incivility is still “generally not well understood and accordingly not recognized as an issue needing attention” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1523422313488062">Estes &amp; Wang, 2008</xref>, p. 218). Within the human resource development (HRD) community, a very small number of publications on workplace incivility was available (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1523422313488062">Estes &amp; Wang, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1523422313488062">Reio &amp; Ghosh, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1523422313488062">Zauderer, 2002</xref>) until a special issue exploring HRD’s role in addressing workplace incivility and violence was published in <italic>Advances in Developing Human Resources</italic> in 2011 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1523422313488062">Ghosh, Jacobs, &amp; Reio, 2011</xref>). The collection of eight articles in this issue systematically examined a wide range of issues related to incivility, including the role of power in construction of incivility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1523422313488062">Callahan, 2011</xref>), negative mentoring as deviant workplace behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1523422313488062">Ghosh, Dierkes, &amp; Falletta, 2011</xref>), diversity and incivility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1523422313488062">Githens, 2011</xref>), supervisor and coworker incivility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1523422313488062">Reio, 2011</xref>), workplace bullying (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1523422313488062">Bartlett &amp; Bartlett, 2011</xref>), hate crimes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1523422313488062">Jacobs &amp; Scott, 2011</xref>), and workplace violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1523422313488062">Kormanik, 2011</xref>). Most recently, empirical studies such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1523422313488062">Doshy and Wang (2013)</xref> which explored employees’ strategies for coping with workplace incivility were also presented at the Academy of Human Resource Development annual research conference. All these research efforts by HRD scholars signal the increasing recognition of the need for studying this phenomenon. However, compared to HRD research on other topics, the volume of workplace incivility studies remains quite small. Such lack of adequate research on and essential understanding of workplace incivility in the field of HRD may hinder HRD practitioners’ capability of recognizing uncivil behaviors at work and designing effective HRD interventions to address them. Since a primary role of HRD professionals is to facilitate the creation of a healthy and productive work environment, we call for prompt and systematic actions to be taken by both HRD scholars and practitioners in understanding and examining issues related to workplace incivility.</p>
<p>Another component we would add is the long-existing problem of bridging the gap between research and practice. While this issue has been well recognized by scholars and practitioners, both parties still struggle to find ways to effectively disseminate and apply research findings to enhance organizational practices. This article demonstrates an example of how to do so.</p>
<p>In the remainder of the article, we start with the introduction of the case, followed by a brief description of the process that leads to the identification of the solution. We then discuss the specific solution employed by the organization and its impact. We conclude with implications and questions for critical thinking for future research and practice.</p>

<title>The Case</title>
<p>The context of this case study is Empire State College (hereinafter abbreviated as the College). The College is a public institution, part of the State University of New York (SUNY) “dedicated to enabling motivated adults, regardless of where they live or work, to undertake a rigorous academic program, and earn a university degree” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1523422313488062">Empire State College Fact Book, 2010-2011</xref>, p. 1). In a recent article about the Open Learning movement, three Empire State College administrators offered their description of the College as an “antiestablishment” institution designed to break the “shackles of tradition” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1523422313488062">Benke, Davis, &amp; Travers, 2012</xref>, p. 145).</p>
<p>In order to carry out its unique mission of serving adult reentry learners all over the state of New York and beyond, the College is arranged in a distributed model. The College has 1,753 employees, of whom 721 are full time and 1,032 are part time (Empire State College Fact Book). Out of the College’s full-time faculty members, 198 are women, accounting for two thirds of the full-time faculty; 96% of full-time faculty holds terminal degrees. There are 228 support staff employees (of which 16 are part time and 212 are full time), 300 professional employees (of which 253 are full time and 47 are part time), 58 management confidential employees (of which 54 are full time and four are part time). The College is distributed across the State of New York, with regional learning centers in Metropolitan New York, Hudson Valley, Long Island, Central New York, Genesee Valley (Rochester area), Niagara Frontier Center (Buffalo area), and Northeast Center (Albany area). There is a Center for Distance Learning, headquartered in Saratoga Springs, which houses the instructional designers, faculty, administrators, and staff for the College’s online division. The School for Graduate Studies offers graduate certificates and degrees, and the Center for International Programs.</p>
<p>The College serves about 20,000 students annually through centers across the state of New York and online through the Center for Distance Learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1523422313488062">Empire State College Fact Book, 2010-2011</xref>, p. 1). With a mission to serve adult learners, the College offers a variety of locations and modalities to allow adult learners to design their own degree programs that are aligned with their academic, intellectual, and professional goals, and take courses in modalities that fit into their schedules. Faculty work with students one on one in a variety of formats such as online groups, in online courses, and in residency-based hybrid courses. Faculty members mostly have autonomy in determining what they will offer, and in what modality. The first author is a full-time faculty member located in the Central New York region, and she has been employed by the College for 10 years.</p>
<p>In 2009, a member of the faculty of the College (also the first author of this article) proposed an ad hoc Committee on Workplace Civility. The proposal was inspired by the first author’s observation that the College had an opportunity to learn and to grow into a culture that had a shared understanding of respect and civility. The first author came across <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1523422313488062">Estes and Wang’s (2008)</xref> article on workplace civility in <italic>Human Resource Development Review</italic>. This article provided the first author with much needed knowledge of the terminology related to workplace civility, and inspired her to make the proposal mentioned above. Given the instrumental role of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1523422313488062">Estes and Wang’s (2008)</xref> article, we provide below a brief overview of the core ideas of the article that informed the new initiative launched by the college in her effort to create a civil workplace.</p>
<sec id="section7-1523422313488062">
<title>Summary of Estes and Wang’s Article</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1523422313488062">Estes and Wang (2008)</xref> provided an integrative review of workplace incivility which covers the definitions, characteristics, trends, causes, and impact of this phenomenon on individual and organizational performance. The authors proposed a conceptual framework that consists of eight constructs relevant to workplace incivility. They are performance, organizational context (management philosophy, organizational culture), social systems and social interactions, coworker beliefs, mental disorders, moral maturity, and psychological contract. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1523422313488062">Table 1</xref> presents a summary of the eight constructs.</p>

<p>These eight elements directly and indirectly contribute to the occurrence of workplace incivility. Based on the conceptual analysis, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1523422313488062">Estes and Wang (2008)</xref> provided HRD practitioners with some specific guidelines in three areas: (a) creating an incivility-free environment, (b) establishing zero tolerance, and (c) building authentic leadership. This article has inspired the case and the intervention we will demonstrate below.</p>

<sec id="section8-1523422313488062">
<title>The Process to Identify a Solution</title>
<p>After the proposal for an ad hoc Committee on Workplace Civility was approved by the institution’s senate, the founding committee chair collaborated with the senate chair to determine the optimal approach to the work of the newly formed committee. This committee had no precedent in the College, and it was deemed important that the committee represent a cross section of professional functions, and geographic locations. The committee was comprised of a cross section of faculty, professional employees, and staff members. The initial committee’s charge was to explore issues of workplace civility, to explore various approaches to strengthen a climate of civility, and to make recommendations for next steps. After a series of conference calls over several months, the committee determined that an optimal approach would be for the founding chair of the committee to partner with the Affirmative Action Officer of the College to design, develop, and offer a training workshop for all offices and all employees across the College.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1523422313488062">
<title>Solution: Workplace Civility Training Workshops</title>
<p>The developers of the actual training program included the first author and the College’s Affirmative Action Officer. Anticipating a relatively short window of time in which the workshop would have to fit, the program developers designed a scalable model that could be delivered in a time span ranging from 90 min to 3 hr. The “flex” built into the program that allowed for this time scalability was the extent to which participants would engage in case scenarios. There were three fundamental components in the training program. The first part aims to introduce the language and framework of workplace civility, bullying, and related terms as provided by scholars (including <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1523422313488062">Estes &amp; Wang, 2008</xref>). The primary instructional method here is lecturing with Power Point presentations. The trainers alternated in guiding participants through the terminology.</p>
<p>The second part of the program focuses on the concept of the “Continuum of Civility” which the developers adapted from the work of Dr. Kirsten Schwehm of Louisiana State University (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1523422313488062">2011</xref>). The goal was to introduce participants to the idea that actions that lack civility can be conceptualized subjectively and individually, along a continuum ranging from a trivial slight to verbal or physical assault. The instructional methods in this section were engaging and interactive. After offering an explanation of the idea of a Continuum of Civility, the facilitators then ask participants to provide their own individual responses to several different types of actions. Participants were asked to “rate” their response to each action, ranging from a “1” which means that the <italic>action does not affect them</italic> or upset them, moving along the numeric continuum up to “10” which indicates that the person feels very <italic>negatively affected by the action</italic>. Examples of actions offered in this part of the training program include:</p>
<list id="list1-1523422313488062" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>A coworker regularly uses obscene language when you’re having private conversation.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The receptionist refers to you as “honey.”</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>A colleague stands outside of your office while you are on the phone, trying to get your attention and motioning for you to hurry up.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>During a meeting, a colleague begins berating and speaking negatively about another colleague who is not present.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>A colleague raises her voice during a meeting, so loud that others in the vicinity can hear the argument.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>You overhear an employee telling a homophobic joke; it’s not the first time.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>An employee begins massaging your shoulders when you’re working at your computer stating that you look “up tight.”</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>You receive an email from an employee—the subject of the email is work-related but the tone is strong and harsh.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>As a way to show an employee that you are displeased with his behavior you ignore him.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Participant responses typically range for each of these actions, and participants are invited to provide their rationale for their ratings. This part of the workshop creates an environment in which issues are raised in a safe, open, and nonconfrontational environment. Sometimes the discussions become lighthearted and humorous, which contributes to the safety and openness of the workshop.</p>
<p>The third part of the training program is knowledge application through case studies, in which participants are divided into small groups of three to five members, and are given approximately 15 minutes to read the case and respond to the questions that follow the case. The developers wrote a variety of cases that involved incivility and bullying issues across organizational hierarchy and functions. (Please see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-1523422313488062">appendix</xref> for an example case scenario.) After working through case scenarios, the workshop ends with facilitators providing suggestions and implications for how to create a culture of respect and civility, and participants share their reflections and their aspirations.</p>
<p>These workshops were conducted on various occasions, including 2009 New Mentor (which means Faculty) Orientation, the Professional Employee Conference, the Center for Distance Learning Conference, Long Island Center, President’s Cabinet, Genesee Valley Center, Central New York Center, the Support Staff Conference, and the Metropolitan Center. To date, over 800 employees of the College have participated in this training. The outcomes of the program have been obtained from three sources. The first source was the first-hand, face-to-face communications, emails, and phone calls from participants to the trainers, extending their appreciation for this training workshop. Participant feedback from these sources has suggested that the workshop has opened up a space for learning and dialoguing about issues related to incivility and bullying. As a result, employees now have the language and ability to identify and express their concerns about challenging interpersonal exchanges at work which might have been persistent over a period of time. The second source was Empire State College Climate Survey, which began in 2010 and now includes questions related to civility. The Office of Planning and Institutional Effectiveness has provided the survey results to the founding Committee Chair and the President of the College, and will continue to do so, so that the impact of this training program can be tracked overtime. The third source was a feedback form distributed by the trainer to participants at the end of the workshop. This form includes questions regarding the degree of learning about the subject, the level of preparation and knowledge/skills of the trainers, and the relevance of the program. So far, the evaluation feedback generated through these various means has been consistently positive.</p>

<title>Implications and Lessons Learned</title>
<p>Findings of this case study have implications and benefits for multiple stakeholders. The case of success presented in this article provides valuable lessons which can be helpful to organizational leaders, policy makers, and human resource developers in their own endeavor to identify/address incivility related issues. With an enhanced knowledge and awareness, they are better positioned to help organizations to foster a civil and healthy work environment for employees. In addition, this case study demonstrated how research has been successfully applied to enhance practice; therefore, showing both scholars and practitioners one way to bridge the gap between research and practice.</p>
<p>However, it is not the intent to claim that one training program is a panacea or a cure-all for the complexities and challenges inherent in a large and distributed organization like the one included in this article. In this case, the training intervention proved to have a positive impact on both employees and an organization with a unique mission of adult emancipatory education, a rich tradition of academic rebelliousness, and a physical distribution of employees across the state of New York. What contributed to the success was the unique positions assumed by the first author of this article (being both a practitioner and a faculty of the selected organization). Her dual roles facilitated the receptivity of her organization toward learning, growing, and developing. Further, what warranted the success of the new initiative was also the level of support received from multiple stakeholders. In other words, the trainers did not have to “advertise” the training program or solicit venues. Rather, the workshop was promoted by faculty members, support staff, professional employees, and at senior administrative meetings. As a result, each training request was initiated by the receiving party rather than the trainers. Below are five key lessons we learned from this case.</p>
<list id="list2-1523422313488062" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Research is valuable in informing and enhancing practice, as evidenced by the case of Empire State College. Therefore, it is important that practitioners take the initiative to seek research findings to guide their practice.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>By the same token, it is equally important that researchers find ways to disseminate their research findings in the practitioners’ world. For example, we encourage researchers to reach out to organizations, identify issues that are relevant to them (e.g., workplace incivility), and use these issues as topics of their research. One way to do so is to form partnership with practitioners (either in practice or scholarship or both).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>To ensure the success of an intervention, obtaining organizational support is critical. In this case, the practitioner did not initiate the workplace civility training program alone. Instead, she sought approval by the College senate first and then collaborated with the College Affirmation Action Officer in the development and delivery of the training program. Involving multiple stakeholders helps increase the likelihood of success.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>It was also evident that the practitioner in this case (the first author) played an important educative role. Not only did she educate herself about the topic of workplace incivility by reading the scholarship work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1523422313488062">Estes and Wang (2008)</xref>, she also educated organizational leaders (committee, college senate, AAO), as well as organizational members (trainees) through the training programs.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>To sustain the success, it is critical to go beyond the implementation of an intervention and conduct a systematic review of its outcome. In this case, the practitioners designed a multisource, multiphase evaluation system to obtain participants’ feedback on the training program. By doing so, they were able to monitor the quality of the program continuously.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>By offering this case study we hope readers (both scholars and practitioners) will be inspired to think about ways in which they can leverage their scholarship, practice, or both, to enhance the well being, the productivity, the ethics, the diversity, the financial performance, or any desired organizational goals and outcomes.</p>

<title>Critical Thinking: Moving Beyond the Case</title>
<p>In the section below, the authors have moved beyond the boundaries of their unique case and have challenged you, as the reader, to think more critically about the problem and solution they presented. Specifically, within the reflection questions, you are encouraged to think deeply about how this case, and others like them, could affect your work as a scholar, scholar-practitioner, or practitioner. Take time to answer these questions from your own perspective, or with others in small group to explore a diversity of ideas and applications.</p>
<list id="list3-1523422313488062" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>How can scholars make their work accessible to practitioners who may be not only informed by the scholarship, but actually emboldened, as the primary author was, to initiate an organization wide training program?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Which areas of organizational performance can incivility be related to or should be examined further?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>For incivility issues, for those who can influence through committees, policy, work procedures, which resources or strategies are useful or essential to apply knowledge and insights from academic research? How should workplace incivility interventions be measured or incorporated into daily work routine/organizational rules? How receptive do you think your organization would be to training on workplace incivility?</p></list-item>

<title>Appendix: Case Scenario</title>
<sec id="section12-1523422313488062">
<title>Scenario One: Nontenured Faculty</title>
<p>Jane is a nontenured, assistant professor who joined Empire State College 2 years ago. She recently had a conversation with you, in confidence, explaining that her 1st year at the college was great, but during the last 8 months she feels tremendous pressure from John, a senior faculty member at the Center.</p>
<p>Jane explains: “Yeah, it’s really bizarre; John and I really hit it off in the beginning. We had great academic discussions about my research. He explained how things worked here at the college and he even helped me by reviewing and recommending changes to an article I was working on. I must say that he really helped me get my feet on the ground, but now things have changed. Since my article was published in the Chronicle, John rarely speaks to me. When I’ve stepped into his office to chat, he looks over his glasses at me and glaringly states that he’s too busy to talk. When I’ve ask him if he would like to grab some lunch, he declines. For the past 4 months at our center meetings he’s been really disrespectful when I try to participate. I volunteered to sit on ________ committee because I thought it would be good experience for me, but he said aloud ‘thanks but no thanks, we’re all set.’ Then when I spoke up at last week’s meeting, I saw him from the corner of my eye shaking his head ‘no’ and rolling his eyes.”</p>
<p>Jane tells you that she doesn’t know what to do. She explains that John rarely speaks to her, and that she regularly overhears him inviting colleagues to have lunch, but he doesn’t include her. She states that when she has tried to address the issue with him he comments that he’s too busy to get into it. Jane tells you that she’d look for another job but feels locked in because her kids are already enrolled in school.</p>
