<p>Scholars have long pointed to James Madison’s argument for constitutional veneration in <italic>Federalist</italic> No. 49 to illustrate what they see as Madison’s fear of democratic politics and frequent constitutional reform. This article challenges that consensus, first, by showing that Madison said the opposite several years earlier and, second, by revisiting the historical and textual context of <italic>Federalist</italic> No. 49. It argues that even as Madison praises veneration he offers serious reasons to be wary of it.</p>

<p>Studies of American constitutionalism often rely on one of two well-known dichotomies. The first is the famous contest between Thomas Jefferson and Alexander Hamilton, between a strict construction of the Constitution with an emphasis on consent and a broad construction of the Constitution with an emphasis on sovereignty. The second is perhaps less well worn, but equally important. This dichotomy pits Jefferson against James Madison. Under Jeffersonian constitutionalism, institutions should represent and embody the will of the people, and constitutional change should be frequent because each generation has the right to give its consent to its fundamental laws. Under Madisonian constitutionalism, institutions should mediate the will of the people, and constitutional change should be relatively infrequent because people need a constitution they can “venerate” and tinkering with it every generation would undermine this requirement of government. This article aims to reorient our understanding of Madisonian constitutionalism by qualifying Madison’s argument for constitutional veneration.</p>
<p>Madison’s <italic>Federalist</italic> No. 49 is the most well known and most important of his recommendations of constitutional veneration.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1065912911427451">1</xref></sup> In that essay, Madison criticized a provision of Thomas Jefferson’s 1783 proposed constitution for Virginia, which would have provided for a new constitutional convention whenever two-thirds of any two of the three departments called for it. Madison noted that Jefferson’s proposal had “great force” because it seemed “strictly consonant” with “republican theory” in that it would refer constitutional disputes back to the people, who “are the only legitimate fountain of power.” But Madison also listed “insuperable objections against the proposed recurrence to the people.” In particular, Madison argued that appeals to the people would undermine “veneration” toward the law and would at the same time raise regime-level questions that would appeal to the passions rather than to the reason of the public (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1065912911427451">Hamilton, Jay, and Madison 2000</xref> [hereafter <italic>FP</italic>], 322-25).</p>
<p>Because Madison so clearly says that prejudice is a necessary substitute for reason, there has been little interpretative uncertainty about No. 49. Scholars have typically found in this essay support for the larger argument that Madison was a “conservative” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1065912911427451">Adair 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1065912911427451">Meyers 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1065912911427451">Wills 1981</xref>, 28; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1065912911427451">McCoy 1991</xref>, 48-49; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1065912911427451">Burstein and Isenberg 2010</xref>, 178). To be sure, scholars are still divided concerning Madison’s commitment to democracy and concerning the consistency of his political thought over time.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1065912911427451">2</xref></sup> But even those scholars who emphasize a more democratic Madison acknowledge the difficulty the essay makes for their case (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1065912911427451">Gibson 2005</xref>, 13; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1065912911427451">Sheehan 2005</xref>). More generally, <italic>Federalist</italic> No. 49 is the clearest indication for scholars that Madison did not share Jefferson’s belief in constitutional change by appeal to the people. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1065912911427451">Jack Rakove (1999b)</xref>, for example, appeals to <italic>Federalist</italic> No. 49 as a counterweight to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1065912911427451">Bruce Ackerman’s (1984</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1065912911427451">1991</xref>) reading of No. 40, which Ackerman reads as supporting Ackerman’s theory of recurring constitutional moments. In a <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1065912911427451">forthcoming</xref> article, Dustin Gish and Daniel Klinghard argue that Madison wrote No. 49 to counter what they see as Jefferson’s attempt to use his <italic>Notes on the State of Virginia</italic> to influence the writing and ratification of the Constitution. In their words, Madison believed that reason was an insufficient foundation for republican politics, so he argued that the Constitution, like the Almighty, had to be “<italic>venerated</italic> and <italic>revered</italic>.”</p>
<p>This article makes a first step in challenging this consensus. After presenting the main argument and difficulties of No. 49, the article offers two reasons to qualify Madison’s defense of constitutional veneration. First, it argues that the historical context suggests that the argument for veneration fit Madison’s strategic objective in preventing a second convention. Second, it offers a new reading of <italic>The Federalist</italic> to show that Madison’s recommendation of veneration itself offers reasons to be wary of constitutional veneration.</p>
<p>The historical context offers reason enough to be cautious about hanging too much on the argument from veneration. As we will see, Madison did not always think that Jefferson’s proposal was a bad idea. In fact, he endorsed it in 1785 when making recommendations for a new constitution in Kentucky. Madison’s concern then was that constitutional mistakes become more settled over time and thus more difficult to correct—a concern he repeats throughout his life. With regard to his critique of Jefferson and praise of veneration, it is obvious that Madison wrote and published his <italic>Federalist</italic> essays for a particular objective, convincing Americans to ratify the Constitution.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1065912911427451">3</xref></sup> But what is often underappreciated in studies of <italic>The Federalist</italic> is that Madison wrote his essays on the republican credentials of the Constitution just at the time when the prospects for ratification had taken a turn for the worse. Specifically, at this time, Madison’s goal was convincing moderates, particularly in Virginia, that a second convention would not get them what they wanted. This article argues that Madison wrote the essays on the republicanism of the Constitution with these moderates in mind. Because these moderates could have been attracted to a second convention as a compromise, Madison focused these essays on the problems of deliberation. Because Jefferson’s proposal could potentially give rhetorical and democratic heft to this compromise, Madison brought up Jefferson’s proposal to demolish it.</p>
<p>In addition to the historical context, <italic>The Federalist</italic> itself suggests reasons to be wary of constitutional veneration. Instead of reading the essay as a discreet treatment of Jeffersonian appeals to the people (Nos. 49–50), or as a step in the argument concerning separation of powers (Nos. 47–51) simply, this article examines the essay as closing Madison’s larger discussion of the requirements of republican government (beginning in No. 37). Read this way, we are reminded that Madison goes out of his way, and further than any other supporter of the Constitution, to clearly elucidate the ways in which the Constitution, and any conceivable constitution, is flawed. Moreover, Madison does not attempt to understate these flaws by calling them unimportant or solvable in the future. Rather, he attributes them to the problems of deliberation, not only by the people but also by elites, and in an important part of this argument, Madison makes the troubling confession that the republican remedy for the republican disease, the extended republic, makes deliberation worse during times of founding.</p>
<sec id="section1-1065912911427451">
<title>The Case for Veneration in <italic>Federalist</italic> No. 49</title>
<p>In <italic>Federalist</italic> No. 49, Madison offers four reasons to reject Jefferson’s proposal. The first objection is that it would not accomplish its goal, that is, it would not prevent the legislative branch from benefiting from the arrangement by allying itself with one of the other two departments. The second brings us to the subject of this article: such appeals would deprive the government of “that veneration which time bestows on everything.” Such veneration is necessary, because “government rests on opinion.” The problem, however, is that “the reason of man, like man himself, is timid and cautious when left alone, and acquires firmness and confidence in proportion to the number with which it is associated.” It is worth noticing that Madison’s reference to the “reason” of men, combined with his discussion of the “veneration” men have toward their governments, calls attention to the tension between unattached pursuit of truth and love of country. But even while seeming to remind readers of this perhaps irreconcilable tension between philosophy and citizenship, Madison makes a different point about reason. Rather than emphasizing the danger reason presents to the political order, Madison instead depicts reason among individuals as needing “firmness and confidence.” Reason needs to be “fortified,” and time and agreement with other citizens “are known to have a double effect” in such fortification. Veneration seems to support reason rather than work against it (<italic>FP</italic> 322-25).</p>
<p>Madison’s discussion of public reason makes sense when we see that Madison’s understanding of reason rests on the compatibility between reason and respect for the laws. Madison says that considerations on how to fortify reason should be disregarded “in a nation of philosophers,” because “a reverence for the laws would be sufficiently inculcated by the voice of an enlightened reason” (<italic>FP</italic> 323). Furthermore, such a “nation of philosophers is as little to be expected as the philosophical race of kings wished for by Plato,” but he does not explain what characterizes the difference between the reason of the philosophic and that of the ordinary. One possible explanation is that philosophic reason is not at odds with republican politics. Support for this explanation can be found in the logic that animates <italic>Federalist</italic> No. 10. In that essay, Madison acknowledges that there is such a thing as a “permanent and aggregate interest of the community,” but it seems that the “reciprocal influence” between passions (especially self-love) and opinions alters what might otherwise be a rational estimation of the community’s permanent and aggregate interest (<italic>FP</italic> 54-55). But this is to say that a proper regulation of the passions could allow for a better calculation of interest, even those interests that are permanent and aggregate. Instead of being fundamentally opposed to the law, philosophic reason elevates timid and cautious reason, which, if left alone, would disrespect the law because it wrongly regards the law as standing in the way of interest. If philosophic reason were widespread, republican politics would spring naturally and rationally from interest.</p>
<p>Madison turns more explicitly to the passions in the third, and what he calls a “more serious,” objection to Jefferson’s proposal. Such appeals to the people, he writes, would disturb the “public tranquility by interesting too strongly the public passions.” Because constitutional conventions are “experiments” that “are of too ticklish a nature,” it is best not to attempt them when unnecessary. But having just undergone a revolution, Madison must explain how the recent revolution can be distinguished from others:
<disp-quote>
<p>We are to recollect that all the existing constitutions were formed in the midst of a danger which repressed the passions most unfriendly to order and concord; of an enthusiastic confidence of the people in their patriotic leaders, which stifled the ordinary diversity of opinions on great national questions; of a universal ardor for new and opposite forms, produced by a universal resentment and indignation against the ancient government; and whilst no spirit of party connected with the changes to be made, or the abuses to be reformed, could mingle its leaven in the operation.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In this striking passage, Madison catalogs the ways in which the passions were aligned for a change in government that could be compatible with respect for the laws. The thrust of this argument is that passions arising from local and particularistic concerns were pushed aside by passions against the common enemy and passions for common leaders against that enemy. In other words, because philosophic reason is not to be expected, constitutional founding rests on the dubious hope that benign passions will rule the more ordinary, more dangerous, passions that typically arise to answer ticklish questions. By this logic, a founding should not be repeated (<italic>FP</italic> 323-24).</p>
<p>The fourth objection is that the appeal to the people would not solve the problem requiring the appeal in the first place because, as the department closest to the people, the legislative branch would most likely benefit from such an appeal. Even when the executive and judicial departments call for an appeal to the people to correct an overbearing legislature, it would be likely that the people would side with the legislative branch and further constitutionalize legislative tyranny. This practical point helps clarify why the ordinary passions would be dangerous. Because the executive and judicial departments are “too few in number” and, in the case of the latter, too separated by their tenure from the people, it is likely that the people will favor the legislative department. After all, the members of the legislative branch are “distributed and dwell among the people at large.” Furthermore, they have “connections of blood, of friendship, and of acquaintance” with the most “influential part of society,” and the “nature of their public trust implies a personal influence among the people.” To be sure, there would be times when the “usurpations of the legislature might be so flagrant and so sudden, as to admit of no specious coloring,” so that the executive and judicial departments would enjoy an advantage. But even in these moments, Madison predicts, the “public decision” “could never be expected to turn on the true merits of the question.” Rather,
<disp-quote>
<p>It would inevitably be connected with the spirit of preexisting parties, or of parties springing out of the question itself. It would be connected with persons of distinguished character and extensive influence in the community. It would be pronounced by the very men who had been agents in, or opponents of, the measures to which the decision would relate.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>From this catalog of the advantages of the legislative branch, and from Madison’s prediction of the outcome of an appeal to the public, perhaps even in periods of ordinary politics, we catch a glimpse of what Madison sees as the character of public opinion during periods of founding or refounding. The people seem to be unable to serve as judges in the contest between the departments either because they lack the ability to see beyond their own immediate connection to a member of Congress or because they fall under the influence of legislative coalition leaders who have a stake in the outcome of the appeal to the public.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The passions, therefore, not the reason, of the public would sit in judgment. But it is the reason, alone, of the public, that ought to control and regulate the government. The passions ought to be controlled and regulated by the government.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This passage is striking for the clarity in which Madison records his doubts about the ability of the public to sort through appeals but is also notable for its apparent tension with his previous comment concerning reason. In the previous passage, Madison went out of his way to write that philosophers can see that reason and reverence for the laws are compatible, but ordinary citizens cannot because their reason is timid and cautious. Here, however, Madison seems to offer <italic>public</italic> reason as an alternative to passion, which is to say that public reason is possible.</p>
<p>There are two possible ways to resolve this tension. The first, or strong, explanation is that public reason is possible only when the government <italic>controls</italic> and <italic>regulates</italic> the passions of the people (<italic>FP</italic> 325). This in turn suggests that veneration stands in as a milder form of governmental control and regulation of the passions. That is, it seems for Madison that the discoveries of the modern science of politics—the extended republic and legislative checks and balances—are insufficient in that they require a prior grounding on allegiance to a particular constitution. This allegiance must be almost spiritual in its devotion, which is to say that the constitution must be beyond contestation and deliberation. For those scholars who emphasize ancient and/or conservative strands in Madison, this passage is important in its suggestion that government shapes its citizens. The second, or soft, explanation is that public reason emerges from constitutional deliberation. Under this explanation, separation of powers and other institutional arrangements elevate the public passions and interests into something close to public reason. That is, the constitutional process itself stands in as a substitute to the appeal to the people and renders unnecessary the question whether the people are able to sort through an appeal to the public.</p>
<p>Even if either or both explanations are persuasive, they leave other puzzles about the argument for veneration. First, consider Madison’s rhetorical strategy. Why would Madison take the time to consider and dismantle a friend’s proposal about the Virginia constitution when nobody else had proposed applying that solution to the national constitution?<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1065912911427451">4</xref></sup> Second, given the lack of discussion regarding Jefferson’s proposal, it is somewhat strange that Madison went out of his way to recommend veneration on the grounds that veneration is necessary for any constitution when the actual task at hand was to replace one constitution (the Articles) with another (the Constitution of 1787). That is, why would Madison argue so vigorously for veneration when moderates or fence-sitters might want the assurance that they would be able to tinker in the future? More broadly, if we must venerate the constitution only because the alternative is worse, we then venerate even though the object of our veneration is perhaps unworthy of our longtime attachment. This could be a matter of choosing the less bad option, but what does veneration recommend when the opportunity arises for the people or their representatives to form a better constitution? Madison, after all, would have been the first in 1788 to say that the Articles were unworthy of veneration.</p>

<title>The Kentucky Constitution in 1785</title>
<p>There is no lack of scholarship on Madison’s thinking before the Convention of 1787. What has not been noticed, however, is that Madison’s first written analysis of Jefferson’s 1783 proposal was not <italic>Federalist</italic> No. 49 but rather his hitherto underappreciated 1785 letter to Caleb Wallace (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1065912911427451">Madison 1973–77</xref> [hereafter <italic>PJM</italic>], 8:350-59). Wallace was a friend from Princeton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1065912911427451">Rakove 1999a</xref>, 926; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1065912911427451">Ketcham 2006</xref>, 29) who had moved to the Kentucky territory and solicited Madison’s advice on writing a state “in embryo.” Although scholars have treated the letter in solving other problems within Madison’s constitutional thought (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1065912911427451">Rakove 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1065912911427451">1987</xref>, 429; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1065912911427451">1997</xref>, 1056; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1065912911427451">1999b</xref>, 1946; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1065912911427451">2004</xref> 8; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1065912911427451">Kramer 1999</xref>, 626; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1065912911427451">2006</xref>, 738; and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1065912911427451">Rosen 1999</xref>, 67), none has commented on the tension between this letter and No. 49.</p>
<p>In contrast to <italic>Federalist</italic> No. 49, Madison used the 1785 letter to endorse the idea of a planned review of the constitution. Wallace had asked whether there should be a “periodical review of the Constitution.” Madison answered, “Nothing appears more eligible in theory nor has sufficient trial perhaps been yet made to condemn it in practice.” Without naming Jefferson, Madison brought up the proposal from Jefferson’s 1783 constitution: “That a Majority of any two of the three departments should have authority to call a plenipotentiary convention whenever they may think their constitutional powers have been Violated by the other Department or that any material part of the Constitution needs amendment.” In contrast to No. 49, Madison offered at least a limited endorsement: “I should think it both imprudent &amp; indecent not to leave a door open for at least one revision of your first Establishment.” The reason why it would be imprudent is because constitution makers would have more “resources” for support of a constitution as well as more “lights” in framing one in “15 to 20 years hence.” The reason why it would be indecent is because a “handful of settlers” ought not frame a perpetual constitution for what will be a “populous country.” Accordingly, Madison recommended that the framers of a Kentucky constitution make “necessary and certain” a future revision of the constitution, which, in this context, meant including a provision like Jefferson’s proposal.</p>
<p>Before we consider the significance of this letter, we should consider three alternative explanations. The first is that there is a difference between a single appeal in the shape of a convention and a <italic>process</italic> for repeated appeals to the people. So, under this explanation, Madison’s reference to “revision” is closer to the amendment process than a new convention. And this would not be all that surprising because Madison in No. 49 does allow the amendment process as a “constitutional road” to constitutional correction (<italic>FP</italic> 322). But this explanation is unsatisfactory. In the letter to Wallace, Madison clearly speaks of “at least one revision” of the Kentucky constitution, not amendment, and the implication is that he endorses Jefferson’s proposal, at least for Kentucky. In fact, Madison changes Jefferson’s proposal to make such constitutional conventions <italic>more frequent</italic> by requiring only a “majority” instead of two-thirds of two of the three departments. The second alternative explanation is that there is a difference between writing constitution for a new territory or state and writing a new constitution for the United States. The premise for this objection is clear: Madison might have believed that the stakes were lower and therefore the states could experiment with and even rewrite their constitutions. But this is not a distinction Madison employs in No. 49. Rather, he considers and rejects Jefferson’s proposal for appeals to the people as a proposal for any constitution. A third and related explanation is that Madison changed his mind. Perhaps the deepening crisis under the Articles, or Shay’s Rebellion, prompted a new appreciation for the law. Or, to apply Banning’s thesis that Madison learned from the Convention, perhaps Madison learned from his participation in the Convention that writing a constitution was more difficult and dangerous than he and Jefferson had supposed.</p>
<p>Even if the second and third explanations were true, they would still leave some questions answered. If it is true that Madison believed that a state rather than the union should use Jefferson’s proposal, we would then have to conclude that Madison believed constitutional veneration is not always a good. Similarly, if it is true that Madison changed his mind because he came to see how fragile union really was, then we must again understand how the special importance of this particular union factors in Madison’s understanding of veneration. Both points suggest that we need to consider in greater detail the context of Madison’s endorsement of veneration. This point is illustrated by yet another of Madison’s analyses of Jefferson’s 1783 proposed constitution (<italic>PJM</italic> 11:281-295). Only several months after writing No. 49, Madison sent another friend in Kentucky his criticisms of Jefferson’s constitution. In this otherwise extensive analysis, Madison this time omitted any discussion of the proposal for institutionalized appeals to the people or of veneration. Perhaps Madison had changed his mind again or, this time, did not think Jefferson’s proposal merited notice.</p>
<p>It is possible, then, that the 1785 endorsement of Jefferson’s proposal reveals an important aspect of Madison’s constitutional thought. In an argument that Jefferson himself might have made, Madison claimed that time brings about certain resources and that these resources suggest a kind of progress. The people would become more ready for constitutional government, perhaps because they would improve their skills in constitutional design by additional discoveries in the science of politics. Furthermore, Madison’s distinction between a handful of settlers and a populous country underscores the differences between the few who make the law and the many who are governed by them. Under this explanation, then, Madison did support constitutional veneration in certain instances, but he also believed that progress and basic considerations of justice could outweigh unwavering attachment to a flawed constitution. This is precisely what Madison said about the Articles of Confederation. As he put it in the letter to Wallace, the Articles were “faulty” in two ways: the authority by which they were formed and their actual form. Nevertheless, “the Issue of an experiment has taught the difficulty of amending it.” More important, the prospects for reforming the Articles were getting worse with time. With each passing year, the “depths to which it will have stricken its roots” will “counterbalance any more auspicious circumstances for overturning it.” Because progress and justice require a way to transform the constitution, the framers of the Articles were imprudent and indecent for making their constitution perpetual. Experience under the Articles shows that veneration of the constitution is not always a virtue.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1065912911427451">
<title>Madison’s Political Objective in 1788</title>
<p>When Madison published No. 49 in February 1788, the advocates for the Constitution had lost momentum and were facing an increasingly difficult problem in the ratification process. In the weeks following the Convention, Madison had anticipated the problem in a letter to George Washington (<italic>PJM</italic> 10:225): on one hand, there was a “very strong probability” that at least nine states would “pretty speedily” ratify, yet, on the other, nobody knew what would happen to the states that refused. By December, this possibility was becoming more likely, and the practical problem had the potential to have enormous political consequences, as at this point Madison knew that ratification was uncertain in two of the most important states—New York and Virginia. Madison hoped that the ratification problem would solve itself: difficult states such as New York and Virginia would have no choice but to ratify because nine states already had.</p>
<p>But the practical political problem was given a theoretical twist when opponents to the Constitution in those two states proposed amendments to the Constitution in the form of a bill of rights. The problem was that these proposals took on the language of “conditional” ratification, ratification only on the condition that the Constitution was amended to include a bill of rights. From Madison’s perspective, then, these amendments were disconcerting not only because they had the potential to undo the structural arrangements of the Constitution but also because even an innocuous declaration of rights threatened to create varying levels of ratification and thus make a legitimate basis for union impossible.</p>
<p>By January, Madison and his allies had lost ground. Massachusetts was no longer a sure bet: Madison had asked Washington in late December to use his influence in Massachusetts (<italic>PJM</italic> 10:334), and, on January 20, he wrote letters to Washington and Randolph calling the situation there “very ominous to the Constitution” (<italic>PJM</italic> 10:398-99). At the same time, Madison learned that, instead of ratifying, North Carolina had surprised everyone by deciding to postpone their decision until Virginia had decided. Now, because the anti-Federalists in Virginia were gaining momentum, and because he thought South Carolina and Georgia might follow North Carolina in waiting on Virginia, Madison had reason to fear that no more than eight states would ever ratify.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1065912911427451">5</xref></sup> On January 10, he wrote Randolph, “I consider everything therefore as problematical from Maryland Southward” (<italic>PJM</italic> 10:356). Madison’s strategy, that nine states would easily ratify and force the more reluctant states into the fold, was in shambles. When No. 49 was published on February 2, Madison had reason to believe that the prospects for ratification had improved in Georgia and South Carolina (<italic>PJM</italic> 10:455), but there was a new cause for Madison’s concern. A new version of Jefferson’s <italic>Notes on the State of Virginia</italic> had been published in Philadelphia on January 23, 1788 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1065912911427451">Scigliano 2000</xref>, xxviii).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1065912911427451">6</xref></sup> According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1065912911427451">Burstein and Isenberg (2010</xref>, xix, 180), Jefferson had long “sought to undermine the ratification process” and “hoped to prompt a supplementary second convention.” And according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1065912911427451">Gish and Klinghard (forthcoming)</xref>, Jefferson had arranged for his <italic>Notes</italic> to be published to influence the ratification and even the Constitution itself. Even if we do not accept these arguments about Jefferson’s intentions (and I do not), it is possible that Madison believed that Jefferson’s proposal for an appeal to the people in a different context would help the anti-Federalist cause by providing a second convention as a compromise with the authority of Jefferson’s name and the normative argument from democracy. Madison, after all, knew that Jefferson’s proposal had so much force that Madison himself had praised it in 1785.</p>
<p>Madison’s concern about a second convention is revealing in that it rested on his assumption that the supporters of the amendments would find it impossible to agree on <italic>any</italic> list of amendments (<italic>PJM</italic> 10:325-26). The problem, then, was not only that the opponents to the Constitution would change the Constitution but rather that they would disagree so much about how to change the Constitution that they would agree only to call a convention to discuss future changes to the Constitution. This is to say that, from Madison’s calculations, the seemingly safe fallback position to a set of amendments was actually the more likely and the more dangerous scenario. Madison’s task in the winter of 1788, then, was to show well-intended critics of the Constitution, first, that a conditional ratification would result not in a bill of rights but rather a convention and, second, that this convention would be dangerous. This second point would be especially difficult because, as Madison’s 1785 letter so nicely shows, both justice and progress seem to be on the side of planning for “at least one revision” of the Constitution.</p>
<p>There is no better indication of Madison’s anxiety than his January 10, 1788, letter to the governor of Virginia, Edmund Randolph. Randolph was crucial to ratification in Virginia, and Madison could not be sure about his intentions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1065912911427451">7</xref></sup> As a member of the Virginia delegation to the Convention of 1787, Randolph had set the convention in the direction toward a strong national government by introducing Madison’s Virginia Plan, yet Randolph refused to sign the final document on the grounds that he would first need to assess opinion in Virginia. Although Randolph did hold several objections to the Constitution, he stated he was most concerned that the requirement of accepting or rejecting to the Constitution “in toto” would lead “anarchy and civil convulsions,” particularly if nine states did not ratify it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1065912911427451">Madison 1987</xref>, 656-67). Madison wrote his letter in response to Randolph’s letter of December 27, in which Randolph had enclosed his own letter to the Virginia Assembly recommending a second convention. This letter had been published in pamphlet form and reprinted in newspapers “from Virginia to Massachusetts” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1065912911427451">Maier 2010</xref>, 89).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1065912911427451">8</xref></sup> Madison’s response contained three parts. First, Randolph was making a mistake in letting his name be connected with men like Patrick Henry and the disaffected elements of Massachusetts, whose opposition was ultimately aimed at destroying the union. Second, even if a second convention did not include those who wanted to dissolve the union, it would be counterproductive because the “ground” taken by even the honest critics of the Constitution in the “different quarters” “forbids any hope of concord among them.” Third, and most important, because the “bulk of mankind” is not up to forming a constitution and instead “must follow the judgment of others not their own,” a second convention would undermine the respect for the leading characters of <italic>both</italic> the first and the second conventions, thus rendering a constitution by convention impossible.</p>
<p>Madison’s distinction between the bulk of mankind and men like Randolph calls to mind his argument in No. 49 that Jefferson’s proposal might work for philosophers but not by ordinary citizens. What has not been appreciated seriously enough, however, is how clearly Madison records his skepticism of deliberation among leading politicians during moments of founding. Madison warned Randolph that a second convention would “give a loose to human opinions,” which “must be as various and irreconcilable concerning theories of Government, as doctrines of religion.” A second convention of leading politicians could not work, and it would undermine the first. Like an appeal to the wider public, it would reveal the shaky ground on which the first Convention rested. But Madison did not keep this unsettling view private, for he made this very point in No. 37, which was published one day after he had composed his letter to Randolph. The connection between Nos. 37 and 49 and the letter to Randolph is not a new discovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1065912911427451">Rakove 1999a</xref>, 1955), but the chronological proximity of Madison’s surprisingly dark assessment of constitutionalism in the letter and in <italic>Federalist</italic> No. 37 is reason enough to return to the context in which the praise of veneration emerges. Read in light of Madison’s larger discussion of republicanism within <italic>The Federalist</italic>, Madison’s argument from veneration is considerably more circumscribed than scholars have noted.</p>

<title>The Case against Veneration in <italic>The Federalist</italic></title>
<p>Madison’s <italic>Federalist</italic> No. 37 expands on the comment to Randolph and provides more reason to be wary of constitutional veneration. Broadly, the point of the essay is to make the transition in <italic>The Federalist</italic> to discussion of the republican credentials of the Constitution. It includes the claim that the Federal Convention enjoyed an unusual “exemption” from the usual “party animosities” in most “deliberative bodies,” going so far as to conclude that the Federal Convention was evidence of divine intervention.</p>
<p>But what is important about No. 37 is the degree to which Madison goes out of his way to catalog the ways in which the Constitution was less than perfect. Madison offers five “difficulties,” and three are of interest.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1065912911427451">9</xref></sup> One difficulty is “marking the proper line of partition” between the national and state governments. Madison explains this difficulty by pointing out how difficult it is to use words to define political institutions (see the supplemental material). Madison drives this point home with a less than pious reference to sacred texts: even when “the Almighty himself condescends to address mankind in their own language,” our “cloudy medium” of words render his efforts “dim and doubtful.” Just as discussions of the commands of God are likely to be dim and doubtful, discussions of the divisions between national and state authority will be rendered more difficult by the imprecision of words. Madison’s concession first relies on the charges of the critics of the Constitution and then turns it against them: like the future broad constructionists those critics envision, they too may be victims of the indeterminacy of political words (<italic>FP</italic> 226-27).</p>
<p>After showing how words such as <italic>federal</italic> and <italic>nation</italic> are impossible to define, Madison moves to another difficulty, the Great Compromise. Madison was never happy with this compromise, so it is perhaps not altogether surprising that he briefly departs from his cheerleading to note his displeasure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1065912911427451">Robertson 2005</xref>). But what is surprising is that Madison goes further than he needs—and much further than any of his contemporaries—in showing the centrality of the compromise to the final document: more than a one-time deal, the compromise actually produced “a fresh struggle between the same parties, to give such a turn to the organization of the government, and to the distribution of its powers, as would increase the importance of the branches, in forming which they had respectively obtained the greatest share of influence.” This is to say that the Great Compromise settled one question but opened others: the powers of the House and Senate, and perhaps other features where representation comes into play, were influenced by “extraneous considerations” rather than “theoretical propriety.” What else Madison has in mind (perhaps the Electoral College and the Senate’s portion of executive powers) he leaves to the imagination, but it is worth pausing to note the clarity of Madison’s confession of constitutional imperfection. Instead of narrowing the importance of the Great Compromise, Madison announces that it had infected the entire document (<italic>FP</italic> 227).</p>
<p>Another difficulty was born of regional differences and brought about more compromises. Again, Madison might have treated this difficulty as a straightforward one, but, instead, he complicates it by making a distinction between operating a government and creating a government.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>And although this variety of interests, for reasons sufficiently explained in a former paper, may have a salutary influence on the administration of the government when formed, yet every one must be sensible of the contrary influence, which must have been experienced in the task of forming it.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The former paper is No. 10, where he defended the extended republic on the grounds that the multiplicity of factions would help moderate the effects of faction. In that essay Madison had argued the effects of factions must be controlled because the causes of faction were “sewn in the nature of men” and therefore irremovable (<italic>FP</italic> 55). By “enlarging the orbit,” the extended republic would make it more difficult for a faction to achieve majority status and still be a faction, which is by definition adverse to rights or to the public good. But however salutary this may be for administering a government, Madison says here in No. 37 that a multiplicity of factions would have the opposite effect when forming a government. During normal politics, the extended republic solves a very old political problem (the people are disposed to vex and oppress and each other; <italic>FP</italic> 55), but, during times of founding, it makes it worse. Although Madison does not say it here, we know from a letter to Jefferson that Madison had in mind Congress’s power over exports and imports as well as slavery. As he put it, “S. Carolina &amp; Georgia were inflexible on the point of the slaves” (<italic>PJM</italic> 10:214). Seen in this light, Madison’s qualification of the application of the argument for the extended republic is a serious one because it suggests not only that the extended republic will fail to secure the rights of minorities but also that it is likely to constitutionalize these failures. That is, even if the multiplicity of factions would work against any one faction that sought to undermine rights, that very multiplicity would work against rights in cases when rights have yet to be secured. And it is precisely in times of founding when such extensions of rights might occur. This distinction raises a troubling question: if the extended republic is dangerous to rights during times of founding, what is the alternative? If Madison’s famous republican remedy for the republican disease does not work during times of founding, what does?<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1065912911427451">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>Madison does not answer this question. Instead, he offers a strange account of Convention of 1787 by comparing two ways to think of its success. He writes that “any man of candor” would be “astonished,” while the “man of pious reflection” would see the “finger of th[e] Almighty hand.” Madison’s invocation of the Almighty prepares, perhaps, the rhetorical way for the defense of veneration coming in No. 49, but it nevertheless stands out in the pages of <italic>The Federalist</italic>. It is one of only two uses of the term in the entire work. As we have seen, the other also occurs in No. 37, but its point there was to remind readers that even God’s words are imprecise. More broadly, and without digging too deeply into Madison’s personal belief, the invocation of the hand of the Almighty stands in stark contrast to Madison’s other writings concerning the prospect of divine intervention. In 1825, for example, Madison observed that all too often the “finiteness of the human understanding” causes us to leap from effect to cause, from “Nature to Nature’s God” (Madison to Beasley, November 20, 1825; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1065912911427451">Madison 1910</xref>, 230). With this move to the final cause, as Madison complains, “all Philosophical reasoning on the subject must terminate.” Does Madison expect readers of No. 37 to put aside all philosophic reasoning because of the astonishing work of the Convention?</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1065912911427451">
<title>The Disappearance of Deliberation</title>
<p>After pointing out that the extended republic probably made faction even more dangerous during the Convention, Madison in No. 38 compares the Convention to famous foundings in antiquity. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1065912911427451">Gary Rosen (1999)</xref> has argued, Madison raises and answers a question left unresolved by the argument of the Declaration. According to the Declaration, the people have a right and duty to alter and abolish a government that does not secure their rights, but the people are also “more disposed to suffer” than to go through with the ordeal of revolution and founding. Madison’s remedy for this republican problem is straightforwardly less than republican: the many have to rely on the “safe mediation of the few—or one” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1065912911427451">Rosen 1999</xref>, 124). Just as the ancient founders had departed from the law to establish governments that could operate by deliberation and consent, the signers of the Constitution had made possible a republican government that could not arise by its own strength.</p>
<p>More than an acknowledgment of the difficulty that liberal government requires the intervention of the few, Madison uses the examination of governments in antiquity to discuss the absence of deliberation during times of founding.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1065912911427451">11</xref></sup> In No. 38, Madison brings up deliberation when he writes that it is “not a little remarkable” that in the ancient examples of government by “deliberation and consent” the “task of framing it has not been committed to an assembly of men, but has been performed by some individual citizen of pre-eminent wisdom and approved integrity.” Madison points to seven examples and explains that it is not possible to know for sure whether each was “clothed with the legitimate authority of the people,” but he notes that Draco and Solon seemed to have been asked by the people to reform the laws, and that in the case of Lycurgus, in which the proceedings were “less regular,” the advocates for reform “turned their eyes” to Lycurgus rather than a “deliberative body of citizens.” With the examples of Athens and Sparta, Madison sharpens his question: why is it that the Greeks, a people so reputed for their love of liberty, “should so far abandon the rules of caution as to place their destiny in the hands of a single citizen”? One possible answer is that the problems of deliberation (“discord and disunion”) exceeded the threat of treachery by a single person. Madison notes that even these Greek founders faced “difficulties” and had to resort to “expedients”:
<disp-quote>
<p>Solon, who seems to have indulged a more temporizing policy, confessed that he had not given to his countrymen the government best suited to their happiness, but most tolerable to their prejudices. And Lycurgus, more true to his object, was under the necessity of mixing a portion of violence with the authority of superstition, and of securing his final success by a voluntary renunciation, first of his country, and then of his life.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Madison respects Lycurgus more than Solon, but what is also worth noticing is that Madison does not apply the Greek solution to his previous discussion about the unsuitability of the extended republic to acts of founding. Rather, Madison uses the example to repeat his point from the previous essay, that any mistakes in the Constitution must be considered in light of the “defect of antecedent experience.” Because previous governments resting on consent and deliberation traced their own origins to an act of tyranny rather than to one of deliberation, the Americans had little guidance (<italic>FP</italic> 229-31).</p>
<p>After making this less-than-reassuring point, Madison spends the rest of the essay pointing out that there is no credible alternative to the new Constitution. As he shows in a lengthy catalog of anti-Federalist arguments, the critics of the Constitution were at war among themselves about the proper correction, even as almost everyone agreed that the Articles would not work. Madison likens the people under the Articles to a sick man: a sick man must accept a doctor’s prescription even though there will be those who disagree about the measures prescribed, unless those who disagree can come up with an alternative other than doing nothing. This point reflects his concern in the letter to Randolph and builds on the theoretical claims of No. 37: the lack of unanimity regarding an alternative, which itself must take the form of imprecise words, stems from the deliberative nature of criticism and seems to be irresolvable in politics. But why would Madison need to refer to the “irregular” foundings of the Greek republics to make this very practical point? Specifically, why open the question of the legitimacy of the Constitutional Convention if the main point of the essay is to show how there is no consensus about the ways to improve the Constitution? By explicitly calling our attention to the foundings of ancient governments of deliberation and consent, Madison again forces us to wonder at the astonishing work of the Convention.</p>
<p>With these questions unanswered, Madison moves in No. 39 to take up two specific charges against the Constitution, that it is not “strictly republican” and that it is a “consolidation” of the states into one. The first is of interest. To answer the charge, Madison must offer a definition of republicanism. He dismisses four modern possibilities (Holland, Venice, Poland, and England) mentioned by “political writers” because each fails to lodge power in the people. Oddly, Madison does not mention here any of the examples from antiquity that in No. 38 he had claimed were governed by deliberation and consent. Having forgotten about his ancient examples and having cleared modern examples cited by political writers from his path, Madison is now able to offer a definition of the republican form:
<disp-quote>
<p>We may define a republic to be, or at least may bestow that name on, a government which derives all its powers directly or indirectly from the great body of the people, and is administered by persons holding their offices during pleasure, for a limited period, or during good behavior.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>What is “essential,” then, is that power derived from “the great body of the society,” as opposed to a few or to a favored class. It is “sufficient” that elections and defined tenures be employed. This is to say that indirect elections and lengthy tenures may be republican, as long as power ultimately resides with the great body of the people. It is important to note that this definition emphasizes consent but not deliberation—a feature Madison had explicitly associated with republican governments in antiquity. This suggests that a government without deliberation can be republican as long as the people consent to it. Deliberation does not seem to be a necessary feature of the republican form (<italic>FP</italic> 240).</p>
<p>To say deliberation is not necessary for republican politics, however, is not to say that it is impossible or never useful. As Madison explained in <italic>Federalist</italic> No. 37, the indeterminacy of words requires that laws be settled over time. This form of deliberation might take the form of elections, a series of precedents, or judicial decisions. In the case of the bank, Madison eventually decided that deliberation among the departments—and not the text of the Constitution itself—could settle the Constitution’s sloppiness.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1065912911427451">12</xref></sup> Sometimes, deliberation can settle what mere veneration cannot. But can deliberation work all the time, during ordinary <italic>and</italic> extraordinary politics? If so, do we mean deliberation by the people or by elites? With regard to deliberation by the people, Madison clearly says in No. 49 that deliberation by the people during times of founding is impossible.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1065912911427451">13</xref></sup> But what has not been appreciated enough is that Madison in Nos. 37–39 implies the same thing about elites. True deliberation during times of founding is unlikely. From Madison’s account, we learn that this was true even of the deliberative body of 1787.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1065912911427451">
<title>Implications</title>
<p>Madison succeeded in persuading Randolph and in preventing a second convention.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-1065912911427451">14</xref></sup> But his recommendation of constitutional veneration in No. 49 follows a remarkably tentative account of constitutionalism and of the Convention of 1787. Under the other models in antiquity, government by deliberation and consent was made possible by lack of deliberation, that is, by the intervention of the one or few. The Convention of 1787, in contrast, did deliberate, but its deliberations produced a document that was, according to Madison, filled with fundamental errors. These errors were not the result of an appeal to the public but rather grew out of irresolvable problems within constitutional deliberation. In this remarkable discussion, Madison goes as far as to narrow the applicability of his famous discovery, the extended republic as a solution for faction. In particular, the problem of discussing imprecise forms with imprecise language seems to aggravate the enduring problem of faction. This is also to say that even if the extended republic would be able to protect against a majority faction denying rights during ordinary politics, Madison seems to acknowledge that a majority faction might be able to reinterpret the Constitution during times of extraordinary politics.</p>
<p>Given this presentation of the Constitution, we should be open to the possibility that, for Madison, the benefits of constitutional veneration are mixed. Even if constitutional veneration can sometimes provide what deliberation cannot, there are serious reasons to be wary of it. We know, for example, that Madison believed that state equality in the Senate was a fundamental act of injustice that was caused by the unwillingness of some delegates to see beyond their local interests. The Senate, as a result, would be forever flawed. And from Madison’s later (yet prepartisan) argument for presidential removal powers, we know that Madison believed the principle of “stability,” which he described in No. 37 as necessary ingredient of government (<italic>FP</italic> 224), was tainted by its association with the equality of the states. Because state equality in the Senate—unlike slavery—cannot be amended out of the Constitution (without the consent of the state losing its equal suffrage), ratification of the Constitution promised, perversely, that the “irregular course” pursued at the Convention would become one of the very things Americans would respect over time. On top of all of this, we learn from No. 37 that this compromise between the large and small states gave rise to other unnamed compromises—or imperfections.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-1065912911427451">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>This reading of <italic>The Federalist</italic> can be supported from events in Madison’s life. As we have seen, Madison did not recommend veneration to the citizens of Kentucky in 1785, nor did he recommend it to Americans living under the Articles in 1786 and 1787. In fact, from Madison’s later actions, we know that he believed that constitutional veneration was not always the solution to the problems caused by those unnamed imperfections. There were times when Madison thought a policy was great policy but required a constitutional amendment (internal improvements, the national university, and recolonization of slaves). There were times, however, when he thought an amendment might be ideal in the abstract but unnecessary in practice (his first position on the Bill of Rights, and his later opinion on the bank). Similarly, even though he often advised that an amendment to the Constitution should not be proposed during a national controversy, he made calls for the states to begin the amendment process (the Alien and Sedition Acts), drafted amendments (the Louisiana Purchase), and distributed proposed amendments widely (the election controversy of 1824) precisely during moments of national controversy. And yet there were times when he thought a call for an amendment or appeal to the people would undermine the judiciary (Jefferson’s 1823 protest message for the Virginia legislature), which he sometimes thought should be the necessary “final arbiter” in constitutional disputes.</p>
<p>Two of these occasions are especially relevant. During the election crisis of 1800, Madison favored a direct appeal to the people rather than a constitutional path. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1065912911427451">Ackerman (2005)</xref> has argued, it was Federalists who proposed a remedy that could be grounded in constitutional text, and Republicans who used the threat of a second convention as leverage against moderate Federalists. In this context, Madison endorsed what Ackerman calls an “irregular” appeal to the people, without worrying in the slightest that such an appeal would undermine the people’s respect for the Constitution.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-1065912911427451">16</xref></sup> In 1823, during the buildup to the election crisis of 1824, Madison believed that an appeal to the people in the form of a constitutional amendment was the better path. This time, Madison attempted to correct what he had long regarded as a constitutional error, the equality of states in the contingency election in the House for presidential selection. In fact, he went so far as to support his proposal with the claim that the delegates at the Convention in 1787 grew tired and hurried at the end and thus made mistakes (Madison to Hay, August 23, 1823, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1065912911427451">Madison 1910</xref>, 9:155). Rather than being concerned about the consequences of the amendment process during a heated national controversy intertwined with the crisis of sectionalism, he instead returned to the argument he had made to Wallace in 1785. Again, he worried that the constitutional error would become permanently attached to the public mind, “as opinions and commitments formed under its [the Constitution’s] influence, may become settled obstacles at a practicable season” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1065912911427451">Madison 1910</xref> 9:175). Even for Madison, veneration is not always prudent.</p>
<p>The historical context of No. 49 also supports this qualification of the argument for veneration. Read simply as an endorsement of constitutional veneration, the essay strangely dismantles an argument that was not on the table. Instead, when read as part of Madison’s ongoing attempt to convince moderates like Edmund Randolph, it makes sense that Madison would be the first to bring up Jefferson and to do so in the context of discussing the requirements of republicanism. As author of the Declaration, and as the leading political figure among those who had not yet entered the public debate, Jefferson was perhaps the person most well positioned to argue that the new Constitution was insufficiently republican by offering a different definition of republicanism. That is, this preemptive and scathing critique of Jefferson—the only person referred to as an “authority” in <italic>The Federalist</italic>—helped Madison establish the Constitution’s republican principles while at the same time closing the path for more deliberation. Because Madison knew that he could not close the discussion of republicanism in a way that would answer the most scrupulous republicans (Jefferson), while at the same time relieving those most concerned with the deliberation of their constituents (Randolph), Madison had to warn both sets of men against the excesses of the argument from deliberation. As a result he offered the argument from veneration, but not without providing another argument warning against its excesses.</p>

<p>Madison reused this argument from veneration several times later in his career, often when responding Jefferson’s enthusiastic attempts to appeal to the people.

Another difficulty is that there is also a question of whether there is a “Madison problem,” that is, whether Madison changed over time. See <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1065912911427451">Wood (2006)</xref> for a summary of this problem. It goes without saying that there are subtleties obscured by this classification and that within each scholars disagree with one another about both Madison’s theory as well as its evolution from the 1780s to the 1790s.</p></fn>

<p>Randolph was different from George Mason, whom Madison thought was growing more opposed to the Constitution because of self-love, and different from Patrick Henry, whom Madison thought was attempting to create a southern confederacy.</p></fn>

<p>According to Maier, Madison read Randolph’s letter “with relief” because it supported a strong national government and because it stated that Randolph would support the Constitution if it came to an up or down vote. My interpretation emphasizes Randolph’s efforts to prevent this up or down vote.</p></fn>

<p>In line with Randolph’s list of objections to the Constitution given at the Convention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1065912911427451">Madison 1987</xref>, 614-15), Madison refers to these imperfections as “difficulties.” Madison treats two of the difficulties mentioned by Randolph—the “want of a more definite boundary between the General &amp; State governments” and Congress’s power to tax exports.</p></fn>

<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1065912911427451">Burstein and Isenberg (2010)</xref> show the ways in which No. 38 and the following essays were written as a response to George Mason. They emphasize Madison’s institutional answers, that the senate would not be too close to the executive for example, rather than the more theoretical passages of these essays. Their account and my account can both be right. Madison was writing with moderates in mind, moderates who could be pulled away from Mason’s more extreme position.</p></fn>

<p>“In the case of a Constitution as of a law, a course of authoritative expositions sufficiently deliberate, uniform and settled, was an evidence of the public will necessarily overruling individual opinions” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1065912911427451">Madison 1910</xref>, 9:443).</p></fn>

<p>What he does not say in <italic>The Federalist</italic> is whether deliberation can occur among the people during times of normal politics. It is possible Madison believed then—and probable a few years later, according to Colleen Sheehan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1065912911427451">2005</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1065912911427451">2009</xref>)—that a “sovereign” public opinion could form through deliberation of the public and not only through the manipulation of elites. But it is very difficult to find such a statement in <italic>The Federalist</italic>.</p></fn>

<p>Randolph ultimately supported the Constitution. At the Virginia ratification convention (June 1788), Randolph explained that he believed the unconditional ratification of eight other states was reason enough for Virginia to ratify. This was Madison’s strategy from the beginning, but, as Gutzman has noted, Randolph conceded to Madison as early as April that he disagreed with other critics of the Constitution and feared the result of a second convention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1065912911427451">Madison 1973–77</xref> [<italic>PJM</italic>] 11:25-26). It is also important to note that Randolph was instrumental in undercutting George Clinton’s national call for such a convention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1065912911427451">Gutzman 2004</xref>).</p></fn>
