<p>Dhirubhai Ambani’s life is a captivating and sensational management text-book covering marketing management, financial management, human resource management, production management, event management, retail management, crowd management, customer relationship management and self-management. In this mesmerising book, through the incidences taken from the real life of Dhirubhai Amabani, the author explains how Dhirubhai Ambani used ‘Product, Price, Place, Promotion, Packaging, Power, Pace, Politics’ to create formidable businesses. The author has been vividly able to explain the significance of SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) Analysis and STP<italic> (</italic>Segmentation, Targeting, Positioning<italic>)</italic>. Dhirubhai’s life illustrates how ‘Mission, Money, Message, Media, Machines, Measurement and backward vertical integration’ can help in expanding and managing huge business empires.</p>
<p>Many people believe that Ambani is an acronym for ambition and money. Whatever people may say, the truth remains that Dhirubhai Ambani was the right person born at the right time and at the right place and who perhaps took the right decisions and did what was right in the circumstances that were rife. Dhirubhai Ambani was a person of indomitable courage and a never-say-die attitude. He made us understand that even the most distant dream can be realised with determination, persistence and finding the right way to accomplish tasks. The Reliance group is undoubtedly India’s largest private sector enterprise and has made forays into oil and gas, petroleum refining and marketing, petrochemicals (polyester, fibre intermediates, plastics and chemicals), textiles, retail, information technology, telecoms and special economic zones. The group processes about two per cent of the world’s transportation fuels and has the world’s largest refining complex in the world at Jamnagar. Reliance India Ltd (RIL) is the world’s largest polyester manufacturer and RIL alone employs a nearly 90,000 strong workforce. The group is known to complete its projects well before the deadlines.</p>
<p>The first chapter has a short description of the movie ‘Guru’ which many experts believed to be loosely based on the life of the legend Dhirubhai Ambani. The second chapter covers Dhirubhai’s lineage, childhood days and his contributions to his community during the pre-Independence era. The third chapter provides a glimpse into Dhirubhai’s life in the Arabian kingdoms. The fourth chapter covers Dhirubhai’s early attempts to set up a strong foundation in India. The fifth chapter explains how Dhirubhai was able to garner the support of some very influential bankers and politicians, how he gained a strong foothold and cemented relationships. The sixth chapter covers the world of equity. The seventh chapter is dedicated to the many facets of journalism. The eighth chapter covers the ‘great polyester war’ in our country. The book has twenty three chapters of which the first seventeen chapters revolve around Dhirubhai Ambani. The eighteenth chapter explains the vision of Mukesh Ambani, his profound belief in investing in businesses of the future and investing in talent.</p>
<p>Mukesh’s education in Stanford has definitely helped him in making wiser moves. He was able to achieve his father’s dream of Indians making a cell phone call for the price of a postcard. Both Mukesh and Anil Ambani inherited their father’s tenacity, his intuition in consolidating businesses and his competence to manoeuvre through our country’s sinuous bureaucratic system, seizing opportunities and creating core competencies. Till the time Dhirubhai Ambani was alive, his sons Mukesh and Anil kept on working amicably. But after Dhirubhai Ambani left this mundane world a rift between his two sons was out in the open. The feud soon gained colossal proportions and had political and economic reverberations. Although many authoritative and influential people tried to reconcile the two brothers yet their attempts bore no fruit. The nineteenth chapter describes Anil Ambani’s attempts to get into shape and to get his company into good shape. It also provides a view into the events which led to friction between the two brothers. The twenty-first chapter explains the modus operandi of both the Ambani brothers.</p>
<p>The book is a chronicle of the times of Dhirubhai (28 December 1932 to 6 July 2002) and the journey of Reliance thereafter. It also provides good knowledge of other prominent politicians, industrialists/businessmen and industries/businesses in India and factual information accompanied with figures and statistics related to the functioning of the Government of India, besides speaking of a few other countries.</p>
