<p>The book under review <italic>In Search of Change Maestros</italic> written by Pritam Singh and Asha Bhandarker, supported by the research team consisting of Ajay Jain and Sumita Rai, has been published by SAGE Publications India Private Limited in the year 2011, and has already undergone a second printing in 2011 itself, a testimony of the value and demand of the book. Hard bound price is kept at eight hundred and fifty INR, number of pages is 481, which is a good value for money although the value of books should never be judged either by its volume or by price.</p>
<p>Behavioural science students and practitioners have been interested in understanding the phenomenon of leadership in various realms of the society and life and enough documentation exists in this fascinating area of research-based knowledge since early nineteenth century. Consequent to such a long standing and sustained interest, a number of theories and theoretical perspectives emerged over a period. At this time point leadership is looked at both as a ‘property’ and as a ‘process’. The process consists of non-coercive influences to move a group of people towards accomplishment of the group objectives, whereas the property approach is concerned with a set of qualities and characteristics attributed to those who successfully exert such influences. The dominant theoretical approaches include the trait perspective, the behavioural perspective, the contingency approach, the inspirational approach and the idealized influence approach. Depending upon what level of leadership one is talking about, that is, a supervisory level, the middle level manager or the CEO, the perspective’s efficacy towards clarity of understanding of the leadership phenomenon seems to vary. Most of the work in organizational setting is actually accomplished in terms of the input, throughput and output by the middle level management. Hence, when it comes to the research data base, the existing literature seems to have heavily depended on the respondents from middle level management cadre. However, when it comes to decide what, how and why a group needs to pursue the objectives that it is pursuing, or plans, or needs to pursue, it is usually the level of the CEO or the Dominant Coalition level or put more simply the top level leadership that is responsible.</p>
<p>Until recently, very few enunciations have been available to the consumers of the leadership research that could truly claim to have analyzed the top level leadership. There could have been two reasons in the main. One, the behaviour science researchers usually are looking for commonalties between the respondents’ set to arrive at a ‘theory’, and there is so much of diversity at the top. Second, the top leaders simply cannot afford time for the researchers. Those that have been available either talked about a single ‘great’ leader or even if comparisons were available, the leaders belonged to a culture largely alien to the Indian cultural backdrop and challenges of twenty-first century that the Indian organizations are facing. It is this need that the book under review has fulfilled in a very satisfactory manner. It talks about the Indian ‘change maestros’ behind seven winning Indian organizations headed by Kumar Mangalam Birla, Meleveetil Damodaran, Sajjan Jindal, Kundapur Vaman Kamath, Sunil Bharti Mittal, Anil Manibhai Naik and Kiran Majumdar Shaw. The authors emerge victorious in their effort and identify eight principles that seem to be driving these great top level leaders; the principles include: Contextual sensitivity, Compelling vision and purpose, Winning streak, People connect and engagement, Meaningful contribution with speed, Creative destruction for transformation, Evolving self and Culture architecture. The book unfolds the mysteries of the journey of seven very different corporate czars in a lucid story telling format though the content is based on hard core behavioural science data obtained through first-hand analyses, taking care of both the qualitative as well as the quantitative needs of the analyses, through development of case studies useful in more than one way including classroom and personal learning, for which the authors and their research team deserve kudos!</p>
<p>Our Indian audience is reasonably aware of great CEOs from abroad, but hardly of any worth the name from our native soil. This is a profound book filling up this unfortunate state of affairs. The book caters to a very significant need of the consumers of leadership research, be it the students or aspiring CEOs, and certainly deserves a place in personal and library collections. To sum up, it is a must-have piece of scholarly treatise on a topic of paramount importance.</p>
