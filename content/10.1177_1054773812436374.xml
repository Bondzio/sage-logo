<abstract>
<p>The aim of this study was to describe the translation and the cross-cultural adaptation process of questionnaire about intimate partner violence (IPV). IPV is a serious threat to women’s health. There is a need for instruments to measure the results of educational interventions. The Violence Against Women Health Care Provider Survey was found suitable for translation and adaptation to the Swedish cultural context. A five-step process according to Guillemin et al. was followed: (a) translation by independent translators, (b) back translation of each translation independently from each other, (c) committee review with multidisciplinary members produces the final version, and (d) pretesting to ensure equivalence between source and final version, and (e) weighting scores. The Swedish version consisted of the same number of items as the original. The results indicated that the questionnaire can be used in Sweden to measure the effectiveness of IPV training programs.</p>

<title>Introduction and Background</title>
<p>Intimate partner violence (IPV) is common worldwide and poses serious threat to a woman’s health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1054773812436374">Campbell, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1054773812436374">García-Moreno &amp; World Health Organization, 2005</xref>). Hence, health care professionals need to be prepared for identifying and caring for women exposed to IPV. However, studies have shown that although the effects of IPV are treated, the violence itself remains unidentified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1054773812436374">Frost, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1054773812436374">Gutmanis, Beynon, Tutty, Wathen, &amp; MacMillan, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1054773812436374">Haggblom, Hallberg, &amp; Moller, 2005</xref>). In addition, other studies have shown that although IPV is common in primary health care (PHC), PHC professionals are less prepared to deal with IPV than are professionals in emergency and gynecological care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1054773812436374">Andréasson, Stenson, Björck, &amp; Heimer, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1054773812436374">Heimer &amp; Sandberg, 2008</xref>). Specifically, a recent study in PHC in Sweden confirmed the lack of preparedness among PHC nurses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1054773812436374">Sundborg, Saleh Stattin, Wändell, &amp; Törnkvist, 2011</xref>). To address this issue, nurses working in PHC would need both formal training and experience in meeting women exposed to IPV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1054773812436374">Gutmanis et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Lack of preparedness among nurses may have adverse consequences for women exposed to IPV. If IPV is not identified and women received no adequate support, IPV would continue to affect the women’s life psychologically, physically, socially, and economically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1054773812436374">Campbell et al., 2002</xref>). In addition, inadequate support may result in women feeling victimized in the hands of health care professionals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1054773812436374">Corbally, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1054773812436374">Kasén, Nordman, Lindholm, &amp; Eriksson, 2008</xref>). An earlier study also found that women exposed to IPV were disappointed or felt that the system had failed them when they were not asked about the violence they have experienced and/or offered support and protection when they themselves initiated a discussion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1054773812436374">Peckover, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Some of the reasons behind the lack of preparedness among health care staff may be that they focus more on physical symptoms, feel uncomfortable about touching the topic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1054773812436374">Corbally, 2001</xref>), lack awareness of the extent of IPV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1054773812436374">Sugg, Thompson, Thompson, Maiuro, &amp; Rivara, 1999</xref>), and/or lack knowledge and procedures in identification of IPV and interventions when meeting women exposed to IPV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1054773812436374">Gutmanis et al., 2007</xref>). There is a need for suitable training programs to increase preparedness among nurses in PHC and valid instruments to assess the effectiveness of such programs. We conducted an earlier study where we showed that the majority of PHC nurses in Stockholm County in Sweden were found to be inadequately prepared to care for women exposed to IPV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1054773812436374">Sundborg et al., 2011</xref>). For that, we designed a new educational training program that focused on enhancing the nurses’ preparedness to encounter, identify, and care for women exposed to IPV. To find a suitable questionnaire to measure effectiveness of the training program, we reviewed findings from several studies that evaluated various educational interventions using interviews, surveys, or self-reports. Some of those questionnaires measured knowledge about and/or attitudes to IPV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1054773812436374">Nicolaidis, Curry, &amp; Gerrity, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1054773812436374">Salmon, Murphy, Baird, &amp; Price, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1054773812436374">Wallace, 2002</xref>) whereas others estimated the prevalence of IPV among women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1054773812436374">Edwardsen, Pless, Fiscella, Horwitz, &amp; Meldrum, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1054773812436374">Lo Fo Wong, Wester, Mol, &amp; Lagro-Janssen, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1054773812436374">Protheroe, Green, &amp; Spiby, 2004</xref>) and one study measured all of these (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1054773812436374">Hinderliter, Doughty, Delaney, Pitula, &amp; Campbell, 2003</xref>). Only one questionnaire, namely The Violence Against Women Health Care Provider Survey, was found that measures nurses intentions to act (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1054773812436374">Schoening, Greenwood, McNichols, Heermann, &amp; Agrawal, 2004</xref>). This instrument was deemed suitable for translating into Swedish. The questionnaire was originally developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1054773812436374">Dickson and Tutty (1998)</xref> and further developed and validated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1054773812436374">Gutmanis et al. (2007)</xref>.</p>
<p>A literal translation of an instrument into other languages is often subject to cultural and linguistic hinders with a goal to achieve equivalence between two different languages. The instrument also has to be adapted in a culturally relevant and comprehensible form while maintaining the meaning of the original items (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1054773812436374">Flaherty et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1054773812436374">Lee, Li, Arai, &amp; Puntillo, 2009</xref>). Cultural equivalence, functional equivalence, as well as the ethic perspective has been accounted for in this article according to the established principals for cross-cultural adaptation of research instruments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1054773812436374">Jones, Lee, Phillips, Zhang, &amp; Jaceldo, 2001</xref>). During the adaptation process, it is important to ensure that the concepts are equal between the original and target language, time and context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1054773812436374">Gjersing, Caplehorn, &amp; Clausen, 2010</xref>). Since the 1980s, there have been major legal reforms in Sweden to take IPV into account. All the above, which apply only to Sweden, are needed to be taken into account when cultural adaptation of an instrument was underway.</p>

<title>Description of the Questionnaire</title>
<p>The original questionnaire contained instructions to the respondents followed by a description of a practice session regarding a patient and 60 items which were divided into two parts. Part 1 consisted of 43 items about preparedness (8 items), self-confidence (7 items), practitioner lack of control (7 items), comfort following disclosure (2 items), professional support (4 items), practice pressures (5 items), abuse inquiry by practitioner (7 items), and consequences of asking (3 items). Possible answers were “strongly agree,” “agree,” “disagree,” or “strongly disagree.” The participants used the hypothetical scenario or their own experiences to answer the items in the questionnaire.</p>
<p>Part 2 consisted of 17 questions about demographic information (2 items), education and training (7 items), and experience with violence against women (8 items). The items are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1054773812436374">Table 1</xref>. Consent for cross-cultural adaptation was obtained from the original constructors Leslie Tutty and Iris Gutmanis. Ethical approval for this study was obtained from Regional Ethical Reviews Board at Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm.</p>

<title>Guidelines for Cross-Cultural Adaptation</title>
<p>Guidelines for the cross-cultural adaptation process according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1054773812436374">Guillemin, Bombardier, and Beaton (1993)</xref> were followed. These guidelines have often been used in studies such as in translation and cross-adaptation of the health-related quality of life measure (HRQOL) questionnaire which was translated into 36 different languages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1054773812436374">Herdman, Fox-Roshby, &amp; Badia, 1998</xref>). The cross-cultural adaptation process included 5 steps: (a) translation, (b) back translation, (c) committee review, (d) pretest, and (e) weighting of scores if relevant (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1054773812436374">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Cross-Cultural Adaptation Process of the Questionnaire</title>
<sec id="section7-1054773812436374">
<title>Step 1: Translation</title>
<p>The guidelines suggested that two or more translators should work on one translation to attain the highest quality possible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1054773812436374">Guillemin et al., 1993</xref>). The benefits were easier detection of mistakes and diverse interpretations of unclear items. Qualified translators could even, though not necessarily, have had some knowledge on the subject. In this study, three translators were contacted who had different backgrounds but all had Swedish as their native language (the language to translate into) and very good command of English (the language to be translated from). One was an engineer and two were district nurses, of whom one was also a nursing instructor. The three different translated versions were referred to as A1, B1, and C1. Instructions and information about the objective of the task and the translation process were given to the translators. They were asked to comment on any difficulties they had encountered or on any other issues regarding the translation process. Any further inquiries in relation to the subject, but not the translation process itself, were tackled by the researchers. Each translator carried out the translation process independently, as they lived in different parts of the county.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1054773812436374">
<title>Step 2: Back translation</title>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1054773812436374">Guillemin et al. (1993)</xref> back translation should be done by different people to detect misinterpretation and failure to adapt to the new cultural context. In this study, three other people who had English as their native language and a good command of Swedish were selected; two were professional translators and one was a dietician. They were supplied with the three translated versions from Step 1 (A1, B1, and C1) and received the same information and instructions as those given to the translators in Step 1. They carried out the translation process independently and the result was three back-translated questionnaires referred to as A2, B2, and C2.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1054773812436374">
<title>Step 3: Committee review</title>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1054773812436374">Guillemin et al. (1993)</xref>, a committee produces the final version and ensures that the translation is fully comprehensible. Members should be bilingual and have expertise in the research area and use the instrument. If the committee fails to reach agreement, the person heading the committee should make the final decision. In this study, the committee members included a sociologist, a lawyer with a master’s degree in criminology and a social welfare officer. These three people were working in the research area and one of them had English as her native language. The fourth person (one of the authors) was a nurse who had a PhD in social medicine. She arranged committee meetings, documented all the results, and made sure that decisions were agreed upon and a final version of the translation was generated (i.e., after the pretest version in Step 4 below). Guidelines for how to conduct the selection process were explained to the committee members in advance. The process started with reviewing each translated item (from A1, B1, and C1) and discussing which items to choose and the reason behind each decision. The committee also compared each back translation (A2, B2, and C2) with the original questionnaire for clarity. Decisions were made by consensus or majority vote (3 out of 4). The review committee had three meetings and one electronic mail exchange before the final version of the questionnaire was produced (i.e., after two pretests; see Step 4 below).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1054773812436374">
<title>Step 4: Pretest for equivalence using adequate techniques</title>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1054773812436374">Guillemin et al. (1993)</xref> the final step of the translation and cross-cultural adaptation process is to pretest the final version. The translated questionnaire reviewed by the committee was distributed to 10 health care professionals, ten of whom worked at PHC centers (PHCC). The group consisted of one occupational therapist, three district nurses, three nurses, one dietician, one physiotherapist, and one health educator. None of the participants worked specifically with women exposed to IPV. They were asked to comment on the questions regarding relevance, understanding and clarity in relation to the subject, language and grammatical accuracies. The questionnaires were returned with comments after 2 weeks. The first author summarized the comments of each respondent. Revisions were discussed between members of the committee. Minor changes were approved and those changes with significant implications on the content and legibility of the questions were discussed further until agreement was reached.</p>
<p>After the committee’s second revision, a second pretesting was performed to further validate the questionnaire. This time the test group included persons from the target group for which the final version of the questionnaire would be used. The revised questionnaire was sent to 30 district nurses working at different PHCC in Stockholm County and was returned within a week. All comments were summarized and discussed by the authors. Ambiguities were resolved by contacting each respondent. The committee members reviewed all the changes and a final version of the questionnaire was approved. Finally, the questionnaire was sent for language and spelling corrections.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1054773812436374">
<title>Step 5: Weighting scores</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1054773812436374">Guillemin et al. (1993)</xref> also recommended a fifth step, that is, weighting scores. This step can be shortened by accepting the weighting scores of the original instrument (1993).</p>

<title>Translation, Back Translation, and Committee Review</title>
<p>The translation and back translation resulted in six different versions of the questionnaire (A1, B1, and C1 for the translation and A2, B2, and C2 for back translation). These showed differences between the translations in each step regarding the choices of certain words to convey the same meaning. The following was discussed and decided upon during the first committee review.</p>
<list id="list1-1054773812436374" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>The choice of words: “abuse of women/violence against women” or just the word abuse, which were used interchangeably in one of the translations. The committee decided to use “violence against women” throughout the questionnaire.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Grammatical issues in which the placement of the negation would give different meaning to the sentence, as in Item 7: “I don’t feel I can help the women . . .,” or alternatively, “I feel I cannot help the women. . . .” This was recurrent in several items in the questionnaire. The committee decided to use the latter.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The use of the words prepared and ready when translated into Swedish resulted in two different words that did not have the same impact on the item in question. The committee decided to use both words.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Item 25 was difficult for the committee to agree upon because of the word “able,” which was substituted by the Swedish word “capable,” because there is no Swedish word for “able” and different interpretations were offered. Among these were “have the competence,” “capable,” or “have the possibility.” The committee agreed to use both the word “capable” as well as the version “have the possibility” as the second alternative to be pretested. The committee decided to use both “I am capable to continue the discussion after a disclosure to assess the needs of the client” and “I have the possibility to continue the discussion. . . .”</p></list-item>
</list>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1054773812436374">
<title>First Pretest and Committee Review</title>
<p>In the first pretest there were 105 comments on the wording and grammar in 37 out of 43 items. One specific item (Item 25) was perceived as most difficult and had the highest number of comments (<italic>n</italic> = 12) concerning both clarity and conceptualization. The pretest resulted in many valuable comments which led to the word “capable” being used, as it was found to be the best alternative. The word “capable” corresponded to the ability of a person to encounter women exposed to IPV. Another conceptual change decided by the review committee was the use of “the women” instead of “women.” For example, the question “I may forget to ask her about woman abuse” was changed to “I may forget to ask her if she is exposed to violence” and another example was “I would feel confident if I was required to ask women about abuse” which was changed to “I would feel confident if I was required to ask a woman if she is exposed to violence.” In addition, item “It is an expectation to inquire about woman abuse” was changed to “It is an expectation in my professional role to ask women if they are exposed to violence.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-1054773812436374">
<title>Second Pretest and Committee Review</title>
<p>In the second pretest there were 23 comments on 16 out of 43 items. Of these, one item (Item 11) received the most comments (<italic>n</italic> = 5), while the rest received one to two comments each. All comments were on the wording to make Item 11 more comprehensible: “I feel that I am able to support this woman while she gets the right help.” These comments were mainly due to mistakes in Swedish grammar but there were also suggestions to change the phrase “the right help” to “the help that the woman needs.” The few minor changes were sent by e-mail to the review committee for their comments and suggestions and a meeting was suggested if needed. Feedback was received from all three committee members and a final version was accepted.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The current study presents the translation and cross-cultural adaptation of the English questionnaire Violence Against Women Health Care Provider Survey. Widely established methodological procedures were followed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1054773812436374">Guillemin et al., 1993</xref>) because ensuring equivalence of cross-cultural instruments is a challenge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1054773812436374">Wang, Lee, &amp; Fetzer, 2006</xref>), and it is important to achieve a balance between maintaining the integrity of the questionnaire and being culturally appropriate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1054773812436374">Willgerodt, Kataoka-Yahiro, Kim, &amp; Ceria, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>In the first step, the guidelines suggested that two or more translators should work on one translation to attain the highest quality possible. In this study three translators worked independently who produced a wide range of comments that the committee used for discussion and from which suitable alternatives were chosen. To improve the quality of the final version, three people produced independent back translations. The recommendations to use professional back translators who were not aware of the intent and concepts behind the questionnaire were followed. Thus, misinterpretations and biases during the back-translation process were avoided. The importance of back translation has been also shown elsewhere and without it the validity and reliability of the instrument may be compromised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1054773812436374">Hilton &amp; Skrutkowski, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1054773812436374">Jones, Lee, Phillips, Zhang, &amp; Jaceldo, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1054773812436374">Sperber, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1054773812436374">White &amp; Elander, 1992</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1054773812436374">Yu, Lee, and Woo (2004)</xref> also showed that back translation is the most widely used and accepted translation method for obtaining equivalence between the source and target languages.</p>
<p>The purpose of the committee was to produce a final version from the translations obtained during the first and second steps. Certain criteria for committee members were followed. Members were bilingual, familiar with the issue and had both formal training and extensive professional experience working with women exposed to IPV. The review committee agreed on all but two items (Items 11 and 25) where some difficulties arose that required further discussions before an agreement was reached. The same difficulties were encountered for the same items during the first and second pretest and most of the comments received from the respondents concerned these two items. Among the comments were that they were rather vague, their wording was difficult to understand, and that they did not adequately convey the intended meaning. Following the comments, changes were made in the wording but no new information was added to comply with the original questionnaire.</p>
<p>Finally, two pretests of the final version were carried out that resulted in a validated version of the questionnaire in Swedish. The questionnaire was pretested by respondents who worked in health care. The big issue during the first pretest was whether to use “able” or “capable.” The responders recommended using “capable.” The responders of the second pretest also chose “capable.” In a similar study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1054773812436374">Ostlund, Gustavsson, &amp; Furst, 2007</xref>), the results of the first pretest indicated difficulties with certain items despite the review committee’s decision. These difficulties were one of the two reasons for conducting a second pretesting with a larger group of responders. The other reason was to increase the validity of the adapted version. The discussions with some of the respondents which revealed the way they argued and reasoned was useful to arrive at a valid and culturally adapted instrument for use in Sweden.</p>
<p>A limitation of this study may have been that the fifth step, weighting of scores, recommended by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1054773812436374">Guillemin et al. (1993)</xref>, was not followed. However, the authors suggested the fifth step to be used only if relevant. Here, we did not find it necessary to enter Step 5. Instead, we decided to accept the weighting scores of the original instrument, a solution also suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1054773812436374">Guillemin et al. (1993)</xref>. This may be counted as a limitation. In a future study, further testing of the Swedish version of the instrument using a larger study population is being planned to validate the Swedish version.</p>

<title>Conclusion and Application</title>
<p>A Swedish version of the English questionnaire Violence Against Women Health Care Provider Survey has been generated following an internationally recognized methodological procedure for validity and reliability. No such questionnaire previously existed in Sweden. The results indicate that this questionnaire can be used in Sweden to measure the effectiveness of IPV training programs. It can also be used to determine whether there is adequate preparedness among healthcare professionals and to compare results between national and international studies which make use of this instrument.</p>
