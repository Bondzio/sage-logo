<abstract>
<p>To investigate the clinical effect of distally pedicled peroneus brevis muscle flaps and retrograde neurocutaneous flaps on treatment of bone and soft-tissue 3-dimensional defects of the lower leg and foot, the authors retrospectively studied all the patients admitted in their center in 3 consecutive years with bone and soft-tissue defects from March 2008 to February 2011; 21 patients suffering from traumatic and osteomyelitis were treated with peroneus brevis muscle flaps, for obliterating the hole-shaped bony defects after osteomyelitis debridement, and neurocutaneous flaps, for repairing associated soft-tissue defects. After thorough debridement, the average size of soft-tissue defects was 2 cm × 2 cm to 13 cm × 9 cm and that of bony defects was 2 cm × 2 cm × 2 cm to 6 cm × 3 cm × 3 cm. Neurocutaneous flaps completely survived in 20 cases, and the wounds healed at stage I; 1 case developed necrosis in the distal part of the peroneus brevis muscle flap and sural nerve flap, and the wound healed with a saphenous nerve flap. The flaps maintained good texture and shape during a follow-up of 6 to 24 months. Recurrence of osteomyelitis was not observed in any of the patients. In conclusion, distally pedicled peroneus brevis muscle flaps and retrograde neurocutaneous flaps are simple, safe, reliable, and suitable for clinical treatment of hole-shaped bony defects and reconstruction of soft-tissue defects within a single stage, especially when the 2 defects are located in different 3-dimensional spaces.</p>

<body>
<p>Because of the scanty subcutaneous soft tissues of the lower leg and foot, traumatic soft-tissue defects commonly result in exposed tendons and bone in this area. Subsequent mishandling can easily cause osteomyelitis. Hence local or free flaps and muscle flaps are needed to repair soft-tissue defects and control potential bone infection. However, the compact structure of soft tissues of the lower leg and foot has led to difficulty in designing local flaps to repair the defects. In addition, there is difficulty in repairing the defects using local muscle flaps because associated calf muscles have largely transferred from muscle bellies to muscle tendons.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1534734613479381">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1534734613479381"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1534734613479381"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1534734613479381"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1534734613479381">5</xref></sup> The free flaps or muscle flaps offer a good alternative, but their application is largely limited as a result of the complex, time-consuming operation, lack of microsurgical professionals, and the general condition of the patient.</p>
<p>In 1997, Mathes and Nahai<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1534734613479381">6</xref></sup> introduced the application principles and anatomical and surgical techniques of the peroneus brevis muscle flaps. Later, in 2001, Eren et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1534734613479381">7</xref></sup> first applied the distally pedicled peroneus brevis muscle flaps for the reconstruction of soft-tissue defects of the lower limb. Through an autopsy in 2005, Yang et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1534734613479381">1</xref></sup> found that the distal pedicle was always located within 4.25 cm (3-6 cm) from the fibular tip and that the muscle flap survived when the peroneus brevis was attached to the fibular within 6 cm from the fibula tip.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1534734613479381">1</xref></sup> A number of reports show that the peroneus brevis muscle flap contains sufficient tissues to repair small- to medium-sized soft-tissue defects of the lower leg and foot. This method is advantageous because of constant perforators of the arteries, simple and easy dissection of the flap, and small damage to the donor area.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1534734613479381">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1534734613479381"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1534734613479381"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1534734613479381"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1534734613479381"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1534734613479381"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1534734613479381">7</xref></sup> However, it cannot meet the needs of clinical practice to repair hole-shaped bony and soft-tissue defects simultaneously, especially when the 2 defects are located in different 3-dimensional spaces. Second, it cannot reconstruct the relatively large soft-tissue defect because the peroneus brevis muscle contains limited tissues by itself. During the past 2 decades of microsurgical experience, surgeons have gained a better understanding of the vascular anatomy of the lower leg with its associated perforators and angiosomes, and the neurocutaneous flaps were introduced by Masquelet et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1534734613479381">8</xref></sup> for the reconstruction of soft-tissue defects of the lower limb in 1992. Subsequently, the sural nerve, saphenous nerve, and superficial peroneal nerve accompanying artery flaps were widely used in clinical treatment of soft-tissue defects of the lower limbs. Associated operations have been proved to be simple, safe, reliable, and capable of repairing relatively large soft-tissue defects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1534734613479381">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1534734613479381"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1534734613479381"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1534734613479381"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1534734613479381"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1534734613479381"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1534734613479381"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1534734613479381"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1534734613479381"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1534734613479381"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1534734613479381"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1534734613479381">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>According to the literature, there is still a lack of an effective method for the reconstruction of distal tibial, fibular, and calcaneal hole-shaped bony defects and relatively large soft-tissue defects in the related areas after thorough osteomyelitis debridement concurrently, especially when the 2 defects are located in different 3-dimensional spaces, and the soft-tissue defect cannot be repaired with a skin graft because of exposure of the tendon, bone, or plate beneath. In recent years, we have applied the distally peroneus brevis muscle flaps for the obliteration of dead space in the tibia or calcaneus after osteomyelitis debridement and the retrograde neurocutaneous flaps (sural nerve flap, saphenous nerve flap, and superficial peroneal nerve flap) for the reconstruction of associated soft-tissue defects. In this study, we discuss the application of distally peroneus brevis muscle flaps and retrograde neurocutaneous flaps for treatment of osteomyelitis with soft-tissue defects of the lower leg and foot.</p>

<title>Patients</title>
<p>This study has been approved by the hospital ethics committee. The selection criteria were as follows: (1) patients who had traumatic, acute, or chronic osteomyelitis; (2) patients suffering from distal tibial, fibular, and calcaneal hole-shaped bony defects with soft-tissue defects after debridement, with the 2 defects located in different 3-dimensional spaces; and (3) inability of the soft-tissue defect to be repaired with a skin graft because of exposure of the tendon, bone, or plate beneath. From March 2008 to February 2011, 21 cases of patients hospitalized in our hospital met the criteria (17 male and 4 female patients, 19-60 years old, with an average age of 41 years) and were, therefore, selected as the participants. Of these, 7 cases were traumatic, acute osteomyelitis and the other 14 were traumatic, chronic osteomyelitis. All patients were initially suffering from open fractures. Prior to their hospitalization in our hospital, all patients were treated with unsuccessful operations multiple times. All wounds contained 1 to 2 types of bacteria, with <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> and <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> being the most common species.

<title>Surgical Techniques</title>
<p>All key surgical procedures were performed by the first and corresponding authors. Each surgeon had extensive experience (15-20 years) in reconstructive surgery and performed on average &gt;150 cases of flap surgery per year. Prior to the operation, the artery perforators of the peroneal artery, superficial peroneal artery, and posterior tibial artery were assessed using a Doppler blood flow meter and marked on the skin. The perforators proximal to the defect site were considered as the vascular pedicles of the neurocutaneous flaps.</p>
<p>The wounds of the lower leg or calcaneal osteomyelitis were first thoroughly debrided. All lesion ranges had to be completely removed, including inactive soft tissues, infected granulation tissues, periosteum with no vascular supply, and scarred muscles and subcutaneous tissues. The sequestrum had to be completely removed regardless of the degree of bone defects after debridement. The wounds were then repeatedly rinsed using normal saline. The infected or necrotic tissues were collected for bacteriological analyses and drug susceptibility tests. The peroneus brevis muscle flap and reverse island flap were transplanted postdebridement.</p>
<sec id="section4-1534734613479381">
<title>Dissection of the peroneus brevis muscle flap</title>
<p>The surgical incision took neurocutaneous flaps into account. For the dissection of the sural nerve flap and peroneus brevis muscle flap, a skin incision was made 1 cm posterior to the fibular axis (head of the fibula to fibular tip) from the proximal third of the lower leg to the pivot point of the flap; for the superficial peroneal nerve flap and peroneus brevis muscle flap, the incision was made 1 cm anterior to the fibular axis; and for the saphenous nerve flap and peroneus brevis muscle flap, the incision was made 1 cm posterior or anterior to the fibular axis. On identification of the peroneus longus, peroneus brevis tendon, and superficial peroneal nerve, the peroneus brevis muscle was raised and sharply dissected from the uppermost point of the fibula. Segmental perforators were ligated during the dissection process, which was ceased when the muscle flap could approach the defect site through extended incision or subcutaneous pathways. After a survey of flap bleeding, the proximal portion of muscle flap was rotated to the defect site as an inlay for obliteration of dead space in the debrided bone. Then, the neurocutaneous flap was applied to cover the muscle flap surface and soft-tissue defects. Care should be taken to protect the motor branch by which the superficial peroneal nerve controls the peroneal longus muscle. To avoid damage to the most distal vascular pedicle of the muscle flap, interference within 6 cm from the fibular tip should be prevented.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1534734613479381">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1534734613479381">11</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="section5-1534734613479381">
<title>Dissection of the retrograde sural nerve flap</title>
<p>The flap was designed according to the size and shape of the defect, with the axis being the connection between the midpoint of popliteal fossa and that of the connection between the fibular tip and Achilles tendon, and the pivot point 3 to 5 cm above the fibular tip. To prevent damage to the vascular pedicle, the exploratory incision was generally not required after the perforators were identified by Doppler. The proximal portion of the flap was first dissected along the designed line to expose the small saphenous vein and medial sural nerve, which lead to the flap. The position of the flap was adjusted according to the direction of relevant nerve and nutrient vessels. The nerve was then dissected at the proximal portion of the flap with blood vessels ligated. The skin dissection around the flap was made to the deep fascia, from which the flap, sural nerve, and accompanying blood vessels were reversely raised. The pedicle only contained fascia tissues of the small saphenous vein, sural nerve, and accompanying nutrient vessels, with the pivot point generally 2 to 3 cm in width. The sural nerve flap was transferred through an extended incision to the peroneus brevis muscle flap surface and associated soft-tissue defects in the recipient area.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1534734613479381">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1534734613479381">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1534734613479381">13</xref></sup></p>

<title>Dissection of the retrograde superficial peroneal nerve flap</title>
<p>The design of the flap was based on the shape and size of the wounds, with the surface projection line of the superficial peroneal nerve as the axis, 2 to 3 cm within the connection of the medial and lateral malleolus as the pivot point, and a 3- to 4-cm-wide pedicle. The deep fascia was dissected from both sides according to the proposed shape of the flap. The tissue flap, including deep fascia, subcutaneous fat, superficial peroneal nerve, and accompanying nutrient vessels, were reversely raised from the loose tissues under the deep fascia from the proximal to the distal end. When close to the pedicle, the separation procedure should be applied as carefully as possible to prevent damage to fine perforators. Active bleeding was observed in the tissue flap with loosened tourniquet. The superficial peroneal nerve flap was subsequently transferred to the peroneus brevis muscle flap surface and associated soft-tissue defects.

<title>Dissection of the retrograde saphenous nerve flap</title>
<p>The perforators were selected as the pivot point according to the osteomyelitis site. In general, 1 to 2 perforators within 5.0 to 10.0 cm from the medial malleolus were used as the vascular pedicle for improved blood supply of the flap. With the connection of the medial malleolus tipand femoral epicondyleas the longitudinal axis, the saphenous nerve flap was designed from both sides of its axis. The saphenous nerve flap was reversely raised, and the proximal portion of the flap was first dissected along the proposed line. The great saphenous vein, saphenous nerve, and accompanying blood vessels were exposed and dissected. During the dissection process, perforating branches of the posterior tibial artery were identified and ligated to the septum perforating branches between the soleus and flexor digitorum muscle. When approached from the vicinity of the pedicle, the deep fascia was longitudinally dissected from both sides of the muscle septum to avoid damage to the great saphenous vein and saphenous nerve. When the flap was raised to the pivot point, large perforating branches originating from the posterior tibial artery or cutaneous perforators from the anterior tibial artery of the upper ankle and skeleton were visible and had to be prevented from injury. The retrograde island saphenous nerve flap, with a 3- to 4-cm-wide pedicle, was nourished by posterior tibial artery perforators or anterior tibial artery perforators of the upper ankle and skeleton. The flap was transferred through an extended incision to the peroneus brevis muscle flap surface and associated soft-tissue defects in the recipient area.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1534734613479381">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1534734613479381">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>To prevent the formation of hematoma, a 14# anticompression tube was placed beneath the muscle flap, with several rubber drainages at the closure edge of the donor area and the flap. The tube and rubber drainages were extracted after 48 to 72 hours. All patients were treated with appropriate antibiotic therapy from 3 hours preoperation to 10 to 14 days postoperation. During this period, the antibiotics were adjusted according the results of bacterial culture and drug sensitivity tests.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>After debridement, the average size of soft-tissue defects (length × width) was 2 cm × 2 cm to ~13 cm × 9 cm and that of the bone defects (length × width × depth) was 2 cm × 2 cm × 2 cm to ~6 cm × 3 cm × 3 cm. There were 14 cases of osteomyelitis and soft-tissue defects treated with peroneus brevis muscle flap and retrograde sural nerve flap, 4 cases treated with peroneus brevis muscle flap and retrograde superficial peroneal nerve flap, and 3 cases treated with peroneus brevis muscle flap and retrograde saphenous nerve flap. The neurocutaneous flaps completely survived in 20 cases, and the wounds healed during stage I; 1 case developed necrosis in the distal part of the peroneus brevis muscle flap and sural nerve flap because part of the peroneal artery perforators injury was caused by fibular internal fixation, and the wound healed with a retrograde saphenous nerve flap. Also, 12 cases were treated with primary closure and 9 cases with skin graft to the donor area. During a follow-up of 6 to 24 months, the neurocutaneous flaps maintained good texture and shape. Osteomyelitis did not reoccur in any of the patients.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The application of muscle flaps is one of the most effective treatments for bone infection: it not only obliterates bone defect–caused dead cavities postdebridement but also transfers associated blood supply to the recipient area and enhances antibiotics transportation through the muscle flap vessels to the recipient area, thus achieving the aims of infection control and osteomyelitis treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1534734613479381">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1534734613479381"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1534734613479381">22</xref></sup> Masquelet et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1534734613479381">8</xref></sup> suggested that vessels accompanying the sensitive superficial nerve give off many cutaneous branches and perforators to the suprafascia during their course, thus ensuring the survival of flaps; this formed the anatomical basis of neurocutaneous flaps. In 1997, Jeng and Wei introduced the application of distally based sural nerve flaps to soft-tissue defects in the foot and ankle. In addition, Chang et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1534734613479381">14</xref></sup> and Kim et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1534734613479381">15</xref></sup> described the anatomy and clinical applications of superficial peroneal nerve flaps. In recent years, neurocutaneous flaps have widely been accepted as an alternative to free flaps for the reconstruction of the lower limb and foot defects. The neurocutaneous flaps are stable and reliable, with no need of microsurgery. Associated applications are advantageous in constant perforators, with reliable blood supply and no sacrifice of major blood vessels.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1534734613479381">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1534734613479381"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1534734613479381"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1534734613479381"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1534734613479381"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1534734613479381"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1534734613479381"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1534734613479381">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>The blood supply of most calf muscles is Mathes and Nahai IV type. Because of the small arc of rotation, it remains difficult to use calf muscles for the reconstruction of soft-tissue defects of the medial malleolus and heel. Other difficulties in repairing associated soft-tissue defects are caused by the transfer of calf muscles to muscle tendons at the lower third of the leg.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1534734613479381">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1534734613479381"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1534734613479381"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1534734613479381"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1534734613479381"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1534734613479381">6</xref></sup> The peroneus brevis muscle arises from the upper third of the fibula, with the muscular part extended to the lateral ankle, and the muscle belly, up to 25 cm (22-27 cm) in length. To ensure blood supply in the muscle flap, the pedicle needs to be attached to the fibula within 6 cm from the fibular tip. Yet a 19-cm-long muscle flap is rotatable to the Achilles tendon, medial and lateral malleolus, and calcaneus for the reconstruction of small- to medium-sized soft-tissue defects in the recipient area.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1534734613479381">1</xref></sup> By comparison, the neurocutaneous flaps are flexible and simple to operate for the reconstruction of soft-tissue defects of the distal lower limb. Although neurocutaneous flaps can repair relatively larger soft-tissue defects than muscle flaps, the former do not carry as much resistance to bacterial infection as muscle flaps.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1534734613479381">1</xref></sup> Taking into consideration the advantages and disadvantages of both methods, in the present study, we designed a distal peroneus brevis muscle flap to obliterate dead cavities in the tibia and calcaneus after osteomyelitis debridement and to control the reoccurrence of bone infection. Within the same stage, we applied the retrograde neurocutaneous flaps for the reconstruction of associated soft-tissue defects. The transferred muscle flaps lack sensation and may undergo fibrosis and scarring, which complicate secondary surgical procedures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1534734613479381">23</xref></sup> In fact, a later bone graft may be required to promote bone healing of the tibia and calcaneus with large defects, and a simple muscle flap transplantation is obviously inappropriate. The transfer of muscle flap and neurocutaneous flap allows the elevation of these flaps when a bone graft is needed. Even if the muscle flap has undergone fibrosis and scarring, the original neurocutaneous flap can still be applied to the wound of the bone graft. This is the first advantage of our proposed method. During the simple application of peroneus brevis muscle flap to soft tissue defects of the lower leg and foot, a split thickness skin graft is needed to cover the muscle flap surface. To ensure the survival of muscle flaps, the surgical area should not be bandaged with pressure after a skin graft. This commonly leads to the formation of a subcutaneous hematoma and eventually prevents the survival of the skin graft. To avoid graft necrosis, some surgeons perform a secondary skin graft with patients after the transplantation of the peroneus brevis muscle, which increases the number of operations and prolongs the stay of patients in the hospital. In contrast, our applications of the peroneus brevis muscle flap and neurocutaneous flaps can be performed within a single stage, allowing infection control and reconstruction of soft-tissue defects at stage I. This is the second advantage of our proposed method. Although the size of the reconstruction area of peroneus brevis muscle flaps and neurocutaneous flaps was relatively small in this study, this surgical combination can be applied to larger soft-tissue defects and obliterate larger dead space of bone defects when required. This is the third advantage of our proposed method. Previously, El-Khatib et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1534734613479381">24</xref></sup> reported the coverage of a 20 cm × 7 cm defect by splitting the peroneus brevis muscle, whereas Kim et al covered a 9 cm × 12 cm soft-tissue defect using the superficial peroneal nerve flap.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1534734613479381">15</xref></sup> We have recently applied sural and saphenous neurocutaneous flaps for the reconstruction of soft-tissue defects ranging from 18 cm × 12 cm to 22 cm × 16 cm in size.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1534734613479381">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1534734613479381">12</xref></sup> We found that this application met the needs for repairing associated tissue defects on a larger scale. The most important advantage of our proposed method was that it offered a versatile combination to reconstruct the hole-shaped bony and soft-tissue defect when the 2 defects were located in different 3-dimensional spaces. For instance, in case 2 of our study, a penetrating wound was caused when the necrotic tibial and fibular bone were removed during the process of debridement; the peroneus brevis muscle flap was used to fill the hole-shaped bony defect, and a saphenous nerve flap was used to reconstruct the soft-tissue defect located at the medial malleolus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1534734613479381">Figure 1</xref>). In case 8, a right posterior calcaneus bone defect and Achilles tendon exposure were found after debridement; the peroneus brevis muscle flap was used to fill the hole-shaped bony defect located at the anterior aspect of the Achilles tendon, and the sural nerve flap was elevated to cover the exposed Achilles tendon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1534734613479381">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

<p>The disadvantage is the bulkiness of the combined flap, sometimes, especially in women. However, the fact that functional reconstruction has been gained in such a complex defect may help offset this disadvantage. Another disadvantage of this study is related to the small number of patients involved and the fact that it is a retrospective study.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the application of distally pedicled peroneus brevis muscle flaps and retrograde neurocutaneous flaps represents an excellent option for obliterating dead space in the lower leg and foot after osteomyelitis debridement, controlling potential bone infection and repairing relatively large soft-tissue defects in the recipient area. This surgical technique is simple, easy, safe, reliable, and suitable for clinical treatment of hole-shaped bony defects and reconstruction of soft-tissue defects within a single stage, especially when the 2 defects are located in different 3-dimensional spaces.</p>
