<abstract>
<p>Jim Dyos, founding-father of British urban history, argued that cities have commonly acknowledged “individual characteristics” that distinguish them. Such distinctive characteristics, though usually based on material realities, are promoted through literary and visual representations. This article argues that those who seek to convey a city’s distinctiveness will do so not only through describing its particular topography, architecture, history or functions but also by describing its “local colour”: the supposedly unique customs, manner of speech, dress, or other special features of its inhabitants. In colonial cities this process involved white racial stereotyping of “others”. In Cape Town, depictions of “Coloured” inhabitants as unique “city types” became part of the city’s “destination branding”. The article analyses change and continuity in such representations. To this end it draws on the insights of Gareth Stedman Jones into changing depictions of London’s “Cockneys” and the insights of Stephen Ward into historical “place-selling”.</p>

<p>Cities have multiple meanings for individual inhabitants, multiple senses of place generated through experience and consequent emotional attachments. Yet one can still agree with Jim Dyos, a founding father of urban history in Britain, that cities have often had commonly acknowledged “individual characteristics.” These could be, and have been, perceived to distinguish them in popular imagination from other cities, even if such characteristics might change over time.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0096144211420646">1</xref></sup> Late-nineteenth-century gothic London, a place of fog and crime, could become plucky London of the Blitz, with St. Paul’s rising miraculously above the flames, or swinging London of the 1960s; Grim Glasgow of slums and violence could become Glasgow, city of culture.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0096144211420646">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Distinctive cities of the imagination have been created and popularized in both literary and visual media, normally through a combination of the two. Creators and propagators have included city historians, novelists, travel writers, and documentary and feature filmmakers. They have also and importantly included amateur or professional place sellers keen to attract tourists, investors, or additional inhabitants. Such place sellers will create some unifying myth about modern places and their “uniqueness,” however objectively complex cities have become.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0096144211420646">3</xref></sup> All those who attempt to convey the individual characteristics of a city are likely to do so not only by describing distinctive elements of its topography, architecture, demography, and functions but also through seeking to describe its “local color”: “the customs, manner of speech, dress, or other typical features of a place or period.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0096144211420646">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>From the perspective of white visitors, describing the local color of colonial port cities, or port cities with a colonial past, has often been in large part about describing the culture of local inhabitants of color. Before air travel, port cities were the preeminent sites of international cultural exchange, diverse human intermingling, and “racial miscegenation.” Such exchange and miscegenation produced in many port cities “racial” and cultural hybridity, with both processes perhaps more accurately or acceptably described as creolization.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0096144211420646">5</xref></sup> It would appear from the Cape Town case study that follows that it was not only, or predominantly, perceived physical difference such as darker pigmentation that warranted the attention of white visitors or locals when they were explaining what was supposedly unique about this port town. An essential ingredient of accounts of “local color” were comments on spectacularly distinct, indeed “colorful,” outward appearance that went beyond the anatomical. Such accounts focused on perceived difference in dress, adornments and appendages, behavior and tastes. It was these cultural elements, themselves the result of creolization, that made their bearers sufficiently “exotic” to merit inclusion as “local color.”</p>
<p>This article analyzes how verbal and visual representations of Cape Town from the late nineteenth century to the 1970s used representations of spectacular Creole or “Colored” Capetonians as local color, most notably “Malays,” “Colored Flower Sellers” and “Coon Carnival participants” (these terms will be explained). Such representations may appear to be simply examples of racial “othering.” In this way, they might be deemed to be much the same as those ubiquitously present in the literature and art of European “discovery” and colonial encounter at the Cape that commenced with descriptions of “Hottentots” and the “Hottentot Venus.” These were representations that did not neglect culture but demonstrated particular fascination with perceived anatomical difference.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0096144211420646">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>Yet the following analysis suggests that representations of local color in Cape Town from the mid-nineteenth century onward seem to have focused more on perceptions of cultural and behavioral distinction. They are reminiscent of contemporary Anglophone accounts of local color in European cities, be they travelers’ accounts of Venetian gondoliers or British accounts of London Cockneys, that were not obviously the result of colonial encounter.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0096144211420646">7</xref></sup> It would appear not only that local color was a ubiquitous way in which the individuality of a city was promoted, but also that such descriptions usually contained a class dimension.</p>
<p>In this respect, representations of Cape Town’s local color were strikingly similar to representations of London’s Cockneys memorably analyzed by Gareth Stedman Jones.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0096144211420646">8</xref></sup> What Stedman Jones makes clear is that for at least some middle- or upper-class British observers, Cockneys were seen in what seems to be racial terms as inherently different. Kipling for one likened Cockney customs “to those of the Barrolong.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0096144211420646">9</xref></sup> Anglophone middle-class visitors to lower-class and poverty-stricken areas of cities in Australia, the United States, and Britain from the late nineteenth onward usually looked for and found exotic “others,” even among those not identified as living in the likes of Chinatowns or coming from an immigrant community. Their descriptions of what they dubbed “slums,” whether in London’s East End, Birmingham, Sydney, or San Francisco, used deliberately sensational language or visual imagery to emphasize perceived abnormalities and differences among their denizens.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0096144211420646">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>To this extent of course there were similarities with the literature of colonial encounter. This would appear to have reflected both the rise of pseudo-Darwinist ideas about inheritable difference, the popularity and influence of colonial travel literature, and the changing social demography of nineteenth-century cities.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0096144211420646">11</xref></sup> Technological innovations such as railways and trams facilitated urban growth and suburbanization, and thereby spatial separation that correlated with class. “Slumlands” were portrayed as being continents apart from middle-class areas, their inhabitants often depicted as being as dissimilar from the observer as anthropophagi. General William Booth of Salvation Army fame certainly thought along these lines as is evident even from the very title of his book, <italic>In Darkest England and the Way Out.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0096144211420646">12</xref></sup> For Cape Town’s middle-class inhabitants like their counterparts in many other cities, when inhabitants of slums were portrayed in more positive and cheerful fashion, as with Cockney Pearly Kings and Queens, such local color was “<italic>the popular in its place</italic>.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0096144211420646">13</xref></sup> In this way, depictions of members of the predominantly Colored lower classes as “Malays,” “Colored Flower Sellers,” and “Coons” made the urban proletariat seem unthreatening. So did the focus on the relatively small and respectable “Malay Quarter” on the slopes of Lion Hill as the area of Cape Town in which “Malays” lived.</p>
<p>“Malays,” a term used as a synonym for Colored Muslims since the mid-nineteenth century, lived in other areas of the city, notably the much larger District Six. Yet unlike the Malay Quarter, District Six was a place that was securely added by middle-class Capetonians to the pantheon of the city’s attractions only after it had been declared a “whites-only” group area in 1966, and subsequently demolished, under apartheid-era legislation. Until the continued existence of District Six was threatened by an Afrikaner nationalist government, it was generally depicted in middle-class English-language representations as dangerous and unattractive. Briefly expanding on the reasons for this helps to explain what was selected for inclusion as part of Cape Town’s “local color” and what was not.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0096144211420646">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>The often very negative depictions of District Six before the apartheid era may have been because it was part of an extensive area of workshops and small factories, thus more readily identifiable in middle-class imagination with the threatening presence of an urban proletariat than the Malay Quarter. More certainly it was associated with gangs and violence, and was depicted as a decidedly unsafe place that white visitors were told to avoid. A further reason why District Six was usually excluded from depictions of Cape Town’s local color was probably because the greater proportion of its inhabitants were Christian Coloreds, and thereby generally less spectacular in appearance and customs than the Muslim “Malays.” Christian Coloreds became local color only when holding large bundles of colorful, thus spectacular, blooms as flower sellers, or in gaudy dress and makeup when appearing as “Coon carnival participants.” Colored Capetonians if deemed (rightly or wrongly) to be sufficiently safe and spectacular could then be listed among the city’s unique characteristics alongside Table Mountain or South-Easter winds. Each could be part of both an insider and outsider sense of Cape Town as distinctive place. For example, here is a description of Cape Town written in 1947 by a leading author of books that used local color to promote a Cape Town sense of place:</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>It is a sweltering evening before New Year and there is music in Somerset Road. Often enough the road is harsh and littered with human wreckage, but tonight there is music. These violins and guitars are played by coloured men. . . . Something in the singing makes me stand and listen. This is Cape Town’s own music, and tonight the note is plaintive. As they march on to their vague destination the men turn into an alley and the music fades. I can no longer visualize them, for it was long ago; yet the memory lingers. They carry centuries with them as their melody blends with the moonlight. . . . [I]t seems as though the soul of Cape Town moves with the troubadours and their music. All the many races that have mingled to form Cape Town’s coloured population are there with the musicians. Hottentot and Malay and Bantu blood without a doubt; but other origins are lost and they are just coloured coons in the darkness. They cannot be sad, for this is one of their rare nights. Yet the music is softened and almost ghostly, the voices are wistful. It is as though the slaves are singing for their freedom. I strain to hear the last of them, and then the tune changes. “Vat jou goed en trek, Ferreira. . . .” [“Take your things and go, Ferreira”] When you listen to that old song and many more, strummed out on guitars by marching coloured men, then you can be nowhere in the world but in the Cape.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0096144211420646">15</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>This was written by arguably the greatest literary popularizer of Cape Town’s distinctiveness from the mid-1930s to early 1970s, Lawrence Green. The extract is from Green’s most successful book, <italic>Tavern of the Seas</italic>, which sold more than fifty thousand copies at a time when the white English-speaking population of South Africa was only about eight hundred thousand.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0096144211420646">16</xref></sup> Given his success, Green and his work deserve some further explanation.</p>
<p>Green became a private Cape Town city booster for the same reason that motivated most other city boosters: genuine love of place became intertwined with realization of the potential personal reward to be gained from promoting it. In Green’s case such reward came from his immensely popular evocations of Cape Town’s distinctiveness. Except for a brief period as a Fleet Street journalist, Green was domiciled all his life in Cape Town and according to his biographer never wished to live anywhere else.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0096144211420646">17</xref></sup> For many years he was a journalist and travel writer on a local newspaper, the <italic>Cape Argus</italic>. Green’s journalism and the books that grew out of this combined two enduring ingredients of popular travel literature. The first was carefully constructed evocations of place that incorporated the likes of local color, mention of distinctive topography, flora, and fauna, and antiquarian history. The second was sensationalism, as suggested by the titles of Green’s early books based on his African travels: <italic>Coast of Treasures</italic>, <italic>Great African Mysteries</italic>, <italic>Secret Africa</italic> (which had a chapter on Cape Town’s Malays), <italic>Strange Africa</italic>, and <italic>Old Africa Untamed</italic>.</p>
<p>Green was a prolific writer and apart from his journalism wrote thirty-four books. These were aimed at both an overseas and South African readership. But it was the four on Cape Town, and preeminently <italic>Tavern of the Seas</italic>, that were his most successful, and they sold largely to local readers. One likely reason for Green’s popular appeal was absences. His books contained no overt politics, and, partly connected to this absence of course, they made little attempt to explain change over time in any coherent way, albeit that there was the implicit suggestion that history (including the history of towns) was made by individuals. Instead Green’s books were thematically rather than chronologically ordered, moved backward and forward between the present and the past, and contained numerous chapters on seemingly disconnected themes: from the Cape Town weather, to the New Year carnival, to “snakes, spiders, and scorpions,” to the history of lighthouses, to old recipes, to how streets and suburbs got their names, and to what had happened in them “long ago.” This was history little interested in causation, but immensely interested in the antiquated, the odd, the remarkable, and the eccentric; in other words, in elements of local color.</p>
<p>Green guided the reader around Cape Town and the Cape Peninsula, its built structures, flora, fauna, and topography, reminding or informing his readers of how spaces were places. In particular he provided history, and thereby a sense of place and self-identity, to residents of Anglophone suburbs from Sea Point to Simonstown and to the streets and old buildings in or near where they worked in the Australian-style small city center. Thereby Green’s Cape Town books provided a sense of place for local residents not necessarily derived—as Tuan might have it—from their childhood experience if certainly in part from his own.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0096144211420646">18</xref></sup> And a major component of Green’s technique in providing an overall Cape Town sense of place was to include descriptions of Colored Capetonians as part of describing the city’s local color.</p>
<p>“Coon Carnival Troupes,” “Colored Flower Sellers,” and “Malays” were the three quintessential elements of Green’s representations of Coloreds as local color in <italic>Tavern of the Seas</italic>: “Coon Carnival Troupes” were described in the extract already quoted. Green was depicting what disturbingly to outsiders was and still is referred to by participants as the Coon Carnival, nowadays more commonly dubbed Cape Town’s New Year Carnival in tourist literature. Of Colored Flower Sellers Green wrote,</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>Adderley Street’s world-famous flower-sellers . . . have become part of Cape Town, <italic>like the gondoliers of Venice and the Zulu rickshaw men of Durban</italic>. They are among the memories a tourist is bound to carry away with him; worth more to the city than any number of coloured posters. . . . They have helped to make Adderley Street one of the world’s great streets.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0096144211420646">19</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>

</fig>
<p>Several pages of <italic>Tavern of the Seas</italic> were devoted to describing the history and customs of Cape Malays: their origins as exiles from Dutch East India Company territories in the Far East, Malay “magic” and medicines, <italic>Khalifas</italic> (sword ordeals), their torchlight processions on New Year’s Eve, the “breath of the past” in the Malay Quarter.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0096144211420646">20</xref></sup> And Green wrote of this part of Cape Town in a subsequent book, “Atmosphere, that elusive quality, is stronger here among the chickens and pigeons of the Malay Quarter than in any other part of South Africa.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0096144211420646">21</xref></sup> Or in yet another work, one more overtly aimed at a non–South African Anglophone audience, Green averred that the “cries of the red-fezzed Malay fisherman” were among the distinctive sounds of Cape Town along with those of its birds, the “creak of cargo tackle” and the “lapping of the tides.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0096144211420646">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>To begin to understand the origins, nature, and possible meanings of these three iconic uses of Colored Capetonians as local color requires setting a history of representations within what one might dare to call a brief “real” history of the city. Cape Town was established by the Dutch East India Company in the mid-seventeenth century as a way station between Europe and its possessions in the East.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0096144211420646">23</xref></sup> In time the settlement developed into a territorially expansive colony complete with imported slaves, exiled opponents of Dutch colonialism in the East, and subjugated Khoisan. Many of the slaves and exiles were Muslim.</p>
<p>When the British seized the Cape in the course of the Napoleonic Wars, Cape Town was still a very small place. The population had reached only about sixteen thousand, with a two-way division between those who were largely (but not entirely) light-skinned and free (seven thousand), and darker skinned slaves. Categorization and self-description of Capetonians predictably changed through time. Before emancipation, the most important divide was between the free and the bonded, albeit that this divide largely coincided with lightness and darkness of pigmentation. By the 1850s, those who thought of themselves as whites began to refer to Muslim Capetonians, whatever their actual ancestry, as Malays. By the 1870s, if not before, the term <italic>Malay</italic> was adopted by numbers of people so categorized to describe themselves, at least in their dealings with whites.</p>
<p>It is probable that the vast majority of Malays at this stage were ex-slaves and their descendants. Adherence or conversion to Islam would appear to have aided the process of giving many slaves and their descendants psychological self-ownership. Islam, education in Arabic, many shared occupations, participation in choral street bands, and particular culinary and medical practices. So did residential concentration in one- or two-storied, flat-roofed, white-washed houses in what some were already referring to as the Malay Quarter by the 1870s.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0096144211420646">24</xref></sup> So also did distinctive dress and festive practices. Malay men wore</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>large broad-brimmed hats of basket-work, and many have coloured handkerchiefs tied round their heads. The women flaunt gay head-dresses, and when a wedding or a feast takes place, the streets are ablaze with colour.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0096144211420646">25</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Flamboyant dress may well have served to obscure phenotypical differences by becoming a more important external signifier of group identity for Cape Town’s Malays and those who perceived them: clothes helped maketh the Malays. The brief description cited was written by David Kennedy, a Scottish traveler to the Cape in the 1870s. His immodestly titled <italic>Kennedy at the Cape</italic> was just one of numerous literary and visual representations of Cape Town in the nineteenth and early twentieth century that deployed picturesque Malay local color in depicting the city. Few, if any, representations in this period failed to do so. Notable visual and literary contributions in this respect were made by the likes of George Angas’s lithograph “Malay Boy of Cape Town,” published in London, J. S. Mayson’s <italic>The Malays of Cape Town</italic>, Lady Duff Gordon’s <italic>Letters from the Cape</italic>, and Arthur Elliott’s exhibitions that included photographs of street scenes from the Malay Quarter.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0096144211420646">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>Consequently experiencing Malay culture or visiting the Malay Quarter became a tourist attraction for British visitors from the nineteenth century onward, whether they were aristocrats like Lady Duff Gordon or actresses like Lily Langtree. This helped to ensure that Malays and Malay culture became an enduring part of written and visual popular representations of the city into the era of professional place selling with the establishment of the Cape Peninsula Publicity Association (CPPA) in 1909.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0096144211420646">27</xref></sup> Lawrence Green featured Malays in one of his early general books on Africa published in London in 1936.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0096144211420646">28</xref></sup> A mid-twentieth-century boost also came in the form of official Afrikaner nationalist recognition of the distinctiveness of Malay ethnic identity, in substantial part the result of the ethnographic publications of Afrikaner writer I. D. du Plessis.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0096144211420646">29</xref></sup> Unsurprisingly, Lady Macmillan, wife of the British prime minister, was shown in British newsreels having tea in the Malay Quarter, not District Six, during the couples’ “Winds of Change” tour of the Union in 1960.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0096144211420646">30</xref></sup></p>
<p>By the end of the nineteenth century Malays were the Muslim component, or subset, of the Cape Town “Colored” population. The term <italic>Colored</italic> was used by people who thought of themselves as white or European in the middle of the nineteenth century in two ways: either to describe all blacks or, more narrowly, just those who were not Bantu-speaking “Natives” or Africans. In the course of the nineteenth century some people defined as Colored used the term to describe themselves and to distinguish themselves from both whites and Bantu-speaking Natives (Africans). Communities consisting predominantly of ex-slaves and Khoisan were formed in the countryside and towns of the Cape before and after formal emancipation in the 1830s. Cape Town’s Malays were one such community. Cultural forms, such as Emancipation Day and New Year celebrations, served to remind members of their share heritage of oppression and bondage. So did continued white domination of power and resources, the continued perceivable correlation between darker pigmentation and deprivation. Connections between these communities were provided by the likes of labor mobility, rural–urban migration, and service in colonial levies. A creolized form of Dutch, Afrikaans, became the main linguistic medium of communication.</p>

</fig>
<p>The fact that members of these communities began to see themselves as Colored in contradistinction to white or Bantu-speaking “Native” was the result of a symbiotic relationship between racialization and self-identity at a time when new divisions of labor were tending to confirm a tripartite division of Cape Town’s social formation into white, Colored, and Native. This occurred as migration of the latter group from other parts of South Africa, as well as legislation that discriminated against them (such as pass laws, segregation in locations, and prohibition on the consumption of “European” alcohol), increased in the late nineteenth century. The establishment of overtly Colored political and social organizations helped promote and maintain such distinctions.</p>
<p>So did social events such as the street parading at New Year that became known as the Coon Carnival in the twentieth century. Such festivities probably had their origins as licensed celebrations of temporary “freedom” by the bonded during slavery. By the 1870s paraders were formed into singing and sporting clubs distinguished by different costumes, and their celebration began to be noticed by local white journalists. By the late 1880s both numbers of paraders and the unusualness of their costumes and appearance would seem to have increased sufficiently for local newspapers to expend considerable column inches in describing them. In 1886 the <italic>Cape Times</italic> stated,</p>
<p><disp-quote><p>The frivolous coloured inhabitants of Cape Town . . . [went] . . . about in large bodies dressed most fantastically, carrying “guys,” and headed by blowers of wind and players of stringed instruments, who evoked from their horrible monsters the most discordant and blatant noises that ever deafened human ears. At night time these people added further inflictions upon the suffering citizens of Cape Town in the shape of vocalisation, singing selections from their peculiar weird music, with variations from Rule Britannia and the Old Hundreth. They also carried Chinese lanterns and banners . . . [when] the strange glinting of . . . the street lamps and the . . . lanterns fell upon their dark faces, they seemed like so many uncanny spirits broken loose from—say the adamantine chains of the Nether world.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0096144211420646">31</xref></sup></p></disp-quote></p>
<p>In 1888, perhaps for the first time, one of the “large bodies” consisted of paraders dressed as American blackfaced minstrels. By the 1900s, reports revealed that the names of different troupes included “The Jolly Coon Masquerade Troupe,” “The Jolly Coons” and “The Diamond Eyes,” as well as “The Spanish Cavaliers,” “The King’s Messengers,” and “The Prince of Benin’s Escorts.” By the 1930s the Coon Carnival was officially accepted and propagated as part of the city’s unique characteristics. That this happened was in part due to the interest shown in the carnival by foreign newsreel companies. The wholly British-owned Topical Film Company—that presented “issues of the day . . . alongside eccentric and idiosyncratic stories”—was probably the first to screen what it called the “Coloured Folks Carnival” in cinema screens in Britain in 1928: “Grotesquely attired grown-ups and piccanins celebrate New Year’s Day with procession and war-dance through the streets of Cape Town.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0096144211420646">32</xref></sup></p>
<p>This imperial blessing may explain why the tourist promotion arm of the South African Government, the South African Railways and Harbours Department (SARH), sponsored a film in 1932 called <italic>The Cape of Good Hope</italic> that also featured Carnival troupes amidst more conventional attractions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0096144211420646">33</xref></sup> The opening sequence featured a map of Africa and the tip of the Cape Peninsula accompanied by the commentary that it was first rounded by Bartholmew Diaz in the 1480s. The film then had more shots of the Peninsula mountain chain and further narration over shots of Cape Town harbor that declared that the Cape “is the Gateway to Africa.” We are also told that Cape Town was the mother city of South Africa and the site of parliament and shown some of the city’s distinctive attractions associated with Dutch and British colonial history: the historic castle, “the oldest building in South Africa,” Groot Constantia, one of the “oldest examples of Cape Dutch architecture,” and Rhodes memorial built in “illustrious memory of a great patriot,” whose advice to “look north” was taken and thereby a hinterland “once dominated by superstition and savagery” opened up for civilization. But a further distinctive Cape Town characteristic was proffered in a sequence that began with the statement, “Just a moment, here come the Cape Coloured Coons,” and that then showed a group of minstrels wearing satin costumes, playing violins and banjos, and singing American negro spirituals strolling up Adderley Street past electric trams.</p>
<p>For the next two decades, albeit with something of a hiatus during the Second World War, the Coon Carnival featured regularly, and favorably, in both South African and British newsreels, as well as in many city histories, guides, novels, and travel writing.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0096144211420646">34</xref></sup> For instance, in 1947 British Pathé News featured the Carnival in its “The World at Your Elbow” magazine feature. The compilation began with a boxing contest in Sydney that was immediately followed by a shot of a billboard with the words “Colossal Coon Carnival.” This introduced a sequence of shots featuring groups of blackfaced minstrels marching through the streets of Cape Town. The voice-over narration went,</p>

<p>Adderley Street flower sellers were a third variety of local color commonly used to evoke Cape Town in literary and visual representations for much of the twentieth century, including Green’s seminal <italic>Tavern of the Seas</italic>. Probably as a result of the establishment of the CPPA in 1909, photographs of flower sellers by a Mrs. Caleb Keen apparently first made their appearance on postcards in 1910. In the interwar period South Africa’s Central News Agency bookstore produced its own postcards featuring a series of scenes of Cape Town that included flower sellers. One much photographed was a Mrs. Susan Ferreira, who also appeared on chocolate box covers.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0096144211420646">36</xref></sup> An illustration of a flower seller was placed opposite the title page of an unofficial tourist guide to Cape Town in 1927.

<p>The high point in the use of all three elements of Capetonians as local color occurred from the 1930s to the 1950s. So what meanings might be attached to these depictions? It may be possible to distinguish here between more enduring meanings and others that changed somewhat over time. The numerous parallels between representations from the 1910s to 1960s of Colored Capetonians and those of Cockney Londoners from the 1890s to the 1960s are very striking.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0096144211420646">39</xref></sup> Indeed, several authors who described Cape Town and its inhabitants suggested as much. For instance A. W. Wells in <italic>South Africa</italic>, an influential guide to the country in the 1930s and 1940s that ran to several editions, overtly stated that Colored Capetonians were Cape Town’s Cockneys.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0096144211420646">40</xref></sup></p>
<p>Likewise, Joy Packer, whose novels and autobiographical writing were—alongside the histories of Lawrence Green—among the most popular depictions of Cape Town between the Second World War and the 1970s wrote, “[T]he Cape Coloureds are a gay, good natured people . . . their ready humour is as quick and individual as the cockney.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-0096144211420646">41</xref></sup> As Packer’s words suggest, depictions of Coloreds and Cockneys represented both as people of wit and cheerfulness. Both were also represented as people who enjoyed picturesque display, people of “clownish fancy dress”—whether as “Coon” or “Pearly”—and musical “knees-ups”; people of distinct dialects and residential areas whose knowledge or interests seldom extended beyond their immediate locale or social peers.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-0096144211420646">42</xref></sup></p>
<p>The writer Francis Brett Young, who had depicted the local color of the British Midlands in his Mercian novels before emigrating to South Africa after the Second World War, wrote in similar vein in his Satour guide of 1952. After the obligatory mention of Malay culture, Young stated, “These coloured folk are a quick-witted race. . . . They have a humour that is all their own, and are endowed with a taste for vivid colours.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-0096144211420646">43</xref></sup> Likewise, in his guide to South Africa, Alan Paton stated that Coloreds “are in general a cheerful and friendly people.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-0096144211420646">44</xref></sup> American writer, journalist, and national broadcaster Robert St. John, in his account of visiting South Africa, cited an Anglican minister who worked in District Six (a predominantly Colored residential area) as saying, “‘They simply <italic>love</italic> colour!’” (emphasis original).</p>
<p>One reason why Coloreds and Cockneys were represented in such similar fashion is that there were many important commonalities between economic activities and social structure in Cape Town and London in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, despite huge disparities of scale. In both cities economic power resided with “those whose income derived from rent, banking and commerce.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-0096144211420646">45</xref></sup> Seasonality of production, types of casual occupations, and a strong artisan sector characterized both labor markets. Significantly, even if small factories and workshops were plentiful in both places, the presence of an industrial proletariat was strongly diluted. This was both through the existence of a sea of casual labor as well as by many who were semi-proletarianized, partially self-employed, or self-sufficient. Their numbers included both Cockney and Colored costermongers as well as members of the “traditional” classes such as fishermen or tailors.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-0096144211420646">46</xref></sup></p>
<p>Hence both Colored Capetonians and Cockneys could be portrayed as people of the market place, as participating in low-level and sometimes illegal trade of varying kinds, rather than people of the workshop, because this was at least true of a substantial number. And arguably both Coloreds and Cockneys could trade, display, and clown in an urban spaces more central, observable, and less confined or controlled than those in industrial or mining centers such as Kimberley or Johannesburg. Yet the ubiquitous iconography of Coloreds as flower sellers (or fishermen) rather than as factory hands is arguably similar to representations of Cockneys as “costers” in further ideological ways. As Stedman Jones has suggested, such portrayals can be seen as the language of class: a desire on behalf of the middle classes to disassociate members of the “lower classes” from any direct relationship with industrial production (and threatening big labor). The consequence was to “blunt the threat of mass democracy and to fragment it into a mosaic of colourful idiosyncrasy.” And in the opinion of both local and foreign observers Coloreds were indeed “docile,” uninvolved in nationalism or affairs of state, the majority peaceful and orderly: “untroubled things” who were “only decoratively functional” to the representation of countryside as well as town in the Cape.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-0096144211420646">47</xref></sup> Like the British rural lower orders in a George Eliot novel, Coloreds were “included for conversation and colour, not so much bearers of personal experience” or as individuals.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-0096144211420646">48</xref></sup> As the narration of one Satour film put it in 1954, in reference to the opening of parliament, “but such exalted goings on mean little to the flower-sellers of Cape Town who ply their trade with patent unconcern every month of the year.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-0096144211420646">49</xref></sup> Depictions of Coloreds like those of Cockneys would certainly appear to have been celebrations of the “<italic>popular in its place</italic>” as Stedman Jones put it.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50-0096144211420646">50</xref></sup> These were depictions in the case of Coloreds that were often conveyed by middle-class South Africans, such as Lawrence Green or Joy Packer, who had moved around the British World, particularly back and forth between the Cape and Britain. They had experienced as well as read about both Cape Town and London and were likely to have had similar class attitudes tinged with racialization to the “lower orders” of both cities.</p>
<p>It was Johannesburg that was South Africa’s Manchester in terms of perceived weight of proletarian presence, a threat notably demonstrated by revolutionary white mineworkers in the “Rand Revolt” of 1922 as well as by black mineworkers who were violently driven back to work in 1946.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn51-0096144211420646">51</xref></sup> But even black mineworkers could be commonly portrayed as divided into numerous “tribal” components while performing picturesque Sunday morning dances for tourists.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn52-0096144211420646">52</xref></sup> And the black working class in South Africa’s third largest city (by the 1940s), Durban, could be depicted as the Zulu rickshaw puller, complete with outlandish headdress and cheerful high-stepping trot.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn53-0096144211420646">53</xref></sup></p>
<p>Like Cockneys in British popular culture of the 1980s, depictions of Colored or Malay flower sellers, fishermen, and tailors, as well as the streets they inhabited, were often tinged with nostalgia in the post–Second World War years of modernization: skyscrapers, motorways, and airplanes. The passage from Green’s <italic>Tavern of the Seas</italic> cited above is a prime example. The same is true of Packer’s novels, or <italic>Vissers van Kalkbaai</italic> (1955), a documentary made with the financial support of the South African Department of Information, or the countless depictions in city histories of the 1940s through to 1960s.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn54-0096144211420646">54</xref></sup></p>
<p>If both Cockney and Colored were depicted as cheerful, this was in part because cheerfulness had a functional role in securing temporary employment or trade for people who “unlike the skilled and the better paid . . . could not afford the luxury of rejecting the patronage of those above them and probably could not see the point of doing so.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn55-0096144211420646">55</xref></sup> Clownish behavior on Carnival occasions was partly an extension of its everyday utilitarianism. Yet Carnival, whether in London or Cape Town, had other meanings, including potential disorder.</p>
<p>Of course New Year Carnival in Cape Town had its own particular history, and one inexplicably connected to the city’s function as a port located between the Atlantic and Indian worlds as well as place of small units of production for local consumption. The appearance of New Year revelers changed over time and demonstrated a variety of influences. From twentieth-century evidence, the ability to wear elaborate costumes was facilitated by the central involvement of tailoring families. Costume purchase could be financed by a set-aside system of saving during the preceding months.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn56-0096144211420646">56</xref></sup> Some participants in the nineteenth century wore satin breeches and feathered hats, presumably in enduring emulation or mockery of white elites.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn57-0096144211420646">57</xref></sup> One troupe in the 1870s wore firemen’s costumes. Since there was a Malay Fire Brigade in the city, this may have been their working clothes. But these uniforms were obviously British imports and symbolic of British domination. Because of these ingredients, carousing in this apparel could contain satirical meaning, as might the fact that troupes in marching formation were, and continued to be, led by “captains,” suggesting the influence and parody of British military parades. Indeed, albeit that most Colored Coons, like Cockneys, “unlike the skilled and better paid . . . could not afford the luxury of rejecting the patronage of those above them and probably did not see the point of doing so.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn58-0096144211420646">58</xref></sup> Yet disguised at New Year they could combine self-mockery with parody and symbolic occupation of the city’s central streets.</p>
<p>Cape Town’s position as a port situated between the Atlantic and Indian Oceans explains a number of cultural influences in the New Year Carnival. Take for instance the evident borrowing from American minstrelsy. White minstrels in blackface makeup first came to Cape Town in the persons of Joe Brown’s Band of Brothers in 1848.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn59-0096144211420646">59</xref></sup> But the most successful entertainment of this sort was provided by the Harvey-Leslie Christy Minstrels in 1862 and 1865. They performed “nigger” part songs, jigs, and mocking caricatures of American slaves in a variety of venues to all classes of Capetonians. According to the local <italic>Cape Argus</italic> newspaper, “even at the Cape. Where the nigger character is so well understood, the caricature created a furore.” Leslie, in the character of “Broder Bones,” provided local flavor with his impressions of “life among Dutch farmers” and imitations of “Cape Dutch.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn60-0096144211420646">60</xref></sup> Slave descendants in Cape Town were likely to have found some resonances, not least in the ambivalences of songs like “I’m leaving thee in sorrow Annie,” “Hard Times,” and “Massie’s in the Cold Ground.”</p>
<p>The playing of such songs at New Year endured into the 1950s as Donald Swanson’s film of carnival performers demonstrates.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn61-0096144211420646">61</xref></sup> And alongside those obvious imports were both hit tunes from the Anglophone world of that decade as well as <italic>ghoemaliedjies</italic>, literally drum songs, some of whose rhythms and forms had almost certainly been brought to Cape Town by slaves from the Dutch East Indies. And <italic>ghoemaliedjies</italic> certainly contained both social and political satires.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn62-0096144211420646">62</xref></sup></p>
<p>As already suggested in this article, there were particular chronologies, including moments of greater and lesser salience, to the appearance of the three elements of Coloreds as local color we have discussed. The one that appeared first, Malays and their culture, went into something of a temporary retreat in the 1880s when anti-Malay and anti-Colored racism more generally grew in the depths of a serious economic depression, strike, organization by the unemployed, and the so-called Cemetery Riots of 1886. This involved Muslim resistance to the closure of their burial places for “sanitary” reasons.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn63-0096144211420646">63</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Coon Carnival, though in existence and noticed by middle-class observers by the 1870s, did not become securely part of city place selling and city histories until the 1930s. This was partly because the Carnival’s growth also coincided with the social disturbances of the 1880s, indeed may have played a role in producing the Cemetery Riots.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn64-0096144211420646">64</xref></sup> It was also because there was an ongoing association of Carnival with unrespectability. In the wake of the multiracial Hunger Riots of 1906, organized by the Cape Town branch of the Social Democratic Federation, a new municipal regulation stipulated that no street processions except for funerals would be allowed without the written consent of the mayor, and then only “by such routes and in the manner specified in such consent.” A hundred Colored men were subsequently brought before the Resident Magistrate for parading and “playing banjos.” The Magistrate commented that there was “too much of this sort of procession—quite enough of it. By-and-by the men would not be able to control themselves, and then there would be trouble.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn65-0096144211420646">65</xref></sup> The 1907 Carnival was confined to a highly controlled procession from the Grand Parade, in the city center, to the sports ground on Green Point Common where troupe competed for prizes judged “mostly” by middle-class whites. More spontaneous street parading returned only in 1909, while the competitions for prizes continued and were eventually contained within the safe environs of stadiums. So the addition of the Carnival to the local color portion of Cape Town’s attractions only came after it, and importantly the social rebelliousness of the 1900s, had seemingly been tamed.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn66-0096144211420646">66</xref></sup></p>
<p>The delay was probably extended further for two reasons. First, because of renewed anti-Colored prejudice in the 1920s that was based on pseudo-Darwinist theories of the deleterious effects of miscegenation. Such thinking was popularly promoted in Anglophone middle-class circles by the publication in 1924 of Sarah Gertrude Millin’s <italic>God’s Stepchildren</italic>, which had numerous subsequent editions. As the inside of the dust jacket put it in the 1951 edition, and the content of her novels demonstrated, as Millin grew to young womanhood, “the endless, self-repeating tragedy of mixed blood took horrified hold of her imagination.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn67-0096144211420646">67</xref></sup></p>
<p>There was also the apparent desire on the part of the CPPA in the immediate post–World War period to emphasize the white, European nature of Cape Town’s amenities, historical associations, and culture more generally. The effect was that the city was marketed to potential immigrants or tourists as Europe in the sun, the <italic>Riviera of the South</italic> (the title of a CPPA pamphlet of 1929), elements of Creole or African distinctiveness played down.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn68-0096144211420646">68</xref></sup> That the Carnival might actually be an attraction for Europeans was demonstrated securely only in 1928, when, as previously mentioned, the British Topical Film Company decided to make <italic>The Coloured Folks’ Carnival</italic>.</p>
<p>By the 1960s the promotion of the Carnival as a possible tourist attraction or its inclusion as a positive aspect of local color was in decline. It made a late and rather menacing appearance in the opening sequence of a little-seen British feature film called <italic>Code 7, Victim 5</italic>. This was a 1964 thriller-cum-travelogue set in the Cape that again emphasized Cape Town’s Rivieran qualities in positive fashion, while Coons and even Malays (portrayed performing the Khalifa) were shown as threateningly other.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn69-0096144211420646">69</xref></sup> By the late 1960s Coons and Malays were all but absent from local and foreign feature films and travelogues; Coons even from several city histories. Only the more anodyne and fleeting presence of flower sellers remained in feature films like <italic>The Cape Town Affair</italic> or travelogues like <italic>Four Cities in the Sun</italic> and <italic>Four Seasons in the Sun</italic>, or Slinger’s city history, <italic>Cape Town’s 100 Years of Progress</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn70-0096144211420646">70</xref></sup></p>
<p>The title of Slinger’s book provides a clue as to why this happened. By the 1960s, emphasizing the progress and modernity of South Africa’s cities, and their supposed similarity in this respect with European and North American counterparts, had clearly become the preferred strategy in the minds of many official or unofficial place sellers. In the context of growing international antipathy to apartheid, itself in part the result of much of the rest of the world gradually retreating from colonialism and legislated racial discrimination, using racial otherness to sell South African cities would be a questionable strategy. To even mention the existence of a Coon Carnival in Cape Town might confirm the world’s worst suspicions of white South African racism. There was also the consideration that apartheid legislation and modernist town planning in Cape Town were undermining the potential of the Carnival to be a visible attraction, by serving to whiten the city center.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn71-0096144211420646">71</xref></sup> The South African Government Information Office may have given financial support to the making of <italic>Vissers van Kalkbaai</italic> and its “sympathetic understanding of the way of life of these colorful people” in the 1950s. But by the early 1960s the official view was that films it supported should promote the idea that the “basic strength of South Africa lies in its traditional policy of ‘free enterprise’ as expressed by individuals living and working for a common cause,” like any other country of the global West.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn72-0096144211420646">72</xref></sup></p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>For all the similarity in portrayals of Cockneys and Coloreds as other, one significant difference was that unlike Coloreds Cockneys could be conceived of and embraced, however paternalistically, as part of one nation in the mid-twentieth century. This was thanks to the way that the likes of Kipling argued that British imperial adventures, including the South African War, were reliant on the participation of “Tommy Atkins.” This assimilation to the nation was later reinforced by middle England belief in the supposed <italic>Me and My Girl</italic> cheerful pluckiness of East Enders during the Second World War.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn73-0096144211420646">73</xref></sup></p>
<p>Colored Capetonians were excluded from the white South African nation putatively created by the Act of Union in 1910. Hitherto, and especially in the Cape with its nonracial franchise and at least theoretical equality of all before the law, it had been possible for Colored Cape colonists to imagine themselves as British, even to be accepted as such by white Britons, albeit perhaps especially when they were recruited like Tommy Atkins to fight against the Boers. But the Act of Union established a sociopolitical system in which race trumped class, that there would be a whites-only franchise in South Africa’s three provinces beyond the Cape, and that white political supremacy was thereby entrenched. The victory of Afrikaner Nationalists in 1948, and their increased success in subsequent elections through the 1950s and 1960s, seemingly confirmed permanent Colored exclusion from the South African nation. What lingered for some was a somewhat ironic nostalgia for Britishness lost.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn74-0096144211420646">74</xref></sup></p>
<p>Yet if Coloreds were not part of an imagined white South African nation, they continued to be accorded proper Capetonian citizenship, however paternalistically this was conveyed, by a number of popular thus influential white Capetonian authors like Green and Packer. Colored Capetonians, whether as Malays, Coons or flower sellers, also loomed large in at least one illustrated history and contemporary souvenir of the city, Alfred Honikman’s <italic>Cape Town: City of Good Hope</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn75-0096144211420646">75</xref></sup> The fact that they did so probably had much to do with all three author’s publicly avowed opposition to the National Party and its policies. They included Group Areas Act removals of Colored communities to the Cape Flats and central government ordained removal of Coloreds from the Cape Town municipal voters’ rolls.</p>
<p>This opposition to apartheid was shared by many white English-speaking Capetonians, albeit that it frequently (but not always) had rather more to do with a sense of their own marginalization by Afrikaner nationalism than with a principled stand on behalf of the disenfranchised. In addition, from the late 1950s Colored Capetonian writers began to publish poems, short stories, and novels in which they represented themselves. To begin with these often omitted white stereotypes in favor of grimmer, more social realist depictions of slum life. However, by the 1970s they also incorporated depictions of Malays, Carnival, and flower sellers in communities destroyed by Group Area Act forced removals. In part they did so to conjure up communal worlds they had lost because of such legislation, thereby providing a powerful and enduring critique of apartheid.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn76-0096144211420646">76</xref></sup></p>
