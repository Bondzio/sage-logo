<title>Problem Addressed</title>
<p>An estimated 56 million Americans or 33% of the workforce are un- or underbanked and therefore relying on alternative financial services providers (AFSPs). Examples of AFSPs include check-cashing outlets, payday lenders, pawnshops, rent-to-own stores and auto title lenders. Fees for these services can be 15% to 17% for a 2-week loan, resulting in annual percentage rates ranging as high as 700%. In some industries, more than 90% of the workforce is at the mercy of such lenders.</p>
<p>Moreover, 20% of the workforce does not have easy access to a home computer, and even with such access, a significant percentage of the direct/nonsalaried workforce (approximately 85%) still comes to HR to affect transactions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0886368712440490">
<title>Innovation</title>
<p>The answer is an at-the-worksite ATM that can also serve as an HR portal access site. It is provided at no cost to the employer for groups of 300 or more employees at a given worksite. This ATM provides traditional ATM-type services such as balance inquiry, withdrawals, account-to-account transfers, immediate cash, bill payment and so on. However, in addition, via payroll interface it uniquely allows employees to take controlled cash advances against their accrued paychecks. The fees for these cash advances are three to four times less than those charged by AFSPs.</p>
<p>The following describes how the process generally works:</p>
<list id="list1-0886368712440490" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Innovator advances the employer requisite funds to allow employees to gain access to this benefit</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Employees opt in and become registered users with their own profile</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Employee hours earned are sent daily to innovator</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Innovator calculates the current unpaid wages earned</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The employee is given access to up to 50% (or other specified percentage) of earned net wages</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Employer reimburses innovator through the payroll deductions file</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Employees can take as little as $20 to enable them to meet daily expenses</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>In addition, this worksite portal allows employees to transfer funds to families and relatives in foreign countries without the hassle and high cost associated with alternative methods.</p>
<p>The ATM can also serve as the HR portal worksite access point or as an access point for any other employment (or potentially general business) related online needs, for example, training, performance planning and so on, via linkages to the employer’s existing systems.</p>

<title>Return on Innovation (ROI)</title>
<p>The ROI will be specific to each employer based on facts and circumstances but it can be measured in terms of the following:</p>
<list id="list2-0886368712440490" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Provides employees with increased control of finances</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Increases employee financial wellness, thereby reducing employee stress and reducing time consuming requests to HR department related to wage garnishments, payday advance requests, 401(k) plan loans and so on</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Increases employer ability to move away from paper to online workforce processes</p></list-item></list>
