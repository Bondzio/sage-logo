<title>Introduction</title>
<p>As a university teacher I struggle to find ways to help my students learn to ‘be critical’. It’s one of those skills – like riding a bicycle – that you have to <italic>feel</italic> your way into grasping but once you’ve got it, you never lose it. So it’s a very challenging skill to teach and I very much looked forward to reading bell hooks’ advice. But this book wasn’t what I was expecting at all. I was expecting a manual full of sassy tools to use in my teaching – clever exercises to turn my students’ worlds on their heads and make them think the previously unthinkable, but instead I had my world turned on its head and thought the previously unthinkable about <italic>my own</italic> practice. What you will find in this book is bell hooks’ manifesto for a passionate, engaged pedagogy that takes place face-to-face, between students and teacher, in the classroom. Bell Hooks is writing from her perspective as a black, female, American teacher of ‘English’ literature, and although readers may not be from the same background, her arguments throughout the book are relevant to anyone, especially those from traditionally marginalized groups within academia and/or who teach ‘critical management studies’ as I do. Her definition ‘thinking in action’ (p. 7) is what frames her arguments in this collection of short, beautifully written essays and in this review, I discuss the key themes that, for me, draw them together. I read the book in a random fashion, dipping into two or three chapters whenever I had ten minutes to spare – so the logic of my review doesn’t exactly map onto the structure of the book, nor do I discuss all the chapters – but I found reading in this non-linear way helped me see interesting connections between bell hooks’ ideas in a way I hope you also find interesting and useful.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1350507612445415">
<title>Engaged pedagogy: Who are you?</title>
<p>Just by being in the classroom we start our students thinking critically: ‘our students are looking at us and wondering what our bodies have to say about who we are and how we live in the world’ (p. 153). Who we are and the way we behave in speech and deed has profound effects, and in my desire for ‘pedagogical tools’, I had forgotten about the most fundamental apparatus of all – myself. This basic recognition of the teacher-as-body flies in the face of much contemporary hype around ‘e’ and distance learning as the solution to mass, global education in a technologically advanced age – however, the ideas in <italic>Teaching Critical Thinking</italic> implicitly ring a warning against such developments, at least if we care about teaching critically and accept the importance of bell hooks’ treatise here. Of course, the teacher’s body is also brought into proximity with the students’ bodies in class and the various ways in which they interact forms the basis for much of the book as I examine below. But to begin, the idea of ‘engaged pedagogy’ (Chapter 3) is borne of interaction in the classroom and underpins the rest of the book. Her advice in Chapter 3 is about building a community in class before any learning – critical or otherwise – can begin. Intuitively we know this to be important, but in the 50-minute seminar format, with a large and diverse group of students who often do not know each other I wonder how many of us take the trouble to do this. This idea was the most significant in the book for me – one tactic described is to ask students to write spontaneously for a few minutes in the first class of a course, and then share their reading with everyone present. I have not been brave enough to try this with undergraduates (yet) but it worked very well with my Masters class on research methods whom I asked to write freely on ‘why I want to study’. It certainly generated the sense of ‘wholeness’ that bell hooks advocates is necessary to really engage students and I felt humbled by the pride, anxieties and honesty that my students shared.</p>
<p>In Chapter 5, we are shown that ‘Engaged pedagogy’ stems first and foremost from a sense of the teacher’s integrity – defined as ‘congruence or agreement between what we think, say and do’ (p. 32). Noting that education is the tool of mass conformism, and curricula thus have in-built biases that support dominant ideologies, Chapters 2 ‘Decolonization’ and 4 ‘Democratic education’ urge us to keep this at the forefront of our minds when designing programmes and classroom experiences that are inclusive. In particular, bell hooks asks us to respond constructively to these biases with a clear sense of purpose. ‘Purpose’ is the topic of Chapter 6 and her brief discussions here raised issues that I think are particularly pertinent to the current management education context.</p>
<p>As a feminist, critical management scholar from a working-class background, I teach from the perspective that management has very real effects on those who are managed. Yet my students – especially MBAs paying high fees – are expecting to learn <italic>how to</italic> manage. On the face of it, these may not seem contradictory agendas but when students begin to understand that managing to minimize negative effects on others may be harder, more complex, and not necessarily in the business’s short-term profit-motivated interest, conflict arises. Is it ethical of me to refuse to deliver what they are paying for? In the UK, the division between <italic>our</italic> purpose and the students’ purposes is likely to diverge further with the introduction of higher tuition fees in 2012 – and as bell hooks notes, from the American experience where high fees are the norm, we can expect students to further regard education as a commodity, with ‘teachers as low-level workers in the “factory” of knowledge”’ (p. 112). Teaching with integrity, for me, has meant really having to examine my foundations and take the trouble to <italic>persuade</italic> my students that what they are learning really is worth it, that ‘theory’ is not a waste of their time and ‘diversity’ is not just for girls and blacks, to state a few common perceptions. The highest accolade I have received in this regard was from an MBA student who had been especially conflictual during my course on Strategic Change Management, challenging much of what I said in class. On leaving our last meeting I was astonished when he thanked me saying, ‘I came here thinking I knew it all, and now I don’t think I know anything – this has been the most useful course on my degree’. To begin with, his adversarial nature had shaken me and my enjoyment of teaching the class. I worried that he would expose my assertions as unfounded and that the class would revolt – painful issues written about by bell hooks in Chapter 15 ‘Conflict’ where she reminds us that in many places in the world people risk imprisonment or death for speaking freely – even in the classroom. She stresses we should avoid notions of ‘false safety’ (p.88) in the classroom if we really want to encourage critique, concluding: ‘It is often professors and not students who want to maintain the “safe” classroom because it is simply easier to demand that students cultivate an atmosphere of seamless harmony in the classroom and harder to teach them how to engage in meaningful critical dialogue’ (p. 88).</p>

<title>Lecturing vs. the curse of the silent classroom</title>
<p>To many of us faced with a room full of mute, blank faces, the idea of dealing with conflict might be a ‘nice-to-have’, since stimulating talk from students often seems to be a mammoth task. The common response to a room full of silence is to lecture just to fill the void, even in a small group setting. In Chapter 12, bell hooks makes some poignant observations about whether ‘To lecture or not’, seeing lectures as the appetizer before the main meal of learning that will take place elsewhere. She counters this with the familiar refrain that many teachers lecture with a desire to show off all they know, or make dull but minutely thorough presentations out of debilitating anxiety that they are not fully equipped for the job. But she also points out that spectacular, entertaining lectures are also not usually the best vehicles for learning either, even though they are often rapturously exciting for the audience. I learned this the hard way during a ‘teaching as performance’ session run by professional actors on the International Teachers’ Programme I attended recently – despite my hubris around being an effervescent, engaging and vibrant lecturer, I was almost reduced to tears by the (kind) criticism of my peers and the facilitator that I was too exhausting to watch for very long!</p>
<p>We do not usually expect interaction from our students during lectures – even the physical space in the traditional lecture hall militates against this, with tiered rows of forward-facing seats. But we do hope our students will be <italic>engaged</italic> and bell hooks reminds us not to lecture to ‘you guys’, or ‘folks’, or ‘you lot’ – but to speak to one student at a time when addressing the group, a lesson I also learned from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1350507612445415">Aswath Damodrodan (2008)</xref> in his treatise on the ‘magic of the classroom’. One especially nice touch she shares is how she thanks especially attentive students individually after her lecture, because: ‘their rapt listening heightens my engagement in what I am saying … Their “silent” gift renews my spirit, especially if I am tired or not feeling well’ (p. 64).</p>
<p>But what can we do with a seminar room full of students who are unwilling to speak out in class? In Chapter 20 ‘Teachers against teaching’, bell hooks explains how she always asks students what they have contributed to the classroom dynamic when they complain to her of boring classes, reminding us that a ‘boring’ class is a dynamic between teacher and students. So insisting that students <italic>need</italic> to come to class ready to participate is the first step. The second step, for me, is the physical layout of the room – people cannot talk easily to each other if they are sitting side by side in straight lines! Establishing a sense of community as noted above is probably the next stage and in Chapters 8, 9 and 10 ‘Conversation’, ‘Telling stories’ and ‘Sharing stories’, bell hooks emphasizes the importance of dialogue in learning to help grow this. In telling our own stories, we help students to engage vicariously with our experiences. This is important for those who are yet to have direct experience of the topics they are studying, or as bell hooks put it: ‘Stories help us to connect to a world beyond the self’ (p. 53). Imagination (Chapter 11) is crucial to experiencing others’ stories and therefore to critical thinking, and she reminds us that: ‘the killing off of the imagination serves as a way to repress and contain everyone within the limits of the status quo’ (p. 60). There is no-one who brought about radical change, who did not dream of it first.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if we invite students to share <italic>their</italic> stories, bell hooks argues that they will listen intently and with respect for one another. This sharing starts a learning conversation which as she notes is ‘awesomely democratic’ (p. 44) because we all do it and this is how we pick up a lot of our knowledge in daily life. A conversation will jump like a spark ignited by what each of the participants finds of importance in the others’ exchanges and although we may be wary of letting discussion digress from our prepared topics lest we fail to cover the necessary material, this might be more a matter of our need to be in control, because: ‘mindful conversation – talking that is powerful and energetic – always spotlights what <italic>really</italic> matters’ (p. 45 original emphasis). For me, a good teacher works with the flow of the conversation, steering it imperceptibly and stimulating debate on the students’ own terms. A former student once referred to me as a ‘mental gymnast’ for my ability to do this, a label I was both delighted with and am still proud of.</p>

<title>Laughing, crying, loving and sex</title>
<p>Many chapters in <italic>Teaching Critical Thinking</italic> deal with emotion. Chapter 13 calls for more humour in the classroom, which bell hooks sees as a positive democratizing force, opening up the teacher’s humanity to the students. This is undoubtedly true, but as I have argued elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1350507612445415">Warren, 2005</xref>), we also need to take care not to cause offence, especially in classrooms with much cultural diversity, as is the case in my own institution. As someone who is known for her humorous response to most things, it came as a great shock to me to find out that a throw-away, meant-to-be-funny comment I made had angered and upset a first year doctoral student. We were discussing how epistemological assumptions shape our choice of research methods in a small class of about twelve and he volunteered a technically proficient, lengthy – and actually very impressive – answer. In seeing the panic on the other students’ faces because they had not understood the class material that clearly, I jokily replied: ‘Blimey! That’s a bit of a mouthful for a Friday afternoon!’ to try to put them all at ease. However, unbeknown to me, my ‘funny’ comment had shamed the bright student who left the class quietly fuming. Thankfully I was able to put the situation right after a colleague told me the student had come to him to vent his anger He had spent hours reading and trying to get to grips with a complex subject prior to class and I dismissed this. We met for a coffee and discussed what happened and have since built a good relationship, although bell hooks states that ‘shaming is one of the most common strategies used by educators in classrooms where prejudices prevail. (p. 183). The student in my example is from the Caribbean and these words have caused me to think searchingly about myself.</p>
<p>The other parts of the book that explicitly deal with emotions (Chapters 14, 25, 26, 27 and 30) do so from a more controversial base. They are quite varied, for example Chapter 25, ‘Spirituality’ is a short reminder of how the ‘spirit’ as emotional effervescence and authenticity is something quite different from ‘religion’ whereas Chapter 14 ‘Crying time’ addresses how to respond to students who experience overwhelming emotions in class. Whilst we think that the subjects we teach in management may not provoke such responses, I read this chapter as indicative of every ‘dangerous’ emotion that might arise in class. I have witnessed strong emotional responses in students when running case studies as debates, using role plays and even just facilitating heated class discussion on gender, or globalization, for example. I once had to call a debate off in a class of undergraduates, because they were getting so angry with each other!</p>
<p>Chapter 14 also talks about our own emotions as teachers in class. Like bell hooks, ‘I never want to cry in front of my students’ (p. 79), but while I was reading this book, I was running a class with MBA students and putting into practice some of the ‘sharing work’ the book recommends. The class was on discourses of ‘wellbeing’ at work, and I’d asked the students to bring in and discuss photographs of what made them ‘stressed’. I also brought pictures myself and when talking about how hard it was for me to be living away from my two almost grown-up sons, I thought I’d managed to hide how incredibly emotional I felt, sticking to the ‘facts’ of how stressful it was to fit phone-calls and visits into my busy schedule since I had moved to take up my position as Professor at the School. I later received a very touching email from one of the students I’d previously found very arrogant and ‘cold’ – he had seen straight through me and wrote about how he completely connected with my story, being away from home himself.</p>
<p>bell hooks explains how showing emotion is still seen as a sign of weakness, partly on account of our hierarchical conception of ‘mind over matter’, but is also part of ‘dominator culture’ since emotion is seen as peculiarly female, and therefore weak: ‘One measure of our inferior status in the sexist mindset is the assumption that at times all females will be emotionally overwhelmed, that we will “come undone”’ (p. 79). I wonder when it will be OK for us all, especially men, to ‘come undone’ and I relish the day when emotion is not seen as the enemy of reason.</p>
<p>Chapter 27 ‘To love again’ continues this theme, calling for a more loving attitude in teaching: ‘love’s place in the classroom is assured when there is any passionate pursuit of knowledge’. She also reminds us that when we respond to a student’s emotional needs in class, or in any pastoral encounter, we are responding with love. Chapter 26 ‘Touch’ and Chapter 27 ‘Talking sex’, go further into the choppy waters of the erotic and its place in the classroom, and I certainly felt both fascinated and uncomfortable while reading them. Following Audre Lorde, bell hooks places ‘erotic energy … as an essential act of resistance, a way to stand against dehumanization and domination’ (p. 178). She talks about how ‘sex’ is such a taboo subject in every sphere of life, and yet ever present and in this regard she quotes from a text by Frank Browning:
<disp-quote>
<p>By erotic, I mean all the powerful attractions we might have: for mentoring and being mentored, for unrealizable flirtation, for intellectual tripping, for sweaty mateship at work, for spiritual ecstasy, for being held in silent grief, for explosive mutual rage at a common enemy, for the sublime love of friendship….(Browning, cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1350507612445415">bell hooks, 2010</xref>: 179–180)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Yet to talk of the ‘erotic space’ in the classroom is still highly charged, as evidenced by recent furore around the publication of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1350507612445415">Catherine Hakim’s (2010)</xref> article ‘Erotic capital’ in the <italic>European Sociological Review</italic> and its adaptation as ‘advice for academics’ in an article in the <italic>Times Higher Education Supplement</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1350507612445415">1</xref></sup> Although I find Hakim’s ideas regrettable in many ways, they do at least dare to suggest that the erotic is <italic>inescapably</italic> part of everything – but this is an argument much more skillfully developed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1350507612445415">Joanna Brewis and Stephen Linstead’s (2000)</xref> book <italic>Sex, Work and Sex-work</italic>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1350507612445415">
<title>Critical thinking: Teaching</title>
<p>bell hooks calls teaching a ‘prophetic vocation’ (Chapter 31) and as she shows in her book, <italic>we</italic> are the instruments for teaching critical thinking, yet we often lack training in the art of teaching, and do even less for each other in the sharing of the experiences that help us to cope with the demands of the job and/ or learn from each other. Few of us talk about teaching – in the ways that we do for our research – and we rarely invite each other into our classrooms, save for the annual ‘peer review audit’ which many treat as a bureaucratic exercise rather than a genuine opportunity to watch, share and learn.</p>
<p>Ironically, clever people often have low self-esteem, and in Chapter 21 bell hooks reminds us that we need to work on our own esteem issues to avoid inadvertently treading on the self-esteem of others. Superiority, control, the dismissal of students’ needs – however unconscious – is ‘poisonous pedagogy’ (p. 124) and although we need to take care of the esteem of all our students, this may be especially important to be mindful of when teaching bright, young, women. In Chapter 28 ‘Feminist change’ we return to her ideas of love, in an extract which resonates very strongly with me:
<disp-quote>
<p>many of our female students who might be quite brilliant find themselves full of self-doubt and fear. They may be fretting over whether or not they will be seen as cool if they exercise their intelligence, or they may be wrestling with the age-old fear that being smart means they will be alone. To teach them, both by our theory and practice, women professors who are advocates of feminism must have the courage to let our lights shine, to let our capacity to love self and others be revealed for the power it brings. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1350507612445415">bell hooks, 2010</xref>: 166–167)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>It is easy to forget the power that we hold, just being a ‘teacher’ – especially so among Asian students who grow up learning that teachers are supreme authorities. Many of these students have just arrived in the UK when we first meet them, having had no chance to acclimatize, and for them to accept the informality of a British classroom – let alone address the teacher by their first name – is as abhorrent to them as it would be ask a Brit to jump the counter queue in the post office. This is in stark contrast to the American situation of disrespect that bell hooks describes in Chapter 19 ‘Honoring teachers’, but we would do well to remember that no matter how friendly and egalitarian we hope our classes are: ‘We are not all equals in the classroom. Teachers have more power than students’ (p. 114). We set the exams, grade the assignments and have huge power to bring into bloom students’ ideas, or equally to crush them.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Perceptions of ‘teaching as a necessary evil’ in research-intensive universities is a simmering undercurrent that saps our energy for our students. <italic>Teaching Critical Thinking</italic> is a wonderful antidote to anyone who has drifted into this mindset through the pressure of ‘publish or perish’ cultures, managing research projects, or just the lethargy that familiarity with the job and time served combine to produce in the best of us. It’s all too easy to blame lazy, weak students who don’t think, don’t read enough, never prepare and often don’t even attend classes, but nonetheless, every one of us enters the lives of hundreds of young and not-so-young people every year – and this is a grand responsibility. For those whose lives we touch it is even more profound, for: ‘a life of the mind is one of those journeys in life that once begun affords so much freedom to roam and explore that there really is no turning back’ (p. 139).</p>
<p>This book was a joy to read and helped me reconnect to my classroom practice. It reminded me of how important my classroom is for learning – even though I am currently excited about the possibilities that e-learning and social media offer for helping students learn. It also made me think about my earlier desire for ‘something else’ to help me teach critical thinking, and reflect on whether this need for tools and techniques is a defence against bringing our whole selves to class, and at the very least, a strategy that downplays the skills of the person facilitating the exercises – a projection of the responsibility for just <italic>being</italic> a good teacher onto structure and process perhaps? <italic>Teaching Critical Thinking</italic> could quite easily just be called <italic>Teaching</italic> – bell hooks has reminded me that <italic>all</italic> teaching should be about encouraging critical thinking, and perhaps we would do well to stop partitioning off ‘critical thinking’ from ‘other thinking’ whatever that may be.</p>
