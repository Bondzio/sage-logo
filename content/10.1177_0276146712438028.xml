<p>This <italic>Journal of Macromarketing</italic> special issue on Vietnam was edited by Clifford J. Shultz II of Loyola University Chicago. Cliff has made Vietnam a research priority and, over a twenty-year period, has visited the country over fifty times. The refereed articles include studies of entrepreneurship, retailing, education and household income, product purchasing, weddings and sex roles, quality of life, and environmental sustainability. The commentaries are equally diverse and explore the battles between Vietnamese and American catfish farmers, land reform, threats to the Mekong Delta ecosystem, and political and trade relations. The Journal owes Cliff a profound debt of gratitude for putting together such an excellent assemblage of macromarketing thought. Given that he was editor of this Journal from 2004 through 2009, his devotion to macromarketing, not to mention his editorial stamina, is unmatched in the field.</p>
