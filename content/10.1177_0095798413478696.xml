<abstract>
<p>Informal support networks as opposed to formal mental health counseling may represent a culture-specific, indigenous style of coping for Black college students. Using the African American Student Network (or as students refer to it AFAM), this article comments on the potential of an informal networking group as a culturally sensitive therapeutic intervention. Along with a description of the group process is a discussion of traditional therapeutic factors associated with group work in students’ lived experience of AFAM. The major contention is that even in an informal networking setting, the group process associated with counseling or therapy may occur and generate therapeutic factors. To more fully explore this idea, future development and study of informal networking groups for Black students on predominantly White campuses is recommended. This line of inquiry may have important implications for the development of culturally sensitive mental health practices that better support the psychological health and well-being of Black college students.</p>

<p>Black students face a number of stressors on predominantly White campuses. These students experience more racial conflict, more pressure to conform to stereotypes, and less equitable treatment by faculty, staff, and teaching assistants than their White counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0095798413478696">Ancis, Sedlacek, &amp; Mohr, 2000</xref>). In particular, Black students experience stress related to acceptance or fitting in, cultural conflict, help-seeking, coping, lack of resources, mistrust of the institution, racism, social support, and stigma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0095798413478696">Watkins, Green, Goodson, Guidry, &amp; Stanley, 2007</xref>). On predominantly White campuses, Black students often find themselves in hostile and unfair environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0095798413478696">Davis et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0095798413478696">Jones, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0095798413478696">Solorzano, Ceja, &amp; Yosso, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0095798413478696">Swim, Hyers, Cohen, Fitzgerald, &amp; Bylsma, 2003</xref>). Along with family and financial problems, these students report stressors related to institutional racism, poor health and energy, and social isolation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0095798413478696">Arnold, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0095798413478696">D’Augelli &amp; Hershberger, 1993</xref>).</p>
<p>Though Black college students face a number of psychosocial stressors, these students tend not to seek mental health counseling for assistance with their problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0095798413478696">Chiang, Hunter, &amp; Yeh, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0095798413478696">Constantine, Chen, &amp; Ceesay, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0095798413478696">Constantine, Wilton, &amp; Caldwell, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0095798413478696">Nickerson, Helms, &amp; Terrell, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0095798413478696">Utsey, Adams, &amp; Boldern, 2000</xref>). Rather, Black students tend to rely on informal networks for coping with distress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0095798413478696">Chiang et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0095798413478696">Constantine et al., 2003</xref>). One potential drawback to this coping style is that Black students’ social networks tend to consist of other Black students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0095798413478696">D’Augelli &amp; Hershberger, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0095798413478696">Pike &amp; Kuh, 2006</xref>), but Blacks are still underrepresented in higher education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0095798413478696">Thompson, Gorin, Obeidat, &amp; Chen, 2006</xref>). Therefore, building social networks on predominantly White campuses where there is no critical mass can be difficult. Furthermore, as a group Black students tend to lack tacit knowledge about college life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0095798413478696">Arnold, 1993</xref>). Consequently, the result of relying primarily on other Black students for support and guidance may lead to the problem that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0095798413478696">Moore (2001)</xref> points out: The perpetuation of uninformed, maladaptive strategies for traversing university settings, where Black students experience greater difficulty and stress navigating college terrain than their White counterparts.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0095798413478696">Constantine et al. (2003)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0095798413478696">Chiang et al. (2004)</xref> suggest that relying on informal networks to cope with distress as opposed to formal mental health counseling may be a culture-specific, indigenous style of coping for Black students. Therefore, finding intentional ways to be inclusive of and responsive to this style of coping is important, particularly on predominantly White campuses where Black students experience a great deal of psychosocial stress related to racism, fitting in, cultural conflict, and lack of social support or stigma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0095798413478696">Watkins et al., 2007</xref>). Although numerous studies have been reported in the literature on the challenges Black college students face on predominantly White campuses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0095798413478696">Ancis et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0095798413478696">Cabrera, Nora, Terenzini, Pascarella, &amp; Serra Hagedorn, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0095798413478696">Davis et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0095798413478696">Nora &amp; Cabrera, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0095798413478696">Phelps, Taylor, &amp; Gerard, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0095798413478696">Rankin &amp; Reason, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0095798413478696">Schwitzer, Griffin, Ancis, &amp; Thomas, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0095798413478696">Solorzano et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0095798413478696">Swim et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0095798413478696">Watkins et al., 2007</xref>), few have focused on the role of informal networking groups in mitigating psychological distress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0095798413478696">Constantine et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0095798413478696">Chiang et al., 2004</xref>), and none have focused on the development of informal networking groups as culturally sensitive counseling interventions for this group of students. Yet the development and study of informal support networks as therapeutic interventions seems to be one culturally sensitive way college counseling centers can reach out to Black students.</p>
<p>The idea of a within-group sanctuary or support network as a tool of healing and well-being for African Americans is not new (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0095798413478696">Jones, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0095798413478696">Watt-Jones, 2002</xref>), and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0095798413478696">Utsey, Ponterotto, Reynolds, and Cancelli (2000)</xref> link social support with the best potential outcomes for Blacks experiencing race-related stress. Although informal support networks are different from formal counseling groups, these networks can still be embraced by college counseling centers and mental health professionals. Multiculturally competent counselors take into account indigenous healing practices and coping mechanisms, and in multicultural counselor training collaboration is often emphasized with the understanding that exercising multicultural competence may require working in conjunction with members of diverse communities and/or organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0095798413478696">Sue &amp; Sue, 2003</xref>). Given that relying on informal networks may be an indigenous coping strategy, the development and study of these networks as therapeutic interventions on predominantly White campuses is one line of inquiry that can help universities and college counseling centers better support the psychological health and well-being of Black college students. Moreover, collaborating with Black faculty, staff, and students to more fully explore, understand, and harness the therapeutic value of informal networks can serve to further the cultural sensitivity and competence of mental health and college counseling center staff.</p>
<p>Based on previous studies and my own immersion in an informal network called the African American Student Network (or as students refer to it AFAM), I argue that the intentional development and maintenance of such groups can be a culturally sensitive way to facilitate psychological well-being. For example, the development of informal networks such as AFAM is responsive to Black students’ tendency to build dense social networks and can facilitate the ability to make connections with other Black students on a predominantly White campus. In addition, a network in which Black faculty, staff, and graduate students come together to guide and support Black undergraduates in problem solving and making sense of their college experience can help alleviate the perpetuation of maladaptive strategies that inhibit successful navigation of the college terrain. Furthermore, as research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0095798413478696">DeFour and Hirsch (1990)</xref> indicates, frequent contact with Black faculty and other Black students can be linked to higher levels of social integration and social support, where students who are more integrated tend to be better adjusted, earn higher grades, and perceive themselves as progressing well in their coursework. Moreover, informal support networks have been found to be a significant moderating variable in Black and Latino students’ level of psychological distress where for Blacks informal networks appear to be an effective buffer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0095798413478696">Constantine et al., 2003</xref>). Watching the group process unfold through AFAM (an informal networking as opposed to college counseling setting) for over six semesters has motivated me to explore and comment on the potential therapeutic value of this group as a culturally sensitive intervention for Black college students. Given the stigma of mental health counseling in the African American community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0095798413478696">Wallace &amp; Constantine, 2005</xref>) and the tendency for Black students to underutilize college counseling services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0095798413478696">Duncan &amp; Johnson, 2007</xref>), such commentary is potentially valuable and fruitful.</p>

<title>Overview of the African American Student Network</title>
<p>The AFAM is a social networking group developed for Black undergraduates at a large, urban, research university in the Midwest. The purpose of AFAM is to provide a safe space for Black students to (a) explore and make meaning of their experience on campus, (b) find support and encouragement for coping with personal and academic stressors, and (c) make meaningful connections with other Black students, faculty, and staff. The networking group meets weekly over the lunch hour, and through small grants from various offices on campus such as the Office for Equity and Diversity and the Office for Student Affairs food is provided at each meeting. Attendance at AFAM meetings can include up to 30 participants, and meetings are always open to new members. To facilitate community, weekly meetings begin with introductions in which group participants state their name and share a “high” moment or positive experience and a “low” moment or negative experience from the past week. Discussion topics emerge from students’ sharing, and topics range from personal struggles to academic concerns to sociopolitical issues. AFAM meetings are facilitated by me with the assistance of a Black graduate student.</p>
<p>With a focus on supporting the health and well-being of Black college students, an intentional psychosocial space is created in AFAM using relational education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0095798413478696">Raider-Roth, 2005</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0095798413478696">Yalom’s (1995)</xref> theory of group work. To better understand how Black undergraduates experience AFAM, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0095798413478696">Grier-Reed, Madyun, and Buckley (2008)</xref> conducted a phenomenological-like study to explore the lived experience of the group, that is, a study focused on the experience of AFAM through the eyes of its student participants. The research uncovered seven themes in students’ lived experience of AFAM: safety, connectedness, validation, empowerment, intellectual stimulation, resilience, and a home base on campus.</p>
<p>In the current article, I comment on the group process in AFAM and examine the presence of traditional therapeutic factors in students’ lived experience of the group. The seven themes uncovered in the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0095798413478696">Grier-Reed et al. (2008)</xref> study are used to represent students’ lived experience of AFAM. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0095798413478696">Yalom’s (1995)</xref> 11 curative or therapeutic factors are used to define the therapeutic factors traditionally associated with group work, and the five stages associated with small group development—forming, storming, norming, performing, and adjourning—are included to explore the group process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0095798413478696">Tuckman, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0095798413478696">Tuckman &amp; Jensen, 1977</xref>).</p>

<title>Description of the Group Process in AFAM</title>
<p>Even though AFAM is not a counseling or therapy group, I have observed the forming, norming, performing, and adjourning stages unfold in the group process much as I have witnessed these stages unfold in groups conducted in college counseling settings. This development is surprising because, unlike traditional counseling and therapy groups, AFAM is not a closed 5 to 8 member group in which participants are prescreened and preselected. Rather, AFAM is an open social networking group with up to 30 participants at most meetings and a constant influx of new faces. Moreover, there is no screening process for the AFAM network and no commitment solicited from members regarding attendance and participation. AFAM students are free to come and go as they please, and many arrive late to and/or leave early from the weekly meetings as their course or work schedules demand. Finally, whereas typical college counseling groups occur weekly and may meet for 90 minutes each time, AFAM meets weekly over the lunch hour for only about 60 minutes each time. Yet even under these circumstances, four distinct stages of the group process have consistently emerged.</p>
<p>The forming stage seems to reoccur in AFAM at the beginning of each semester. Though there is always a mix of new and returning students, the first few meetings of the semester are characterized by uncertainty and a dependence on the group facilitator for direction. Following the relatively structured check-in process in which students introduce themselves and share a high and low moment from the week, during the forming stage there is usually an uncertain hesitancy in the group that is often accompanied by silence and waiting as students look to the facilitator to provide more structure. During these weeks becoming oriented to the nature and purpose of the group and how they will use the group are the primary milestones for students.</p>
<p>Following the forming stage is the norming stage. In the norming stage, students develop a clear sense of how to relate to others in a group and how they will use the group for themselves. In other words, students become socialized to the norms or implicit rules of engagement in the AFAM network. Over the course of the semester, students also help socialize new members. Consistent with my experience facilitating groups in college counseling settings, in AFAM there is no significant degree of storming or conflict and turbulence in which students rebel against the facilitator and engage in rivalry with other members.</p>
<p>The forming and norming stages typically last anywhere from 3 to 6 weeks; then students begin to move into the performing stage. This stage is characterized by a marked increase in comfort and cohesion among group members and less reliance on the group facilitator for structure and direction. During this stage, students come in with issues, ideas, and struggles to explore in group, and rather than waiting for the facilitator to open the floor for discussion after the check-in students may do so by posing the proverbial “What’s on your minds or what are we talking about today?” question. Moreover, in the performing stage students may take the initiative to start the check-in process and may come in ready to engage with topics, issues, or situations to share and get feedback on. The hesitance and uncertainty of the first few weeks is greatly diminished. Instead, there is a sense of comfort and cohesion as students actively engage with one another across serious and humorous matters.</p>
<p>The adjourning stage occurs toward the end of each semester as students begin to count down and take note of the number of AFAM meetings left in the term. It is during this time that students begin to express remorse about the semester and the group ending, share what AFAM has meant to them, and point out how they will miss members of the group. The adjourning or termination stage of AFAM is particularly poignant during spring semester when the academic year ends and students make plans to leave the university due to graduation, study abroad, and/or summer hiatus.</p>

<title>Description of Therapeutic Factors Traditionally Associated With Group Work</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0095798413478696">Irving Yalom (1995)</xref>, a renowned figure in group counseling theory, has linked the group process discussed above with the presence of 11 therapeutic factors associated with group work: Catharsis, Cohesion, Interpersonal learning, Development of new socializing techniques, Imitative behavior, Imparting of information, Altruism, Corrective recapitulation of the primary family group, Instillation of hope, Universality, and Existential factors. According to Yalom, cohesion is one of the most important therapeutic factors in groups, where acceptance is the key variable. Catharsis and interpersonal learning are also key therapeutic factors in groups as they facilitate intimacy and interpersonal relations. These three factors—cohesion, catharsis, and interpersonal learning—focus on interpersonal relationships and attend to the basic human need for acceptance and social interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0095798413478696">Yalom, 1995</xref>). Cohesion can be described as the bonds of caring and connectedness that develop between members in groups. Catharsis can be described as emotional release, and interpersonal learning can be described as members learning from each other within the social microcosm of the group.</p>
<p>Closely related to the key factor of interpersonal learning is the development of new socializing techniques. Social learning whether direct or indirect is inherent to group work. Social learning can include acquiring skill in being helpful and responsive to others, resolving conflict, and developing empathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0095798413478696">Yalom, 1995</xref>). Through social learning in groups, members are able to develop new socializing techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0095798413478696">Yalom, 1995</xref>). Vicarious learning or imitative behavior is also a mechanism of learning in groups and is particularly relevant for junior members who may learn by observing or imitating more senior members in group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0095798413478696">Yalom, 1995</xref>). Moreover, the imparting of information is a mechanism for learning and growth in groups and can take various forms including didactic instruction and giving advice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0095798413478696">Yalom, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>With respect to altruism, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0095798413478696">Yalom (1995)</xref> asserts that this factor is not only inherent to group work but also inherent to the process of healing and therapeutic in and of itself. Group members are altruistic or helpful to each other by giving reassurance, support, and insight and by sharing their problems with each other. With regard to the corrective recapitulation of the primary family group as a therapeutic factor, Yalom concedes that most groups are like families, particularly in terms of deep personal sharing, intimacy, and strong emotions. Corrective recapitulation of the primary family group provides positive experiences in which group members can understand and work through negative and/or dysfunctional familial dynamics. As members work through their problems in group, the instillation of hope emerges. According to Yalom, the instillation of hope as a therapeutic factor is built on a sense of optimism stemming from the belief that one’s participation in the group will lead to positive outcomes. The instillation of hope also seems closely connected to universality.</p>
<p>Universality as a therapeutic factor is based on the profound recognition that one is not alone. Knowing that one is not alone facilitates a sense of hope and relief in therapy groups. Furthermore, an understanding that one is not alone struggling in isolation is the antidote to deep interpersonal alienation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0095798413478696">Yalom, 1995</xref>). The final therapeutic factor is based in existential concerns. Existential factors focus on the problems of existence, and according to Yalom, the ultimate concerns of existence are related to isolation, freedom, and the search for meaning.</p>

<title>Description of the Therapeutic Factors in Students’ Experience of AFAM</title>
<p>In describing how AFAM meetings unfold, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0095798413478696">Grier-Reed et al. (2008)</xref> provide limited examples of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0095798413478696">Yalom’s (1995)</xref> therapeutic factors.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Consider the example of students discussing the issue of Black students not making eye contact and acknowledging each other [on campus]. After some discussion, AFAM students decided to rewrite this norm and try out something new. They suggested to each other “When you see me or I see you, we will make eye contact and say hi.” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0095798413478696">Grier-Reed et al., 2008</xref> p. 479)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In this example, students in the AFAM network engaged in interpersonal learning and the development of new socializing techniques by (a) sharing how they felt when unacknowledged by other Black students and (b) identifying a new way of being or socializing with each other on campus. Yalom’s therapeutic factors are also apparent in students’ lived experience of the network. As aforementioned, safety, connectedness, validation, resilience, intellectual stimulation, empowerment, and a home base on campus are the seven themes outlined in students’ lived experience of AFAM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0095798413478696">Grier-Reed et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The therapeutic factors of catharsis and universality can be found in the first theme—safety. In illustrating the theme of safety, the ability to share freely without fear of being judged, misunderstood, or stigmatized characterized the psychosocial space in the group. One student described it as a type of oxygen that allowed them to breathe and relax. Safety has been identified as a prerequisite for catharsis. This also seemed evident in students’ lived experience of AFAM, where experiences centered on students being able to let go, spill their guts, and express themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0095798413478696">Grier-Reed et al., 2008</xref>). The cathartic process in which students could let go and share freely and listen to others let go and share freely was rooted in the safe space and seemed to generate a sense of universality or the feeling that one is not alone. One student succinctly underscored this idea in the following quote: “It really helps you get through the week to express yourself and hearing people like you express themselves” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0095798413478696">Grier-Reed et al., 2008</xref>, p. 480).</p>
<p>The therapeutic factor of universality is perhaps most evident in the second theme of students’ lived experience of AFAM—connectedness. An awareness of common ground or common experience was one major component of this theme. In other words, the awareness of a shared experience with others seemed to illuminate a sense of connectedness along with an awareness that one is not alone struggling in isolation. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0095798413478696">Yalom (1995)</xref>, this awareness can be defined as universality. Also central to the theme of connectedness was a sense of community. It seems that in the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0095798413478696">Grier-Reed et al. (2008)</xref> study, students experienced AFAM as a space in which they could get to know and align themselves with others in order to develop a sense of community on campus. These communal bonds seemed to reflect the therapeutic factor cohesion, where through the sharing of struggles students bonded and connected with others in the network.</p>
<p>The third theme in students’ lived experience of AFAM was validation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0095798413478696">Grier-Reed et al., 2008</xref>), and existential factors seemed evident in this theme. As previously discussed, existential factors center on the problems of existence. For Black college students who are still underrepresented in higher education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0095798413478696">Thompson et al., 2006</xref>), one major problem of existence on a predominantly White campus is invisibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0095798413478696">Davis et al., 2004</xref>). The presence of AFAM on campus was validating for Black students in that it seemed to affirm their existence on campus. One student summarized it as such:
<disp-quote>
<p>It [AFAM] means that Black people exist on this campus. When groups like this are developed for Black kids on this campus, it’s signifying that yes I see you on this campus, and yes I see that something needs to be done. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0095798413478696">Grier-Reed et al., 2008</xref>, p. 481)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Furthermore, the experience of validation in AFAM seemed to be made up of corrective experiences. Though <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0095798413478696">Yalom (1995)</xref> identifies the corrective recapitulation of the primary family group as a therapeutic factor, corrective emotional experiences are an important component. Validation in AFAM seemed most reflective of the component part, where students felt heard, seen, valued, and respected rather than devalued, stereotyped, and/or rejected. Thus, AFAM seemed to provide a counter space of validation and cultural affirmation, that is, a psychosocial space of corrective emotional experiences that were counter to the invalidating and negative experiences Black students encountered outside of group.</p>
<p>Corrective emotional experiences also seemed to be part of the fourth theme—resilience. The term <italic>resilience</italic> was coined to describe the fortification students identified in their experiences of the weekly AFAM meetings. Students described AFAM meetings as helping them “get through the week.” In other words, these meetings seemed to bolster students’ strength for coping with challenges and provide them with resilience for navigating the university environment. The fortifying and restorative atmosphere students found in AFAM seemed to be another example of corrective emotional experiences, where students found restoration and rejuvenation for coping in a dysfunctional or hostile campus environment.</p>
<p>In addition, the presence of corrective experiences seemed evident in students’ experience of intellectual stimulation in AFAM. In AFAM, students discussed being able to approach problems from an intellectual perspective and being able to use or “flex their intellectual muscles” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0095798413478696">Grier-Reed et al., 2008</xref>). This experience seemed to offer students an opportunity to step outside of stereotypic ways of being perceived and interacting with others. Instead, students were provided with a space in which they could freely exercise their intellect and feel affirmed in the process. The affirmation these Black college students experienced as intellectual beings was demonstrative of another corrective experience and counter space in which deficit notions of people of color were dismissed.</p>
<p>Altruism and the imparting of information also seemed to be generated through intellectual stimulation. In the student quotes reported in the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0095798413478696">Grier-Reed et al. (2008)</xref> study, students identified the importance of (a) being able to help friends and (b) having the opportunity to share and pass on knowledge in AFAM. In this discussion, there was also the sense that as students expressed themselves intellectually, AFAM provided a mechanism for giving and receiving emotional support. As a result, students had opportunities to engage in altruism or helping each other by passing on knowledge (i.e., the imparting of information) and by providing emotional support, particularly with respect to developing and exercising their intellectual identities.</p>
<p>The sixth theme in students’ experience of AFAM was empowerment; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0095798413478696">Grier-Reed et al. (2008)</xref> suggested that students experienced empowerment in AFAM by having a platform for exercising their voice and interacting with other African American college students “striving to succeed and show leadership” (p. 482). As the following quote suggests, this platform seemed to provide an outlet for students who might not have otherwise expressed themselves.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>When we discuss a lot of different issues in some of my classes it gets real uncomfortable for me. I’m waiting for a White person to say something stupid. Seriously in my classes people don’t know what the sound of my voice sounds like. I’m not very talkative in class. So when I come to group everyone knows when I am in group because I am just loud, but it’s a blessing because it’s important to be able to talk and express yourself, and when you have stuff on your mind, it’s not good to keep that stuff inside. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0095798413478696">Grier-Reed et al., 2008</xref>, p. 482)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This outlet of empowerment in which students felt free to express themselves also hearkens back to the therapeutic factor of catharsis or release.</p>
<p>The focus on models striving to succeed and show leadership underscores the opportunities for imitative behavior in AFAM, where through the weekly networking meetings Black students had opportunities to look to and imitate the behavior of successful peers and other models in navigating the campus environment. One student in the study alluded to the importance of this:
<disp-quote>
<p>Though we may be looked at as the stem of a lot of social problems and we may be incarcerated at alarming rates and we may be not graduating at the rate we wish were graduating at, I love to going to those [AFAM] meetings and seeing people who are so opposite of that. It’s really good to go to AFAM and see those types of people. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0095798413478696">Grier-Reed et al., 2008</xref>, p. 482)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Access to successful models in AFAM also seemed related to another therapeutic factor—the instillation of hope.</p>
<p>The final theme in students’ lived experience of AFAM was a home base on campus; here, the sense of belonging and cohesion generated through AFAM seemed most evident. The home base reflected students’ experience of acceptance, a key feature of cohesion. In addition, the authors of the study suggested that feeling welcomed and accepted as part of AFAM helped mitigate feelings of rejection and isolation on campus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0095798413478696">Grier-Reed et al., 2008</xref>). Hence, the warm, cohesive, and accepting space or home base on campus also provided an opportunity for corrective emotional experiences that were counter to the marginalization commonly experienced by Black students on a predominantly White campus.</p>

<title>Implications and Recommendations</title>
<p>In all, a case can be made for most of the traditional therapeutic factors associated with group work in students’ lived experience of AFAM, and these therapeutic factors have been linked to improvements in psychological well-being across a range of groups. For example, in a study of chronic lung patients engaged in outpatient group psychotherapy, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0095798413478696">Agapetus (1994)</xref> found that the therapeutic factor of hope was essential to the well-being and survival of the group. In an examination of divorce support groups, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0095798413478696">Oygard (2001)</xref> found that adjustment after divorce was associated with the therapeutic factors of catharsis, universality, and cohesiveness. Even in a computer-mediated support group for parents, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0095798413478696">Bragadottir (2008)</xref> found that mutual support (operationalized by altruism, instillation of hope, universality, cohesion, and catharsis) was related to decreased levels of depression and anxiety. Moreover, in the examination of a psychoeducational group for older adults focused on “friends helping friends,” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0095798413478696">McIinnis-Perry and Good (2006)</xref> found evidence for all 11 therapeutic factors along with improvements in group members’ psychological well-being. Thus, even in groups outside of traditional psychotherapy or mental health counseling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0095798413478696">Yalom’s (1995)</xref> therapeutic factors have been generated and linked to improvements in psychological well-being.</p>
<p>In addition, research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0095798413478696">Constantine et al. (2003)</xref> suggests that for Black college students informal support networks may be a buffer against the negative effects of psychological distress. Therefore, exploratory and outcome research focused on informal networks as therapeutic interventions for Black college students on predominantly White campuses is needed. At present, I am not aware of the existence of any such studies, even though as Constantine et al. and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0095798413478696">Chiang et al. (2004)</xref> point out, relying on informal support networks as opposed to formal mental health counseling may be a culture-specific, indigenous coping style for Black students. The intentional development of informal networks for Black students on predominantly White campuses may help create therapeutic counter spaces of safety, connectedness, validation, resilience, empowerment, intellectual stimulation, and acceptance.</p>
<p>In turn, fostering and developing such networks can be one way for college counseling centers and mental health practitioners to engage in culturally sensitive outreach. Thus, in tandem with the recommendation for exploratory and outcome research focused on the therapeutic value of informal networks such as AFAM, I recommend the intentional development of these networks as potential culturally sensitive counseling interventions. Given that (a) relying on informal networks (as opposed to formal mental health counseling) may be a culture-specific, indigenous coping strategy for Black students, (b) these students tend to underutilize college counseling centers, and (c) informal networks have been identified as a significant moderating variable and buffer against psychological distress, the development and study of informal networking groups as therapeutic interventions is an important line of research that can to lead to exciting advancements in culturally competent mental health practices that better support the psychological health and well-being of Black college students.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Black students on predominantly White campuses face a number of psychosocial stressors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0095798413478696">Ancis et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0095798413478696">Arnold, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0095798413478696">D’Augelli &amp; Hershberger, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0095798413478696">Davis et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0095798413478696">Solorzano et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0095798413478696">Watkins et al., 2007</xref>), and informal networking groups such as the AFAM may be therapeutic for coping with these stressors. Even though AFAM differs from traditional counseling groups, the group process still seems to unfold and generate therapeutic factors. To better understand the therapeutic potential of informal networking groups as interventions for Black college students, research including empirical investigations is needed. This line of inquiry may have exciting implications for helping universities and college counseling centers better support and facilitate the psychological health and well-being of Black college students on predominantly White campuses.</p>
