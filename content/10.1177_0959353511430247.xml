<p>Rutvica Andrijasevic’s <italic>Migration, Agency and Citizenship in Sex Trafficking</italic> offers a timely intervention into the dominant discourse surrounding border policy and protection in the European Union (EU). As the EU’s financial and political integrity continues to be challenged in the media, with attention focused on Greece’s debt burden to wealthier EU countries and the financial ‘eurozone crisis’, Andrijasevic’s study of migrant sex workers in Italy reminds us there are material and human dimensions to the EU’s financial and political choices; while money may move freely across EU borders, people may not, and this creates the conditions that put migrant workers, including those trafficked for sex work, into dangerous and precarious positions. Andrijasevic states that one must look at the ‘broader spheres of social and political life in contemporary Europe’ in order to understand the conditions in which sex trafficking comes about and is sustained (p. 1). Her book focuses on women who have been trafficked and allows them to speak of these conditions themselves in order to highlight that it is not just traffickers, third-party controllers and criminal organizations that deny sex workers mobility and access to basic social and human rights, but also the state.</p>
<p>Compiled from a series of interviews Andrijasevic undertook in Bologna, Italy, in 1999 and 2000 at a women’s shelter where she volunteered, the book revolves around the in-depth interviews of 15 women from non-EU countries who came to Italy for sex work and engaged in, and eventually left, third-party controlled street-level prostitution. Chapter One details the book’s theoretical grounding and methodology and makes an argument against viewing the women solely as trafficked victims. Chapter Two turns to the women’s stories of migration as a basis for understanding how EU border policies create the conditions of illegal migration and the reasons women decide to engage in sex work. Chapter Three focuses on the women’s stories of sex work, including how they left prostitution, and makes an argument for the women’s agency under difficult and oppressive circumstances. Chapter Four returns to Andrijasevic’s initial argument that a complex analysis is needed to understand how and why the women made the decisions they did about sex work and migration and what, in turn, this can tell us about how border policies shape migrant’s lives and their understandings of themselves as gendered and sexualized beings. Finally, Chapter Five concludes by calling for a different model of citizenship in the EU that takes into account new forms of delocalisation and migratory practices, and moves past the illegal/legal binary as a model for social inclusion.</p>
<p>In the book’s most compelling moments the women interviewed speak for themselves about their migration journeys, experiences of sexualized violence and isolation, and feelings about prostitution. These stories undermine any neat distinction between the idea of voluntary and involuntary migration for sex work, and make clear that although the women often knew they would be working as prostitutes when they arrived in Italy from their home countries, they were in no way complicit in their abuse and exploitation. The women’s stories also reveal that EU border restrictions and the threat of deportation did not deter, nor stop, them from coming to or working in Italy. Those caught and deported in their first attempts to reach Italy, for instance, simply had to spend more time, energy, and money once they returned home to come back. Their migration journeys were detoured rather than discontinued. Once inside Italy it was often also the fear of being deported that left the women in vulnerable positions and restricted their mobility and visibility. The women were just as afraid, if not more, of the police as they were of their third-party controllers. The women’s stories of migration therefore reveal that deportation policies were not only ineffectual in each of their cases, but often created the conditions for their sex work by forcing them to work illegally, and for their exploitation by forcing them to stay hidden thereby protecting their controllers and clients.</p>
<p>Despite the focus on ‘sex trafficking’ in the title, the book would be more appropriately described as an argument against the trafficking framework and as an analysis of migration and labour. In fact, Andrijasevic outlines several reasons why the concept of trafficking is ineffectual and inappropriate to her study. She states:<disp-quote>
<p>With its emphasis on criminal organizations and victimised women, the discourse on sex trafficking as the new slave trade depoliticises the debate on migration and labour and closes down the possibility of seeing the ways in which women’s assertion of social positions, that are not deemed legitimate for victims of ‘sex trafficking,’ press onto and reshape the boundaries of citizenship in Europe. (p. 4)</p></disp-quote>This is one of the book’s strongest claims, as Andrijasevic insists that the way EU governments and the general public define sex trafficking contributes to the precarious status of sex work for the women interviewed and ignores the many subjective factors that shaped their decisions to migrate for sex work, including desires ‘for spatial, labour, affective, and social mobility’ (p. 143). The trafficking model does not account for the ways the women interviewed entered into sex work, their experiences of migration and labour, or the ways that they became participating members of their new communities, enacting forms of social citizenship regardless of their legal status. In fact, this model works to erase these dimensions of migration in order to maintain a strict dichotomy between women who are labelled as trafficked, and therefore treated as victims without agency, and those who are labelled as illegal sex workers, and therefore treated as deviants to be deported.</p>
<p>One area of the book that could use further development is in its attempt to debunk the myth that sex workers are always victims. On its opening page the study is described as an investigation into how EU government policy plays itself out ‘at the level of the subject’ and the impact it has ‘on individual experience of gender difference and sexuality’ (p. 1). Yet, the analysis shies away from a discussion of sexuality or gender that takes into consideration patriarchal power relations, maintaining that the women are engaged in a type of labour and that they did not sell themselves as ‘selves’. At these times the book works too hard to avoid engaging with a feminist analysis of patriarchy that would insist on pointing out that the type of work the women engaged in is a gendered practice designed to serve men’s sexual needs. If the book is to be a study of how ‘the conditions of exploitation and abuse of migrant labour are maintained and perpetuated’ (p. 77), an analysis of patriarchal relations, beyond a short dismissal of feminist theories of abolition in Chapter One, needs to be more thoroughly engaged. Yes, the focus of the book is on the women’s experiences, but their experiences, and they way speak of them, are also shaped by patriarchal social relations that often normalize the masculine ‘need’ to buy sex from women, and this plays a role in state policy as well as interpersonal relations.</p>
<p>On a related note, another problematic aspect of the analysis is that the study uses the women’s individual experiences as the basis for a larger socio-political critique. The procedure of taking subjective stories and then generalizing and drawing conclusions about sex work, border policy, and EU politics is important and effective, but it is complicated by the fact that Andrijasevic is working with a small number of women in a particular context. Prostitution is not only legal in Italy (although organized prostitution is prohibited), but it is the only EU country where victims of sex trafficking can press charges against third-party organizers and then apply for Italian citizenship. Therefore, the book’s claim about how migrant sex workers negotiate their circumstances, subjectivities, and emotions—and the valid analysis that ‘abusive working arrangements in the sex sector are not permanent or monolithic but open to negotiation and change over time’ (p. 3)—needs to be contextualized more clearly in the Italian setting which allowed the women to not only leave sex work and become ‘legal,’ but also to speak to Andrijasevic in the first place.</p>
<p>Overall, the book provides a credible and multi-layered argument about why we need to redefine the ways we talk about sex work in connection to migration and citizenship, and about why we must hold the state accountable for creating the very conditions it wishes to police. The concluding appeal for a different and more ethical model of EU citizenship that asks us to question what, rather than who, makes a community, is significant, timely, and persuasive. In allowing women who have been legally excluded from the state to speak, the book exposes that the construction of migrant sex workers as victimized, deviant ‘Others’ is an integral part of how citizenship and inclusion are currently defined in the EU.</p></sec>
