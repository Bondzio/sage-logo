<p>Biographical research encourages attention to meanings and generates rich, nuanced understandings. It places its diverse subjects in wider social, political, economic and cultural contexts. Through generating narratives of individual lives, researchers explore the meeting of inner and outer worlds. As Merrill and West convincingly argue in their collaborative text <italic>Using Biographical Methods in Social Research</italic>, ‘the particular can evoke and enrich our understanding of the general’ (p. 184).</p>
<p>The authors set themselves at thoughtful odds with scientific convention or what they describe as the dominant thread of mainstream social research, the objectivist tradition in which validity lies in ‘statistical significance, standardised procedures, reliability, replication and generalisability’ (p. 164). Biographical research does nothing less than challenge these notions of validity, and the authors detail this while urging readers to engage with the utility of narrative research and more humanistic approaches to knowledge creation. As they assert, ‘small [sample sizes] can be beautiful, sometimes more so’ (p. 106).</p>
<p>Merrill and West have put an excellent case together, laying out a broad coverage of the use and value of biographical methods in their fields. While it is unlikely that researchers or practitioners hostile to the notion of subjective accounts will be swayed by these arguments – or likely by <italic>any</italic> encouragement towards biographical methods – Merrill and West’s text is ideal to support research practitioners already seeking alternative, deeper methods to understand the interactive dynamics of social forces and individual agency.</p>
<p>Urging an ‘interdisciplinary imperative’ (p. 43), the authors’ goal is to help readers embrace different ways of seeing. Reflecting their biographies, they write primarily from the fields of sociology, psychology, therapy, and education. I was disappointed that insights from cultural anthropology as practiced in the United States tradition are omitted, particularly as engaging with current discourses on the nature and method of ethnography would enrich the discussion of biographical methods for all fields. As Merrill and West note, the Chicago School was only a partial, beginning foray into using empirical research to explore everyday experience.</p>
<p>Some readers may find the strokes of this text too broad. For example, active participant observation is evident in the samples of good biographical writing that Merrill and West provide (e.g. pp. 150-152), but only interview is explicitly discussed in the book. Nevertheless, as the authors point out, no single volume can provide sufficient space to do justice to map the full breadth and depth of biographical methods across the diverse disciplines that employ it. The authors’ goal instead is to give a flavour of the method, provide a ‘guidebook… [offering] glimpses into a rich, vibrant and changing terrain’ (p. 39).</p>
<p>The authors’ call for awareness of the emotional tone in interviews is particularly interesting, revealing the complexity of both the emotional subject and the information garnered for analysis (p. 118). Likewise, their attention to the negotiation of self in interviews is especially rich. As they note, change can happen over the course of an interview project or even a single interview, and this should not be rejected as ‘irrational’ subjects or data. The research process should instead be understood as a transitional space of identity negotiation and development, for the research subjects, the researchers, and the research questions and understandings themselves.</p>
<p>Despite its admirable organization and useful discussion, the book does not have the detail to be a clear or systematic biographical methods ‘how-to’ for beginning researchers. In the authors’ open exploration of differing approaches and styles, many points which would need to be explained or emphasized for novice researchers and writers tend instead to slide away. Such essential issues as representation, ethics, and reflexivity are frequently referenced but – for readers lacking detailed background knowledge - insufficiently explored to provide concrete guidance. More of the sort of useful detail seen in Barbara’s steps of analysis (p. 131) and inclusions in Linden’s proforma (p. 138) would have been helpful here.</p>
<p>The authors argue that it is important for researchers to choose the specifics of their method for themselves and their research and writing purposes, ‘constructed by the researcher in interaction with others and a range of discursive possibilities’ (p. 160). That is useful, sensible advice, yet not enough tools are provided which would stand alone here to help readers understand and fully reflect upon possible approaches.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the broad discussions in this text will be particularly useful for readers already minimally acquainted with biographical methods, particularly if their familiarity comes primarily from the perspective of only one discipline. As the authors describe, their own collaborations across disciplines have made them ‘less dogmatic and humbler about what… [they] do’ (p. 190), enhancing the open reflexivity engagingly evident throughout their text. As these authors remind us, researchers and writers are ‘part of an imaginative community, building on the inspiration and insights of many others’ (p. 157). At heart and in sum, this book represents an impressive model for open, collaborative, and continuing learning – exactly what Merrill and West call for in biographical research.</p>
