<abstract>
<p>Increasing emphasis is being placed on the need for advanced care planning (ACP) at the end of life. The Preferred Priorities for Care (PPC) document is a patient-held record promoted by the End of Life Care Strategy as an ACP tool to promote discussion and communication amongst patients, family and health care providers. However, little research exists into evaluating its effectiveness or exploring patient and carer views, particularly in non-malignant disease. Because the majority of patients with Motor Neurone Disease (MND) lose verbal communication, early discussion of patients’ wishes and preferences, a central aspect of ACP, is vital. This study examined MND patients’ bereaved relatives’ experiences of using the PPC document and their perceptions about its impact on end-of-life care using qualitative methods. Key findings adding to existing literature were that the PPC document was felt to have little impact on end-of-life care amongst this patient group and that there was a perceived lack of awareness of the document amongst health care professionals (HCPs), in particular hospital staff. This was felt to limit the effectiveness of the document. This has obvious implications for practice, looking at awareness amongst HCPs and ways to improve this situation, particularly in light of the current pressures to meet patient preferences at the end of life.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Motor Neurone Disease (MND) is a progressive neurodegenerative condition with no effective treatment and survival statistics worse than some malignancies. Over 50% of patients die within three years of the first symptom.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269216311399664">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269216311399664">2</xref></sup> Patients are vulnerable to infection and are more likely to die in hospital than those with malignant disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269216311399664">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269216311399664">6</xref></sup> The disease trajectory of MND presents both clinical and ethical challenges, notably around end-of-life care decisions. Consequently, the use of advance directives is becoming commonplace, particularly in the United States.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269216311399664">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269216311399664">9</xref></sup> Because the majority of patients lose verbal communication yet retain the capacity to make decisions, early discussion of patients’ wishes and preferences, a central aspect of advanced care planning (ACP), is vital.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269216311399664">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269216311399664">12</xref></sup></p>

<title>Background</title>
<p>With increasing emphasis on patient centeredness, the need for ACP at the end of life for all patients, regardless of diagnosis, has been increasingly highlighted in government policy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269216311399664">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269216311399664">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269216311399664">16</xref></sup> The Preferred Priorities for Care (PPC) document, formerly known as the Preferred Place of Care document, is a patient-held record originally developed and piloted in the Lancashire and South Cumbria Cancer services network. One of three initiatives promoted by the Department of Health’s End of Life Care Strategy, the PPC document is recommended as an ACP tool to help identify patient preferences for end-of-life care and prevent unwanted hospital admissions at the end of life.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269216311399664">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269216311399664">20</xref></sup> In contrast to an advanced directive or decision to refuse treatment, the PPC document is not a legal document but an advance statement of wishes. As with verbal and written information about people’s expressed wishes and preferences, the PPC document can prove particularly useful when making best interest decisions for patients under the Mental Capacity Act (2005), which legally requires health care professionals (HCPs) to acknowledge such sources.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269216311399664">21</xref></sup> The congruence between actual and preferred place of death is becoming increasingly recognised as an outcome in evaluating the quality of end-of-life care<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269216311399664">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269216311399664">22</xref></sup> and the PPC document, as an ACP tool, is anticipated to help patients achieve their preferred place of death. However, there has been little research evaluating the PPC document’s effectiveness, or exploring patient and carer views, particularly in non-malignant disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269216311399664">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0269216311399664">25</xref></sup> This study aimed to look at MND patients’ bereaved relatives’ experiences of using the PPC document and their perceptions about its impact on end-of-life care.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0269216311399664" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>This study was conducted at a MND Care and Research Centre in the North West of England in consultation with the International Observatory on End of Life Care at Lancaster University. Potential participants included bereaved relatives or primary carers of patients with MND known to the centre as identified by its database. Inclusion criteria required that the patients must have died at least three months prior to the study and had completed a PPC document during life. All patients were over 18 years of age. Non-English speaking relatives or carers and those lacking the capacity to consent or experiencing significant health problems were excluded. Semi-structured face-to-face interviews were conducted at the participants’ homes and digitally audio-recorded with permission. A field diary was kept throughout the study. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and anonymised. Thematic analysis was used to analyse the written interview data.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0269216311399664">26</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0269216311399664" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>Eleven participants were interviewed, including one joint interview with a father and son. The participants were mostly above 65, male, British White and had been living with the patient.</p>
<p>Four main themes were identified specific to the PPC document:</p>
<list id="list1-0269216311399664" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>completion;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>document availability to others;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>importance and influence on the end-of-life experience;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>limitations.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>1. Completion.</p>
<p>The process of completion encompassed three subthemes: (a) persons involved in completion; (b) timing; and (c) experience of completion.</p>
<list id="list2-0269216311399664" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>(a) Persons involved in completion</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>All but two patients completed the PPC document in the presence of a relative or carer and all but one with a HCP. This was usually the MND Specialist Nurse, otherwise a district nurse. All participants felt the professional involved was the most appropriate person mainly because of an established relationship with the HCP with whom they felt comfortable.</p>
<list id="list3-0269216311399664" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>(b) Timing</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Document completion ranged from two to 17 months prior to death. All but one participant described prior conversations with the patient regarding wishes and preferences before introduction of the PPC document. Several participants felt that it was important that the PPC document had been completed whilst patients were still able to talk or sign the document themselves. For patients that had lost verbal communication, some participants felt completion should have been earlier. For participants with a strong sense of the patient’s wishes timing was less important. No participants reviewed the PPC document following completion.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Nudging a big button, a very slow word processor, is not the same as talking and I think … if we had done it January February time … [patient] would have been able to express probably more forcefully her feelings. (I9)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<list id="list4-0269216311399664" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>(c) Experience of completion</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Most participants saw the experience of completion as positive, particularly for the patient, affording peace of mind and a sense of relief. Most found it hard emotionally, despite the obvious benefit. All but one participant agreed with the patient’s wishes, which were often seen as more important than their own.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>As a patient it, it did wonders for me mum, you know, because peace of mind, that’s what it was. (I1)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<list id="list5-0269216311399664" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>2. Document availability to others</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>There were two categories of people to whom the document might be shown: (a) family and friends, and (b) HCPs.</p>
<list id="list6-0269216311399664" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>(a) Family and friends</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The majority reported showing the PPC document to other family members or friends, often soon after completion. In only two cases the document was regarded as private.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Everybody, all the family and husbands and wives all read it and all said ‘Yeah, Ok we understand it’ so if I wasn’t here and anything happened they knew and they knew where the document was. (I7)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<list id="list7-0269216311399664" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>(b) HCPs</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The PPC document was less likely to be shown to HCPs. Only two participants reported showing the document to all HCPs involved in the patient’s care and less than half showed the document to the General Practitioner (GP) or District Nurse. Several participants reported showing the PPC to paramedics in an attempt to prevent hospitalisation. However, once hospitalised, only half showed it to hospital staff. Overall participants were more likely to <italic>tell</italic> HCPs about the PPC document than <italic>show</italic> it to them. Again, showing the PPC document to others was less important to those with a strong sense of the patient’s wishes.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Yeah well there’s no point in the document if people don’t know it exists especially if it’s to do with someone’s care errmm, so everybody who came into contact I showed ‘em the document and give ‘em time to read it. (I7)</p>
<p>I actually told him ‘She’s got a document’ I told ‘em all but no one actually asked to see it. (I4)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<list id="list8-0269216311399664" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>3. Importance and influence on the end-of-life experience.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>(a) Importance</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Overall the PPC document was seen as important, particularly in providing peace of mind for the patient and increasing HCPs’ awareness of the patient’s wishes.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>It was formalised, everyone knew what [patient] wanted and everybody worked to give her that and we had confidence then that if she did go into hospital and we weren’t with her at least the document was there and everybody knew what was required. (I7)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Again, those with strong agreement with patient wishes saw the PPC document as less useful, but acknowledged that it may be more useful for others. They reported that the PPC document had prompted conversation regarding issues not previously discussed, such as resuscitation.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I think we knew from the very beginning of what we wanted … they all knew exactly what we wanted, see, so I wouldn’t say you could forget the document but in our case I’m not entirely certain the document actually worked. (I3)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<list id="list9-0269216311399664" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>(b) Influence on the end-of-life experience</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Although seen as important, many felt that the PPC document had little impact on end-of-life care with awareness of the patient’s wishes being more influential.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I tend to suspect that it was more us made it happen rather than that piece of paper … If I was to be honest I can’t say that document made [patient’s] end of life as she wanted it, I think that was us that did it. (I3)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Two participants even described a negative influence. Despite this, the majority of participants felt they would recommend the PPC document to others or would complete one themselves. However, many wanted assurance that HCPs would take notice of it.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>If they’re wishes are implemented, yes, but if hospital staff are going to completely ignore any of their wishes why bother? (I6)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<list id="list10-0269216311399664" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>4. Limitations</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Lack of awareness amongst HCPs was seen as a major limitation to the effectiveness of the PPC document, particularly during hospital admission. This either related to staff not understanding the purpose of the document or appearing to ignore a patient’s stated wishes and preferences. Consequently, increasing awareness of the PPC document was the most common thing participants felt they would change about its use.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I think it were the, the not knowing outside the people that knew about the, the disease … that’s the only point that we felt the document was useless was the fact that not enough people knew about the document. (I1)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0269216311399664" sec-type="discussion">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The aim of this study was to explore experiences of using the PPC document amongst bereaved relatives of MND patients, including their perceptions about its impact on end-of-life care. To date existing literature has been largely concerned with the congruence between actual and preferred place of death. This study therefore adds several new important findings, as well as reinforcing findings from previous studies not necessarily specific to MND patients.</p>
<p>Despite being emotionally difficult, completing the PPC document contributed positively to the end-of-life experience for both participant and patient. As well as affording a sense of relief and peace of mind, completion was felt to help patients maintain a sense of control, all of which were felt to be important by many participants. These emerged as strong themes throughout. Indeed, the importance of maintaining control in achieving ‘a good death’ has been highlighted repeatedly in the literature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269216311399664">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0269216311399664">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0269216311399664">30</xref></sup> and may be particularly pertinent in this patient group, who are faced with progressive loss on a daily basis.</p>
<p>Timing has been recognised as one of the main challenges of the ACP process. Despite recommendations that it should begin as early as possible,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0269216311399664">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0269216311399664">32</xref></sup> findings from this study corroborate those of others, in that the timing of ACP is a highly individualised concept reflecting the different stages of acceptance of illness experienced by patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269216311399664">13</xref></sup> It would appear that appropriate timing poses a particularly unique challenge amongst this patient group and this study further adds that, in the case of MND, ACP is more effectively achieved whilst the patient retains the ability to communicate effectively. Despite recommendations for regular review, as wishes and preferences can change over time,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269216311399664">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269216311399664">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269216311399664">20</xref></sup> this study found no evidence of this following initial completion, regardless of the interval from completion to death. This may reflect the predictable decline experienced in MND, with a relative paucity of disease-modifying treatments compared with malignant disease.</p>
<p>Although not directly related to completion of the PPC document, participants of this study reported a high level of agreement with patient preferences, often describing a strong sense of obligation to fulfil wishes, as described in previous research.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0269216311399664">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0269216311399664">34</xref></sup> Patient and carer agreement is recognised as important in achieving a ‘good death’ and is a strong predictor for achieving preferred place of death,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0269216311399664">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0269216311399664">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0269216311399664">37</xref></sup> which was achieved by 60% of this sample. Other findings consistent with existing literature included the importance of HCP continuity and good communication skills in the ACP process.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269216311399664">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269216311399664">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0269216311399664">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0269216311399664">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0269216311399664">39</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although the PPC document was developed as a communication aid, it appeared less instrumental in initiating discussion between patient and carer than between patient and HCP. Most participants reported being already aware of patient wishes, as a result of discussions held prior to PPC document completion, often shortly after diagnosis. This may be a finding specific to this sample and therefore may not apply to diseases with less predictable prognoses. This would be an important area for further study. The document’s influence on ongoing discussions is less clear, but findings may suggest that the primary role for the document in this patient group may be to promote awareness amongst HCPs rather than relatives and carers. Indeed, the PPC document can not only empower the patient and relatives, but also the HCP.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0269216311399664">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0269216311399664">41</xref></sup></p>
<p>Perhaps, therefore, the most significant finding of this study with the greatest relevance to ongoing clinical practice was the perceived lack of awareness of the PPC document (as either misunderstanding the purpose of the document or appearing to ignore a patient’s stated wishes) amongst HCPs, especially hospital staff. This was seen as a major limitation to the document’s effectiveness. Not surprisingly, raising awareness amongst HCPs emerged as a particularly strong theme and was the most common aspect participants felt they would change about the ACP process. However, only a minority of participants recognised the importance of showing the document to all HCPs involved in the patient’s care. Participants were likely to verbally communicate patient preferences and the existence of a completed PPC document, but the document was more likely to be shown to family and friends than HCPs, particularly during hospital admission. Although written evidence of treatment preferences is important, completion of documents alone has been recognised as insufficient and communication of wishes and preferences to key HCPs is crucial.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269216311399664">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269216311399664">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0269216311399664">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0269216311399664">42</xref></sup> Nevertheless, showing the PPC document to HCPs aware of its role may increase the likelihood that patient preferences are followed and therefore its influence on the end-of-life experience.</p>
<p>This has clear implications for clinical practice. Currently, patients and relatives are encouraged to show the PPC document to key HCPs. As the PPC document is ultimately a patient-held record, the importance and benefits of showing it to HCPs must be stressed. In addition, encouraging HCPs to enquire routinely about the PPC document would likely assist patients and relatives. This study has also highlighted a significant need for further education of HCPs in awareness and use of the PPC document. Education programmes developed during the introduction of the PPC document were originally aimed at District Nurses and other community staff likely be involved in completion and have yet to be implemented to a wider audience. Extending education therefore, especially to hospital staff, can only enhance PPC document effectiveness. This has particular significance for those responsible for implementing the End of Life Care Strategy, as the number of patients with a PPC document or evidence of ACP is likely to increase in light of local and national initiatives to decrease hospital deaths and promote patient choice at the end of life.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269216311399664">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>Due to limited resources this study involved a small, homogenous sample; therefore, results cannot be generalised but are rather suggestive of issues relevant for those who have used the PPC document. It is interesting to note that the majority of participants were bereaved males, despite the slight increased prevalence of MND amongst men and slightly greater proportion of female carers. Further studies would need to address this possible gender bias by including a more balanced sample. However, the aim of this study was not to look at the effect of gender on experiences and perceptions. The fact that the use of the PPC document is well established amongst the Preston MND Specialist Nurses who received enhanced communication skills training during the original pilot may also have influenced experiences of completion. In addition, the time from completion of the PPC document to interview was variable and may have affected memory of events for some participants.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Amongst this group the PPC document was felt to contribute positively to the end-of-life experience by affording peace of mind and a sense of control. However, participants felt the document had little impact on the end-of-life experience, which was seen to be influenced by other people’s awareness of the patient’s preferences irrespective of having the document. Despite being developed as a communication aid, the participant was usually already aware of patient preferences prior to PPC document completion. This may be a reflection of the predictable trajectory of MND and it remains unanswered whether this may be more relevant in other disease processes. However, a greater role for the document may be in raising awareness of patient preferences amongst HCPs, particularly amongst this patient group where effective verbal communication is often lost before the end of life. It is therefore significant that this study has highlighted a perceived lack of awareness of the PPC document amongst HCPs, particularly hospital staff. This has obvious implications for practice by looking at levels of and ways to improve awareness amongst HCPs, particularly in light of the increasing goal to achieve patient preferences at the end of life, through whatever mechanism they may be expressed.</p>
