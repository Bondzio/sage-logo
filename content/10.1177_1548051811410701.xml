<abstract>
<p>This research shows employees have views on supervisor “face,” defined in terms of moral character and social status. Employee perceptions of supervisor face were examined as a mediator in the relationships between perceived organizational support and work outcomes in a survey of 278 hospital employees and their supervisors. Work outcomes were based on supervisor ratings of employee extra-role behavior and employee in-role behavior. Findings indicated partial mediation by perceptions of supervisor “face.” The evidence shows supervisor moral character and social status influenced work outcomes. Implications of the findings are discussed.</p>

<p>The abstract notion of “face” (self-presentation) is often seen to be an Asian construct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1548051811410701">Earley, 1997</xref>) based on the traditional link to ancient Chinese cultures dating to the 4th century B.C.E (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1548051811410701">Hu, 1944</xref>). However, in this investigation, it came to light that ancient Greek and Hebrew texts (e.g., Old Testament Psalms) originating from about the 7th century B.C.E reflect a notion of face similar to the ancient Chinese. These Western texts define face with multiple meanings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1548051811410701">Botterweck, Helmert, &amp; Heinz, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1548051811410701">Friedrich, 1967</xref>) similar to the Chinese (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1548051811410701">Hu, 1944</xref>), including both the physical face and the abstract view<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1548051811410701">1</xref></sup> “of man in his position in human society” and of “a man of esteem” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1548051811410701">Friedrich, 1967</xref>, p. 770).</p>
<p>Researchers have linked the notion of “face” to self-identity concepts. For example, organizational face theory proposed self-identity is an integral component of group structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1548051811410701">Earley, 1997</xref>) by defining a person’s status in the group. Status has been recognized as a dimension of face from ancient times (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1548051811410701">Earley, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1548051811410701">Hu, 1944</xref>). Face as self-presentation is the line one takes within a group or dyadic situation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1548051811410701">Goffman, 1967</xref>), such as subordinate, advisor, mentor, or trainer. Understood in this way, face and self-identity of a social actor establish norms and expectations for actor behavior within a specific setting. A corollary to face is facework, which has been described as behavior signals, including verbal and nonverbal messages, that serve to communicate the self’s position (e.g., social status), to protect it and to recover it if face should be lost or damaged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1548051811410701">Ting-Toomey, 2005</xref>). These views suggest face and self-identity are important concepts to understand supervisor–subordinate relationships.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1548051811410701">Farmer and Aguinis (2005)</xref> combined resource dependency theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1548051811410701">Pfeffer, 1981</xref>) and identity theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1548051811410701">McCall &amp; Simmons, 1978</xref>) to understand supervisor–subordinate relationships. They proposed that subordinates depend on supervisors to maintain subordinates’ desired work role identities. For example, supervisors control resources including social, emotional, and job-related rewards. These ideas are consistent with earlier assertions that supervisors are the source of ongoing subordinate self-verification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1548051811410701">Dienesch &amp; Liden, 1986</xref>) and that a subordinate’s identity can be altered by a supervisor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1548051811410701">Lord &amp; Brown, 2004</xref>). Organizational face theory makes a similar proposition and states that the status dimension of face can be transmitted by association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1548051811410701">Earley, 1997</xref>). Examples of this abound in press reports, for example, when zealous fans seek the attention of top athletes or rock stars. Sometimes equally zealous aversion by many individuals to fallen idols also appears in press reports. For example, exposures of star athletes’ egregious misdeeds such as alleged child abuse or cruelty to animals have resulted in public outcry and demonstrations of disgust. These represent people seeking to distance themselves from individuals publicly identified to be “bad” in terms of moral character and low in social status.</p>
<p>The question in this research addresses whether employee perceptions of supervisor face could influence employee work outcomes? A supervisor’s moral character and social status might serve as social resources to employees and serve as a symbol of organizational support. This research examines the mediating role of supervisor face between perceived organizational support and job performance.</p>

<title>Perceived Organizational Support</title>
<p>An extensive body of research has emerged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1548051811410701">Rhoades &amp; Eisenberger, 2002</xref>) since the initial scale development of perceived organizational support (POS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1548051811410701">Eisenberger, Huntington, Hutchison, &amp; Sowa, 1986</xref>). The concept extended ideas from social exchange theory and organizational commitment. POS was described as an employee’s sense of the employer’s caring and concern for employee job success and needs in challenging situations. The reciprocation process was presented as employee belief in organizational support in return for employee loyalty to and involvement with the organization. Research has shown this exchange process involves employee work outcomes.</p>
<p>Employee behaviors often examined in connection with POS have included in-role behavior, extra-role behavior, and commitment to the organization. Helping behavior, as a component of organizational citizenship behavior, has frequently been examined as extra-role behavior. Several investigations found significant relationships between POS and extra-role behavior (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1548051811410701">Eisenberger et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1548051811410701">Lynch, Eisenberger, &amp; Armeli, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1548051811410701">Moorman, Blakely, &amp; Niehoff, 1998</xref>). In-role behavior was also found to be significantly related to POS (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1548051811410701">Eisenberger et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1548051811410701">Lynch et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1548051811410701">Wayne, Shore, &amp; Liden, 1997</xref>). More recently, POS was found to be positively correlated with citizenship behavior and task performance in a model including cynicism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1548051811410701">Byrne &amp; Hochwarter, 2008</xref>). Based on past research, I expect POS will be significantly related to employee extra-role behavior and to employee in-role behavior.</p>

<title>“Face” (Self-Presentation) and Identity</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1548051811410701">Goffman (1959</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1548051811410701">1967)</xref> proposed that rules of self-respect and consideration establish the mutual acceptance of the “line” (social position; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1548051811410701">Goffman, 1959</xref>) each actor takes in a situation. Face is viewed as “one’s most personal possession, source of security and pleasure, on loan to the self from society—potentially to be withdrawn if conduct is not deemed worthy” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1548051811410701">Goffman, 1967</xref>, p. 10). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1548051811410701">Earley (1997)</xref> extended Goffman’s concept of face by considering dimensions of face from traditional Chinese culture and research on social identity theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1548051811410701">Tajfel, 1972</xref>), self-categorization theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1548051811410701">Turner, 1985</xref>), and other research.</p>
<p>Organizational face theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1548051811410701">Earley, 1997</xref>) is presented as a midrange model. That is, the focus is on the individual level, yet the necessity to include social systems to understand “face” in organizations is also emphasized. Face is held to be an aspect of the social actor closely related to social identity embedded in societal and organizational contexts. I adopt Earley’s definition of face, which represents a blend of Goffman’s definition and the two dimensions of traditional Chinese “face,” moral character and social status:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote><p>The evaluation of self based on internal and external (to the individual) judgments concerning a person’s adherence to moral rules of conduct [moral character form of face] and position within a given social structure [social status form of face]. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1548051811410701">Earley, 1997</xref>, p. 43)</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The internal component of face refers to a reflection of an individual’s conscience guided in part by the social context of a situation. The external element includes the symbolic nature of a person’s actions in a social setting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1548051811410701">Earley, 1997</xref>). Thus, face is seen as a public phenomenon embedded within a social context as an image of self perceived by others. This contrasts with notions of self-esteem such that face is not defined privately by an individual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1548051811410701">Lim, 1994</xref>). Many social scientists (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1548051811410701">Mead, 1928</xref>) posit face is dominated by and only understood within a social context. Although internal moral standards are important aspects of an individual’s face in the Chinese definition, my focus in this examination is on the external aspects of face espoused by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1548051811410701">Goffman (1959)</xref>. That is, face as social currency among actors in a setting.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1548051811410701">Ting-Toomey (2005)</xref> also associated face with identity in social interaction and linked face to “identity respect and other-identity considerations” (p. 73). Identity confirmation was proposed to be part of identity-based goals involving respect and approval. When an identity within a specific context is threatened, such as social status degraded, face loss occurs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1548051811410701">Ting-Toomey, 2005</xref>). An example might be criticism of job performance at work or an accusation of misconduct. Researchers have proposed that positive identity and building social resources at work is important to strengthen an individual’s position at work. Social resources in the form of numerous and diverse high-quality relationships often provide access to additional resources including trust and information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1548051811410701">Dutton, Roberts, &amp; Bednar, 2010</xref>). Pathways to positive identity were defined to include virtuous attributes and self-esteem. To experience identity growth toward high standards of achievement was also proposed as an avenue to a positive identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1548051811410701">Dutton et al., 2010</xref>). These ideas echo the two dimensions of traditional Chinese face, moral character and social status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1548051811410701">Earley, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1548051811410701">Hu, 1944</xref>).</p>
<p>It has been suggested that “face” can be related to organizational citizenship behaviors in a social-exchange context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1548051811410701">Earley, 1997</xref>). For example, an employee might do extra work by staying after hours to complete a project, or he or she might extend a helping hand to assist with work when a colleague is absent. These behaviors may generate praise from a supervisor and may result in enhanced status for the employee. One aspect of this exchange was proposed to involve the bestowal of added status. For example, an individual with high status (e.g., manager/supervisor) has the ability to elevate the status of a person of low status (e.g., employee/subordinate) through favorable treatment of the low-status person. Examples of favorable social interactions at work might be praise for good performance, as a demonstration of respect and/or approval. In a sample of public employees in emergency support roles and road construction workers, mutual identity confirmation was positively related to cooperation at work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1548051811410701">Milton &amp; Westphal, 2005</xref>). This demonstrates the influence of employee- perceived face of colleagues with employee work outcomes. Based on the research on face and identity and the link between employee-perceived face of others at work and citizenship behavior, I expect employee perceptions of supervisor face will be positively related to extra-role behavior and to in-role behavior.</p>

<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 1</italic>: Employee perceptions of supervisor face are positively related to employee extra-role behavior.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 2</italic>: Employee perceptions of supervisor face are positively related to employee in-role behavior.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Organizational-based self-esteem (OBSE) is an additional identity variable shown to be important in work settings and related to theories of symbolic interaction. The proposition is that significant others, including entities, contribute to perceptions of members within an organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1548051811410701">Brockner, 1988</xref>). OBSE is defined as “the degree to which organizational members believe that they can satisfy their needs by participating in roles within the context of the organization” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1548051811410701">Pierce, Gardner, Cummings, &amp; Dunham, 1989</xref>, p. 625). Having high OBSE means an employee sees the self as valuable to the organization. Thus, an employee’s perceived sense of support from the organization may contribute to the employee’s sense of self-identity within the organization. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1548051811410701">Lee and Peccei (2007)</xref> found OBSE mediated the relationship between POS and commitment. OBSE also mediated the relationship between POS and deviant behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1548051811410701">Ferris, Brown, &amp; Heller, 2009</xref>). Looking to agency theory and the idea that members of the management group are agents of the organization, we might infer from this research that employee POS may also influence employee perceptions of the supervisor.</p>
<p>A second identity variable, behavioral integrity, similar to aspects of “face,” has garnered recent research attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1548051811410701">Simons, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1548051811410701">Simons, Friedman, Liu, &amp; Parks, 2007</xref>). Researchers posited behavioral integrity consists of two dimensions: (a) espoused versus enacted values and (b) relating to promises kept. Social context is a key factor in that behavioral integrity refers to a pattern of behavior and thus is a perceived phenomenon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1548051811410701">Simons et al., 2007</xref>). This idea of behavioral consistency is similar to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1548051811410701">Goffman’s (1959)</xref> notion of the “line” an actor takes in a situation. Researchers focused on Black employees and their sensitivity to behavioral integrity. They found employee perceptions of manager behavioral integrity mediated the relationship between employee race and several work outcomes including organizational commitment and intent to stay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1548051811410701">Simons et al., 2007</xref>). Black employees were more sensitive to behavioral integrity for White managers when compared with Black managers, which influenced work outcomes.</p>
<p>Reputation has also been examined for mediation effects related to work outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1548051811410701">Hall, Zinko, Perryman, &amp; Ferris, 2009</xref>). Echoes of the definition for face can be detected in the definition for reputation: “a general consensus regarding how others view an individual; positive reputations . . . viewed as being more legitimate, competent and trustworthy . . . possessing higher status” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1548051811410701">Hall et al., 2009</xref>, p. 383). These researchers found employee personal reputation mediated the relationship between employee-perceived personal accountability and task performance. Perceived accountability, for example, refers to perceptions that coworkers’ success or failure depends on a target “accountable” actor. Relative to managerial reputation and employee work outcomes, researchers found leader reputation related to customer loyalty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1548051811410701">Mehra, Dixon, Brass, &amp; Robertson, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, researchers found a supervisor factor, employee perceptions of supervisor support (PSS), mediated the relationship between POS and two work outcomes, organizational citizenship behavior and in-role behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1548051811410701">Shanock &amp; Eisenberger, 2006</xref>). The researchers viewed POS as an antecedent to PSS such that high POS enhanced PSS. That is, perceived support from the organization reflected favorably on perceived support provided by a supervisor. This is similar to the “trickle down” effect posited by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1548051811410701">Simons et al. (2007)</xref>. Through mediation analysis, the researchers found “middle managers’ perceptions of their senior managers’ behavioral integrity trickled down to affect line employee perceptions of the middle managers (p. 650). These findings echo agency theory with supervisors seen as agents of the organization to employees. The extent an employee perceives he/she has organizational support reflects on employee’s perception of supervisor image and likely influences employee perceptions of supervisor status and character.</p>
<p>Evidence points to a mediation role for identity factors in the workplace between POS and extra-role behavior and in-role behavior. The identity factors include OBSE, behavioral integrity, and reputation. It is important to note, however, that past research demonstrates numerous factors relating to POS and employee performance outcomes that involve socioemotional needs, performance-related expectations, and more (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1548051811410701">Rhoades &amp; Eisenberger, 2002</xref>). Thus, other factors are likely to affect the employee performance variables in the present study. Based on the above review, I expect employee perceptions of supervisor face will partially mediate the relationship between POS and extra-role behavior and between POS and in-role behavior. That is, POS will have an indirect and direct positive effect on extra-role behavior and in-role behavior, respectively.</p>

<sec id="section5-1548051811410701">
<title>Sample</title>
<p>Participants were 672 hospital workers in a large Midwestern city in the United States. Surveys were sent to 2,349 employees at the hospital’s main campus, of whom 672 responded, representing a 28.7% response rate. Employees volunteered to complete the survey and were motivated by a drawing awarding three cash prizes of $300 each. Females comprised the majority of respondents (87.8%); 30.1% were between 41 and 50 years of age and 28.6% were 50 years and older. Representing 93.7% of the sample, most were White Americans, 46.3% worked in nursing areas, and 18.1% worked in clinical support areas. Most respondents had college experience with bachelor’s degrees (51.2%), and 23.5% had taken some college courses. Many respondents were longtime employees, with 35.4% having more than 10 years at the hospital, and 25.2% had been at the hospital between 5 and 10 years.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1548051811410701">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>Paper-and-pencil surveys were sent to 230 supervisors and their nonsupervisory employees in all hospital departments. Supervisor surveys were sent via the hospital internal mail system. Supervisors rated employees on work outcomes, in-role behavior, and extra-role behavior. Employee surveys were sent to home addresses. Employees and supervisors returned surveys via the U.S. postal service directly to the researcher. A total of 142 supervisors completed surveys for a response rate of 62%. Supervisors were 77% female, 95% Caucasian, 73% 41 years or older, and 36.6% supervised nurses. Eighteen participants including matched surveys were omitted due to response bias. A total of 278 dyads were retained for hypotheses testing consisting of 278 employees and 142 supervisors. The dyads were a combination of one supervisor–one subordinate and one supervisor–multiple subordinates. Supervisors evaluated an average of two subordinates. I created dummy variables for supervisors rating more than one subordinate to test for rater bias. All <italic>F</italic> statistics indicated statistical significance, with the smallest sample marginally significant at <italic>p</italic> &lt; .10.</p>
<p>Employees in the sample of 278 were 88% female; 96% were White Americans, average age was 31 to 40 years, and 42% were nurses. Demographic data for employees in the matched dyads were correlated with data for employees missing a supervisor survey. Correlation results for the several demographic items ranged from <italic>r</italic> = .75 to .90, indicating similar demographic profiles for the two employee samples.</p>
<p>The employee survey included demographic data and attitudes about supervisors based on a seven-item supervisor “face” scale (self-presentation). The survey also included three scales for a nine-item POS survey and 20 items to measure positive and negative affectivity. Supervisors assessed employee helping behavior and job performance.</p>

Reliability for the eight-item scale was α = .85 (<italic>n</italic> = 678) and .84 for the subgroup of respondents paired with supervisors (<italic>n</italic> = 278). Items assessed employee perceptions on the extent the organization was caring and concerned for employees in their jobs.</p>

<title>Employee perceptions of supervisor “face.”</title> <p>I developed seven items to measure employee perceptions of supervisor face. First, an extensive review of research on the “face” concept was conducted (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1548051811410701">Earley, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1548051811410701">Goffman, 1959</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1548051811410701">1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1548051811410701">Ting-Toomey, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1548051811410701">Tjosvold &amp; Huston, 1978</xref>). To construct scale items, I focused on the two dimensions of face from traditional Chinese culture included in organizational face theory, moral character viewed as a personal asset and social status as a relational factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1548051811410701">Earley, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1548051811410701">Ting-Toomey et al., 1991</xref>). The stem for the items was “My supervisor is/has.” Response options for these items ranged from 1 = <italic>strongly disagree</italic> to 5 = <italic>strongly agree</italic>. Four items addressed moral character: integrity, honesty, and being ethical and esteemed. Three items focused on social status: being valued, respected, and trustworthy in the organization. Actual survey items are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1548051811410701">Table 1</xref>. Scale reliability was high at .91. Scale items were submitted to factor analysis (discussed below) along with POS items. Factor loadings for the supervisor face scale were .76 and higher and suggest a one-dimensional variable. Although a two-factor definition of face was expected, a one-dimensional variable may be explained by the contrast between the sample population and the Chinese source for the two-dimensional definition. It is likely that persons of Chinese background have a more refined understanding of this construct relative to two distinct dimensions compared with Americans with a one-dimensional view of “face.” This difference might explain aspects of interactional difficulties between parties of the two cultures within cross-cultural initiatives. Differences between the two cultures’ understanding of face is discussed and documented extensively by cross-cultural researchers (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1548051811410701">Hofstede, 1991</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section13-1548051811410701">
<title>Tenure</title>
<p>I measured employee organizational tenure with one item asking respondents to indicate the number of years worked at the organization. The five response options were less than 1 year, 1 to 2 years, 2 to 4 years, 5 to 10 years, and more than 10 years.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1548051811410701">
<title>Educational level</title>

<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1548051811410701">Podsakoff, MacKenzie, Lee, and Podsakoff (2003)</xref> reviewed common method bias literature and concluded that affective states may at times be a confounding factor in behavioral research. For the present research, measures of affectivity were used in partial correlations to assess the role of affectivity on the study’s focal variables. I measured affectivity using the scales developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1548051811410701">Watson, Clark, and Tellegen (1988)</xref> consisting of 10 adjectives each for the two dimensions. The response stem for the items was the following: “Indicate the number of days you have felt each emotion or feeling during the past week. For example, 0 = <italic>no days</italic>, 1 = <italic>one day</italic>, and so on.” The 10 items to measure positive affectivity were interested, determined, alert, attentive, excited, enthusiastic, inspired, active, strong, and proud. The 10 items to measure negative affectivity were guilty, irritable, distressed, scared, hostile, ashamed, jittery, upset, nervous, and afraid. Internal consistencies for the items were high at .86 for positive affectivity and .84 for negative affectivity.</p>

<title>Factor Analysis</title>
<p>The items for POS and supervisor “face” were submitted to factor analysis to assess the latent variables. Response options for these items ranged from 1 = <italic>strongly disagree</italic> to 5 = <italic>strongly agree</italic>. Cronbach’s alpha for POS in the present study was .85, similar to previous reports of the scale’s reliability at .90 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1548051811410701">Eisenberger, Cummings, Armeli, &amp; Lynch, 1997</xref>). Internal consistency for items in the supervisor “face” scale was .91. Factor loadings for POS were at or above .60, and for supervisor face were at or above .76. The results are displayed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1548051811410701">Table 1</xref>. Two cross-loadings for items in the supervisor face scale were low at .33 and .26. The results suggest the two variables are related but distinct.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1548051811410701">Table 2</xref> displays the means, standard deviations, correlations, and reliabilities. Hypothesized relationships are reflected in the correlation results. Reliabilities ranged from .84 for the control variable negative affectivity to .92 for in-role behavior. The alpha statistic for employee perceptions of supervisor “face,” the proposed mediator, was high at .91. The correlation between employee perceptions of supervisor “face” and POS was significant. Employee perceptions of supervisor face were also positively related to the two outcome variables.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The evidence in this sample of Midwestern hospital workers indicates that the employees had opinions on the moral character and social status of supervisors. Employee perceptions of their supervisor, referred to as “face,” were positively related to POS, extra-role behavior, and in-role behavior. These perceptions of supervisor face partially mediated the relationship between POS and extra-role behavior and between POS and in-role behavior. Partial mediation means POS continued to be significantly related to employee performance variables while accounting for perceptions of supervisor face. This research is consistent with the stream of past research showing the importance of POS. Organizational support is represented, for example, by authority figures caring for, assisting, and appreciating employees. Also, past research shows perceived supervisor support was positively related to employee POS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1548051811410701">Shanock &amp; Eisenberger, 2006</xref>) suggesting employees perceive supervisors represent the organization. However, the findings in this study suggest it is not just what organizations do for employees. Employees were also motivated by perceptions of supervisors’ honesty, ethics, respect earned within the organization, and perceived value to the organization. Job performance was positively related to these aspects of perceived supervisor “face” representing moral character and social status. The results are especially noteworthy given the location of study participants and their distance from cultures where the concept of face dominates social interactions.</p>
<p>Many avenues of future research could explore the antecedents and consequences of employee perceptions of supervisor “face.” For example, supervisor behavior and organizational reputation might influence employee perceptions of a supervisor’s ethics and value to the organization. Perceptions of supervisor face might be associated with employee turnover, absenteeism, deviant behavior, or organizational commitment. A few studies have explored the link between employee ethics and job performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1548051811410701">Turnipseed, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1548051811410701">Valentine, Varca, Godkin, &amp; Barnett, 2010</xref>) and between employee factors related to organizational ethics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1548051811410701">Baker, Hunt, &amp; Andrews, 2006</xref>). Yet aspects of the relationship between perceived supervisor face on performance have received little research attention. These questions remain for future researchers to explore. By examining a factor of character and status, results of the present study point to the complexity of the supervisor–subordinate relationship. In a small way, this study contributes to the research that focuses on “subordinate as follower” as a critical dimension to understand the role of leaders and to clarify leadership theories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1548051811410701">Lord &amp; Brown, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>The development and initial test of the scale for perceptions of supervisor face represents a limitation in the study. However, internal consistency was very high and factor loadings for scale items were high when combined in the factor analysis with POS. Future research should test the scale in samples representing different cultures, industries, and levels of employees. The cross-sectional nature of the study also represents limitations. Subjects responded to items on perceptions of supervisor face and POS in the same survey. Common method variance can be a problem if subjects tend to strive for consistency in responding to survey items perceived to be similar. However, affectivity as a potential confounding factor was tested and proved to have a negligible influence on the results. Additionally, data were collected from supervisors on employee performance measures to avoid more extensive common method variance.</p>
<p>This study adds to the stream of research in identity constructs in the work setting. Examinations of face, behavioral integrity, and reputation shed light on understanding the antecedents and consequences of social identity factors. With competition increasing rapidly on a global scale, it is important for organizations to identify employee factors influencing performance outcomes. Perceptions of supervisor face could mean the difference between successful and unsuccessful business units and whether an organization is able to grow and serve customers effectively. The notion of “face” is of particular importance in cross-cultural initiatives where varying meanings of “face” in social interactions can reverse forward progress.</p>
<p>These results might encourage top decision makers to carefully consider “face” in proposing and implementing cross-cultural initiatives. Training for managers in the meaning of “face” within and across the cultures could facilitate harmonious results. Additionally, executives might evaluate aspects of face in selecting and promoting candidates to supervisory positions. Standards in ethics and moral conduct should be set and communicated clearly. Organizational communications might be explicit in recognizing achievements and successes of supervisors to build awareness among employees of respect earned by and value attributed to supervisors. Supervisor shortcomings and failures should be carefully assessed with remedial actions taken quickly to help them become high performers. Relevant training on these topics might be considered for supervisors when behavior demonstrates deficiencies. In conclusion, the research confirms the importance of organizational support. It also expands beyond the organization’s caring and concern for employees to include consideration for supervisor moral character and social status.</p>
