<abstract>
<p>The clinical importance of lowering of total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) to decrease cardiovascular (CV) risk has been verified over many years starting with significant support in 1984 of the then previous lipid hypothesis. Significant support of this hypothesis began that year with publication of the Lipid Research Clinic study. Since then, multiple other studies including outcomes studies have established the value of LDL-C reduction in decreasing CV risk. In addition, multiple other factors such as inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, nitric oxide, antioxidant properties, and plaque stabilization appear important for modifying CV risk and possible favorable alterations by medications such as statins must be considered. Nevertheless, reduction of LDL-C has well-established value and is being accepted by clinicians as a major guideline for CV disease prevention. However, there are still problems with adherence by many clinicians to CV risk modification. Therefore, abandoning LDL-C reduction as a target, as has been advocated by some, appears premature and contraindicated. A strategy of LDL-C reduction in no way interferes with increased understanding of the complexities of atherosclerosis and new approaches to CV disease prevention as they become supported by outcomes studies.</p>

<p>In an Editor’s Perspective article, Hayward and Krumholz state that there is no scientific basis for treating low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) targets.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0003319712451115">1</xref>
</sup> It is their contention that no major randomized clinical trial has tested the benefit of cardiovascular (CV) risk modification according to a specific LDL-C target and that a tailored treatment is a simpler, safer, more effective, and more evidence-based approach. The authors describe a tailored treatment approach as so-called “individualized” or “personalized” care. However, any competent clinician always considers all the CV risk factors for the individual patient. Therefore, discussion of this opinion of Hayward and Krumholz appears indicated with presentation of additional perspective, especially when considering the difficult road traversed to get physicians to buy into CV risk modification. This is why evaluating the situation further may be of benefit to patients and physicians alike. Without question, LDL-C has been a simple and convenient target for guiding CV risk modification. It is well established as the primary goal for lipid-lowering interventions despite the need to deal with all vascular risk factors such as hypertension, tobacco, diabetes mellitus, and obesity.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0003319712451115">2</xref>
</sup> There does not appear to be any established cutoff LDL-C level below which there is no further clinical benefit but this question remains open for further study.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0003319712451115">3</xref>
</sup> An aggressive approach with stricter LDL-C targets has frequently been difficult to achieve, necessitating consideration of combination therapy, statin dose titration, and patient adherence.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0003319712451115">4</xref>
</sup> Abandoning LDL-C as a target appears a bit premature while, at the same time, we need to evaluate new approaches and consider the entire CV continuum as our knowledge and understanding increase.</p>
<sec id="section1-0003319712451115">
<title>Evidence for Value of Decreased LDL-C</title>
<p>The lipid hypothesis that lowering of cholesterol and LDL-C was beneficial had been advocated for many years but with limited evidence. It was finally given significant support in 1984 with the publication of the Lipid Research Clinic study results.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0003319712451115">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0003319712451115">6</xref>
</sup> This was achieved by the use of cholestyramine in the treatment group. Both placebo and treatment groups followed a moderate cholesterol-lowering diet. In the treatment group, there was a 13.4% decrease in plasma total cholesterol and a 20.3% reduction in LDL-C. The cholestyramine group showed a 19% reduction in risk (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .05) of the primary end point, which was a definite coronary heart disease (CHD) death (decrease of 24%) and/or a definite nonfatal myocardial infarction ([MI]; decrease of 19%). This initial support for the lipid hypothesis appears to be what can be called a “pure play” in lowering LDL-C since cholestyramine is essentially inert for any significant systemic metabolic effects; it lowers total cholesterol and LDL-C by binding bile acids in the small intestine and is, essentially, nonabsorbable.</p>
<p>Quantitative coronary angiography established the possibility for atherosclerosis plaque regression. In the Cholesterol Lowering Atherosclerosis Study (CLAS) using colestipol plus nicotinic acid, it was demonstrated by quantitative coronary angiography that plaque regression in the coronary arteries can be achieved with statistical significance.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0003319712451115">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0003319712451115">8</xref>
</sup> Nicotinic acid decreases biosynthesis of very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) triglycerides (TGs) by an average of 21%.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0003319712451115">9</xref>
</sup> Kinetic modeling suggests that the reduction in TG is due to a decrease in TG content of VLDL via a reduction in lipoprotein size more than number. Therefore, some metabolic effects can be attributed to nicotinic acid but they are definitely not comparable to statins and the significant modifier appears to have been the LDL-C reduction observed in CLAS.</p>
<p>Ileal bypass has been shown to lower LDL-C significantly in the Program on the Surgical Control of the Hyperlipidemias study and the ileal bypass appears to yield an essentially pure reduction in LDL-C without other metabolic or pleiotropic effects.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0003319712451115">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0003319712451115">11</xref>
</sup> The decrease in LDL-C was 37.7% and 5-year mortality and atherosclerosis end points were reduced significantly, including decreased mortality from CHD and/or nonfatal MI, coronary artery bypass graft surgery and/or coronary angioplasty, and onset of peripheral arterial disease (PAD). This surgical research from the 1980s to 1990s offers further support to the value of LDL-C reduction.</p>
<p>Apheresis also decreases LDL-C significantly, functioning to specifically bind apolipoprotein B (apo B) containing lipoproteins.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0003319712451115">12</xref>
</sup> Both LDL and VLDL are the major source of apo B and, therefore, a resultant decrease in VLDL reduces plasma TGs as well as plasma cholesterol. In addition, other vascular factors such as fibrinogen, C-reactive protein (CRP),<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0003319712451115">12</xref>
</sup> and lipoprotein (a)<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0003319712451115">13</xref>
</sup> are decreased by LDL apheresis. The principal effect of LDL apheresis is reduction in LDL-C but these other metabolic effects must be noted. The LDL-Apheresis Atherosclerosis Regression Study (LAARS) resulted in a 47% reduction in LDL-C with simvastatin alone and a 63% reduction in LDL-C in the apheresis plus simvastatin group.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0003319712451115">14</xref>
</sup> The 42 male patients were treated and followed more than 2 years with simvastatin 40 mg/d (SIMVA) alone versus biweekly LDL apheresis plus simvastatin 40 mg/d (LDL-A/SIMVA). Using quantitative coronary angiography end points, where quantification was expressed as change in average mean segment diameter, no significant difference was found in mean segment diameter for SIMVA versus LDL-A/SIMVA (0.03 ± 0.16 vs −0.01 ± 0.16 mm, respectively). However, more minor coronary lesions disappeared only in the LDL-A/SIMVA group. Bicycle exercise tests were also performed as part of LAARS and it was found that the time to 0.1 mV ST-segment depression increased significantly by 39% and the maximum level of ST depression decreased significantly by 0.07 mV in LDL-A/SIMVA whereas neither measurement changed in SIMVA. The authors postulated functional improvement noted in LDL-A/SIMVA may precede anatomic change. More dramatic group differences would have been desirable but the study involved patients with severe CHD and hypercholesterolemia and the benefit as observed with additional LDL-C lowering from apheresis add support to the value of decreasing LDL-C.</p>
<p>Hypobetalipoproteinemia is a specific familial condition defined by LDL-C equal to or less than the fifth percentile. Epidemiologic studies have shown that despite having some other associated medical problems, these individuals have a lower than average risk of atherosclerotic CV disease.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0003319712451115">15</xref>
</sup> This appears to add some additional support to protection from CV disease by low circulating LDL-C levels.</p>
<p>The Pravastatin or Atorvastatin Evaluation and Infection Therapy-Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction 22 (PROVE-IT-TIMI 22) study looked at subgroups of LDL-C &lt;40 mg/dL and LDL 40 to 60 mg/dL, in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). These subgroups were in comparison to higher LDL-C levels that were achieved in the rest of the study and it was found that there were significantly fewer major cardiac events in the lower LDL-C groups.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0003319712451115">16</xref>
</sup> The PROVE-IT-TIMI 22 study evaluated intensive therapy with atorvastatin 80 mg/d and moderate therapy with pravastatin 40 mg/d in patients who had ACS. In the intensive therapy group, the median LDL-C achieved was 62 mg/dL; in the moderate therapy standard-dose pravastatin group, the median LDL-C achieved was 95 mg/dL (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0003319712451115">17</xref>
</sup> Among 1825 patients treated with atorvastatin, 91% were at their 4-month LDL-C goal of &lt;100 mg/dL.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0003319712451115">16</xref>
</sup> The 2 lowest LDL-C distribution groups were &gt;40 to 60 mg/dL (34%) and &lt;40 mg/dL (11%). The principal characteristics of patients with the lower LDL-C levels were the following: more often male, older age, diabetic, lower baseline LDL-C levels, previous statin therapy, and reduced incidence of MI. The &gt;40 to 60 and &lt;40 mg/dL groups had fewer major CV events including death, MI, stroke, recurrent myocardial ischemia, and coronary revascularization. It was concluded that when compared with patients treated to an accepted LDL-C goal of 80 to 100 mg/dL, the lower LDL-C levels achieved resulted in no adverse safety effects and there was apparent improved clinical benefit. However, this observation is limited to the duration of the trial which was 18 to 36 months.</p>
<p>The Greek Atorvastatin and Coronary-heart-disease Evaluation study evaluated treatment to the National Cholesterol Educational Program (NCEP) goal versus “usual” care in secondary CHD prevention.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0003319712451115">18</xref>
</sup> A total of 1600 consecutive patients were randomized to either atorvastatin or to so-called usual medical care, in order to assess the effect of atorvastatin on morbidity and mortality (total and coronary) in patients with established CHD. Atorvastatin was titrated from 10 to 80 mg/d to reach the NCEP LDL goal of LDL-C &lt;100 mg/dL. The patients were followed for a mean of 3 years. Primary study end points were death, nonfatal MI, unstable angina, congestive heart failure (CHF) coronary revascularization, and stroke. Secondary end points were safety/efficacy of hypolipidemic medications and the cost-effectiveness of atorvastatin. Mean atorvastatin dose was 24 mg/d that resulted in the following decreases: total cholesterol 36%, LDL-C 46%, TGs 31%, and non–high-density lipoprotein (HDL) 44%. At the same time, HDL cholesterol (HDL-C) increased by 7%. All these decreases and increases were significant. The NCEP LDL-C and non-HDL goals were attained by 95% (n = 759) and 97% (n = 776), respectively, in patients taking atorvastatin. Only 14% of usual care patients received any hypolipidemic medication during the study period and only 3% achieved the NCEP LDL-C treatment goal. Of the patients with CHD receiving usual care, 196 (24.5%) had a recurrent CHD event or died during the study versus 96 (12%) of the patients with CHD treated to target with atorvastatin. This resulted in a risk ratio (RR) of 0.49 with confidence interval (CI) of 0.27 to 0.73, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001. Therefore, compared with usual care, atorvastatin decreased all the following: total mortality (RR 0.57, CI 0.39-0.78, <italic>P</italic> = .0021), coronary mortality (RR 0.53, CI 0.29-0.74, <italic>P</italic> = 0.0017), coronary morbidity (RR 0.46, CI 0.25-0.71, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001), and stroke (RR 0.53, CI 0.30-0.82, <italic>P</italic> = .034). All patient subgroups (women, diabetes mellitus, hypertension age 60-75, CHF, recent unstable angina, and prior coronary revascularization) benefited from atorvastatin treatment with associated lowering levels of LDL-C. Patient withdrawals due to side effects were low for both the groups: atorvastatin 0.75% and usual care 0.4%.</p>
<p>In managed-care patients with CHD treated in lipid-lowering disease management clinics (the ALLIANCE study), a total of 2442 patients with CHD with hyperlipidemia were randomized to atorvastatin 80 mg/d versus usual care.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0003319712451115">19</xref>
</sup> In the patients receiving atorvastatin, LDL-C was reduced 34.3% versus 23.3% for usual care. In the atorvastatin group, 23.7% of patients experienced a primary outcome, principally a nonfatal MI versus 27.7% in the usual care group (hazard ratio, 0.83; 95% CI 0.71-0.97, <italic>P</italic> = .02).</p>
<p>The Justification for the Use of Statins in Prevention: an Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin (JUPITER) study subgroup that looked at the participants attaining an LDL-C &lt;50 mg/dL and found significantly fewer CV events compared with the complete study group, adding support to the value of decreasing LDL-C. This occurred without an increase in adverse events.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0003319712451115">20</xref>
</sup> The overall JUPITER study randomly assigned 17 802 apparently healthy men and women with LDL-C levels less than 130 mg/dL, and high-sensitivity CRP (hsCRP) levels of 2.0 mg/L or higher, to rosuvastatin 20 mg/d or placebo. The patients were then followed for the occurrence of the combined primary end point of MI, stroke, coronary revascularization, hospitalization for unstable angina, or death from CV causes.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0003319712451115">21</xref>
</sup> Rosuvastatin reduced the LDL-C levels by 50% and hsCRP levels by 37%. In this trial of apparently healthy persons without major increases in LDL-C but with elevated hsCRP, rosuvastatin significantly reduced the incidence of major CV events as measured by the combined primary end point. The median baseline LDL-C was 108 mg/dL for both rosuvastatin and placebo groups with an interquartile range for both of 94 to 119. Therefore, even those patients with a low starting LDL-C appeared to benefit, and the issue of percent reduction in LDL-C is brought into focus.</p>
<p>The major outcome studies have tracked percent LDL-C reduction, still keeping the lowering of LDL-C as a goal.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0003319712451115">22</xref>

</sup> They do not define a specific low goal even though a goal of LDL-C &lt;70 mg/dL has been suggested as a convenient target for the patient at high CV risk, including the diabetic patient.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0003319712451115">26</xref>
</sup> The consideration and recommendation that percent LDL-C reduction may be the key also has support even when a high CV risk patient has a starting LDL-C level near 70 mg/dL such as in PROVE-IT-TIMI 22,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0003319712451115">16</xref>
</sup> the JUPITER study subgroup,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0003319712451115">20</xref>
</sup> and in a 2004 assessment of the implications of then-recent clinical trials for the NCEP III guidelines where a straight-line decrease in relative CHD risk down to LDL-C 40 mg/dL was noted.<sup>

<sec id="section2-0003319712451115">
<title>Pleiotropic Effects of Statins</title>
<p>The so-called pleiotropic properties associated with statins can be briefly summarized to include improvement of endothelial dysfunction, increased nitric oxide, antioxidant properties, decreased inflammation, and atherosclerotic plaque stabilization.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0003319712451115">27</xref>
</sup> These properties appear to make a major contribution to the relatively rapid CV benefit observed with statins and amplify the effects of statins as the most potent medication class for LDL-C reduction. It appears likely that these properties act in association with the very potent effects of statins in lowering LDL-C. However, over the long term, it appears that the decrease in LDL-C is the specific consistent unifying factor for beneficial CV disease reduction in the statin outcomes trials. At the same time, these pleiotropic effects make it more difficult to evaluate the contribution of the decreased LDL-C.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0003319712451115">
<title>Statins in a High Dose</title>
<p>The question of just always using a high dose of a statin, whether considering LDL-C reduction or a tailored approach, has to be raised. This has good support when starting a statin in the presence of ACS<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0003319712451115">17</xref>
</sup> with continuation during apparent acute inflammation. However, after inflammation should have resolved in 3 months, maintenance of a high-statin dose contributes to risk of myopathy as related to the progressive increase in dosage.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0003319712451115">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0003319712451115">29</xref>
</sup> This risk of myopathy is not close to zero, as touted in some clinical trials, but is more approximate to 10.5%.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0003319712451115">30</xref>
</sup> Percent reduction in LDL-C can be maintained on a lower, safer dose of a statin by the addition of other medications such as ezetimibe. Doubling the statin dose, as an average, only decreases LDL-C by approximately another 6%,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0003319712451115">31</xref>
</sup> but the addition of ezetimibe reduces LDL-C approximately 23.6%<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0003319712451115">32</xref>
</sup> and, in addition, contributes to hsCRP reduction.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0003319712451115">33</xref>
</sup> The question of whether or not to use and maintain a high-statin dose will persist despite these arguments for moderation (when possible) to maintain a desirable percent reduction in LDL-C.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0003319712451115">
<title>Medication Problems Associated With LDL-C Reduction</title>
<p>Some medications that reduce LDL-C, such as hormone replacement therapy (HRT) with estrogen plus progesterone, torcetrapib, and ezetimibe, have been associated with problems and have created controversy. In the case of HRT, estrogen has some beneficial effects in that it raises HDL-C, decreases LDL-C, and promotes endothelial stabilization.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0003319712451115">34</xref>
</sup> However, in the Heart and Estrogen/progestin Replacement Study (HERS) study, during an average follow-up of 4.1 years, treatment with oral conjugated equine estrogen plus medroxyprogesterone acetate failed to decrease the overall rate of CHD events in postmenopausal women with established CHD.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0003319712451115">35</xref>
</sup> In the case of the hormone medications, there were actually more thromboembolic events and gallbladder disease. In addition, during the first year of HERS, there was a significant time trend for more CHD events in the HRT group in the first year. It would appear that other hormone effects over and above the inarguably beneficial ones of estrogen—such as decreased LDL-C— resulted in lack of benefit.</p>
<p>The next major approach to CV risk reduction may be with medications directed at raising HDL-C levels. The most potent class of medications to achieve this goal appears to be a cholesterol ester transferase protein (CETP) inhibitor. This class of medications also decreases LDL-C significantly. However, the first CETP inhibitor tested, torcetrapib, as evaluated in the Investigation of Lipid Level Management Using Coronary Ultrasound to Assess Reduction of Atherosclerosis by CETP Inhibition and HDL Elevation trial, was associated with significant problems.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0003319712451115">36</xref>
</sup> Despite the marked increase in HDL-C and marked lowering of LDL-C, torcetrapib was associated with hypertension and no significant decrease in CHD progression. The question then was whether the unfavorable results were a class effect or a single medication effect. Another CETP inhibitor, anacetrapib, appears to have favorable CHD benefit in initial evaluations.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0003319712451115">37</xref>
</sup> However, results with another CETP inhibitor, dalcetrapib, were just determined not to be sufficiently favorable to continue with its development although there were no safety issues reported.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0003319712451115">38</xref>
</sup> In the case of torcetrapib, there were possibly specific disadvantageous effects on HDL-C despite the elevation of the lipoprotein.</p>
<p>Publication of the Ezetimibe and Simvastatin in Hypercholesterolemia Enhances Atherosclerosis Regression (ENHANCE) trial results definitely made it a requirement to justify the use of ezetimibe in the absence of a major outcomes study.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0003319712451115">39</xref>
</sup> The results and conclusion of the ENHANCE trial were that the combination of ezetimibe with simvastatin did not result in significant changes in the study parameter of carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) despite the further reduction in LDL-C and hsCRP that resulted from the addition of ezetimibe to simvastatin. However, the carotid differences were minimal and the study group selected, familial hypercholesterolemia, already on a high dose of simvastatin, probably did not lend itself to demonstration of a major reduction in cIMT in a short 24-month trial period. In a recent editorial in support of this, Paraskevas, Veith, and Mikhailidis concluded that current evidence suggests that diminishing LDL-C (with or without ezetimibe) will decrease or inhibit cIMT progression if the LDL-C reduction is significant and if the pretreatment cIMT is sufficient to allow a measurable decrease to occur.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0003319712451115">40</xref>
</sup> An additional study with ezetimibe, the Study of Heart and Renal Protection study, found that decreasing LDL-C with simvastatin 20 mg/d plus ezetimibe 10 mg/d in patients with advanced chronic renal disease safely reduced the occurrence of major atherosclerotic events in a wide array of patients.<sup>

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0003319712451115">42</xref>
</sup> ezetimibe offers a means for patients with high CV risk to attain a desired percent lowering of LDL-C. This occurs while maintaining a safer and better-tolerated statin level in a setting where a high-dose statin lacks specific support, as in the case of ACS<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0003319712451115">17</xref>
</sup> during the acute inflammatory state, which presumably persists for 3 months.</p>
<p>Therefore, even though percent reduction in LDL-C has offered clinicians a well-studied and well-founded approach, the results with HRT, torcetrapib, and ezetimibe emphasize that a useful approach such as LDL-C reduction must be integrated with comprehensive knowledge, and that percent targeting and various, patient-tailored treatments have a place and must be well understood.</p>

<title>Decreasing a Low LDL-C Even More?</title>
<p>Lowering any starting LDL-C level in high-risk patients appears to be advantageous and concomitantly will result in benefit when starting with a statin. This commentary has attempted to present published data in support of this. The patient who presents with CHD or other CV event and has what would normally be considered an ideal LDL-C (&lt;100 mg/dL) appears to be a candidate for further LDL-C lowering on a percentage basis no matter what the starting level is. This appears to be supported by available information and appropriate while more information is gathered on pleiotropic statin effects and how to use them clinically. For the high-risk patient, such as one with an established CV event, or the diabetic patient, the recommendation is to attain an LDL-C of &lt;70 mg/dL.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0003319712451115">26</xref>
</sup> However, if an event in a new patient with no CV history was to occur with such a starting level, available evidence supports aggressive, further LDL-C lowering while we try to increase our understanding of other causations of atherosclerosis, such as inflammation.</p>

<sec id="section6-0003319712451115">
<title>Proposed Guidance for Clinicians</title>
<p>Increasing the understanding of the complicated disease processes involved with atherosclerosis by the practicing clinician is very appropriate. However, the reality is that many medical practitioners still do not adhere to the lipid hypothesis and do not aggressively attempt to modify the CV risk factors for their patients who had CHD and/or PAD events. In most clinical practices, LDL-C lowering to varying degrees (and consistent with percent lowering, depending on individual physician acceptance) has represented a desired goal for high-risk patients. Programs to “get with the guidelines” have increased this awareness. It is still not uncommon to see patients referred for a cardiology consultation who have had a major CV event in the past and have never been placed on a statin. For now, LDL-C lowering should not be abandoned since there is excellent supportive evidence for it. Therefore, there should be continued support and publicity for LDL-C lowering. It appears of more value, for now, to supplement and build on what has proven useful and is backed by evidence-based medicine rather than now suggest a major change in focus as advocated by Hayward and Krumholz.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0003319712451115">1</xref>
</sup> The value of LDL-C lowering for the patient at high CV risk, regardless of starting LDL-C level and consistent with percent decrease, appears established. Nevertheless, consideration of all the other factors that may modify CV risk such as decreasing inflammation and increasing HDL-C is certainly worthy as more and more supportive information becomes available.</p>
