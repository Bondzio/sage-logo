<p>In the short span of time between the end of World War II and the 1951 premiere of television’s <italic>See It Now</italic>, there is the story of radio documentary’s heyday, complete with protagonists, conflicts, and a narrative arc. Ehrlich, a professor of journalism at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, has trained a magnifying glass on a sliver of the twentieth century that is an apt microcosm of the political, economic, and cultural environment of U.S. broadcasting and in the United States at large. He focuses on the historical context of audio documentary; the work of producer Norman Corwin and his peace-advocating <italic>One World Flight</italic>; the specific documentary efforts of CBS, ABC, and NBC; the political climate and its effect on documentary production; and the lasting effects of the era on subsequent cultures of journalism and broadcasting. In describing events at the three commercial radio networks during this time period, Ehrlich sheds light on a wide range of issues, including government regulation and network economics, changing media technology, the cold war, journalistic ethics, and the era’s complex cultural mind-set regarding patriotism, liberalism, and democracy.</p>
<p>Despite radio’s visual limits, it is a colorful piece of history (to wit, an alternative title could be <italic>The Blue Book and Red Channels</italic>) and, like the postwar period itself, this story is rife with muddy paradoxes. One documentary, for instance, “Living 1948,” was referred to as a “drama document,” encapsulating the juxtaposition of fact with artifice therein describing much of the period’s audio documentary style. With an engaging, jargon-free writing style, Ehrlich describes the rapid evolution of audio documentary from nonfiction dramatizations conceived of by Corwin, to journalistic, actualities-style reporting exemplified (and then amplified on TV) by the likes of Edward R. Murrow and Fred Friendly. He presents a well-organized structure with a logical flow, if at times weighed down a bit by ample narrative detail. Likely to appeal to those who are already somewhat familiar with broadcasting history, this account may fill in some gaps in understanding the intricacies and nuances of the era, especially those relating to both patriotism and public service.</p>
<p>Postwar radio programming was vulnerable to the suspicious gaze of anticommunists, and cold war monitoring practices affected many of those in the broadcasting industry. <italic>Red Channels</italic>, the 1950 entertainment industry blacklist, damaged the careers of documentary producers such as Corwin, Robert Louis Shayon, and Morton Wishengrad, to name only a few of the desirables/undesirables who tended to embody the tenets of liberalism and produce programs covering progressive topics like peace and social justice. One of the paradoxes that Ehrlich does a service in addressing is that of liberalism. Reform-minded though the documentary makers might have been in the bigger scheme, their implicit audience was ultimately elite, white, and male. Anticommunism presented itself via different faces, and herein lies another paradox: Ehrlich refers to one as the “<italic>One World</italic> Liberal in the mold of [“antifascist” documentary writer Arnold] Perl and Corwin,” and the other, like Morton Wishengrad, “unalterably opposed to Communism and deeply suspicious of the Soviet Union.” Such nuanced difference was but one characteristic of the era’s cultural complexity and one with heightened implications in documentary production.</p>
<p>The public service aspect of documentary ventured into another kind of monitoring. The “utopia” idea originated with CBS Documentary Unit head Robert Heller, who optimistically described the postwar period as “a virtual utopia for craftsmen who believe in radio’s usefulness as a social force.” Corwin and others espoused these sentiments, too, in their belief that radio should serve a higher purpose and uphold the values of responsibility in efforts to serve democracy, engender an informed citizenry, and improve the world. In an era when radio was communicating to a nonfractured audience, effects of a given program could indeed be palpable on a mass scale (to wit, <italic>War of the Worlds</italic>). A 1951 <italic>Hear It Now</italic> installment followed a pint of blood from a U.S. donor to its ultimate use in saving a wounded corporal in Korea. Murrow asked listeners, “What about <italic>your</italic> blood? Can you spare a pint?” As Ehrlich describes, “A mini-telethon of sorts followed, prompting a half-million blood donations across the country.”</p>
<p>In 1946, the FCC issues its <italic>Blue Book</italic> in an attempt to codify public service standards for broadcast license holders. The controversial concept of public service has mutated over the decades, with the definitions of “standards” and “public interest” ever subjective and malleable. In the postwar years, the broadcasting industry was subject to criticism for its overly commercial strivings to the detriment of coverage of important public issues. Again, paradoxically, there were bottom-line-oriented executives more than willing to play to the patriotic mainstream working side by side (though not always harmoniously) with progressive creative types just as glad to uphold the freedom, democracy, and First Amendment ideals that gave them the right to freedom of expression. Ehrlich spends a good deal of time tackling these polemics; just as the impulses of different strains of anticommunists and different strains of patriots may result in an odd bipartisanship, they may also find themselves eventually to be at cross purposes.</p>
<p>Technology marches on with both good and not-so-good consequences. The invention of plastic audio tape (as opposed to wire recording), for instance, offered dynamic new possibilities for programming, but it also hurt the careers of those documentarians whose work depended on the need for writing narration and dialogue. The most profound technological advancement is the real reason for audio documentary’s brief moment in the sun—it was eclipsed by television. There is a satisfying and substantive history and scholarship on television documentary, especially covering the work of Friendly and Murrow. Though we can paste together pieces from television and journalism history and biographies about, for instance, CBS, Murrow, Friendly, and Corwin, or about specific issues like war reporting, there is little in the way of a book-length focus on radio documentary, making this one a valuable contribution. (A useful precursor to Ehrlich’s book, however, might be <italic>Radio’s Civic Ambition: American Broadcasting and Democracy in the 1930s</italic> by David Goodman, Oxford University Press, 2011, which might provide an even broader view of the role of radio in a democratic society.)</p>
<p>Ehrlich’s research is extensive, as evidenced by his mining of the papers of all and more of the players mentioned above, as well as countless issues of <italic>Variety</italic> and other primary sources. A companion site to the book with a summary of his thesis and several documentary audio clips from the period is available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://netfiles.uiuc.edu/mehrlich/www/utopia.htm">https://netfiles.uiuc.edu/mehrlich/www/utopia.htm</ext-link>.</p>
