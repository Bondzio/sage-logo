<p>In the mid-1980s, Lancaster University’s student union (LUSU) produced <italic>An Alternative Prospectus</italic> which said this of Lash and Urry’s colleagues: ‘A friendly, democratic and informal department, if a little disorganised at times.’ The following year (1985), it was noted that: ‘The Secretaries are very friendly, helpful – and organised too!’ These innocent student comments render the thesis then being developed by their teachers as deeply problematic.</p>
<p>Lash and Urry, in <italic>The End of Organised Capitalism</italic>, sought to replace an analysis of the West based on ‘organized capitalism’ with one identified as ‘disorganized capitalism’. But interestingly, they did not entitle their book <italic>Disorganised Capitalism</italic> (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0950017013479554">Offe, 1985</xref>). Rather, the epochal nature of their di-vision was made clearer by signifying the text ‘the end of organized capitalism’. This emphasis on institutional <italic>closure</italic> rather than opening fitted better perhaps with a Thatcherism in its pomp. For the authors lived in a world where sociology and economics had equivalent status but few overlapping concepts. Keith Joseph had succeeded in renaming the Social Science Research Council as the ESRC and the equivalence had been made in the <italic>Daily Mail</italic> readers’ minds between sociology, class based social unrest and socialism. Hence <italic>The End of Organised Capitalism</italic> served a political function for the discipline by saying in effect that this sort of ‘scary’ logic may have worked once but would no longer. Research was needed to understand just how complex things had become. But it would not be research based on positive economics. Yet, quite startlingly, the normative, driving concern for what is said throughout the book is national economic success and failure (p. 42). Today this is a drive from the Treasury that the ESRC fully reflects but it was clearly there thematically in Lash and Urry in 1987.</p>
<p>The abrupt rupturism evident in their text may well have been one of the secrets of its success. Sociologists of great note have often established their reputations by pointing to some chasm opening up in the social fabric which rents asunder all that we have come to know, replacing it with a new material and ideational structure-in-dominance. But ‘ruptures’ can turn out to be minor and temporary reverses and conceptual terms can be flawed, particularly if they are words in common currency. For an organization theorist, it was obvious that what was being described was not ‘disorganization’ but ‘reorganization’. ‘Organization’ had been taken by Lash and Urry to mean ‘structure’, especially in the centralized, concentrated, bureaucratic systems typical of ‘welfare’ and ‘warfare’ economies. Epochal thinking emphasizes structures because of its concern to suggest sudden transformation of a gestalt kind. The book’s heavy use of lists may be implicated in this failure to embrace process because lists suggest a ‘before’ and ‘after’ stasis. In my field, a key concept was and is ‘organizing’, understood as everyday process, which renders social dynamics visible much more than structural analysis does. Had Lash and Urry regarded organized capitalism and disorganized capitalism in more of a processual way, then there is no sudden appearance of ‘disorganization’. It is one set of structures being transformed into another set of equally organized but different structures through a process of re-organizing. And ‘the market’ is a key component of this shift. Since ‘bureaucracy’ and the ‘market’ were being held up as alternative modes of organizing economic activity at this time, this omission is somewhat surprising – unless one sees it as a disciplinary ploy. In the face of market-led de-bureaucratization, most concerning in <italic>The End of Organised Capitalism</italic> was the homogeneity and power they assumed within ‘management’ (p. 194) and the book contains nothing on the self-evident fissures within management cadres which produced six million sackings among middle managers in the early 1990s. The waxing and waning of the fortunes of this part of the service class – at the hands of the capitalist – is a feature of the last 100 years. But ebbs and flows are not part of Lash and Urry’s rupturist argument.</p>
<p>The concept most relevant to this reader in 2013 was Britain as the ‘Makler’ of the world economy. With the ‘marketization’ and ‘financialization’ of almost everything we thought of as ‘social’, their analysis of ‘Makler UK’ resonates so well with an economy in a double dip recession, heavily dependent on world financial activity, where manufacturing is struggling, where neo-liberal plans for economic development come to nothing. It makes for very suggestive, contemporary interpretations. But in other ways the world has changed away from their di-vision since 1987. The authors thank three people for ‘their excellent typing of the manuscript’ suggesting an institution wherein word processing computers on the desks of academics had not yet arrived. The ‘IT revolution’, the internet and the World Wide Web lay over the horizon. In Lash and Urry’s world of 1987, the Soviet Union still existed and Germany was divided. No mention of China, still then in its brief 150-year doldrum of not being the world’s largest economy. They spend time talking of ‘corporatism’ but not of ‘globalization’; much concentration is found on trade unions and postmodernism but little on consumption and its effect upon identity (although that does appear later in their joint work). Despite these emphases, their book was a huge achievement in the ‘assemblage’ of material, and 25 years of ‘events’ have not been too unkind to it. They noted that the Big Bang had just taken place, Reaganomics and monetarism had come to predominate, Murdoch had recently entered ‘stage right’ at Wapping with his <italic>Sun</italic> waxing. Yet the book’s central notion that capitalism was ‘disorganizing’ via a rupture cannot be maintained. It has merely reorganized – to a limited extent – along other (battle) lines of politico-economic and cultural life. And this ebb and flow, opportunistically monitored by capital, is likely to continue into the foreseeable future.</p>
