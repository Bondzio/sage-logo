Steroids and peptide growth factors functioned as ligands to such receptors to induce cell signaling. Oxygenated steroids remain as an additional group of signal-transducing ligands. Cytochrome P450 catalyses the oxygenation of endogenous cholesterol and yield oxycholesterol (oxysterol) compounds. These oxycholesterols signaled through nuclear membrane–localized receptors to autoregulate cholesterol biosynthesis in animal cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1933719112459241">1</xref></sup> Some oxycholesterols have now been considered as possible ligands to the nuclear orphan receptors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1933719112459241">2</xref></sup> Oxysterols are available through food due to their ubiquitous presence in plant and animal kingdom. Brassinostreroids are plant oxysterols that are present at 10 to 100 µg/kg wet plant tissue. Dietary consumption of these compounds by herbivores and omnivores allow for their assimilation in the animal cells with a potential to affect cell function and growth in the host in a temporal manner. In recent years, phytohormones have been considered biologically significant in animal health and in agriculture. Hormones, in general, work with the immune and nervous systems to regulate growth, immunity, metabolism, reproduction, cognition, and behavior. Altering hormonal signals can therefore affect tissue functions leading to health disorders. Phytohormones can have substantial effect on human health when consumed through fortified foods and herbal medications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1933719112459241">3</xref></sup> Information on their in vivo influences on cellular ultrastructure, metabolism, reproduction, and genetics in higher animals however remains very limited.</p><p>The biosynthesis of all hormonal steroids in response to trophic hormone and other steroidogenic stimuli begins with cholesterol to form the first steroid, pregnenolone, synthesized in all steroidogenic tissues.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1933719112459241">4</xref></sup> Subsequently, the synthesis of testosterone (T) is under the influence of 3β- and 17β-hydroxy steroid dehydrogenases. Steroidogenesis is dependent on the complex cellular process of cholesterol transport to inner mitochondrial membrane, a rate-limiting step in steroid biosynthesis. Steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR) is crucial for the transport of cholesterol to mitochondria where the biosynthesis of steroids is initiated.</p><p>Testosterone is primarily produced by the Leydig cells and is critical for developmental and reproductive functions in the male. The androgen-binding protein (ABP) produced by Sertoli cells in the seminiferous tubules of the testis specifically binds T with high affinity and transports them to the epididymis. Leydig cell function is reportedly impaired by a decrease in T production as a consequence of suppressed CYP11A1, CYP17A1, 3β-HSD and 17β-HSD activities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1933719112459241">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1933719112459241">6</xref></sup> The intratissue sex steroid concentration is implicated as a significant marker in evaluating the expression of steroid-metabolizing enzymes in a tissue.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1933719112459241">7</xref></sup> Studies investigating the effects of 28-homobrassinolide (28-HB) on diabetic male rats indicated antihyperglycemic potency in this phytohormone.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1933719112459241">8</xref></sup> Since hyperglycemia was known to suppress testicular and ovarian steroidogenesis in the rat,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1933719112459241">9</xref></sup> it provided a basis for evaluating the biopotency of this oxysterol in rat testicular steroidogenesis.

The experiments were carried out in accordance with the guidelines of the Committee for the Purpose of Control and Supervision of Experiments on Animals (CPCSEA 2003), Government of India. Normal rats weighing 180 to 250 g were divided into 4 groups as follows. Group I: control, group II: rats treated with 28-HB, group III: diabetic rats, and group IV: diabetic rats treated with 28-HB.

It is however reported that diabetic rats do not respond to T by inhibition of gonadotropin-releasing hormone.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1933719112459241">26</xref></sup> Studies have shown that the rat plasma T content remains elevated up to 4 weeks in diabetic rats following STZ induction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1933719112459241">27</xref></sup> Subsequent decline in plasma T was noted only beyond 120 to 140 days in diabetic rat.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1933719112459241">28</xref></sup> The increase in the T content noted in the rat testis in our study is therefore a reflection of the STZ effect in the experimental diabetic rats used for the study. While <sc>d</sc>-aspartic acid has been shown to be a T booster in male rat,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1933719112459241">29</xref></sup> the use of 28-HB in the present study was also noted to be a booster for T production in the experimental male rats. It is therefore suggested that 28-HB possibly acted as an additional natural factor for the process. However, correlated changes in the T-ABP levels in the rat testis were not observed. Even though T is the major in vivo regulator of ABP synthesis in diabetic rats the marked increase in T seems to downregulate ABP expression in rat testis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1933719112459241">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1933719112459241">31</xref></sup></p><p>Lipid peroxidation is a well-known process of oxidative cellular injury in plants and animals and is an indicator of oxidative stress in tissues. Polyunsaturated fatty acid peroxides generate MDA and measurement of MDA content has been used as biomarkers of LPO status in the animal tissues. Diabetogens, such as STZ, enhanced ROS generation and induced LPO and protein carbonyl expression in the animal testis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1933719112459241">32</xref></sup> These effects could be attenuated by the administration of antioxidants or herbal extracts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1933719112459241">33</xref></sup> In hyperglycemia, the oxidative stress was due to inactivation and glycation of antioxidant enzymes. Elevated antioxidant enzymes, SOD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1933719112459241">Figure 3B</xref>) and catalase activities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1933719112459241">Figure 3C</xref>), were measured in experimental rat testis. Increased GSH content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1933719112459241">Figure 3D</xref>) and changes in the TBARS level were also noted following 28-HB administration to the experimental rats. Our study confirms the antioxidative property of 28-HB reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1933719112459241">34</xref></sup> earlier. Increased oxidative stress and decreased antioxidant level was, however, observed in STZ-diabetic rat testis. Recovery of the antioxidant status was achieved through elevation in catalase and SOD activities concomitant with a decrease in oxidative stress (reduced TBARS) as cited earlier. 28-Homobrassinolide thus reduced rat testicular tissue LPO significantly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1933719112459241">Figure 3A</xref>).</p><p>The metabolism of brassinosteroids in animal tissues is not fully known. Close structural similarity to oxycholesterols containing the ganone ring system may presumably subject this organic cyclic molecule to a metabolic fate similar to that of any steroid nucleus, generating intermediates potentially capable of influencing cellular metabolic events,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1933719112459241">19</xref></sup> steroidogenesis, and histological changes in a host tissue. It is not clear whether 28-HB was assimilated into mammalian cells through simple diffusion process or required specific mechanism for transport of this molecular species across plasma/nuclear membranes. The structural features of 28-HB would allow it to be considered similar to endogenous oxysterols involved in receptor mediated cellular signaling process, eliciting a biological response.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1933719112459241">35</xref></sup> It is proposed that the induction of biological activity in mammalian cells by phytohormones may be related to their capacity to elicit specific gene expression within target cells. Experimental evidence to such a proposition is made available through (1) the ability to regulate 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase enzyme activity to influence cholesterol biosynthesis in mammalian cells by oxycholesterols and (2) the ability to induce hexokinase gene expression in the rat tissues following oral administration of 28-HB to a group of male rats.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1933719112459241">36</xref></sup></p></sec><sec id="section17-1933719112459241"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The brassinosteroid plant hormone isoform 28-HB is an inducer of T production in normal and diabetic rat testicular cells. This phytooxysterol increased StAR and ABP expression in rat testicular cells, clearly indicative of the steroidogenic potential of 28-HB in the experimental animals. Based on the insight generated by this study, it can be postulated that specific oxysterols of animal cell origin probably played a role in testostserone biosynthesis and StAR protein production in normal testicular cells. The StAR protein level was however noticeably disproportionate to the increase in T content of the tissue following 28-HB use, suggesting that testicular steroidogenesis in adult rat can possibly exist independent of StAR’s regulatory role. The reduced T levels in the testis is a primary reason for reproductive dysfunction in diabetic male rats. Results of our study indicate a possible role for endogenous oxysterols in animal cells in the regulation of male reproductive function, since 28-HB as a plant oxysterol is capable of eliciting the observed biological responses in rat testicular function. It therefore becomes imperative to review Leydig cell dysfunction associated with male infertility, from this point of view. The significant possibility of endogenous oxycholesterols having a physiological role to influence testicular steroidogenesis is highlighted through this study.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>R.
