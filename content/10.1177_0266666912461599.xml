<p>This issue looks at several new perspectives in information development in various parts of the world.</p>
<p>We begin with a new approach to providing information for those working with livestock in the agricultural sector. In ‘Livestock and learning: evaluation of a prototype 3D virtual learning environment for livestock practitioners in India and Bolivia’. Yibo Lin, Claire Heffernan, Kim Thomson and Louise Nielsen of the University of Reading describe the development of the 3D Animal Health Resource Room (AHRR), a web-based environment to disseminate educational materials on key animal health and production constraints faced by the poor in Bolivia and India. The 3D AHRR was tested in seven non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in India and Bolivia, and the results showed that users attached more importance to the level of interaction or the social experience in the 3D space than to content and immersion.</p>
<p>The next paper, by Marina Dobrota, Veljko Jeremic and Aleksandar Markovic of the University of Belgrade, presents ‘A new perspective on the ICT Development Index’. The authors present an ‘I-distance methodology’ that offers a new perspective on the measurement of information development and compares it to the existing ICT Development Index, which combines 11 indicators related to three ICT categories: Access, Use and Skills. The ‘I-distance’ approach uses the same indicators, but synthesizes them into one value. The variables that are most relevant for measuring the ICT development level of countries can then be determined. The correlation between the I-distance values and IDI values is very strong, which makes I-distance an acceptable measurement method for evaluating countries’ ICT development levels.</p>
<p>The next paper deals with a country that has rarely, if ever, featured in these pages before – Afghanistan. In ‘E-government service use intentions in Afghanistan: technology adoption and the digital divide in a war-torn country’, Gohar Feroz Khan, Junghoon Moon, Bobby Swar, Hangjung Zo and Jae Jeung Rho, from various institutes in Korea, report on a study designed to develop and test an integrated model to predict intention to use e-government services by combining the concepts of technology adoption, the digital divide, and conflict literature through surveys of 360 citizens of Afghanistan. The authors found that components of the access divide and the social divide have significant effects on intentions to use e-government services, and that the perceived intensity of civil conflict and perceived behavioral conflict moderate certain predictors of intention to use e-government services. They also discuss the implications for e-government service adoption and delivery in digitally divided conflict zones in the contexts of research, policy and practice.</p>
<p>We return to the agricultural sector with the final paper, which also emanates from Korea. In ‘Impacts of cognitive media attributes and motivation on IPTV adoption: exploring the moderating effects of agricultural information’, Md. Dulal Hossain of the Bangladesh Atomic Energy Commission, Jin Ki Kim of the Korea Aerospace University and Jong Young Lee and Kook Jin Kim of the Media &amp; Future Institute in Korea note that Internet Protocol Television (IPTV) is seen by the agricultural and food industries in Korea as a viable means of promoting their markets. Based on the Stimulus-Organism-Response (S-O-R) framework, their study investigates how the technological and ambient environments of media characteristics influence viewer cognitive and emotional states, and how experiences subsequently affect their responses. The results show that the gathering of agricultural information moderates the relationship between the three factors of cognitive and emotional states and behavioral intention to adopt IPTV, such that the relationships are stronger for those factors that are related to a stronger sense of information gathering. The results should enable agricultural and food related business owners in Korea to obtain insight into using interactivity effectively to propel their businesses forward.</p>
<p>Regular readers will have noticed that, with only four articles in addition to the regular features, this issue is rather shorter than usual, due to the need to remain with an annual page budget of 320 pages. We are pleased to announce that, in view of the growing number of papers being submitted and approved for publication, the publishers have increased the page budget for 2013 to 384 pages – an increase of 20 percent. This will make it possible for more papers to appear in these pages more quickly than in the past and reduce the amount of time that papers that have been approved for publication have to remain available only on our website under the Online First facility.</p>
