<abstract>
<p>This study investigates the combined effects of humidity and ultraviolet radiation on the mechanical properties of hybrid composite comprising glass-E and curaua fibers reinforcing terephthalic polyester resin. For this purpose, construction of an accelerated environmental aging chamber was carried out. Mechanical properties were evaluated using tensile and three-point bending tests, along with analysis of fracture characteristics. Mass loss analysis of the specimens was also conducted during exposure in the chamber. A composite with only glass-E fiber was also tested and used as a basis for comparison. In the original condition the hybrid composite exhibited mechanical properties similar to those of the composite containing only glass-E fiber. After aging, there was a decrease in mechanical properties. Aging was more harmful to the hybrid composite than to the glass-E fiber composite. The new hybrid composite developed is intended for engineering applications as an alternative material to glass fiber composites.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0021998311429880" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Natural fibers have stood out in the development of new materials, particularly polymeric composites. Natural fibers composites can be used in many industrial sectors such as civil construction, furniture, and the automotive industry. Their advantages include low cost, low density, high availability, biodegradability, etc.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021998311429880">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021998311429880">2</xref></sup> The main drawbacks are poor mechanical properties and high moisture absorption due to their hydrophilic nature.</p>
<p>Poor mechanical performance can be improved by adding small amounts of synthetic fibers such as glass fibers, forming a hybrid composite. In addition to improving mechanical properties, glass fibers can act as a chemical barrier that reduces water absorption.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021998311429880">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Degradation is any destructive reaction that can be caused by chemical, physical, or mechanical agents. Degradation causes progressive deterioration of composite properties. According to Woo et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0021998311429880">4</xref></sup> ultraviolet (UV) radiation and moisture exposure are among the most severe weather conditions that can compromise the mechanical properties of many polymers. At room temperature and in the absence of light, polymers remain stable for extended periods of time. However, in sunlight polymer oxidation is accelerated, and atmospheric pollutants increase this effect.</p>
<p>Natural fibers can display degradation due to biological agents, acid and alkaline environments, moisture absorption, UV radiation, and temperature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0021998311429880">5</xref></sup> Glass fibers are relatively inert, immune to biological attack, and have good resistance to environmental aging when compared with natural fibers.</p>
<p>During degradation, the first ‘barrier’ to receive radiation is the matrix, and its degradation is inevitable, even at low radiation intensity and short exposure time. If radiation intensity is sufficient to overcome the matrix barrier and reach the fiber, the process changes, since the composite was in some way affected by degradation of the resin. In this case, transfer of the matrix/fiber load begins to occur through a degraded interface, even though the phenomenon is restricted to a single or a few composite layers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0021998311429880">6</xref></sup> The composite response, as to radiation, will depend on the fiber/matrix system, loading type, and fiber exposure time.</p>
<p>Other important factors involving adverse environmental conditions relate to humidity and high temperature. When the composite is simultaneously subjected to these two factors, a decrease in mechanical properties is common, mainly due to increased diffusion kinetics caused by the temperature increase.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0021998311429880">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>The study of composite degradation can be accomplished using natural or accelerated aging tests. The accelerated aging test offers the advantage of speed, supplying data on the probable performance of the material throughout its useful life. These tests are usually performed in a chamber where conditions are simulated, but with high intensities to accelerate the degradation process.</p>
<p>This study investigates the combined effects of temperature, humidity, and ultraviolet radiation on the mechanical properties of a hybrid composite comprising glass-E and curaua fibers reinforcing orthophthalic polyester resin. For this purpose, construction of an accelerated environmental aging chamber was carried out. Mechanical properties were evaluated through tensile and three-point bending tests, along with analysis of fracture characteristics. Mass loss analysis of the specimens was also conducted during exposure in the chamber.</p>
<p>Curaua fiber was selected for this study due to its good mechanical performance compared to other natural fibers, and also for social reasons.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0021998311429880">8</xref></sup> Curaua fiber, which originated in the Brazilian Amazon, has strong potential for agriculture because it offers an alternative to tropical forest exploitation, and contributes to the relocation of people back to the countryside. Curaua fiber is little mentioned in the scientific literature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0021998311429880">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021998311429880">9</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-0021998311429880" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title>
<p>The hybrid composite is a seven-layer laminate. The matrix is an ortho terephthalic polyester resin (Novapol L120) reinforced by glass-E fibers (mats of 450 g/m<sup>2</sup>) and curaua fibers (mats of continuous fiber). The grade of resin: kinematic viscosity (25°C/77°F) – 250 to 350 cps, density (25°C/77°F) – 1.109 to 1.111 g/cm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021998311429880">3</xref></sup>,thixotropic index –1.10 to 1.80 and shelf-life (25°C/77°F) – 4 months.</p>
<p>Curaua fiber was supplied by Embrapa of the Amazon (Brazilian Enterprise of Agronomy Research). Mats of continuous fibers were manufactured manually. First, the fibers were cut to a length of exactly 65 cm, separated into strands, and weighed. The approximate weight of each strand was 1.2 g, corresponding to 0.9 dtex. The strands were aligned and fixed with adhesive tape to form a mat of continuous fibers (184.6 g/m<sup>2</sup>) with 65 cm in width and 95 cm in length. Curaua fiber characteristics and properties can be found elsewhere.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0021998311429880">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0021998311429880">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>The composite was manufactured by local industry using the hand lay-up technique. It is composed of four glass-E fibers layers alternating with three layers of continuous curaua fibers (configuration is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0021998311429880">Figure 1</xref>). It is worth noting that the composite has symmetry in layer distribution. Thus, interlaminar stresses are uniformly distributed through specimen thickness during mechanical tests.
<fig id="fig1-0021998311429880" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Configuration of the hybrid composite.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0021998311429880-fig1.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The final dimensions of the plate were 95 × 65 × 0.56 cm<sup>3</sup>. The external layers consist of glass-E fibers, facilitating the lamination process and guaranteeing more uniform thickness.</p>
<p>A nonhybrid composite (60 × 30 × 0.67 cm<sup>3</sup>) with seven layers of glass-E fibers mats (450 g/m<sup>2</sup>) was also manufactured using the same technique and resin. This composite, called glassfiber composite, was used for comparative study.</p>
<p>The specimens for all tests were cut from laminated plates. Sides were sanded and polished using common metallography techniques. This procedure eliminates any damage from the cutting process and allows the specimens to be analyzed later using both microscopies (optical and SEM). This analysis covers microstructure before and after accelerated aging and fracture characteristics.</p>
<p>Half of the specimens were conditioned in an accelerated aging chamber and the other half were reserved for comparative testing. The chamber was built specifically for this study, following ASTM G53 recommendations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021998311429880">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>The specimens were exposed to the combined effects of humidity and ultraviolet radiation: 18 h of UV rays (lamps emitting UVA) and 6 h of steam-heated water (95% relative humidity) in alternate and independent cycles until reaching 2016 h (84 days). This corresponds to 1512 h of UV rays and 504 h of steam-heated water. Only one face of the specimen is exposed to UV radiation and steam-heated water. This whole procedure is established in standard ASTM G53.</p>
<p>The temperature inside the chamber was 60 ± 3°C during the UV radiation cycle and 61 ± 5°C during the water steam cycle. The outside temperature was 29°C. All specimens were removed from the chamber weekly to perform measurements of mass loss on a precision balance. The effect of that removal on mass loss is negligible.</p>
<p>Tensile and three-point bending tests were carried out for aged and original specimens. After aging time was completed (84 days) specimens were removed from the chamber and carefully sealed in a plastic bag to retain the moisture absorbed. Tests were carried out at room temperature according to ASTM D3039<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0021998311429880">12</xref></sup> and ASTM D790,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0021998311429880">13</xref></sup> respectively. A minimum of eight specimens was tested for each condition.</p>
<p>The density and constituent content of the composites were determined according to ASTM D792<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0021998311429880">14</xref></sup> and ASTM D3171.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0021998311429880">15</xref></sup></p>

<p>The density and constituent content of the composites are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0021998311429880">Table 1</xref>. As expected, hybrid compositedensity is lower than that of the glassfiber composite due to the lower density of the curaua fiber (1.2 g/cm<sup>3</sup> for curaua fiber versus 2.6 g/cm<sup>3</sup> for glass fiber).

<p>Constituent content was determined by a burning test. The low volume of glass fiber for both composites is in agreement with the manual lamination process. In the burning test both resin and curaua fibers are burned and only the glass fibers remain. Thus, it is not possible to determine the volume fraction of the matrix, curaua fibers, and voids of the hybrid composite.</p>

<p>Mass loss of the composite during accelerated aging is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0021998311429880">Figure 2</xref>. The calculation was carried out using the following equation:
<disp-formula id="disp-formula1-0021998311429880"><label>(1)</label><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0021998311429880-eq1.tif"/></disp-formula>

<p>Where Ma is the mass of the specimen (g) and Ms is the mass of the dry specimen (g).</p>
<p>The hybrid composite had greater mass loss mainly due to accentuated degradation of the curaua fibers as well as polymeric matrix degradation. For both composites it was observed that some glass fibers were taken out of the surface and directly exposed to UV degradation, forming small depressions, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0021998311429880">Figure 3</xref>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0021998311429880">Figure 3</xref>(a) shows mass loss characterized by depressions, indicating resin degradation and fiber loss (optical microscopy). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0021998311429880">Figure 3</xref>(b) illustrates the phenomenon of resin loss observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM).

<p>The effect of accelerated aging on composite microstructures was similar for both composites (glassfiber and hybrid). In process is observed the resin degradation in the outer layer of the glass fiber exposing some fibers.</p>

<sec id="sec6-0021998311429880"><title>Accelerated aging effect on composite microstructures</title>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0021998311429880">Figure 4</xref> shows an internal layer of the hybrid composite with degradation aspects in both the resin and curaua fiber; the glass fiber was not affected.
<fig id="fig4-0021998311429880" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>Internal layer degradation of the hybrid composite after aging.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0021998311429880-fig4.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The degradation effect is more intense on the surface directly exposed to radiation and decreases towards the internal layers. Since the curaua fiber layers are internal, they are more protected from the radiation effects but still show evidence of damage.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that degradation results from both UV radiation and humidity. In this case, humidity is represented by steam-heated water. The greatest humidity effect is on the fiber/matrix interface. As the radiation and steam-heated water cycles are alternate and independent, the composite continually suffers from adsorption/desorption cycles, causing matrix shrinkage and degradation of the fiber/matrix interface. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0021998311429880">Figure 5</xref> shows an external layer of the hybrid composite in which degraded interfaces can be observed.

<p>Stress–Strain curves for both composites in the original condition are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0021998311429880">Figure 6</xref>. In general, the curves exhibited quasi-linear behavior up to fracture. This is typical of composites with thermoset matrices and synthetic fibers, such as glass/epoxy. In fact, the behavior is close to matrix due to its high volume fraction.

<p>Tensile mechanical properties are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0021998311429880">Table 2</xref>. The values in parentheses represent deviations (median absolute deviation). Hybrid composite properties were very close to those of the glassfiber composite. There was a decrease of 1.85% in tensile strength, an increase of 5.57% in Young’s modulus, and a decrease of 7.96% in elongation. This result is considered excellent since glass-E fibers were partially replaced by natural fibers with inferior mechanical properties. This behavior is also related to the use of natural fibers oriented to loading direction. In this situation, the load transfer matrix/fiber is maximized.

<p>The decrease in tensile strength is mainly related to matrix degradation on the external layers of the composite since glass fibers are relatively inert.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0021998311429880">16</xref></sup> It is important to note that some fibers protruding from the surface (on the face directly exposed to UV) lose their reinforcement function. The increase in Young’s modulus and decrease in elongation are due to matrix brittleness after UV exposure.</p>
<p>According to Rabek<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0021998311429880">17</xref></sup> and Kumar et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0021998311429880">18</xref></sup> UV radiation leads to excessive matrix brittleness in an irreversible way, through chain crosslinking that can result in microcracking, but will also increase tensile strength. Chain scission can also occur so that the molecular weight and strength of the polymer are diminished. Thus, load-bearing capacity as well as long-term durability are affected.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0021998311429880">Table 3</xref> shows that aging was more harmful to the hybrid composite, mainly to tensile strength, which showed a reduction of 22.4%. The accelerated aging effects reached the internal curaua fiber layers, which are highly sensitive to UV radiation and moisture, primarily to moisture (natural fibers are naturally hydrophilic). Therefore, the largest reduction in tensile strength is likely related to curaua fiber degradation resulting from absorbed humidity. Young’s modulus of the hybrid composite did not show a relevant change. In this case the increased stiffness caused by matrix brittleness was probably compensated by curaua fiber degradation.</p>
<p>The hybrid composite configuration played a fundamental role in degradation resistance. Natural fiber layers are internal and relatively protected from direct environmental action. Otherwise, degradation effects would be much worse.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0021998311429880">Figure 7</xref>(a) and (b) shows two original composite specimens after the tensile test. The final fracture was quite localized, meaning that the specimen did not show evidence of aging in areas that are distant from the fracture. The fracture is flat (in a macroscopic way) and interlayer delamination was not observed.

<p>These characteristics are very important in composite assessment, as they display good adherence between the layers of glass and curaua fibers, despite the strong mismatch (in mechanical and physical properties) between them. This is directly related to interlaminar stress distribution (between layers), which depends on composite configuration. Similar behavior was observed for glassfiber composites. This was not surprising because it is composed only of fiber glass mats.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0021998311429880">Figure 8</xref> shows two broken aged composite specimens. As observed in the original composites, the final fracture was quite localized and interlayer delamination was not observed. It is worth pointing out that glass fibers are evident because of intense matrix degradation, since this surface was exposed to radiation.

<p>The specimens of the aged glassfiber composite showed transverse cracks in the matrix (perpendicular to loading direction) along its entire length. These cracks, typical of tensile tests,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0021998311429880">19</xref></sup> increase in number as the test progresses.

Microcracks are observed perpendicular to the loading direction. In this case, cracks propagate through the curaua/matrix interface not breaking the curaua fiber. Fiber/matrix debonding is also observed.

<p>Stress–Deflection curves for both composites in the original condition are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0021998311429880">Figure 11</xref>. In the case of the hybrid composite, curaua fibers are oriented perpendicular to the direction of load application, i.e., along the length of the specimen. As observed in the tensile test, the curves exhibited quasilinear behavior up to fracture. Thus, the addition of natural fibers caused no significant behavior change in the glassfiber composite. It should be noted that the elastic modulus in bending was calculated by taking the values up to 50% of maximum stress, to prevent damage from influencing measurements.

<p>The comparative analysis of the mechanical properties of the composites is presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0021998311429880">Table 4</xref>. The values in parentheses represent deviations (median absolute deviation). As in the tensile test, the deviations are considered low, especially for the hybrid composite. In the latter, there is a wide discrepancy between the mechanical properties of the glass fiber and the curaua fiber. This may induce high interlaminar stresses, which influences the final behavior of the composite.

<p>As verified in the tensile test, hybrid composite performance was close to that of the glassfiber composite. There was a reduction in flexural strength (5.6%), an increase in elastic bending modulus (8.6%), and a reduction in maximum deflection (16.7%). In the cases of flexural bending strength and elastic bending modulus the percentage difference is within the standard deviation.</p>
<p>The data presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0021998311429880">Table 4</xref> show the good performance of the hybrid composite compared to the glassfiber composite. This behavior is due mainly to layer distribution in the laminate.</p>
<p>In the three-point bending tests for the aged composites, test specimens were placed so that the layer pulled on in the test (origin of the bending fracture) was precisely the layer exposed to aging, thereby showing the effect of aging on the bending properties of both composites.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0021998311429880">Table 5</xref> shows that aging was harmful to the hybrid composite, evidenced by a reduction in all properties. In the case of elastic bending modulus, the reduction was small (−6.7%) and within the deviation range. As for the glassfiber composite aging caused an increase in flexural strength and in the elastic modulus in bending with reduced elongation (especially the increase of approximately 20% in flexural strength).</p>
<p>As previously mentioned, aging by UV rays causes embrittlement of the matrix, which results in an increase in rigidity and, consequently, in the elastic modulus of the composite. This is observed in the case of the glassfiber composite, showing an increase in the elastic modulus after aging. As for the hybrid composite, increased matrix stiffness was counterbalanced by degradation of the natural fiber, resulting in a slight decrease in the elastic modulus. A similar analysis can be made for flexural strength. After aging there was an increase in this property for the glassfiber composite and a small reduction for the hybrid composite.</p>
<p>In flexural loading the external layers of the laminate are essential in composite behavior. Their influence is greater in the elastic modulus, which is measured at low loading levels (up to 50% of maximum stress) before the onset and spread of damage. For this reason glass fiber mats in the external layers of the hybrid composite was used. Besides ensuring better mechanical performance for the laminate, glass fibers are relatively inert to the effects of degradation (although the matrix is not).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0021998311429880">Table 5</xref> shows that the elastic modulus experienced less influence from aging than flexural strength in both composites. In the case of the hybrid composite, the external layers of the glass fiber act as a ‘chemical barrier’ protecting the inner layers of curaua fibers from the effects of UV rays and humidity.</p>
<p>Comparing the two loading types, tensile and bending, it can be concluded that the effects of aging for both composites was lower in bending loading compared to tensile loading. As previously mentioned, this is due to the effect of the external layers of bending loading.</p>
<p>At this point in the discussion, it is clear that analysis of the effects of degradation on the composites is extremely complex when dealing with the simultaneous actions of multiple factors (UV radiation, humidity, and high temperature). Furthermore, the effect of degradation also depends on loading type. It is practically impossible to separate the role of each event in the final response of the composite, but some explanations may be obtained by separately understanding each adversity factor. In this sense, a detailed study of the fracture is very useful for clarifying doubts. In this analysis, some conclusions could only be drawn from this study.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-0021998311429880">Figure 12</xref> shows two original test specimens (hybrid and glassfiber composites) after the bending test. The fracture was quite localized in both composites and interlayer delamination was not observed in either specimen. This denotes good adhesion between layers in spite of, in the case of the hybrid composite, there being a marked discrepancy between the mechanical properties of the glass and curaua fibers.

<p>It was observed that the cracks initiate on the tractive face of the test specimen and spread inwards in the direction of the neutral line, characterizing a typical three-point bending fracture.

<sec id="sec11-0021998311429880" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The mass loss of the hybrid composite was higher than that of the glassfiber composite, mainly due to curaua fiber degradation.</p>
<p>In their original condition both hybrid and glassfiber composites showed similar mechanical tensile and bending behavior.</p>
<p>For the glassfiber composite, aging led to an increase only in the elastic modulus, and decreases in strength and elongation for uniaxial tensile loading. With respect to three-point bending loading, aging caused an increase in both strength and the elastic modulus and a decrease in elongation.</p>
<p>For the hybrid composite aging resulted in a reduction in all properties (regardless of loading type), but in the case of the elastic modulus, the reduction was small and fell within the deviation range.</p>
<p>It is believed that this behavior is generally related to matrix weakening due to aging, which results in increased matrix rigidity, and consequently, of the composite. In the case of the hybrid composite, increased matrix stiffness is offset by degradation of the natural fiber which, being organic, is subject to the effects of UV radiation, humidity, and temperature.</p>
<p>Comparing the two loading types (tensile and bending), it can be concluded that the effect of aging for both composites was lower in bending loading than in tensile loading. This occurred due to the effect of the external layers of bending loading.</p>
<p>Fracture analysis, for both loadings and composites, displays a strong matrix degradation process in the layer exposed to aging, directly influencing the quality of the fiber/matrix interface, and consequently, mechanical behavior.</p>
