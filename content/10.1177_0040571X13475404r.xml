<p>There are many excellent explorations of the nature of vocation and priesthood currently available but few ask about the lived experience of decision making that makes the ‘call’ a reality. Discerning what the faithful response is as one offers oneself for ministry will happen repeatedly, from questions about curacy through to the shape of retirement. <italic>Called to Love</italic> reveals Tomkinson’s long acquaintance with transition in ministry in both his own life and in the lives of those to whom he has ministered. He is currently chaplain at Ripon College, Cuddesdon, an Anglican theological college. Drawing on this lived wisdom of responding to God, Tomkinson seeks to help the reader grow in awareness of their own decision-making processes.</p>
<p>The initial chapters offer a very pastoral exploration of what the period before a transition in, or towards, ministry may feel like: the overarching character is of restlessness. Tomkinson then offers a range of models for decision making from the business world. Aware that some may think that a spiritual issue should have its own spiritual discernment process, he vindicates a faith-informed use of such models. His critique of the models of decision making is at its most powerful when he pushes questions back at the reader, to encourage us to probe what models we already employ. In addition to these tools, Tomkinson also uses fictional and real case-studies, research drawn from the experience of a group of Cuddesdon students as they undergo curacy and post-curacy placing, and meditative readings of apposite biblical passages.</p>
<p>The hub of this book is Chapter 7, ‘Discerned decision making governed by love’. It opens with a passage of praise to God, who moves ceaselessly towards us in love. This is the foundation of any call to ministry; ‘The love of God <italic>for</italic> us calls for a response <italic>from</italic> us’ (p. 124). Whatever expression a ministry takes it is founded on that primary relationship of love. Following from this basis of love comes Tomkinson’s own, figure-of-eight, model of discerned decision making. It encompasses both the individual, inner wrestling and the outer deliberations that are shared by family and Church representatives. It could be a valuable basis for conversation with those going through their own times of transition. The chapter closes with a question that Tomkinson must have heard many times as chaplain, ‘Does God have a blue-print for my life?’ His answer is sagely imaginative; that there is instead an ‘imprint’ of love to be worked out.</p>
<p><italic>Called to Love</italic> is a rich reminder of the source of all ministry: a vision given by God and a call to respond to God’s love. Any response will have its cost but Tomkinson rightly points out that a ‘right’ ministry will also be life-giving, for the minister as well as her people. This is a seasonable message at a time when stretched resources, and decreasing numbers of Anglican clergy due to retirement, place great pressure on clergy appointments and on the task of ministry itself. It will resource those facing ordination and those around them in the first instance, but also any facing ministerial transition.</p>
