<abstract>
<p>An evolvement of surface physicochemical structure in the process of electrochemical oxidation and sizing treatment was monitored by scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. An effect of this evolvement on the properties of carbon fiber/epoxy composites was also researched. The results showed that the root mean square roughness increased from 4.6 nm for untreated fibers to 9.1 nm for surface-treated fibers, and the root mean square value of sized fibers decreased to 8.5 nm. The relative contents of oxygen and nitrogen atomic on carbon fiber surface increased obviously after electrochemical oxidation. Oxygen atomic concentration took a further improvement after sizing treatment and only hydroxyl functional group was found on its surface. The interfacial strength between carbon fiber and the resin matrix improved after surface electrochemical oxidation and sizing, and the mechanical interlock was considered to be the governing factor in fiber/resin adhesion of carbon fiber/epoxy composites.</p>

<p>Polyacrylonitrile (PAN)-based carbon fibers (CFs) have been widely used as reinforcements in both thermoset and thermoplastic matrix composites owing to their low density and high strength and modulus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0731684412449895">1</xref></sup> In CFs reinforced composites, the interfacial property between reinforcing fibers and polymeric matrices is the prominent factor for the composites to obtain optimum mechanical properties.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0731684412449895">2</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0731684412449895">4</xref></sup> Unfortunately, the surface of PAN-based CFs becomes inert after high-temperature carbonization which also leads to a weak interfacial interaction between CFs and the matrix. To overcome this problem, surface treatment becomes a necessary step in the production of CFs. Oxygen-containing functional groups can be introduced onto the fiber surface through surface treatment and surface roughness and polarity can also increase. The interfacial bond between CF and the matrix therefore is extensively improved.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0731684412449895">5</xref></sup> Typical surface treatment methods consist of liquid-phase chemical oxidation,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0731684412449895">6</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0731684412449895">10</xref></sup> electrochemical anodic oxidation,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0731684412449895">11</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0731684412449895">16</xref></sup> plasma treatment,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0731684412449895">17</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0731684412449895">19</xref></sup> electrodeposition treatment,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0731684412449895">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0731684412449895">21</xref></sup> and so on. Electrochemical anodic oxidation treatment has its predominance over other methods, because its treating process is relatively mild and it is easy to control. The electrolyte solutions used for electrochemical oxidation are mainly divided into acid solution, alkaline solution, and ammonium salt solution, and ammonium salts are usually chosen as the electrolytes.</p>
<p>Surface-treated CFs are usually sized immediately in order to protect the oxygen-containing functional groups introduced in the process of surface treatment. Sizing process can also prevent friction damage to the CF surface during fabrication. Sizing has an adhesion and wetting promotion function, thus an optimal sizing process could also improve the fiber-matrix interaction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0731684412449895">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0731684412449895">23</xref></sup></p>

Surface topography and surface chemistry changes of PAN-based CFs in the whole process will be monitored by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Finally, an effect of physicochemical structure evolvement on the properties of carbon fiber/epoxy (CF/EP) composites is also researched.</p></sec>

<p>PAN-based CF samples researched in this study were manufactured in our own laboratory. There were 6000 filaments in per tow. The samples without any treatment were used as received (SU CF). The electrolyte NH<sub>4</sub>HCO<sub>3</sub> was of analytical purity which was purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. (Shanghai, China). WSR6101 (E-44) model epoxy resin was supplied by Wuxi Resin Factory of Bluestar New Chemical Materials Co. (Wuxi, China). The curing agent triethylenetetramine was of analytical purity and was also purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec4-0731684412449895"><title>Electrochemical oxidation and sizing treatment</title>
<p>Surface electrochemical oxidation of PAN-based CFs was carried out with a laboratory set-up. It was composed of a surface treatment bath, washing bath, and drying oven. The length of the electrolytic treatment bath was 1.5 m and 7.5 wt%NH<sub>4</sub>HCO<sub>3</sub> solution was used as the electrolyte. The electric current density was fixed at 0.3 A/m<sup>2</sup>. After electrochemical oxidation, CFs were washed with deionized water in the washing bath in order to remove adsorbed electrolyte, and then they were dried in an oven at 110°C. Surface treated samples (ST CF) were obtained out of the drying oven.</p>
<p>To prevent any damage to the oxidized fiber surface, continuous fibers were sized in the sizing bath after surface treatment. The final content of sizing agents on the surface was controlled around 1.1 wt% of total carbon-fiber weight. There was also a drying process after the sizing bath and then sized samples (STS CF) were picked up.</p></sec>

<p>Scanning electron micrographs of SU, ST, and STS CFs were collected on the Quanta FEG250 model microscope with an acceleration voltage of 5 kV and the magnification was 40,000 times. The CF samples were secured on a metal mount by conducting tape, and then they were coated with gold prior to examination.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec7-0731684412449895"><title>AFM analysis</title>
<p>Dimension3100V atomic force microscope operated in the tapping mode was utilized to analyze surface roughness changes of SU, ST, and STS CFs. In the experiment, one single filament of CFs was fixed on a glassy board using double-sided tape and it was detected by a silicon nitride probe. The received images were in a 500 nm × 500 nm area with its height of 100 nm.</p></sec>

<p>Surface chemical components of SU, ST, and STS CFs were analyzed by AXIS UTLTRADLD X-ray photoelectron spectrometer using Mg Kα X-ray as the source. The emission current was 30 mA and the voltage was 15 kV. Curve fitting was carried out using a non-linear least squares fitting program with a Gaussian/Lorentzian sum function. The carbon 1s electron binding energy corresponding to graphitic carbon was referenced at 284.6 eV for calibration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0731684412449895">3</xref></sup></p></sec></sec>

<p>The matrix resin is a mixture of bisphenol-A (E-44) epoxy resin and triethylenetetramine in the weight ratio of 10:1. SU, ST, and STS CFs were unidirectionally impregnated with the matrix resin, and then they were taken into a special mold to solidify for 2 h at 120°C. The debonding strength of CF/EP composites was evaluated from the interlaminar shear strength (ILSS) using the short beam method.</p></sec></sec>

It could be observed that there were very clear longitudinal ridges and grooves along the surface of SU CF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0731684412449895">Figure 1</xref>(a)). This morphological structure was inherited from PAN-precursors which were used as raw material for CF production. Some impurities also turned up on its surface which might be absorbed in the fiber manufacturing process.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0731684412449895">26</xref></sup> The surface of ST CF became much cleaner after electrochemical oxidation, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0731684412449895">Figure1(b)</xref>, which indicated that foreign contamination on the surface could be removed in surface treatment. At the same time, the whole surface seemed to be rougher than SU CF surface. On the surface of STS CF, longitudinal ridges and striations turned to be less well-defined because the surface had been already covered by certain contents of sizing agents, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0731684412449895">Figure 1</xref>(c).

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0731684412449895">Figure 2</xref> shows the morphological structure changes of SU, ST, and STS CF surfaces monitored by AFM. Obvious striation structure existed on the surface of SU CF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0731684412449895">Figure 2</xref>(a)), and slight particles could also be found on the surface which proved the existence of foreign impurities. ST CF displayed a cleaner surface as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0731684412449895">Figure 2</xref>(b). The striations on its surface became much clearer and deeper, and the surface got much rougher than that of SU CF. Thus, electrochemical oxidation treatment led to a rougher surface structure, and it could be resulted from the electrochemical etching in the surface treatment. When ST CF suffered from sizing process, individual filament could be uniformly covered by sizing agents, thereby the longitudinal grooves on the surface of STS CF diminished (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0731684412449895">Figure 2</xref>(c)). This observation was in agreement with that of Dilsiz and Wightman.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0731684412449895">22</xref></sup>

RMS means the root mean square deviation of the roughness curve profile and Ra is the arithmetic mean of the absolute values of the roughness curve relative to the center line. The higher RMS and Ra values are, the rougher the surface is. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0731684412449895">Table 1</xref>, the RMS value of SU CF was only 4.6 nm and a significant increase took place on that of ST CF surface which was up to 9.1 nm. However, the RMS value of STS CF decreased to 8.5 nm. Results indicated that surface treatment could extensively increase the surface roughness, and sizing process made the oxidized fiber surface less rough.

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0731684412449895">Figure 3</xref> summarizes the chemical element changes on the surface of SU, ST, and STS CFs. All the three kinds of fiber surface were composed of carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, and silicon. In addition, trace amounts of sodium was found on the surface of ST CF. However, there were great differences in the composition percentages of SU, ST, and STS CFs. On the surface of SU CF, carbon element was the dominant component and the percentage of carbon atomic concentration was as high as 94.05%. The concentrations of oxygen and nitrogen elements were relative low, which were, respectively, only 1.72% and 2.47%. A small quantity of silicon element could be attributed to the contamination of silicone oil in the oiling process of PAN-precursor production.

<p>From a comparison of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0731684412449895">Figure 3</xref>(a)-(b), it appeared that a significant increase of oxygen atomic concentration happened on the surface of ST CF and a large decrease of carbon atomic concentration could also be observed on its surface. It is well known that electrochemical oxidation could result in the formation of oxygen-containing functional groups on the surface,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0731684412449895">11</xref></sup> and the typical step-wise oxidative progress is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0731684412449895">Scheme 1</xref>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0731684412449895">3</xref></sup> Nitrogen atomic concentration had a slight elevation from 2.47% to 3.77%, which was possibly stemmed from the nitrogen element adsorption from ammonium salt. There was also trace amounts of sodium detected on ST CF surface. Outer weakly-bonded layer could be eliminated from the surface in the process of surface treatment which made inner sodium element easy to be detected. The decrease of silicon element content from 1.76% to 1.36% could also possibly have a correlation with the removal of outer irregular layer. The decrease of silicon element showed that surface treatment could get rid of silicon contamination which has not been mentioned in other research, and it also indicated that silicon element was mainly stayed on the external layer.</p>
<p>The oxygen element had a further increase to 13.55% on the surface of STS CF, while the percentages of nitrogen, carbon, and silicon elements decreased. This change could possibly result from the appearance of sizing agents on the surface, because the main components of sizing agents were carbon and oxygen elements. The existence of nitrogen and silicon elements indicated that the thickness of the sizing agents was less than the detective depth of XPS analysis. It could be also confirmed that the thickness of the sizing agents was several nanometers and this point was in agreement with that of Oyama and Whightman.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0731684412449895">5</xref></sup> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0731684412449895">Figure 4</xref> shows the changes in O1s/C1s and N1s/C1s atomic ratios of SU, ST, and STS CFs. In the process of electrochemical oxidation and sizing, the O1s/C1s value increased obviously from 0.018 to 0.161. The N1s/C1s value increased after surface treatment, but it had a sharp decrease after sizing.

<p>Only C-OH group was detected on the surface of STS CF, and its percentage was 32.45%, which was approximately twice as high as that of SU CF. That is because a certain thickness of sizing agents appeared on the surface of STS CF after sizing process, and the XPS results of STS CF partly represented the chemical composition of the sizing agents. The disappearance of −C=O and −COO groups on ST CF surface after sizing process could possibly form a chemical bond with the functional groups of sizing agents. On the surface of STS CF, the B.E. position of -C-OH group shifted from 285.6 eV to 286.3 eV under the influence of sizing agents.</p></sec>

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0731684412449895">Figure 6</xref> shows the ILSS values of composites reinforced by SU, ST, and STS CFs. The ILSS values of surface-treated CF composites and sized CF composites are, respectively, 92.6 MPa and 88.3 MPa, which are much higher than that of untreated CF composites. The reason for this improvement has been always a controversial subject. Some people believe that there is no direct connection between improved mechanical interlock and the increase in the shear strength value of the composites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0731684412449895">27</xref></sup> and the acidic groups especially carboxylic are responsible for strong interactions with a polymer matrix,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0731684412449895">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0731684412449895">29</xref></sup> while others argue that there is no correlation between chemical functional groups and the fiber/resin interfacial strength.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0731684412449895">2</xref></sup> In our paper, the mechanical interlock was considered to be the governing factor in fiber/resin adhesion. From a comparison of SU CF and ST CF, the contents of acidic groups (−C=O, −COO) on the surface were almost similar with each other, but the surface roughness of ST CF (9.1 nm) was much higher than that of SU CF (4.6 nm). The final ILSS value of ST CF composites increased by 50%, which proved the importance of mechanical interlock in fiber/resin adhesion and it was the governing factor in interfacial strength of CF/EP composites. Although the contents of acidic groups (−C=O, −COO) on the surface of STS CF was less than that of SU CF, the surface roughness of STS CF (8.5 nm) was also much higher than that of SU CF. The ILSS of STS CF composites higher than that of SU CF composites validated above-mentioned conclusion. In addition, great changes happened on the contents of hydroxyl groups in the process of electrochemical oxidation and sizing and it was found to be not essential to increasing interfacial strength of CF/EP composites.</p>
<p>The vertical-section and cross-section morphological structures of CF/EP composites after interlaminar shear damage are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0731684412449895">Figure 7</xref>. It could be observed that the interfacial adhesion between SU CF and epoxy resin matrix was really weak, and the resin matrix fell into pieces after interlaminar shear damage in the vertical section (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0731684412449895">Figure 7</xref>(a)). The mechanical interlock between reinforcing CFs and the matrix broke up along the cross-section of SU CF composites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0731684412449895">Figure 7</xref>(b)). In STS CF composites, the interfacial adhesion was improved because of an improvement in mechanical interlock and there was still a good bonding between STS CFs and the matrix even after suffering from foreign mechanical damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0731684412449895">Figure 7</xref>(c) and (d)).

<p>Surface physicochemical structure changes in the continuous process of electrochemical anodic oxidation and sizing were studied. Results showed that some impurities on untreated CF surface could be eliminated in surface treatment. The longitudinal grooves on fiber surfaces became more pronounced after surface treatment and less well-defined after sizing process. Surface treatment could increase surface roughness from 4.6 nm to 9.1 nm, whereas sizing process could decrease the roughness to 8.5 nm. Oxygen and nitrogen atomic concentrations increased on the fiber surface after electrochemical oxidation treatment and oxygen-containing functional groups such as hydroxyls, carbonyls, and carboxyls were introduced onto the surface. For the sized carbon fiber, oxygen atomic concentration took a further increase and only hydroxyls functional groups were found on its surface. The interfacial strength between CF and the resin matrix improved after surface electrochemical oxidation and sizing treatment. The ILSS values of surface-treated CF composites and sized CF composites were, respectively, 92.6 MPa and 88.3 MPa, which were much higher than that of untreated CF composites. The mechanical interlock was the governing factor in fiber/resin adhesion of CF/EP composites.</p></sec></sec>
