<abstract>
<p>Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common, well-defined, developmental disorder with a recognized genetic-neurologic basis. Studies report pathogenic involvement of the dopaminergic and serotonergic pathways. Its presentation in the preschool years is variable and can be mistaken for other common behavioral and developmental problems. The aim of this work is to propose an interactive “triangular model” based on the temperamental-genetic, emotional-behavioral, and developmental-genetic pathways of ADHD to explain the evolution of the clinical picture and serve as a guide to appropriate management, particularly in the preschool years. The model can also be used in parental counseling. This article describes 3 illustrative cases of preschool children with hyperactive and inattentive behaviors who were diagnosed with ADHD by standardized developmental and psychological batteries and followed at 2 child developmental centers. By applying the model, treatment could be targeted at the predominant area of difficulty for each child.</p>

<body>
<p>ADHD is a well-defined disorder affecting up to 10% of school-aged children. It is generally described as a neurobiological disorder with a genetic component and environmental influences. At present, the diagnosis is based solely on clinical criteria. The true age of onset of ADHD remains unclear. According to the criteria of <italic>The</italic>
<italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</italic> (4th ed., text revised) (DSM-IV-TR),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0883073811420151">1</xref></sup> ADHD begins before age 7 years<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0883073811420151">2</xref></sup> or age 6 years (older versions).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0883073811420151">2</xref></sup> However, must studies included only school-aged children, and there are few descriptions of the diagnosis, course, and treatment of the disorder in the preschool years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0883073811420151">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0883073811420151">4</xref></sup> The recent psychological literature shows that the appearance of ADHD at school age is associated with disturbances already in the preschool age in 3 main constitutional-environmental areas: temperament, child-caregiver interaction, and cognitive functioning.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0883073811420151">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0883073811420151">6</xref></sup> The disturbances are presumed to directly affect the early development of executive competence and self-regulation, which can ultimately lead to impulsivity and inattention.</p>
<p>The clinical observations are in line with neurobiological studies, indicating that ADHD involves a disruption in dopaminergic and probably serotonergic mechanisms, as well as noradrenergic pathways, in the central nervous system. The findings point to a pathogenic role of specific areas of the brain in ADHD, namely, the prefrontal cortex, limbic area, corpus striatum, and cerebellum. Barkley<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0883073811420151">7</xref></sup> observed that neurotransmitter function in these areas leads to the inhibition of executive brain functions. However, because imaging studies (eg, single photon emission computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging) are usually performed in school-aged children, they may not reflect brain changes that occur at an earlier age. Thus, it is difficult to know if the findings described precede the clinical manifestations or are a result of the ADHD behaviors themselves. Some authors have suggested that given the 0.7 to 0.8 correlation of ADHD with genetic factors,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0883073811420151">8</xref></sup> the temperamental traits may themselves be a genetic presentation of ADHD. Negative infantile behaviors have indeed correlated with some of the genetic polymorphisms linked with ADHD, such as those at the dopamine receptor site.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0883073811420151">9</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>The present work is based on clinical cases seen at child developmental centers in the community and a search of the literature. The aim of this report was to propose a “triangular model” of ADHD intended to provide further understanding of the evolving clinical picture of ADHD and to assist clinicians in its diagnosis and treatment, particularly in preschool children. The 3 bases of the model were derived from the early constitutional-environmental risk factors of ADHD described above<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0883073811420151">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0883073811420151">6</xref></sup> and include emotional-behavioral problems, cognitive-learning problems, and attention-related/temperamental problems. By assessing the interplay of these 3 domains, therapists will be better able to identify the predominant dysfunctional area in the individual child and thereby offer accurate, targeted early management. Three illustrative cases are presented, followed by a detailed discussion of application of the model.</p>
<sec id="section1-0883073811420151">
<title>Case Studies</title>
<p>The cases described were referred to multidisciplinary child development centers affiliated with 2 tertiary medical centers over a period of 4 years (2007-2010). Assessments were performed using standard developmental tests, and treatment was administered by health professionals as deemed necessary.</p>
<sec id="section2-0883073811420151">
<title>Patient 1</title>
<p>This 5-year-6-month-old boy was referred to the child development center because of difficulties in several levels of functioning: delay in language and fine motor skills; emotional and behavioral problems; and difficulty concentrating in kindergarten. His parents reported that he had attended nursery school for an extra year and was currently receiving speech therapy.</p>
<p>The medical and developmental histories were unremarkable, and all milestones were achieved on time. Family history revealed that the parents had been separated for most of the past 2 years. One 15-year-old brother was diagnosed with ADHD and had received stimulant medication in the past.</p>
<p>Findings on physical and neurologic examinations were within normal limits. Results of electroencephalographic studies and laboratory workup (including blood count, blood chemistry, and thyroid-stimulating hormone levels) were negative or normal. During the developmental examination, the child remained very quiet and avoided verbal communication with the examiner; therefore, only a partial assessment was obtained. He often seemed to be “in his own world,” although he responded (after some prodding) to his name and to requests to perform basic tasks. Eye contact was normal. Interview with the Pediatric Examination of Educational Readiness<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0883073811420151">10</xref></sup> revealed a development and intellectual level of 1 to 1.5 years below his age norm (developmental quotient = 75-80), in addition to emotional and behavioral difficulties. On the Conners’ Parent and Teaching Rating Scale–Revised,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0883073811420151">11</xref></sup> the T score was higher than 65 (clinically significant) for all areas except psychosomatic function. The child fulfilled 6 of the 9 DSM-IV criteria for inattention and 7 of the 9 criteria for hyperactive/impulsive behavior (Parent and Teacher Rating Scales).</p>
<p>The diagnosis was ADHD (preschool) with developmental language delays and developmental coordination disorders. Intelligence was defined as low-normal. The child was referred for psychological evaluation and for educational assessment and placement. In addition, his parents were referred to the social worker for support coaching and behavioral training. At that point, it was decided not to begin treatment with stimulant medication.</p>
<p>Psychological evaluation supported the findings of below-normal intelligence (IQ = 80)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0883073811420151">12</xref></sup> and low self-esteem, and parental inability to appreciate and cope with their child’s problems. The child was placed in a special education kindergarten where he received occupational and speech and language therapy. After the parents received initial training, they and the child participated in psychotherapy and play sessions with the psychologist. At the last evaluation, significant improvement was noted in the child’s self-esteem and in the ability of his parents to provide more emotional and behavioral support and acceptance of his behaviors. Conners’ scale scores for attention and behavior improved, although the boy was still functioning significantly below age level. Medication was withheld in view of the progress made.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0883073811420151">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0883073811420151">14</xref></sup>

<title>Patient 2</title>
<p>This 10-month-old girl was referred to the child developmental center because of behavior and sleeping difficulties. She would cry incessantly and had “temper tantrums” that included head banging and self-induced vomiting. The medical and developmental histories were unremarkable, and all milestones were achieved on time. The patient was an only child. Her mother had a history of learning disabilities and possibly attention problems that were never diagnosed.</p>
<p>On initial evaluation, findings on the Cognitive Adaptive Test/Clinical Linguistic and Auditory Milestone Scale, of the Capute Scales,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0883073811420151">15</xref></sup> revealed a normal developmental level with evidence of hypersensitivity to touch and sound, sleep problems, and difficulty in regulating emotions and temperament. Psychosocial and family evaluation showed that the mother lacked confidence and admitted to attachment difficulties with her child and to having “no idea” what to do with her.</p>
<p>The patient together with her parents were placed in a sensory integration training group.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0883073811420151">16</xref></sup> The parents were referred for psychosocial evaluation and parental training, but the mother attended only one session.</p>
<p>The child was lost to follow-up for the next 3 years, returning for care when she was 4.5 years old because the kindergarten teacher complained that she was not participating in scheduled activities, had difficulty “explaining herself,” and had difficulty maintaining attention. The mother reported that the child was unable to tell her about what she learned or heard during the day.</p>
<p>Findings on blood workup and on vision and audiometric testing were negative or normal. The physical and neurologic examinations revealed no abnormalities, except for height and weight over the 90th percentile. Psychosocial evaluation showed that the child had separation anxiety. A sensory profile<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0883073811420151">17</xref></sup> showed high tactile sensitivity. During the examination, the child was cooperative for the most part, but became fidgety, especially toward the end of the examination, when she got up and asked to leave the room. Her attention fluctuated, depending on the level of task difficulty. Her overall intelligence was in the normal range, with some problems in verbal expression and in following complex sentences,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0883073811420151">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0883073811420151">12</xref></sup> which may have been partly a consequence of her high distractibility.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0883073811420151">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0883073811420151">12</xref></sup> Response to the Conners’ Rating Scale revealed learning and attention problems (T = 70), with borderline impulsive/hyperactive behavior (T = 64; hyperactive index = 61) and some behavior problems (T = 54).</p>
<p>The child was referred to a speech therapist to improve her verbal expression and to an occupational therapist for sensory integration therapy (or sensory modulation training).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0883073811420151">16</xref></sup> We recommended that she receive assistance in the kindergarten and undergo further assessment by the psychosocial staff for possible behavioral intervention. When we found that she responded to the sensory treatment, we deferred medication.</p>

<sec id="section4-0883073811420151">
<title>Patient 3</title>
<p>A 4-year-10-month-old boy was referred to the child development clinic because of behavioral difficulties, including oppositional-defiant behavior and impulsivity. He was also aggressive to the point of physical assault on his peers and was having social difficulties. He had no developmental delays. There was a family history of behavior and attention problems. Connors questionnaires<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0883073811420151">11</xref></sup> revealed attention deficits, impulsivity-hyperactivity, and oppositional behavior, in addition to psychosomatic symptoms and some anxiety. Findings on developmental and physical/neurologic examinations were normal, aside from mild graphomotor and naming difficulty and some decrease in short-term memory.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0883073811420151">10</xref></sup> The diagnosis was mixed-type ADHD. The parents were referred for training, and the child was referred for psychological treatment with individualized attention in the kindergarten. After several months, however, the behaviors failed to improve. A trial of stimulant medication (methylphenidate, 5 mg) yielded a good behavioral response in all domains.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>All 3 cases described here demonstrate the relationship of a difficult temperament with incipient development of ADHD symptoms. Patient 2, in particular, presented with temper tantrums and head banging. Patient 1 presented mainly with cognitive-developmental difficulties with a significant emotional-behavioral component, as well as some family dysfunction, all of which had an adverse affect on his function and attention span. In patient 3, the attentional-temperamental influence was dominant, with a strong family history of apparent ADHD.</p>
<p>Patient 2 exhibited poor sensory regulation from an early age. Studies have shown that more than half of all preschool children who meet the <italic>DSM-IV</italic> criteria for disruptive disorder/ADHD (including disruptive behavior not otherwise specified, oppositional-defiant disorder, ADHD) have regulatory disorders,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0883073811420151">18</xref></sup> or using the alternative <italic>Diagnostic Classification of Mental Health and Developmental Disorders of Infancy and Childhood</italic> (<italic>DC 0-3</italic>),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0883073811420151">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0883073811420151">20</xref></sup> regulation disorders of sensory processing. Researchers have suggested that <italic>DC 0-3</italic> regulatory problems may be precursors of ADHD at a later age,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0883073811420151">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0883073811420151">22</xref></sup> although this is still controversial.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0883073811420151">21</xref></sup>

<title>Applying the Triangular Model</title>
<p>The triangular model can serve as a basis for evaluating ADHD and treatment planning. Importantly, it is applicable in preschool children, in addition to older ones. Children referred for behavioral and attention problems undergo a careful history and assessment of core symptoms and other medical and psychiatric conditions, with full medical workup, cognitive and behavioral testing, and psychosocial family evaluation. The findings are plotted on the ADHD triangle, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0883073811420151">Figure 1</xref>. If the patient has predominantly cognitive-developmental symptoms, like our patient 1, most of the treatment is targeted at these areas on the assumption that this will have the greatest impact on the overall ADHD symptomatology. Accordingly, we referred patient 1 for speech-language training and occupational therapy and recommended placement in a special-education kindergarten. However, if the symptoms fall predominantly in the emotional-behavioral domain, like in patients 2 and 3, parental training and behavioral (or cognitive-behavioral) treatment would be recommended. In these cases, it may also be necessary to refer the child for more complete psychiatric or family evaluation. In children with mainly temperamental-genetic-related symptoms (eg, a strong family history of ADHD and lack of other factors),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0883073811420151">5</xref></sup> like in patient 3, stimulant medication may be required at an earlier stage. It is noteworthy that the most recent and comprehensive efficacy studies of stimulant medication in preschoolers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0883073811420151">23</xref></sup> had a run-in of 10 weeks of parental training before beginning treatment. When 2 areas predominate or all 3 areas are equally strong, the approach must be multidisciplinary. We found that the model was also useful in explaining the child’s behaviors and prognosis to the parents during counseling.</p>

<title>Implications of the Model: Support for the Syndromic Nature of ADHD</title>
<p>Our model supports the genetic-environmental interaction theories of ADHD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0883073811420151">1</xref></sup> A recent study of preschool children diagnosed with ADHD found that compared with age-matched controls, the majority (about 75%) had significant coexisting deficits in at least one of 4 developmental domains: motor function (eye-hand coordination, balance, etc), visual-motor integration, expressive/receptive language functioning, and sensory modulation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0883073811420151">24</xref></sup> Forty-seven percent of the children had deficits in 2 or more domains. The authors suggested that preschool children with ADHD have multiple developmental deficits over and above the core symptoms of ADHD. Thus, it is possible that the differential diagnoses of ADHD are in fact disorders that are causally related to it. We suggest that ADHD should be viewed as a symptom complex representing a final common pathway of many neurologic, developmental, and psychiatric disorders.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0883073811420151">3</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>From ages 2 to 6 years, the nervous system is in a constant state of increasing myelinization and cortical synaptogenesis, which includes increased axial sprouting and lengthening. These processes are accompanied by a parallel process of “pruning,” in which the number of synapses is reduced on the basis of neural activity/use, partly in response to environmental factors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0883073811420151">25</xref></sup> The findings are in line with studies showing that the limbic area undergoes permanent changes following prolonged emotional deprivation from toddler age.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0883073811420151">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0883073811420151">27</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>We propose a feedback-loop-type mechanism underlying ADHD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0883073811420151">Figure 2</xref>) wherein recurring behaviors and environmental factors create synaptic disturbances in brain pathways, particularly the dopaminergic- and serotonergic-rich regions. As a result, executive functions mediated by these brain regions become impaired.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0883073811420151">7</xref></sup> The constant replay of disturbed regulation exacerbates the behavioral changes, and these, in turn, lead to negative responses and aggravate relationships, which exacerbate the behavioral changes still further while strengthening the modifications in the neurologic pathways. As the child grows older, the synaptic brain changes become permanent, creating the set of behaviors and disturbed regulatory function that sometime after age 3 or 4 years become recognizable as ADHD symptoms.</p>
<fig id="fig2-0883073811420151" position="float">

</fig>
<p>This feedback loop may also explain some of the interplay between the genetic and environmental factors reported in many recent models and studies of preschool ADHD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0883073811420151">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0883073811420151">29</xref></sup> In children in whom a “difficult temperament” may have a genetic component, as reflected in similar behaviors or diagnoses in their parents or other close relatives (our patients 1 and 3, for example), there is a higher likelihood that the changes will continue into school age. This might also be true in patients with a clear neurologic disease in whom there is little leeway for substrate changes. However, when the external triggers are mainly environmental, such as a poor caregiver-child relationship (our patient 2, for example), it may be possible to modify the changes in the preschool period, when myelinization and pruning are still taking place.</p>
<p>Thus, in some children who present with early ADHD behaviors, especially as toddlers, or who have clear risk factors, the brain changes might be reversed by initiating changes in the environment, thereby preventing the formation of full-blown ADHD before school age. This has important implications for caregiver-child interactions and for planning sensory modification therapy (or sensory integration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0883073811420151">15</xref></sup>) in children with evidence of regulatory dysfunction. There have been few, if any, studies in the literature to prove or disprove potential “preventive” treatment, and further research is warranted.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0883073811420151">30</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>In summary, a comprehensive approach to ADHD already in the preschool age group, with consideration of all available genetic, neurophysiological, and psychological evidence in addition to developmental factors, contributes to the formulation of a useful neurobiological model to explain the evolution of the behavioral symptoms and assist clinicians in managing these behaviors. We suggest that in some cases, early management guided by our triangular model might reverse the downward spiral to full-blown ADHD by school age.</p>
