<p>In January 2011, the International Center for Computational Science (ICCS) at LBNL and UC Berkeley organized a workshop in Berkeley, CA, USA on the role of emerging many-core and accelerator-based architectures in science and technology. The focus of the workshop was to usher experts and enthusiasts from disparate backgrounds in academia and industry to introduce, explore and discuss the scope and challenges of harnessing the full potential of these novel architectures for high-performance computing (HPC), especially in the broad range of scientific and technology disciplines. The emerging new techniques open a route for studying future generations of hardware and software using silicon and electrical power much more efficiently, a necessity on the path to exascale computing.</p>
<p>Emerging many-core and accelerator-based architectures offer unprecedented potential for energy-efficient HPC in science and technology. Limited early adoption of such architectures by a broad range of compute- and data-intensive applications has distinctly demonstrated unmatched gains in acceleration and power consumptions. This workshop strived to set the stage for academic and industry leaders to enable partnerships for growth of research and innovation in the broader community. Early adopting core-science teams from across the world had an opportunity to get together to coordinate next steps and establish a regular transcontinental forum in the coming years.</p>
<p>This special issue of JHPCA displays a collection of peer-reviewed articles presented at the ICCS workshop that demonstrate the advanced use of the new architectures and associated programming models for a wide range of applications. The goal of the special issue of the journal is to demonstrate the challenges and solutions in adopting the technologies common to a broader applications base. </p>

<bold>Horst Simon</bold> is an internationally recognized expert in computer science and applied mathematics and the Deputy Director of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab). He joined Berkeley Lab in early 1996 as director of the newly formed National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC), and was one of the key architects in establishing NERSC at its new location in Berkeley. Under his leadership NERSC enabled important discoveries for research in fields ranging from global climate modeling to astrophysics. He was also the founding director of Berkeley Lab's Computational Research Division, which conducts applied research and development in computer science, computational science, and applied mathematics. In his prior role as Associate Lab Director for Computing Sciences, he helped to establish Berkeley Lab as a world leader in providing supercomputing resources to support research across a wide spectrum of scientific disciplines. He is also an adjunct professor in the College of Engineering at the University of California, Berkeley. In that role he worked to bring the Lab and the campus closer together, developing a designated graduate emphasis in computational science and engineering. In addition, he has worked with project managers from the Department of Energy, the National Institutes of Health, the Department of Defense and other agencies, helping researchers define their project requirements and solve technical challenges. His research interests are in the development of sparse matrix algorithms, algorithms for large-scale eigenvalue problems, and domain decomposition algorithms for unstructured domains for parallel processing. His algorithm research efforts were honored with the 1988 and the 2009 Gordon Bell Prize for parallel processing research. He was also a member of the NASA team that developed the NAS Parallel Benchmarks, a widely used standard for evaluating the performance of massively parallel systems. He is co-editor of the biannual TOP500 list that tracks the most powerful supercomputers worldwide, as well as related architecture and technology trends. He holds an undergraduate degree in mathematics from the Technische Universität, in Berlin, Germany, and a Ph.D. in mathematics from the University of California at Berkeley.</p>

<bold>Jack Dongarra</bold> received a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics from Chicago State University in 1972 and a Master of Science in Computer Science from the Illinois Institute of Technology in 1973. He received his Ph.D. in applied mathematics from the University of New Mexico in 1980. He worked at the Argonne National Laboratory until 1989, becoming a senior scientist. He now holds an appointment as University Distinguished Professor of Computer Science in the Computer Science Department at the University of Tennessee and holds the title of Distinguished Research Staff in the Computer Science and Mathematics Division at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), Turing Fellow at Manchester University, and an Adjunct Professor in the Computer Science Department at Rice University. He is the director of the Innovative Computing Laboratory at the University of Tennessee. He is also the director of the Center for Information Technology Research at the University of Tennessee which coordinates and facilitates IT research efforts at the University. He specializes in numerical algorithms in linear algebra, parallel computing, the use of advanced computer architectures, programming methodology, and tools for parallel computers. His research includes the development, testing and documentation of high-quality mathematical software. He has contributed to the design and implementation of the following open-source software packages and systems: EISPACK, LINPACK, the BLAS, LAPACK, ScaLAPACK, Netlib, PVM, MPI, NetSolve, TOP500, ATLAS, and PAPI. He has published approximately 200 articles, papers, reports and technical memoranda and he is coauthor of several books. He was awarded the IEEE Sid Fernbach Award in 2004 for his contributions in the application of high-performance computers using innovative approaches; in 2008 he was the recipient of the first IEEE Medal of Excellence in Scalable Computing; in 2010 he was the first recipient of the SIAM Special Interest Group on Supercomputing's award for Career Achievement; and in 2011 he was the recipient of the IEEE IPDPS 2011 Charles Babbage Award. He is a Fellow of the AAAS, ACM, IEEE, and SIAM and a member of the National Academy of Engineering. </p>

<bold>Hemant Shukla</bold> is an expert in a wide range of scientific high-performance computing, algorithms, simulations, data processing and instrumentation techniques in the fields of physics and astronomy. Before joining UC Berkeley, he has worked in leading institutions at Caltech, Space Telescope Science Institute and in the industry at Stanford Research Systems. He has conceived and lead the many-core and accelerator-based astrophysics project called ISAAC (Infrastructure for Astrophysics Applications Computing), with Horst Simon as the PI. ISAAC is funded by NSF to lead research and development for accelerating astrophysics applications in simulations, instrumentation and data processing/analysis. He has actively expanded HPC knowledge base through conferences, collaborations and education and public outreach. The ISAAC project on billion-particle angular and spatial correlation which he lead was nominated for the Gordon Bell finalist for SC 2012. He co-founded the International Center for Computational Science (ICCS) to research emerging architectures, and programming models for high-performance computing applied to science and technology. His research covers areas in next-generation radio-interferometry, 21 cm cosmology, Fourier optics, extreme-scale image processing, mission-critical end-to-end simulations, fluid dynamics, radiative transfers, adaptive mesh refinement, <italic>N</italic>-body, many-core and GPU computing etc.</p>
