<p>This occasion marked the tenth anniversary for independent filmmakers at the annual Sundance Film Festival to receive the Alfred P. Sloan Prize for an outstanding feature film focusing on science or technology as a theme, or depicting a scientist, engineer or mathematician as a major character. The award comes with US$20,000. The 2013 Festival, held in Park City, Utah, presented 119 feature-length films, representing 32 countries and 51 first-time filmmakers. Films were selected from 12,146 submissions (429 more than for 2012), including 4044 feature-length films and 8102 short films. Of the feature film submissions, 2070 were from the USA and 1974 were international. Over 100 feature films were world premieres, setting the agenda for what will appear in theaters and on television for the upcoming year.</p>
<p>Sloan jurors screened only two films this year. <italic>Computer Chess</italic>, an existential comedy about teaching machines to play chess was selected for its ‘off-beat and formalistically adventurous exploration of questions of artificial intelligence and human connections, unfolding during an early computer chess tournament’. The film, shot in black and white with early 1980’s video equipment, follows a group of techies from MIT, CalTech and other bastions of genius gathered for an annual competition pitting machine versus machine. A man versus machine hypothesis evolves from grad students accompanying their mentors. The only other contender for the award again focused on technology. <italic>jOBS</italic> featuring Ashton Kutcher as Apple founder Steve Jobs has already been picked up for wide distribution. Little new information about the iconic, stormy computer giant is offered. Audiences may, however, be inspired to read the available, well-written biographies.</p>
<p>Each year festival founder Robert Redford and the Sundance Institute staff celebrate what they see as ‘a shift in the DNA of the film community’. That shifting paradigm does not yet seem to include much in the way of compelling science topics. For the most part, independent filmmakers continue to be drawn to stories about bad behavior, faulty scruples, failing adults, sex/drugs and rock ‘n’ roll. The Sloan winner is typically expected to be a more intelligent film. ‘You hope there’s something to give the award to each year’, Sloan’s Program Director Doron Weber said. The science award is a major component of the Sundance Science-in-Film Initiative to support the development and exhibition of new independent film projects that explore science and technology themes or depictions of scientists, engineers and mathematicians in engaging and innovative ways. The Sloan–Sundance partnership is part of a broader program by the Sloan Foundation to stimulate leading artists in film, television, and theater to create more realistic and compelling stories about science and technology, and to challenge existing stereotypes. Sloan has partnered with some of the top film schools in the USA and established annual awards in screenwriting and film production. No scholar has yet surveyed audience engagement or attempted to test learning post screenings.</p>
<p>There have been better years for science at Sundance. Previous Sloan Prize Winners include: Jake Schreier and Christopher Ford, <italic>Robot &amp; Frank</italic> (2012); Musa Syeed, <italic>Valley of Saints</italic> (2012); Mike Cahill and Brit Marling, <italic>Another Earth</italic> (2011); Diane Bell, <italic>Obselidia</italic> (2010); Max Mayer, <italic>Adam</italic> (2009); Alex Rivera, <italic>Sleep Dealer</italic> (2008); Shi-Zheng Chen, <italic>Dark Matter</italic> (2007); Andrucha Waddington, <italic>The House of Sand</italic> (2006); Werner Herzog, <italic>Grizzly Man</italic> (2005), Shane Carruth, <italic>Primer</italic> (2004) and Marc Decena, <italic>Dopamine</italic> (2003). Ample research opportunities await. See <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.sundance.org">www.sundance.org</ext-link> or websites for individual films.</p>
