<p>In the France of the mid-nineteenth century, Catholic militants were convinced of the need to reach the minds of children, above all others, if the faith were to survive; it was Catholic presses, dedicated to the diffusion of ‘good’ books, that produced the bulk of children’s literature. The most successful Catholic writer of stories for children and adolescents, one who still enjoys popularity today, was Sophie comtesse de Ségur née Rostopchine, whose works, however, were in fact published not by a Catholic press but by the brilliantly entrepreneurial Hachette, which monopolized the book-kiosks on railway-stations. She is regarded as having played a key role in the establishment of a Catholic gender-identity for girls. There is a substantial recent French bibliography on this writer, mainly falling into two categories: critical literary studies and popular biographies of restricted focus and largely uninformed by recent academic historiography.</p>
<p>Heywood, by contrast, is concerned less with the content and ethos of de Ségur’s stories than with her place in her cultural milieu, primarily in the worlds both of militant clericalism and of commercial publishing. She draws on the rich French historiography in the relevant fields and thereby makes exceptionally intelligent use of correspondence and family papers. The countess, with all the weight deriving from her marriage into one of the principal aristocratic families of France, was at the very centre of the world of hard-line ultramontane Catholicism. Here, she and her two sons, Gaston and Anatole, acted as something of a literary team. Monsignor Gaston, to whom she stood in the relation of disciple, was a leading figure in this world and functioned as a link between Louis Napoleon’s government and the Vatican of Pius IX. The group had an intimate relationship with that <italic>dur par excellence</italic> the leading ultramontane journalist Louis Veuillot, and the countess campaigned with him for the ideal of a reconverted Catholic aristocracy which would set a bold example to French society as a whole. One of Heywood’s significant concerns is with the countess’s literary self-fashioning and with her status as an authorial figure. Authorship provides one example of how Catholic female militants came to play an active, extra-domestic role. A woman-author, however, was a potentially controversial figure in a century that was more patriarchalist than its predecessor. The countess’s literary self-image as a grandmother telling stories to children at her knee craftily adapted the image of the domestic angel to the active role of public moralist. She had to contend both with the realities of the commercial world of publishing and the restrictions imposed by editors who laboured under the Imperial regime’s censorship and were, moreover, bombarded with indignant letters from private individuals.</p>
<p>In the stifling atmosphere of the early Second Empire, the countess’s vividly illustrated campaign against the corporal punishment of children was often regarded as in bad taste and even as undermining parental authority. Louis Napoleon’s deference to the Catholic milieu diminished from the late 1850s when he supported the movement for Italian unification, thereby weakening his commitment the Papacy’s territorial sovereignty. This meant that while the Imperial regime’s tutelage of social mores became less oppressive, the countess and her circle incurred the disfavour of the regime and her attack on Garibaldi had to be toned down. Her ladyship deeply resented her editor’s excisions, but, in the long term, the strong market appeal of her works gave her a notable authorial independence in relation to the firm of Hachette.</p>
<p>De Ségur was a reactionary in terms of her royalism and her brand of Catholicism, but a progressive by virtue of her humane sensitivity to children, for which she can be meaningfully compared to Dickens. Moreover, the militant clericalism to which she subscribed, for all the savagery of its attacks on those who did not share its positions, was distinguished by its emphasis on a loving God rather than a punishing one, albeit we might regard this as a ‘market-orientated’ piety, calculated to stem the haemorrhage of the masses from the Church. This kind of piety informed the countess’s attitude towards children. Changing attitudes towards childhood are another of Heywood’s major concerns. The ‘Augustinian’ vision of the sinful child, whose ‘concupiscence’, that is the scars of Original Sin, needed to be restrained by rigid discipline, was giving way to a Romantic vision of the charismatically innocent child, not just among secular disciples of Rousseau but among Catholics as well. The countess’s position here, as between two traditions, was complex and ambiguous. Altogether, her figure defies neat pigeon-holing and a study of her is a good vantage-point for examining the swirl of cultural currents in mid-nineteenth-century France.</p>
