<abstract>
<p>Postsecondary transition planning for students with disabilities first entered the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) in 1990. The required provisions for transition planning were updated with the amendments to IDEA in 1997 and its reauthorization in 2004. Since IDEA 2004 took effect in July 2005, 11 court cases have been decided related to postsecondary transition planning. This article summarizes recent litigation in transition and discuss practice implications.</p>

<p>Postsecondary outcomes for students with disabilities have been a persistent concern for educators and parents alike. Youths with disabilities often experience poor postschool outcomes. They are more likely to drop out of high school and to be unemployed (or underemployed) than students without disabilities and are less likely to pursue secondary education and live independently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1053451212472233">Newman et al., 2011</xref>). In 2009, the dropout rate was almost twice as high among students with disabilities compared to their peers without disabilities (15.5% vs. 7.8%), and 80% of youth with disabilities ages 18 to 24 were leaving high school with a credential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1053451212472233">Chapman, Laird, Ifill, &amp; Kewal Ramani, 2011</xref>). In the area of employment, the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1053451212472233">U.S. Department of Labor (2011)</xref> reported the unemployment rate of persons with a disability as 14.8%, a figure nearly 5.5% higher than the rate for those without a disability (9.4%). Furthermore, in a little more than one decade, the rate of students with disabilities enrolled in postsecondary education almost doubled, from 6% in 1995–1996 to 10.8% in 2007–2008 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1053451212472233">U.S. Department of Education, 2011</xref>). This article reviews the postsecondary transition requirements of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act and discusses relevant court cases and due process hearings.</p>
<p>When the Education of All Handicapped Children Act (1975) was reauthorized in 1990 as the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1053451212472233">IDEA, 1990</xref>), it included the requirement of postsecondary transition planning for students with disabilities beginning at age 16. The amendments to IDEA in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1053451212472233">1997</xref> required transition planning begin at age 14, with a transition statement regarding the student’s course of study and, at 16 (or younger), a statement of needed transition services with links to outside agencies. In 2004, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act further refined the transition requirements for youth with disabilities, including the requirement that transition planning begin at age 16. Each state was required to develop a State Performance Plan that outlined 20 indicators to improve outcomes of children with disabilities (20 U.S.C. 1412(a)(15)(A)(iii)), including postsecondary transition (Indicator 13). Transition is defined as
<disp-quote>
<p>a coordinated set of activities that (A) is designed to be within a results-oriented process, that is focused on improving the academic and functional achievement of the child with a disability to facilitate the child’s movement from school to post-school activities, including post-secondary education, vocational education, integrated employment (including supported employment), continuing and adult education, adult services, independent living, or community participation; (B) is based on the individual child’s needs, taking into account the child’s strengths, preferences, and interests; and (C) includes instruction, related services, community experiences, the development of employment and other post-school adult living objectives, and, when appropriate, acquisition of daily living skills and functional vocational evaluation. (20 U.S.C. 1402(34))</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Transition plans involve the following: (a) student invitation, (b) measurable postsecondary goal(s), (c) age-appropriate transition assessments, (d) coordinated set of activities, (e) outside agency invitation, (f) annual individualized education program (IEP) goal(s), and (g) transfer of rights at age of majority (§300.320(b)).</p>

<title>Transition-Related Litigation</title>
<p>Considering the level of importance of postschool outcomes for students with disabilities, it is essential for school personnel to understand the implications of relevant case law in service delivery to avoid costly legal involvement and ensure all students’ transition needs are met appropriately. Using electronic and hand searches of the <italic>Special Educator</italic> from January 1, 2004, to December 31, 2011, the authors found 11 court cases involving postsecondary transition. Of these cases, 8 were decided in favor of the school district and 3 in favor of the parents. Electronic and hand searches of the <italic>Special Educator</italic> were supplemented with an Internet search to locate 28 state education agency rulings during the same time period. Of those, 12 were decided in favor of districts and 16 were decided in favor of parents.</p>
<sec id="section2-1053451212472233">
<title>Transition Court Cases</title>
<p>Districts generally prevailed in court cases if the child’s transition plan, though generic in nature, allowed the student to receive educational benefit, that is, the plan included the goals of graduating from high school, attending a local university or community college, and attaining future employment in the community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1053451212472233"><italic>Virginia S. v. Department of Education</italic>, 2007</xref>). A similar ruling occurred in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1053451212472233"><italic>Rodriguez v. Fort Lee Board of Education</italic> (2011)</xref>. Although the daughter’s transition planning goals were vague and necessary agencies were not invited to the meetings, the court held the school district did not violate the IDEA because it supplied the family with substantial information and assistance. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1053451212472233">Table 1</xref>, additional case law indicates that districts will not be liable for additional services requested by parents or residential placements as long as the IEP or transition plan provides for a free appropriate public education (FAPE).</p>

The assessment also indicated a high interest in performing arts, but the skill score in that area was in the “very low” range. The parents enrolled their daughter in a private, residential school with a curriculum emphasizing music and functional skills and requested tuition reimbursement.</td>
<td>The court concluded the transition plan reflected the student’s skills and interests, as well as a series of practical goals (e.g., that would help her transition into life after developing a weekly budget, balancing a checking account, conversational skills, and meal preparation) and denied request for reimbursement.</td>

<p>In contrast, failure to provide adequate and individualized services to ensure an appropriate education has resulted in parents prevailing in the courts. Specifically, failure to properly assess the student’s vocational skills and address individual needs (e.g., lack of IEP transition goals related to pragmatic language deficits, and failure to allow the student to receive vocational services in the community or services to support independent living) resulted in the court ordering the district to provide compensatory transition services for 2 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1053451212472233"><italic>Dracut School Committee v. Bureau of Special Education Appeals</italic>, 2010</xref>). Similarly, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1053451212472233"><italic>Klein Independent School District and Texas Education Agency v. Per Hovem, Knut Hovem, and Signe Hovem</italic> (2010)</xref>, the court concluded that the student’s transition plan was neither individualized nor adequate to meet his needs after high school (e.g., writing and spelling abilities were not adequate to attend college) and ordered the school to reimburse the family for 2 years of compensatory education. Finally, although the court agreed that the transition plan clearly outlined transition goals, including development of a plan for life after high school, it lacked appropriate transition-related evaluations, and the student’s IEP was too general. Consequently, the court ordered 5.5 hours of compensatory education for every school day in the 2006–2007 school year to be awarded to the student (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1053451212472233"><italic>School District of Philadelphia v.

<title>State Education Agency Decisions</title>
<p>Districts typically prevailed in administrative due process hearings if they had followed procedural safeguards and developed transition plans that enabled the student to receive FAPE by increasing the likelihood of successful transition in postsecondary environments. Districts also prevailed in cases when minor procedural violations were identified, if the district had provided services that afforded the student substantive benefits. In contrast, parents were the prevailing party when the district failed to meet procedural requirements and services provided did not result in substantive educational benefits. Transition plans that were not comprehensive, reflective of the student’s needs, or carefully designed to ensure the successful transition to postsecondary settings were the most frequently cited reasons for ruling in favor of the parents. If the district’s transition planning did not include parental involvement, or if the planning placed the burden of transition responsibilities on the student or parents, then state education agencies (SEAs) decided in the family’s favor. Though required annually, IEP meetings should occur more frequently, if a parent has a concern with the transition plan.</p>
<p>Plans should contain results-oriented, measurable, and appropriate postsecondary goals. The use of multiple transition assessments, updated transition goals when student’s interests changed, and career goals that are consistent with the student’s academic abilities are further safeguards for district personnel. Districts not following these guidelines were often required to pay for compensatory education and services. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1053451212472233">Table 2</xref> provides a sample of SEA rulings on postsecondary transition in favor of districts. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1053451212472233">Table 3</xref> provides a sample of SEA rulings on postsecondary transition in favor of parents or guardians.</p>

<p>The implications of the legal trends on postsecondary transition planning on practice continue to be limited by the lack of a national court decision. Although these court cases reflect a variety of jurisdictions in the federal court system, it is important to note that the case law may not be binding. For example, 7th Circuit rulings are binding in Illinois, Indiana, and Wisconsin only. These cases, nonetheless, present a powerful argument for consideration because of the precedence they establish. In keeping with the requirements of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1053451212472233">IDEA (2004)</xref>, it is imperative that school personnel provide transition plans for students with disabilities no later than when the student turns 16 (unless state requirements begin at an earlier age). District- and state-level special education should provide ongoing professional development for teachers, guidance counselors, building-level administrators, and job coaches in the following areas: (a) IEP development tools, (b) transition assessment and planning, and (c) career assessment. The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1053451212472233">National Secondary Transition Technical Assistance Center (2012)</xref> has provided a battery of products and resources related to postsecondary transition at its website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nsttac.org">www.nsttac.org</ext-link>).</p>
<p>Although IDEA does not require states to guarantee any particular educational outcome, it does require the provision of special education and related services to be carefully designed to allow the child to benefit from special education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1053451212472233"><italic>Board of Education v. Rowley</italic>, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1053451212472233">Yell, Katsiyannis, &amp; Hazelkorn, 2007</xref>). In addition, the student’s transition plan must be reasonably calculated to provide FAPE when it reflects the student’s skills and interests, including practical goals and objectives based on multiple individual assessments that will help the student transition to preferred life trajectories after high school. To further assist with this transition, IDEA 2004 requires a summary of performance when students are no longer eligible for special education services because of high school graduation with a standard diploma or because the student has exceeded age restrictions. To help school districts meet this requirement in a consistent manner, the Council for Exceptional Children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1053451212472233">CEC, 2012</xref>) has developed a summary of performance model checklist. Part 1 includes the student’s demographic information and contact information and the results from his or her most recent formal and informal assessment reports as documentation of the disability. Part 2 lists the student’s postsecondary goals. Part 3 covers three important areas: academic, cognitive, and functional levels of performance, including the accommodations, modifications, and assistive technology that were <italic>critical</italic> in high school to help the student make appropriate progress. Included in Part 4, Recommendations to Assist the Student in Meeting Postsecondary Goals, are suggestions for additional accommodations and services that would be helpful to the student in higher education, training and/or employment, independent living, or community participation. It is highly recommended that the student with a disability complete Part 5, Student Input, for the purposes of self-advocacy and self-determination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1053451212472233">CEC, 2012</xref>).</p>

<title>Future Directions</title>
<p>Future court cases will define both transition and evidence-based practices to promote improved postsecondary outcomes (i.e., education/training, employment, and independent living). In February 2011, Rep. Gregg Harper (R-MS) introduced H.R. 602, The Transition Toward Excellence, Achievement, and Mobility Through Education Act (TEAM), with transition planning age starting at 14. Provisions of the bill include the following: (a) advocates training in self-advocacy and self-determination to increase student empowerment, (b) targets students with significant disabilities who would typically require significant support in an employment setting that pays minimum wage or higher, and (c) prohibits the use of facility-based employment or activity settings, such as sheltered workshops, day habilitation centers, mobile work crews, or enclave work settings in a child’s IEP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1053451212472233">U.S. Congress, 2011</xref>). No action has been taken on this bill beyond its introduction on the floor.</p>
<p>In addition, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1053451212472233">IDEA (2004)</xref> requires “a statement of the special education and related services and supplementary aids and services, based on peer-reviewed research to the extent practicable, to be provided to the child” (Section 614 (d)(1)(A)(i)(IV)). This requirement for evidence-based practices certainly applies to transition services. Though there are no cases addressing the empirical support of transition-related interventions, there is a reasonable expectation that such cases will emerge. School districts will be well served if they implement evidence-based practices for transition. Specifically, transition programs should be comprehensive in nature and address a variety of postschool outcomes and begin with the appropriate academic courses (e.g., participation in the general education curriculum, as well as courses that target specific skills, such as functional mathematics). In addition, transition programs should include self-determination skills, social skills, and career instruction and experiences.</p>
<p>Self-determination is a dispositional characteristic defined as the ability to act as the “primary causal agent in one’s life” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1053451212472233">Wehmeyer, 1996</xref>, p. 24). People who are self-determined are able to take action to achieve their desired quality of life without the undue influence or interference of others. They demonstrate the essential elements of self-determination: autonomy, self-regulation, self-realization, and psychological empowerment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1053451212472233">Wehmeyer, 1996</xref>). Research has indicated that increased levels of self-determination are associated with increased performance in postsecondary education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1053451212472233">Harris &amp; Robertson, 2001</xref>), employment, and independent living (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1053451212472233">Chambers et al., 2007</xref>). Self-determination can be taught by addressing its component skills (e.g., goal setting and attainment skills, decision-making skills, self-awareness, self-knowledge, self-efficacy, self-advocacy and leadership skills, problem-solving skills) and through developed programs such as the <italic>Self-Determined Learning Model of Instruction</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1053451212472233">Wehmeyer, Palmer, Argan, Mithaug, &amp; Martin, 2000</xref>) and <italic>NEXT S.T.E.P.: Student Transition and Educational Planning</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1053451212472233">Halpern, Herr, Wolf, Doren, &amp; Johnson, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>Another transition practice that schools should consider implementing is social skills instruction. Students who demonstrate higher-level social skills are more likely to attend postsecondary education institutions and be employed as adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1053451212472233">Test et al., 2009</xref>). Specific social skills, such as maintaining conversations, may be taught individually or in group settings through modeling, role-playing, rehearsal, video training, and cue cards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1053451212472233">Alwell &amp; Cobb, 2009</xref>). In addition, a number of social skill curricula can be purchased, such as <italic>Skillstreaming the Adolescent</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1053451212472233">McGinnis, 2011</xref>), <italic>The EQUIP Program</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1053451212472233">Gibbs, Potter, &amp; Goldstein, 1995</xref>), and <italic>The ACCEPTS Program</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1053451212472233">Walker et al., 1988</xref>).</p>
<p>Career instruction and experiences are a critical component in transition programs. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1053451212472233">Landmark, Ju, and Zhang (2010)</xref> reported work experience and employment preparation to be the two most substantiated transition practices. Those practices, along with career assessment and occupational courses, have been associated with increased postsecondary attendance, employment, and independent living (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1053451212472233">Test et al., 2009</xref>). Schools can implement this practice through vocational education, providing assessments to help students select potential occupations, work-study programs, and internships.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Effective transition remains a critical component in affording qualified students with disabilities an appropriate education. Over the years, legislative requirements have not only articulated the responsibility of school districts in ensuring the seamless and effective transitioning of students to postsecondary environments but also increased the nature and extent of the schools’ responsibility. Case law discussed in light of this review demonstrates that there is a challenge in ensuring the adequacy of transition services. Furthermore, current employment, postsecondary education, and independent living outcomes are far from acceptable. Consequently, school districts must intensify the implementation of evidence-based practices to improve the effectiveness of transition services and ultimately the lives of those with disabilities.</p>
