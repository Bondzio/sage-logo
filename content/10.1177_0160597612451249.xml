<italic>The Beach Beneath the Street</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0160597612451249">2011</xref>) is McKenzie Wark’s most recent of over half a dozen books. Subtitled <italic>The Everyday Life and Glorious Times of the Situationist International</italic>, it follows publication of his essay <italic>50 Years of Recuperation of the Situationist International</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0160597612451249">2008</xref>). Just prior, <italic>Gamer Theory</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0160597612451249">2007</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0160597612451249">
<italic>A Hacker Manifesto</italic> (2004)</xref> established Wark’s place among cultural theorists beyond the cutting edge. <italic>A Hacker Manifesto</italic> remains Wark’s best-known work, a text that exists in multiple editions available online and in several versions in periodicals prior to its publication as a book by Harvard University Press in 2004. <italic>Gamer Theory</italic> was first available online as GAM3R 7H30RY (and in multiple iterations) prior to its publication in 2007. The text first appeared as an interactive site, or “networked book,” where readers could tag the text and add comments. Discussion forums allowed for interaction among readers—and occasionally its author. In fact, the print version contains comments from version 1.1 of the GAM3R 7H30RY Web site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0160597612451249">2006</xref>).</p>
<p>It seems more appropriate to reveal <italic>The Beach Beneath the Street</italic> outside of typical conventions and with a more interactive approach. While Wark’s prior two books made extensive use of Internet technologies to break out of the typical bounds of the book, I utilized my physical proximity to confront the text with a different method: I traveled to New York City to meet with Wark to discuss his book. We spent most of an afternoon wandering around Manhattan talking about his work and about an hour in his office where I conducted a more structured, recorded interview.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0160597612451249">1</xref>
</sup> This article, then, is a sort of bilateral commentary informed by a reading of the book and a conversation with its author. It is neither a review nor an interview; it is a story about a story.</p>
<p>To begin with the basic, <italic>The Beach Beneath the Street</italic> covers the Situationist International from its beginnings in 1957 through the “split” in 1962. Since the split had much to do with the role of art in the movement—with many of the aesthetes cast out in the years leading up to it, and most of them gone afterward—these early years represent the more aesthetic period for the Situationists. Interestingly, however, the book details little on the art. Marginal characters—or, perhaps more honestly, characters marginalized by historians and commentators—receive considerable attention. The focus away from the artworks and toward minor characters realizes in interesting ways. As an example, Michele Bernstein’s novels receive more detailed attention than Asger Jorn’s paintings. Moreover, Jorn’s innovative rewriting of Marxist political economy receives considerable attention. Guy Debord is noted for his administrative roles with the journal, and his <italic>Society of the Spectacle</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0160597612451249">1983</xref>) is deliberately avoided. Dutch anarchists in Provo and the German Spur group are highlighted, while Raoul Vaneigem is only touched on briefly. The result is light cast into the shadowy spots in the history of the Situationist International, and the stage made larger for many more actors to be present, and (to extend the metaphor) the stage is made circular and to rotate, eliminating the foregrounding of “great men.”</p>
<p>Key strategies and concepts of the Situationists, <italic>dérive</italic> and <italic>détournement</italic>, are detailed and discussed alongside their practical development. The <italic>dérive </italic>is a strategy for exploration used to investigate and chart a terrain. It emerged among a generation of bohemians who were, as Wark says, “unparented, often in a literal sense, but certainly at least in a figurative sense,” and had no alternatives outside of the Gaulist state formation and the Communist Party. These primarily young people from the dangerous classes, outside of the oscillation between work and leisure, were left to experience the city in a completely different way. Bohemians, by choice or circumstance, followed the dictum of the classic graffiti by Debord: “Never work.” The <italic>dérive</italic> is a delinquent experience of a city outside the routine of wage labor. It is figuratively and methodologically an unguided wandering through the hidden terrain of the city. Wark’s book seems in many ways a <italic>dérive</italic> through history and texts. When asked about this, he warned that the metaphor is prone to abuse. While he takes the reader down many paths heretofore unexplored by historians of the movement, he explained that his research and writing were much more deliberate and careful. The <italic>dérive </italic>lacks both prefigured function and care. The only deliberation and concern employed by the early Situationists when wandering through Saint-Germain was perhaps to bring along some rough and tumble friends who could help out if they found more trouble than intended. “<italic>Dérive </italic>is the method,” says Wark, “Psychogeography is the result. The mapping and recording of the ambiances of the city and the normative selection of ones that point to the possibility of unitary urbanism, to find another kind of city. ‘Another city for another life,’ another Situationist slogan. So this is the rare discovery, that you can wander the streets, detect its ambiances, discover the hints of the kind of city that would be required to build for less mediocre games.”</p>
<p>
<italic>Détournement</italic> was developed by the Lettrist International, a parent body to the Situationists. It involves appropriating linguistic, textual, visual, and other content from existing works, embracing plagiarism and theft, and turning these against instantiations of capitalist power. The prime example of <italic>détournement</italic> would be Guy Debord’s film, <italic>Society of the Spectacle</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0160597612451249">1973</xref>), that uses “found” footage from newsreels, advertisements, pornography, and still photographs, along with numerous popular films. The film is narrated by Debord using text from his book of the same title and texts from Marx, Machiavelli, de Tocqueville, and others, often deliberately misquoted and removed from context. Wark’s iterative text, <italic>A Hacker Manifesto</italic>, is itself a <italic>détournement</italic> of the <italic>Society of the Spectacle</italic> book. Other themes, such as the gift or potlatch, appear throughout <italic>The Beach Beneath the Street</italic>, along with <italic>dérive</italic> and <italic>détournement</italic>, but these two concepts cut across the everyday experiences of the Situationists and into their works—from graffiti to paintings, from pranks to books.</p>
<p>As with any critical engagement with a text, the reader is bound to question choices of methodology and emphasis. More importantly, I wanted to know why a book on the Situationist International published over 50 years after the fact? In his polemical antiobituary to Guy Debord, Luther <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0160597612451249">Blissett (1995</xref>) proposed over a decade and a half ago “that we cease allowing the traditions of the dead generations to dominate the lives of the living.” Moreover, why should this history—of a group active prior to computerization—be written by someone who has been at the forefront of digital media in cultural studies?</p>
<p>The answers to this set of questions provide a sort of missing preface to the book, describing the motivations of its author and his situating it within contemporary politics. Acknowledging that he lacks the background in French Studies or Comparative Literature that would typically make one suited to write about the Situationist International, Wark instead points to his personal experience in Bohemian subcultures and in the digital avant-garde, particularly around the <italic>nettime</italic> LISTSERV. <italic>Nettime</italic>, he says, “tried to bring together cheap and quick digital tools with theory and politics as a transnational network.” These experiences offered Wark a critical and personal perspective that allows him to see the Situationists in a different light and in a manner that allows their relevance to be carried forward. He continues,</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Indeed the book began as preliminary research for writing about the digital avant-garde of the 1990s, which was sort of rhizomatic, dispersed, and transnational. I was struggling for a point of entry and I thought, “what was one book that everyone would have read who was on this scene?” And I thought “<italic>Society of the Spectacle!</italic> We all read that!” Everyone read that book. So I re-read it and I thought, “This is a really amazing book! We thought we’d superseded this or transcended this, but we really haven’t.” Everyone reads the first chapter. You know Debord’s famous account: “The world appears as a vast accumulation of spectacles” and so on . . . But the meat of the book is in the later chapters. It’s really a book about <italic>détournement</italic> and the practice of plagiarism, that culture is always a commons that’s collectively produced, and so on. Actually, that’s the central idea of the book. I wanted to know the context of that book. What was the movement that produced it? So I read about the Situationist International. And I thought, “I want to know more about the context that produced them.”</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>This led him to the point where <italic>The Beach Beneath the Street</italic> begins, in postwar France. In this time, a variety of Marxist tendencies were emerging, from the existentialism of Sartre to Leninist and Maoist groups. For Wark, this is a time that continues to inspire intellectuals today, but they are often taking a “wrong turn.” This turn is toward a popular tendency in cultural criticism and theory among 21st century inheritors who are bringing forward “hyperacademic and idealist” work that emerged in this period, alongside the Situationists. Wark describes himself, on the contrary, “as someone who always identified with a critical, libertarian, Marxist set of intellectual currents.</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Reviving Leninism in the twenty-first century, it struck me, seemed like a really terrible idea. Reviving Maoism seemed like an even worse idea. I wanted to tell a story that would open up some other pathways through a resolutely non-Stalinist, libertarian, nonacademic but very intellectually serious set of avant-garde movements. It struck me that telling the story of the Situationist International was one way to start that. An alternative to reading Jacques Lacan is to read his exact contemporary, Henri Lefebvre. An alternative to reading Althusser is to read his almost exact contemporary, Asger Jorn. It was just a way to open up these other paths, another way of doing works that, I think, are much more interesting. They [Situationists] are partly about doing intellectual work, but they’re also about practices. They’re about forming collaborative practices with people who work in other forms, in other media, and so on. I was trying to make a gesture toward all these things, all these other ways of working that are antecedents to things you <italic>could</italic> do now, other than things that seem hypertheoretical but in a vacuum or to politically go back to some of the worst choices you could possibly make and bring them into the twenty-first century.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Here, Wark is pointing to a broader tendency in contemporary cultural theory perhaps best represented by the work of popular figures such as Slavoj Žižek (who is certainly a Leninist, and to some an apologist for Stalin) and Alain Badiou (a Maoist). Recent efforts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0160597612451249">Newman 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0160597612451249">2010</xref>) have been made to revive and update Max Stirner. <italic>The Beach Beneath the Street</italic> attempts a similar feat, bringing into the present the critical and practical work of those neglected in contemporary academia with the aim of guiding future activities within and beyond it. This is complicated, though, because Wark is dealing with a group that is geographically, linguistically, and politically diffused. On the other hand, this text provides scores of entry points for more in-depth investigation and analysis. While some areas of the text do not delve as deeply as I would have liked (i.e., the Provo group), these offer avenues for inquiry to scholars, many of whom are likely to find this book as a source of inspiration. Žižek has done more than inspire scholarship in Leninism and Lacanian psychoanalysis. Cultural theory would benefit by Wark’s readers exploring Jorn’s theory of value, Lefebvre’s trialectic, the Situationists’ uses of Jerry’s ‘pataphysics, the <italic>potlatch</italic>,’ all effectively summarized and engaged, though briefly. Additionally, the methods of the Situationists—from <italic>dérive</italic> and psychogeography to <italic>détournement</italic>—are begging to be appropriated. Wark’s <italic>A Hacker Manifesto</italic> demonstrates the effectiveness of the <italic>détournement. </italic>We see this method in the philosophical work of Agamben (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0160597612451249">Kishik 2012</xref>). Hopefully, Wark’s book will contribute to a developmental reappropriation.</p>
<p>The French interwar period, Wark explains, is also particularly relevant because it reveals opportunities for the contemporary crisis.</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>In that period in the ’50s and early-’60s, the story is often told as though it was a postwar economic miracle, and everyone was happy. “Why did May ’68 happen? Why was there this sudden break and delegitimation? Everything was fine, no one saw it coming?” And the counter is that a lot of people saw it coming. The Situations were among them. They were saying all the way through the late-’50s and early-’60s, “There’s going to be a break. People are going to get bored with this. ‘Our ideas are in everyone’s minds,’” as they famously said. I felt that the period from the early 2000s until now was sort of like that. “We’re living the neoliberal dream with the level playing field. Free markets! What’s not to like? It’s great for everybody!” So when something like Occupy Wall Street happened, people asked, “Who would ever imagine there could be a political movement that would refuse this?” Actually, a lot of us saw that coming! It’s kind of obvious this wasn’t working. So I think that would be another context, one of the politico-cultural strands that feeds directly into the spontaneous break that started to happen. And not just here, but more obviously in other places like Tunisia and Egypt. A strand of that is Situationist thinking. Sometimes it’s a direct strand, and sometimes they already had a theory that boredom is a political actant, and it doesn’t matter whatever little trinkets that you jangle in front of people. Commodification has its limits in the satisfaction of desire. The outside to that is going to appear.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>When we consider that the initial call for Occupy Wall Street was made by the explicitly Situationist-inspired magazine, <italic>Adbusters</italic>, this makes all the more sense. In a time when politics from the academy to the mainstream press are focused toward material inequalities, and when the popular narratives focus on the glut of consumer choices and the waste they produce, Situationism brings to the fore a universal experience of overwhelming boredom, malaise, and the aesthetic emptiness of mass culture. Beyond widening wealth gaps, info-glut, and environmental waste, there is the pervasive sense that postindustrial civilization is not producing a life worth living. These are politics that transcend identities and classes, that seek a life filled with beauty, play, and meaning. This is an added focus deserving attention, both in terms of tracing its genealogies and exploring its utility for developing new political practices.</p>
<p>This is precisely how Wark is using the Situationists. On one hand, he is a narrator telling a story that is more than an aggregate of biographies for a collective of individuals but rather a history of a <italic>movement</italic>. It is about people and ideas <italic>in motion</italic>, stories traversing geographies more than details of subjects. On the other hand, this is a work that sees Wark developing his own philosophy. In conversation with Wark, it became clear that this text does to his <italic>oeuvre</italic> what Zizek’s works on Lacan do for his. As such, <italic>The Beach Beneath the Street</italic> casts his prior body of work into new light and will <italic>situate</italic> his future works.</p>
<p>So what <italic>is </italic>this book? “It’s a book you can read in graduate school, but it’s also a book you can read outside of graduate school,” Wark says. “The thing that pleases me most, and it’s happened a couple of times, is to see someone reading my book on the subway. Because it’s a book about reading books on the subway as much as anything else.”</p>
