<p>Scholarly interest in ruins and derelict spaces has intensified over the last decade. We assess a broad selection of the resulting literature and identify several key themes. We focus on how ruins may be used to critically examine capitalist and state manifestations of power; we consider the way in which ruins may challenge dominant ways of relating to the past; and we look at how ruins may complicate strategies for practically and ontologically ordering space. We speculate about the motivations for this surge of current academic interest, draw out resonances with current trends in geographical thinking, and suggest directions for future research.</p>

<title>I Introduction</title>
<p>A decade ago, the curious researcher on a search for scholarship about 20th-century ruins – the structural fallout produced by rapid cycles of industrialization and abandonment, development and depopulation, conflict and reconciliation – would have found relatively little to work with. Ten years on, the same search reveals an extraordinary intensification of academic and popular interest in the ruins of the recent past and associated realms of dereliction. We seem to be in the midst of a contemporary <italic>Ruinenlust</italic>, which carries strange echoes of earlier obsessions with ruination and decay. While there has been focused attention on this topic in anthropology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0309132512462271">Dawdy, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr153-0309132512462271">Stoler, 2008</xref>), archaeology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0309132512462271">Gordon, 2010</xref>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.ruinmemories.org">www.ruinmemories.org</ext-link>) and literary studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0309132512462271">Hell and Schönle, 2010</xref>), there has been no sustained analysis from within human geography. In this paper, we identify emergent themes among academic approaches to ruin-scholarship, speculate about the attractions and intensities that underlie the current eruption of interest, and suggest that human geography is uniquely positioned to offer essential critical resources and perspectives to future study.</p>
<p>The ruined form is one of the most enduring and complex representational devices in western tradition, and contemporary perspectives are inevitably inflected with traces of earlier engagements. During the Renaissance, the ruin was emblematic of ‘a sundered past’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0309132512462271">Dillon, 2005/2006</xref>); the break with Roman civilization was filtered through Christian iconography that transposed classical fragments with mortal human bodies. The Baroque imagination cast the ruin more ambiguously, mining its allegorical possibilities while dwelling on the melancholic power of transience and decay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr148-0309132512462271">Stead, 2003</xref>). The 18th century witnessed the emergence of Germanic <italic>Ruinenlust </italic>(indexed in cultural products such as the paintings of Caspar David Friedrich and the writings of Goethe) and the decidedly more English pursuit of the picturesque (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0309132512462271">Cosgrove and Daniels, 1989</xref>). Ruined hermitages and crumbled faux-Classical temples appeared in formal gardens, designed to provoke a particular set of emotions in the observer and encourage musing on the aesthetics of pleasurable decay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-0309132512462271">Lowenthal, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr132-0309132512462271">Roth et al., 1997</xref>). This Romanticism foregrounded the symbolic aspects of the ruin, and materialized emerging ideas about the harmonic balance of nature and culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr140-0309132512462271">Simmel, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr167-0309132512462271">Woodward, 2002</xref>). Ruin-gazing became the preserve of an elevated aesthetic sensibility, a mark of sophistication and sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr171-0309132512462271">Zucker, 1961</xref>). But the Romantic conception of the ruin was shaken in the 20th century by the scale and brutality of destruction: it was no longer acceptable to playfully frame intact buildings as ruins, a future equivalent to the classical ruins of antiquity – a favourite conceptual game for artists and architects from Michael Gandy to Albert Speer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr170-0309132512462271">Yablon, 2010</xref>). ‘New ruins’, as McCauley branded them in her post-Second World War study, still ‘smell of fire and mortality’, and sensitivity to this devastation required that ‘ruin pleasure must be at one remove, softened by art’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr102-0309132512462271">1953</xref>: 454). Over the following decades, scholars primarily focused their ruin-scholarship around this aesthetic axis, with art historians, historical geographers and others generating important insights into the perception and reception of classical and Romantic ruins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0309132512462271">Cosgrove and Daniels, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr97-0309132512462271">Lowenthal, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr132-0309132512462271">Roth et al., 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>With the turn of the century, the ruin gaze suddenly broadened, and the ruins of the recent past, dynamic and unsettled, became the focus of cross-disciplinary study. Sites recently investigated by researchers are geographically disparate and typologically diverse: factories, foundries and mills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0309132512462271">Barndt, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0309132512462271">Edensor, 2005a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0309132512462271">High and Lewis, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr104-0309132512462271">Mah, 2010</xref>); military installations and Cold War remnants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0309132512462271">Davis, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr155-0309132512462271">Strange and Walley, 2007</xref>); post-Socialist state-built architecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0309132512462271">Andreassen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0309132512462271">Lahusen, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr126-0309132512462271">Pusca, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr161-0309132512462271">van der Hoorn, 2003</xref>); abandoned rural settlements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0309132512462271">Armstrong, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0309132512462271">DeSilvey, 2007a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0309132512462271">González-Ruibal, 2005</xref>); urban wastelands and edgelands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0309132512462271">Farley and Roberts, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0309132512462271">Franck and Stevens, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0309132512462271">Hudson, 2010</xref>); derelict rail and transportation networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr128-0309132512462271">Qviström, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr130-0309132512462271">Rosa, 2011</xref>); maritime relics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0309132512462271">Gordillo, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0309132512462271">Gorst, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr134-0309132512462271">Schneekloth, 2007</xref>); and even the abandoned island site of a reality TV show (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr95-0309132512462271">Lorimer and MacDonald, 2002</xref>). As we write this paper, the pace of publication seems to accelerate, ‘wreckage upon wreckage’ piling up on our desks more quickly than we can keep up (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0309132512462271">Benjamin, 1999</xref>: 249). A parallel trend is playing out in popular and artistic contexts, much of it indexed on the internet.<sup>

</p>
<p>We focus our attention on these ‘new ruins’, and draw out critical themes from research that has engaged with them. The sheer quantity of work in this area requires that we set some boundaries for our analysis. The term ‘ruin’ has a nuanced meaning, and can refer to both object and process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0309132512462271">Hell and Schönle, 2010</xref>: 6) – ‘a ruin’ (noun) and ‘to ruin’ (verb). While we use the term in both senses in this paper, most of the research discussed concerns sites where process is primary, and where agencies of decay and deterioration are still active and formative. These are sites where the ‘absence of order’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr145-0309132512462271">Somers-Hall, 2009</xref>) and maintenance leads to a state of continual transformation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr98-0309132512462271">Lucas’s (forthcoming)</xref> distinction between ‘fast’ and ‘slow’ ruins has relevance here: while ‘fast’ ruins occur as a result of an abrupt transition – through wartime devastation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0309132512462271">Bevan, 2006</xref>) or natural disaster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr166-0309132512462271">Wilford, 2008</xref>) – ‘slow’ ruins slip into ruination more gradually, sidelined by social or economic transitions, or incrementally abandoned. Most of the work discussed here concerns ruins of the ‘slow’ variety, though we include discussion of sites where fast destruction has been succeeded by slow decay. The sense of working across temporal scales is mirrored by attention to the physical scale and substance of the object of study. Much of the work we address is pitched at the scale of ruined – but still recognizable – structures, but we also examine how processes of ruination operate on a finer grain, and may eventually produce absences, such as vacant lots and gaps in infrastructure. All of the studies we consider deal with structures and places that have been classified (by someone, at some time) as residual or unproductive, but equally most of these sites remain open to appropriation and recuperation. Finally, there is a cultural specificity to this project: most of the work we gather here represents a distinctly western perspective, though we do refer to work which indicates that the current fascination with ruins and decay is of global significance.</p>
<p>In this paper, we draw out key themes from the scholarship in an attempt to understand something of the power and potency of ruins – particularly those produced within living memory. We consider research that explores how ruins are used to do particular kinds of cultural and aesthetic work, producing different meanings and modes of encounter. We also look at how ruins are conscripted to do certain kinds of intellectual labour. As Schönle notes: ‘Somehow we cannot leave ruins alone and let them simply exist in their mute materiality. We need to make them speak and militate for our theories’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr135-0309132512462271">2006</xref>: 652). In the first section, we focus on how ruins may be used as sites from which to examine and undermine capitalist and state manifestations of power; in the second, we consider the way ruins may be used to challenge dominant ways of relating to the past; and, in the third, we look at how ruins may force a reconsideration of conventional strategies for practically and ontologically ordering space. These three themes, while by no means the only way of organizing this material, emerged from our analysis as the most relevant and pervasive tropes in recent ruin scholarship. Within each theme we work to draw out tensions and ambiguities between different approaches. A particular recurrent tension emerges between assertions about the potential for ruins to challenge and critique normative social and material formations and counter-claims about their potential associations with regressive politics and aestheticized passivity. Attitudes to ruins and ruination reveal social and cultural values and commitments that become legible through the different narratives that ruins are asked to carry.</p>
<p>As we review the current trends in the interdisciplinary study of ruins, we identify gaps and limitations in these studies that geographical scholarship may be uniquely positioned to address. While recent ruin studies suggest new interpretive frameworks, attentive to context and contingency, there is still a persistent tendency to privilege visual concerns, and a preoccupation with making the ruin illustrate particular aesthetic or philosophical constructs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0309132512462271">Garrett, 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0309132512462271">Ginsberg, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr111-0309132512462271">Morgan, 2011</xref>). Such preoccupations neglect the ruin’s non-representational power to activate memory and sensation and downplay the significance of the lived presence of ruined spaces and places. Within each section, we explore how geographical scholarship – with its attention to the relational, material, spectral and (non-)representational qualities of space and experience – is well positioned to cast a conceptual net over this slippery subject.</p>

<title>II Counter-sites: resistance and regression</title>
<p>We begin with a review of recent scholarship that charts the critical relationship between ruins and political and economic orders. We introduce research on how ruins are used to critique the structures of global capitalism, colonialism and coercive state power, but we move on to consider how the fundamental semiotic instability of ruins may allow them to be mobilized to affirm and memorialize these same structures. An investigation of the ambiguous critical position generated by photographic representations of ruined spaces follows, which leads on to a discussion of the contemporary context and potential directions for future work.</p>
<p>Many of the accounts presented in this section are influenced by Benjamin’s mobilization of derelict sites and outmoded material culture to unmask the illusions of capitalism as progress. Rather than conceiving of history as a progressive, linear sequence of events, Benjamin regarded modernity as a repetitive cycle of ruin and devastation; in his elaboration of Klee’s emblematic ‘Angel of History’, he writes: ‘Where we perceive a chain of events, he sees one single catastrophe which keeps piling wreckage upon wreckage and hurls it in front of his feet’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0309132512462271">Benjamin, 1999</xref>: 249). Yet, for Benjamin, rapid obsolescence – what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr147-0309132512462271">Stallabrass (1996</xref>) calls an ‘accelerated archaeology’ – held a redemptive, emancipatory dimension, for the process of ruination revealed the ‘truth content’ of a place or object, ‘the critical, utopian moments buried within it’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0309132512462271">Gilloch, 1997</xref>: 110). The ruin indexes both the hope and hubris of the futures that never came to pass – whether early capitalism’s promise of abundance and ease, or socialism’s vision of collective labour and equality.</p>
<p>The echo of Benjamin’s ideas can be detected in recent work on the pervasive dereliction generated by mobile capital. Cycles of ruination, demolition and reclamation have spatially uneven effects: certain buildings are left to decay whereas others are rapidly demolished and replaced; others are left as ‘devalued capital’, presently disused but ripe for future accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0309132512462271">Harvey, 1985</xref>). Paradoxically, the ruin emerges through this process as a symbol of both failure (of local industry) and of growth (elsewhere, usually overseas). Scholars exploring these processes draw on the notion of ‘creative destruction’ – through which capitalism organizes the destruction and reconfiguring of economic orders to clear the way for the creation of new wealth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr136-0309132512462271">Schumpeter, 1994</xref>). Cowie and Heathcott describe how the flight of capital from Detroit – led by the automobile industry – precipitated the gutting of communities and state structures, and the onset of widespread dereliction: ‘(T)he very set of political rules that created the industrial order that we once took to be permanent provided the means by which corporations could dismantle that order’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0309132512462271">2003</xref>: 15). In the landscapes and lives left behind by industry, memory traces – in the form of ruined factories and abandoned infrastructure – contain within them the potential to counter the passive acceptance of economic decline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0309132512462271">High and Lewis, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr154-0309132512462271">Storm, 2008</xref>). As Mah shows in her study of the neighbourhoods around the former shipyards in Walker, Newcastle, ruination may be ‘a lived process’ (Mah, 210: 399) in which memory is rooted in the complex, ongoing experience of industrial decline, where ‘the present has not moved far from the past and the future is at best uncertain’ (p. 410). Ruins in these sites may become forces for mobilizing and materializing collective anger and resistance; but they may also simply be painful reminders of loss. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr107-0309132512462271">Massey (2011</xref>), commenting on her collaboration with film-maker Patrick Keiller in making the film <italic>Robinson in Ruins</italic>, discusses how the sites depicted in the film express the anxiety and exclusion created by mobile forces of global capital and the recent economic recession. The ‘ruins’ in Keiller’s film are marginal and insubstantial – battered hoardings, road verges, disused airfields – but hold a latent critical power nonetheless.</p>
<p>These perspectives are supplemented by recent critiques that extend the signification of ruins beyond an association with volatile capitalist processes to consider them as counter-sites to forces of state violence, totalitarianism and colonial repression. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0309132512462271">Buck-Morss (2002</xref>) discusses the spaces and buildings that served to project visions of a Communist utopia, and argues that their ruination seems to herald the dismantling of these ideologies and the regimes from which they emerged. In a similar vein, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr126-0309132512462271">Pusca (2010</xref>) discusses how ironworks in Romania and the Czech Republic were associated with state-propagated rhetoric, through which heroic worker, industry and city were bound together. Accordingly, for the now detached worker, these ‘industrial horizons became unrecognizable, collapsed in a pool of dust, regrets, corruption, and, more important, a sense of self-destruction and futility that directly challenged discourses of progress and positive change’ (p. 241). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-0309132512462271">Lahusen (2006</xref>) similarly points to the purposeful ruination of symbolic sites following the demise of socialist regimes in Russia and eastern Europe, but argues that the essential ambiguity of these places – through which unrealized revolutionary potential complicates their status as emblems of endurance – has been neglected in the headlong rush to decry and erase them. The potential power of ruins as political counter-sites is exemplified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr156-0309132512462271">Szmagalska-Follis’s (2008)</xref> discussion of how Soviet imperial ruins in the borderlands between the Ukraine and Poland have been appropriated for use as a commune. The commune, which occupies a derelict nuclear base, is based on an anarchist self-sufficiency that responds to the disorder of post-socialist transitional state, yet uses the unexpectedly durable structures of totalitarian power as an exercise in recycling. The commune offers a home to dispossessed and politically marginal people, and suggests the emergence of a more egalitarian kind of collectivism, and an alternative to the wholesale reform and market capitalism that defines mainstream post-socialist reconstruction.</p>
<p>One species of ruin vividly highlights the current volatility of capitalist production – half-finished buildings whose construction has been halted by malign economic conditions. Such sites include abandoned luxury home developments in the USA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr170-0309132512462271">Yablon, 2010</xref>) and Iceland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr118-0309132512462271">Pálsson, 2012</xref>), ghost estates in Ireland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-0309132512462271">Kitchin et al., 2012</xref>) and deserted five-star hotel projects on Egypt’s Sinai Peninsula (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0309132512462271">Gill, 2008</xref>), all victims of the collapse of the subprime mortgage market and the domino devastation of world financial markets. In Smithson’s terms, these sites carry ‘the memory traces of an abandoned set of futures’ (1996: 72) – in this case the false prosperity promised by global markets based on smoke and mirrors. As ‘ruins in reverse’, these ‘buildings don’t fall into ruin after they are built but rather rise into ruin before they are built’ (p. 72). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr135-0309132512462271">Schönle (2006</xref>) discusses how unfinished concrete structures in Russia still litter the landscape, testifying to architectural hubris or banal mismanagement. A similar dynamic plays out in a series of incomplete projects in the liminal spaces of post-socialist Bucharest, which were abandoned following the collapse of the totalitarian Ceauşescu regime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr93-0309132512462271">Light and Young, 2010</xref>). Of six planned food market and dining complexes, four were never completed. Reviled through association with the former regime, the structures seemingly had no place in the post-socialist city, yet lingered for years and were only recently demolished. However, parts of a monolithic civic centre, also unfinished by Ceauşescu, remain derelict, their presence materializing the persistent conflict over how to redevelop such monumental spaces, even as negative associations become diluted over time.</p>
<p>As all this suggests, the critical power of ruins is not fixed, but alters with time and context. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr149-0309132512462271">Steinmetz (2008</xref>) draws out this point in his discussion of post-colonial ruins in Namibia and post-industrial ruins in Detroit, exploring the way in which these ruins are used by certain groups to locate and express nostalgia for the colonial and Fordist past. In this example, the potential critical power of ruins is inverted, and regressive rather than resistant engagements move into the foreground. Stoler picks up on this ambivalence in her analysis of ruins as ‘imperial debris’: ruins may be signs of the ‘aftershocks of empire’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr153-0309132512462271">2008</xref>: 194), but they may also provoke ‘imperial nostalgia’ – as did the ruins of earlier historical periods which became ‘icons of a romantic loss’. In Stoler’s reading, while ruins may provide testimony to baleful historical processes – ‘a political project that lays waste to certain peoples and places, relations, and things’ – they also stand as symbols of ‘consequential histories that open to differential futures’ (p. 195). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0309132512462271">González-Ruibal (2008</xref>) touches on similar territory in his impassioned discussion of the revelations offered by relics such as overgrown Spanish civil war trenches and a rusting Soviet anti-aircraft gun abandoned in the Ethiopian bush. He argues that these sites pay testimony to terrible events but also have the potential to offer a therapeutic recognition of wrongs suffered, ‘unveiling what the supermodern power machine does not want to be shown’ (p. 262). For González-Ruibal, ruins testify to changing regimes of power and economy, and offer an opportunity to ‘disrupt the signifying chains of legitimacy built upon notions of heritage by engaging with matter, fragments, and spectral traces’ (p. 273).</p>
<p>The potential for the ruined form to signify perspectives that range from critical resistance to regressive denial is strikingly evident in the genre of ruin photography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0309132512462271">Kemp, 1990</xref>). While we lack space to address the full range of artistic engagement with ruins – this topic deserves a paper of its own – the role of photography is especially pertinent. The recent debate around photographic projects in the industrial and residential ruins of Detroit illustrates some of the issues at stake. As high-profile international photographers have turned their gaze on the spectacle of Detroit’s disintegration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr105-0309132512462271">Marchand and Meffre, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr110-0309132512462271">Moore, 2010</xref>), local residents and social critics have accused them of creating a depopulated ‘ruin porn’ that privileges the aesthetic charge of ruination, thereby ignoring the contextual economic and social devastation and the role of finance and government in its creation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0309132512462271">Finoki, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr90-0309132512462271">Leary, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr103-0309132512462271">McGraw, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr131-0309132512462271">Rosenberg, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr150-0309132512462271">Steinmetz, 2009</xref>). Others have argued that the ruin-image ‘reproduce[s] the viewing subject as a consumer of dereliction’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0309132512462271">Cunningham, 2011</xref>) and fosters a passive, neutralized position in relation to the image content, risking what Benjamin diagnosed as the ‘aestheticization of politics’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr148-0309132512462271">Stead, 2003</xref>). In many ways, ruin-imagery has become complicit in the logic of the global marketplace, selling both in glossy coffee-table books (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0309132512462271">Dubowitz, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr106-0309132512462271">Margaine, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr114-0309132512462271">O’Boyle, 2010</xref>) and in elaborate advertising campaigns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr117-0309132512462271">Palladium Boots, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>In other projects, however, such as the longitudinal studies carried out by Camilo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr162-0309132512462271">Vergara (1999</xref>) in decaying American cities like Camden, New Jersey, images of derelict and abandoned urban spaces may frame ‘nostalgia as an enabling stance for critical realism’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0309132512462271">Blackmar, 2001</xref>: 335). Lewandowski further suggests that Vergara’s photographs expose ‘the ruinous present of neoliberal “progress”’ and fuse the aesthetic power of images with an ethical and moral obligation to the urban past’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr92-0309132512462271">2008</xref>: 307). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr126-0309132512462271">Pusca (2010</xref>) explores the potential role for photography to validate the experience of former workers and create ‘reflective counter-sites’ in the post-socialist industrial ruins described above, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0309132512462271">Crang (2010)</xref>, in his analysis of photographs of the ship-breaking industry, asserts the potential for critical ‘aesthetic registers’ that ‘depict the wasting processes of globalized capitalism’ (p. 1084). In China, contemporary artists are combining photography with other media to produce rich critical representations which expose the negative impacts of global capitalism and rapid urban modernization on the country's environment and people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0309132512462271">Chu, 2010</xref>). The photographic image – like the ruin itself – is multivalent, and open to diverse interpretations and manipulations.</p>
<p>The work discussed in this section must be understood as a response to the current historical moment, in which ruins are used to testify to what has been left behind by creative destruction and collapsed regimes with their unfulfilled dreams. The ongoing drama of the global economic recession – and the ruination of whole economies in nations once thought to be protected from such vicissitudes – will produce yet more debris, and more opportunities to use this wreckage to stage critical manoeuvres. The current period of global economic instability has accelerated the production of ruins, a trend that resonates with other historical eras in which ruins have proliferated, either through the depredations of war and conflict or through the destabilizing effects of economic restructuring, as in 1980s Britain. The current prevalence of ruins makes them easy targets for symbolic loading, drawing on the venerable old ruin-gazing themes of hubris undone and the fall of empire. While there may be an emergent political sensitivity in the attention paid to ruins, this is always undercut by the potential for other interpretations and appropriations. As Smith pointed out a decade and a half ago in his study of a changing New York City, the ability of the dispossessed to occupy and reclaim abandoned neighbourhoods can only hold out for so long against the powerful forces that work to transform ‘urban dilapidation into ultra-chic’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr141-0309132512462271">Smith, 1996</xref>: 18). Ruin meanings are continually up for negotiation; as such, research on the ruins of the recent past requires a perspective that can straddle economics and identity politics, urban aesthetics and post-colonial theory, a perspective that geography is well placed to provide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr91-0309132512462271">Lees, 2012</xref>).</p>

<title>III Ruin memory: other times, other histories</title>
<p>This section considers the notion that ruins serve as emblematic sites at which to re-examine and recast our relationship with the past, and our understandings of temporality. Linked themes include the pluritemporality of the ruin, the convergence of material and personal memory, and the capacity for alternative, sensual engagements with the past. We further develop an analysis of ‘how people live with and in ruins’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr153-0309132512462271">Stoler, 2008</xref>: 196), and the conditions under which ruins are abandoned, demolished, renovated, commodified or left as testimony.</p>
<p>Many scholars have mused on the process of ruination as a metaphor for the erosive, unpredictable aspects of human memory. According to Stewart, ruins are an ‘embodiment of the process of remembering itself’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr152-0309132512462271">1996</xref>: 93). As things acquire potency and significance through their gradual deterioration, the ruin foregrounds the futility of aiming to recuperate the past in any official or exact sense. The alternative is to celebrate the multi-temporality and indeterminacy of the ruined form. Lynch’s contention that urban materiality is characterized by the ‘accumulation of overlapping traces from successive periods, each trace modifying and being modified by the new additions, to produce something like a collage of time’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr99-0309132512462271">1972</xref>: 171) has relevance here, as does <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0309132512462271">Crang and Travlou’s (2001)</xref> discussion of Athens as a pluritemporal landscape in which ‘discordant moments [are] sustained through a mosaic of sites where qualitatively different times interrupt spatialized juxtastructures’ (p.173). In the ruin, decay strips away layers of time and exposes others, revealing hidden strata and obscured material memories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0309132512462271">Dekkers, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0309132512462271">DeSilvey, 2006</xref>). As sites characterized by multiple temporalities, ruins offer opportunities for constructing alternative versions of the past, and for recouping untold and marginalized stories. As Edensor argues:
<disp-quote>
<p>ruins foreground the value of inarticulacy, for disparate fragments, juxtapositions, traces, involuntary memories, uncanny impressions, and peculiar atmospheres cannot be woven into an eloquent narrative. Stories can only be contingently assembled out of a jumble of disconnected things, occurrences, and sensations. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0309132512462271">Edensor, 2005c</xref>: 846)</p>
</disp-quote> The ruin’s contingent stories often emerge at the interface between personal and collective memory, as material remains mediate between history and individual experience. Van der Hoorn’s (2003) account of the giant National Socialist holiday complex at Prora examines how, in their post-war plundering, local residents bestowed salvaged items with personal meanings that eclipsed the complex’s Nazi associations (although post-unification the same residents lamented the organized asset-stripping of the site as symptomatic of free-market greed). The weaving of collective and personal memory is also explored by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0309132512462271">Armstrong (2010</xref>), who finds in semi-abandoned small towns in rural Saskatchewan ‘degrees of translatability and embedded memory’ that expose the ‘multi-layered and polyvocal’ (p. 277) traces of individual lives lived in a harsh landscape, like ‘a collection of ragged knots with no clear beginning or end’ (p. 281). Similarly, in her excavation of the residual material culture at a Montana homestead, DeSilvey explores how a practice of ‘salvage memory’ unearthed ‘sideways glimpses of the overlapping terrain between intimate experience and collective practice’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0309132512462271">2007a</xref>: 420). DeSilvey describes how, faced with the difficulty of narrativizing and curating ‘the sheer perplexity and promiscuity of the waste things’ found at the homestead, she instead ‘teased out the shape of an alternative engagement with a place and its discards’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0309132512462271">2007b</xref>: 881) and ‘critically and playfully examined the way things are selected, sorted, and preserved in the name of memory’ (pp. 896–897).</p>
<p>These accounts of the exploration and appropriation of abandoned spaces highlight how ruined spaces accommodate, and even encourage, alternative sensual and imaginative engagements with the past (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0309132512462271">Edensor, 2005b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0309132512462271">2008b</xref>). In her essay on Orford Ness, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0309132512462271">Davis (2008</xref>) describes the host of thoughts, impressions and sensations that she experienced as she moved through the ruined techno-military landscape.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0309132512462271">2</xref>
</sup> In such places, the researcher’s own body becomes an instrument for sensing haptic and sensual aspects of past practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0309132512462271">Edensor, 2008a</xref>). In the ‘experiential ruin’, the bodies of absent others – the people who once inhabited the now derelict and deserted structures – are made present through an imaginative ‘embodied exchange’ with history (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0309132512462271">Garrett, 2011b</xref>: 1057). Such encounters may generate an appreciation for the lived experience of others, but they may also confront the researcher with an unsettling awareness of the potency of abject materiality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0309132512462271">Buchli and Lucas, 2001</xref>). Researchers writing about such encounters and exchanges often stress the importance of recognizing the agency of ‘things’ and material residues, and remaining open to the way that objects themselves may propose histories that run against the grain of accepted knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr115-0309132512462271">Olsen, 2010</xref>). As this work reveals, ruins may be excessive spaces, in which material and immaterial traces offer wide scope for direct engagement and imaginative historical reconstruction.</p>
<p>The unstructured exploration of possible pasts, and the encounter with involuntary memories, can perhaps occur more readily in ruins that remain ‘open’ – managed lightly, if at all, still caught up in dynamic processes of decay and unmaking. However, as we have suggested already, this liminal state is actually a fragile and ephemeral achievement. In some places, where economic depression militates against inward investment, ruins may linger for decades; in sites of more dynamic social and economic change, ruined structures are apt to be swiftly razed, reclaimed or restored. Thirty years ago, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0309132512462271">Jackson (1980</xref>) wrote about the essential ‘interval of neglect’ that precedes the ruin’s reclamation as a symbol of a faded golden age. Since then, many relics of the industrial past have undergone a gradual transformation, shedding their marginal status (as painful reminders of economic failure) to be reborn as restored memorials to past industrial prowess. ‘Consolidation’ (which refers to the stabilization of physical structures) is often a direct corollary of commodification in these sites, as once redundant relics become anchors for regional redevelopment and rebranding schemes. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr116-0309132512462271">Orange’s (2008)</xref> work describes how this process played out with the designation of the Cornish Mining UNESCO World Heritage Site, as people who had lived adjacent to mining ruins for decades realized that their informal practices of materials scavenging and fly-tipping (among other things) would need to give way to the more narrowly defined encounters prescribed by the appreciation of these sites as ‘industrial heritage’. The resignification of these sites – driven by desires to frame their preservation with a singular, legible narrative – risks the erasure of other, messier, memories and forms of experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0309132512462271">Edensor, 2005a</xref>).</p>
<p>Yet some approaches remain open to exposing the ongoing negotiation between transience and permanence, even as the ruin is drawn into other orders of interpretation and recognition. In the UK, the ambiguous remains of Second World War and Cold War military infrastructure often linger in a state of limbo, not allowed to be demolished but not considered valuable enough to merit expenditure on stabilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr122-0309132512462271">Penrose, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr155-0309132512462271">Strange and Walley, 2007</xref>). The National Trust’s policy of ‘continued ruination’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0309132512462271">Davis, 2008</xref>) for selected structures on Orford Ness makes a virtue of benign neglect, while in many of the ghost towns of the western USA managers aim to maintain a state of apparent non-intervention, or ‘arrested decay’, in order to confer an aura of ‘authenticity’ to these sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0309132512462271">DeLyser, 1999</xref>). The landscape parks of Germany’s Ruhr region also incorporate states of partial ruination, such as at Emscher Park, Duisberg, where parts of a disused ironworks complex have been utilized for recreational purposes while other sections are allowed to continue to decay and become colonized by vegetation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0309132512462271">Barndt, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr89-0309132512462271">Langhorst, 2004</xref>). A similar mobilization of ‘decrepitude as a self-conscious preservation strategy’ plays out at the Haus Schwarzenberg in Berlin, where, in the midst of widespread gentrification and restoration, this multi-purpose building has been left to rot and crumble in a deliberate act of ‘counter-preservation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr133-0309132512462271">Sandler, 2011</xref>: 687). As Sandler observes, however, all of these approaches contain an element of ‘contrivance and intentionality’ (p. 691). The potential for a fully non-interventionist ‘entropic heritage’ practice, acknowledging processes of ruination without seeking to manipulate or mediate them, has yet to be realized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0309132512462271">DeSilvey, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>While the restored ruin might close down certain forms of engagement and experience, it is impossible to entirely constrain the ruin’s potential meanings: an element of unruliness and unpredictability will always remain. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr159-0309132512462271">Trigg (2009</xref>), in his study of the ruins of the Auschwitz gas chamber, explores how this site refuses to conform to the narrative that is offered to frame its presence, and instead insists on the visceral emergence of the past into the present. At such sites we encounter the ruin as a haunted space, dense with spectral absences that cannot be filled, or interpreted rationally. Other sites of dark history, such as the former SS and Gestapo headquarters in Berlin, have been deliberately destroyed in an attempt to exorcise their ghosts, though the symbolic force of ruins may linger long after material traces have passed into oblivion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr157-0309132512462271">Till, 2005</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0309132512462271">Gordillo (2011</xref>) describes how in the late 19th century the remote Rivadavia district of Argentina was slated for massive economic development, but siltation of the Bermejo River, crucial for access and trade, led to the cessation of development activity and the stranding of several ships. Although all traces of these ships have vanished (with the exception of one ship’s boiler, mounted in a town plaza), legends persist and the ships continue to be invested with mythical stature as symbols of future prosperity and potential.</p>
<p>To return to the broader questions posed by this paper: what might be seen to motivate the recent interest in ruins as sites of counter-history and alternative engagements with the past? In an era when heritage has been a key ingredient in the regeneration of places and the consolidation of place identity, ruins present striking opportunities to cast a critical light on the glorification of some historical sites and the neglect of others. Ruins may also be attractive as relic spaces that can provide a material, unmediated experience of the past in an increasingly dematerialized, digitized world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0309132512462271">Boym, 2010</xref>). Dawdy has suggested that ‘ruin revival indexes an emerging fixation on time itself’, and a desire to scramble temporal orders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0309132512462271">2010</xref>: 762). All of these theories are plausible, but none can bear the full burden of explanation. In fact, the desire to find a singular explanation that will make sense of the current fixation is perhaps misguided. What is more important is finding the critical and creative resources that will allow researchers to articulate how ruination opens up undisclosed and often abject aspects of human experience. Recent work on ‘spectral geographies’ provides some points of orientation here (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0309132512462271">Adey and Maddern, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0309132512462271">Degen and Hetherington, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0309132512462271">Edensor, 2005c</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0309132512462271">2008a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0309132512462271">Holloway and Kneale, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr108-0309132512462271">Matless, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr125-0309132512462271">Pile, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr169-0309132512462271">Wylie, 2007</xref>), as does the work of scholars who engage with psychogeography to excavate the uncanny, indeterminate traces that persist in marginal spaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0309132512462271">Bonnett, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr142-0309132512462271">Smith, 2010</xref>).</p>

<title>IV Ruin (dis)orders: productive possibilities</title>
<p>In addition to generating alternative understandings of the past, ruins propose other ways of ordering and understanding the lived environment, and this reordering has significant spatial, ontological and practical implications. In this section, we consider how ruins create the conditions of possibility for the emergence of alternative orders and appropriations in ostensibly regulated urban spaces. We review the work of scholars who have focused on the creative potential generated by ruination and dereliction, discuss how ruins may break down normative divisions between public and private space, and suggest hybrid understandings of the entanglements of nature and culture.</p>
<p>In conventional urban planning and political discourse, the ruined space or structure is conceived of as a problem, a ‘locus horribilis’ which provides a refuge for undesirable behaviour. This view is encapsulated by a report of the British government-sponsored Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0309132512462271">CABE Space, 2003</xref>), which represents derelict sites as ‘blighted’ areas associated with crime and deviance that threaten the security of children and local residents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0309132512462271">Jorgensen and Tylecote, 2007</xref>). The report calls for design-led initiatives and the ‘efficient’ management of ‘wasted’ spaces to reduce ‘anti-social’ activities and reclaim them as productive, public resources. This managerial, interventionist discourse is countered, however, by a growing body of work that seeks to highlight the potential functional and philosophical value of these spaces. Work in this area has generated a bewildering array of neologisms and conceptual tags: ‘unofficial countryside’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr101-0309132512462271">Mabey, 1974</xref>), ‘edgelands’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0309132512462271">Farley and Roberts, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr139-0309132512462271">Shoard, 2000</xref>), ‘places on the margin’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr138-0309132512462271">Shields, 1992</xref>), ‘terrain vague’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0309132512462271">De Sola Morales, 1995</xref>), ‘dead zones’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0309132512462271">Doron, 2000</xref>), ‘anxious landscapes’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr124-0309132512462271">Picon, 2000</xref>), ‘parafunctional space’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr121-0309132512462271">Papastergiadis, 2002</xref>), ‘voids’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0309132512462271">Cupers and Miessen, 2002</xref>), ‘landscapes of contempt’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0309132512462271">Girot, 2005</xref>), ‘indeterminate spaces’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0309132512462271">Groth and Corijn, 2005</xref>), ‘awkward spaces’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0309132512462271">Jones, 2007</xref>), ‘found spaces’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr129-0309132512462271">Rivlin, 2007</xref>), ‘ambivalent landscapes’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0309132512462271">Jorgensen and Tylecote, 2007</xref>), ‘drosscapes’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0309132512462271">Berger, 2006</xref>), ‘loose spaces’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0309132512462271">Franck and Stevens, 2007</xref>) and ‘urban interstices’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr158-0309132512462271">Tonnelat, 2008</xref>). Not all of these terms refer to ruins per se, but all describe places shaped in some way by processes of ruination.</p>
<p>Many of the scholars working in this area use ruination and dereliction strategically to level targeted critiques at what they perceive to be the rigid and restrictive mechanisms that attempt to manage and control access to the contemporary urban environment. This work focuses on ‘ill defined spaces that are not officially or definitively occupied … ambiguous, unclear and not predestined for a specific use’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0309132512462271">Cupers and Miessen, 2002</xref>: 129), interstices existing ‘between a functional past and future’ (Tonnelat: 2008: 293). In contrast to single-purpose spaces that provide separated and discrete experiences in the urban landscape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr113-0309132512462271">Neilsen, 2002</xref>), ruined and derelict realms are argued to ‘exist outside the city’s effective circuits and productive structures’ (De Sola-Morales, 1995: 120). In this work, ruins are thus often mobilized to critique normative ideas about productive and unproductive space, and confound visions of urban order promoted by city marketers. De Sola-Morales (1995) suggests that ‘terrain vague’ is latent space in which the absence of formal use can create a sense of possibility and freedom. Nefs concurs in regarding such spaces as ‘playgrounds of urbanistic innovation and cultural breeding grounds’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr112-0309132512462271">2006</xref>: 50). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr120-0309132512462271">Papadopoulos (2009</xref>) asserts that they are sites of multiplicity with generative capacities, while Papastergiadis suggests that they are ‘zones in which creative, informal and unintended uses overtake the officially designated functions’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr121-0309132512462271">2002</xref>: 45). Jorgensen and Tylecote argue that, instead of conceiving of such realms as terra nullius, ‘their intricate topography of human structures and artefacts, natural growth and decay, could be treated as the basis for future site planning and design’, opening up ‘new possibilities in urban landscape planning and design’ that might critically question ‘the relentless production, reproduction, consumption (and destruction) of over-programmed urban environments’ (2007: 460).</p>
<p>The celebratory, iconoclastic tone of these arguments can nonetheless risk overstatement. Ruins may present the potential for alternative orderings and engagements, but they also contain other, more negative possibilities. The dark side of ruination and dereliction – danger, deprivation, fear and anxiety – is not erased by their latent creative potential. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0309132512462271">Cupers and Miessen (2002</xref>) acknowledge that while the ‘void’ can be considered a ‘domain of unfulfilled promise and unlimited opportunity’ (p. 83) it may also be associated with ‘an existential and sociological experience of loss’ (p. 80). These informal, indeterminate sites may indeed be utilized by a non-hierarchical, hybrid collection of actors who debate and experiment in search of new ways of urban thinking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0309132512462271">Groth and Corijn, 2005</xref>), but to others ruins are symbols of failure and abandonment, evidence of municipal indifference and social stagnation. For instance, Lynch makes a distinction between ‘wastelands’ – rich with latent potential and the invitation to free exploration and appropriation – and spaces that are functionally barren, ‘empty of life and movement’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr100-0309132512462271">1990</xref>: 26).</p>
<p>If the celebratory tone adopted by those calling for a positive revaluation of ruins suggests one point of potential critique, it is also worth noting that many of these writers are prone to excessive abstraction, and in their work ruined or derelict space often functions as a foil, rather than an actual physical location. However, the multiple potentials of derelict sites and ruins are not merely theoretical, for they are experienced via a myriad of other informal and unofficial practices. As the economic use-value of these places fades, other uses and values emerge as an alternative to, or in the absence of, other provision. Abandoned buildings are widely used by homeless people for shelter and may be ‘transformed by squatters into places of living, creating and performing’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0309132512462271">Doron, 2000</xref>: 253; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0309132512462271">Chatterton, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr158-0309132512462271">Tonnelat, 2008</xref>). Opportunistic salvage practices are undertaken by entrepreneurial informal demolition workers who asset-strip metals and materials from ruined buildings, trading these for cash or assembling them as second-hand building materials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0309132512462271">Hudson, 2012</xref>). Ruination creates spaces for people to grow vegetables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr109-0309132512462271">Moon, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr144-0309132512462271">Solnit, 2007</xref>), walk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr158-0309132512462271">Tonnelat, 2008</xref>) and dispose of unwanted material.</p>
<p>Ruins also provide spaces for unstructured play, exploration and experimentation, serving as unofficial playgrounds where children can imaginatively appropriate loose material to invent adventurous and risky games, and develop skills of balance and improvisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr163-0309132512462271">Ward, 1978</xref>). The absence of surveillance allows children to ‘live out their otherness to adult ordering and adult expectations’ and to actively occupy, control and manipulate these environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0309132512462271">Cloke and Jones, 2005</xref>: 330; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0309132512462271">Edensor et al., 2011</xref>). Ruins provide spaces for adult play as well, including adventure sports, musical events (such as the notorious warehouse raves of the early 1990s), commercial and non-commercial sex, alcohol and drug use, and graffiti composition. The phenomenon of ‘urban exploration’ represents a relatively high-profile instance of adult play, with adventures featured on the ‘site reports’ of Urbex websites. Urban explorers highlight the gendering of exploration, with attendant perceptions of risk and the masculinist reimagination of the intrepid explorer in forbidden or perilous space. Yet, as a loose gathering of non-hierarchical groups that accommodate diverse desires and motivations, the urban exploration movement is depicted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0309132512462271">Garrett (2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0309132512462271">2011b</xref>) as a radical reaction against the escalating securitization, spectacularization and commodification of everyday urban experience.</p>
<p>Other transient functions of ruined space are explored by artists and others who initiate improvisational, experimental projects that transform disused sites and structures into convivial and playful social environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-0309132512462271">Lang, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr123-0309132512462271">Petrescu, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr160-0309132512462271">Urban Catalyst, 2007</xref>). Ruins have been used as temporary art galleries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0309132512462271">Groth and Corijn, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr164-0309132512462271">Webb, 2003</xref>), film sets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0309132512462271">Finoki, 2009</xref>), settings for TV drama (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0309132512462271">Farley and Roberts, 2011</xref>) and venues for programmes of cultural events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr151-0309132512462271">Steinmetz, 2011</xref>). These art practices and cultural representations often foreground the contrast between the disruptive and disordered sensations that can be experienced in ruined space with those available in the more orderly, regulated city. An engagement with ruined space can enliven the body and coerce it into unfamiliar manoeuvres, and through this unfamiliar interaction critically interrogate the overcoded and over-regulated production in other realms of the city (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0309132512462271">Edensor, 2007</xref>). This disordering of normative urban sensation is provoked by the peculiar affordances available in ruined and marginal space: a ‘world of objects and surfaces proposing themselves to be seen, accessible to perception’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr158-0309132512462271">Tonnelat, 2008</xref>: 304) offers multiple possibilities for action and experience. In ruins, things usually assigned to specific functions become jumbled, and the absence of any ordering imperative allows for a more unscripted and loose engagement with space and materiality. Emergent sensual, material and aesthetic qualities reveal the inherent vitalism of all matter, its ‘liveliness’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0309132512462271">Bennett, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>These vital and lively properties become gradually more legible as the process of ruination takes its course. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr128-0309132512462271">Qviström (2012</xref>) discusses a disused railway network around the Swedish city of Lund as a complex assemblage of relations, now characterized by absences, discontinuities and broken connections. Certain parts of the network have been erased, while some have been reutilized as cycle paths and green spaces, and others are devolving into de facto wild space. Qviström’s acknowledgement of such incomplete dismantling offers a complex appreciation of the heterogeneous materialities, temporalities and spatialities involved in the redundancy of a network, and the subsequent enrolment of other actors: ‘ruins do not simply crumble, but are dismantled, reassembled and reinterpreted’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr128-0309132512462271">Qviström, 2012</xref>: 273). Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0309132512462271">Adiv (2011</xref>) shows how the abandonment of a Californian railway generated a semi-derelict landscape of industries and facilities, still loosely linked, though now by desire lines, forms of play and utility, and post-industrial ecologies.</p>
<p>These rewilding landscapes fundamentally challenge distinctions between ‘natural’ and ‘cultural’ orders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0309132512462271">Cronon, 2003</xref>). A rich ‘recombinant ecology’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0309132512462271">Barker, 2000</xref>) emerges in these sites, as the material remnants of industry become host to a range of colonizing species, both animal and vegetable. Such spaces are perhaps best understood as ‘ecological cofabrications’, where a unique ‘politics of conviviality’ accommodates both human and non-human agency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0309132512462271">Hinchliffe et al., 2005</xref>). Qvistrom argues that dereliction is an essentially transgressive state: ‘Every place has a past and a former order, and if abandoned it will disintegrate into ruins or become ruderal … two closely related terms describing the transgression of the divide between nature and culture’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr127-0309132512462271">2007</xref>: 271). Several research studies have focused on the biodiverse ecologies that thrive in brownfields and post-industrial spaces. Lorimer’s discussion of brownfield sites and living roofs develops a ‘fluid biogeography [that] draws attention to the cosmopolitanism of the nonhuman realm and the diverse communities that inhabit and claim to speak for it’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr96-0309132512462271">2008</xref>: 2057). Llanelli’s disused steelworks and abandoned fuel-ash lagoons are wildlife ‘hotspots’ and botanical refuges, and adjacent to Canvey Island town a substrate of dredged silt (deposited as the base for an oil terminal which was never built) supports a rich community of plant life and provides a nationally important refuge for rare insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0309132512462271">Castree, 2005</xref>). Yet this diversity is often overlooked because it does not fit within ‘the standardization of ecological knowledge and its stabilization through a typology of wildlife communities’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0309132512462271">Harrison and Davies, 2002</xref>: 106). Jorgensen and Tylecote argue that such ‘interstitial wildernesses’:
<disp-quote>
<p>are evolving landscapes which re-connect our natural-cultural selves in the context of our urban existence. Their ambivalence and ambiguity should not be seen as a failing but as a reservoir of meanings, which may be constantly elaborated and explored. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0309132512462271">Jorgensen and Tylecote, 2007</xref>: 458)</p>
</disp-quote> The same recombinant processes that produce the rich ecologies of brownfield sites occur within remnant structures, and indeed these processes are responsible for generating much of the aesthetic attraction of ruins as discussed in previous sections. As soon as buildings have been abandoned, they start to fall apart, revealing the unheralded centrality of the continuous, ongoing maintenance and repair of the material world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0309132512462271">DeSilvey, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0309132512462271">Edensor, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0309132512462271">Graham and Thrift, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0309132512462271">Gregson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr94-0309132512462271">Lofgren, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr146-0309132512462271">Spelman, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr166-0309132512462271">Wilford, 2008</xref>). The texture and appearance of decaying objects foregrounds an emergent aesthetics, as function becomes subservient to form and substance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0309132512462271">Edensor, 2005c</xref>). Numerous agents – moisture, bacteria, chemicals, rodents, birds, wind – transform the qualities of matter, exposing what Smithson regarded as the myth that things are enduring, discrete entities. Instead, he argues, ‘solids are particles built up around flux, they are objective illusions supporting grit, a collection of surfaces ready to be cracked’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr143-0309132512462271">Smithson, 1996</xref>: 107). Ruination presents the possibility of renegotiating the porous border between social and ecological ontological orderings, and ‘interrogates dichotomies between … human and non-human, self and other’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr119-0309132512462271">Pálsson, 2013</xref>). Such a shifted perspective, however, must guard against indulging in a haze of ‘naturalized entropic drift and dissolution’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0309132512462271">Cunningham, 2011</xref>) that loses sight of the very real economic and social processes that led to abandonment in the first place.</p>
<p>The intensification of recent scholarship on ruins and dereliction may be seen as a reaction to the proliferation of managed and structured public spaces, and the desire for unmanaged and formless spaces to act as a kind of alternative public realm. As city centres are redesigned and transformed into aesthetically coded shopping and entertainment venues, festival market places, cultural quarters, malls and heritage districts, the lively conviviality and heterogeneity championed by the likes of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0309132512462271">Jacobs (1961</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr137-0309132512462271">Sennett (1970</xref>) is displaced and devalued. Exchange value replaces social value, and opportunities for interaction and sensory stimulation are edged out as rigorous maintenance and surveillance restricts the movements of things and people conceived as ‘out of place’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0309132512462271">Cresswell, 1996</xref>). Derelict spaces are proffered as sites that, by contrast, are replete with latent possibilities and greater scope for conviviality, experimentation and expression. Ruin enthusiasts and scholars critique the proliferation of single-purpose spaces and particular kinds of design orthodoxies, but their arguments often have a historical echo in the proponents of the picturesque, who similarly used their privileged and enlightened positions to challenge prevailing ideas about regimented landscape forms and to celebrate unruly vegetation, ruined structures and the potential for imaginative engagement these spaces offered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr171-0309132512462271">Zucker, 1961</xref>). The work discussed in this section is perhaps most useful in informing a more critical and creative perspective on the embedded ambiguities and oddities of all space, rather than restricting its focus to those spaces deemed (by someone) to be outside the pale.</p>

<title>V Attractions/directions</title>
<p>No doubt much recent writing can be criticized for its somewhat romantic celebration of the alterity of ruins. Many of the approaches that we have discussed here conceive of ruins as symbols of ‘nostalgia for modernity’ and the failed promises of the industrial age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0309132512462271">Huyssen, 2006</xref>). Casting a critical eye on this situation, film-maker Patrick Keiller glumly suggests that, because ‘we no longer have the power or energy to imagine a better world, we now poeticize dilapidation’ (in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr168-0309132512462271">Worpole, 2011</xref>: 47), and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0309132512462271">Cunningham (2011</xref>) similarly critiques the hyperbolic aestheticization of decay: ‘In the image world of hopefully “late” capitalism the industrial ruin has acquired a fair amount of cultural capital, and such over-determination is a major reason for ennui with corroded concrete’. Daniels concurs, suggesting that ruins and other marginal sites have become banal, having been ‘colonized by deep topographers, new nature writers, literary cartographers and psychogeographers’, rendering them ‘increasingly conventional, more central than peripheral to the cultural imagination’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0309132512462271">2011</xref>: 44). He implies that the ‘edgy’ and ‘oppositional’ aspects of ruins have been so thoroughly examined and appropriated that these sites have become ‘liminal zones passing into landscape scenery’ (p. 44), part of an emergent orthodoxy.</p>
<p>As Dawdy points out, however, romantic ruin fixation usually co-exists with a dystopic dark side, the two approaches distinguishable as ‘alternating currents in the discourse of modernity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0309132512462271">2010</xref>: 762). Within an apocalyptic frame, these places are premonitions of a devastated future – post peak-oil, post-capitalism, sometimes even post-human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr165-0309132512462271">Weisman, 2007</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr170-0309132512462271">Yablon (2010</xref>: 4) points out that reconsidering ruins as portending future debilitation is not necessarily pessimistic or nihilistic, but may be motivated by the pursuit of ‘pleasurable melancholy or sublime terror’. This delight is rarely innocent, however, focusing as it usually does upon devastated spaces, lost livelihoods and homes. The current fascination with ruins may thus be part of a broader aesthetic premised on sensationalism and anticipation; we are attracted to ruins to play out possible futures (and pasts), including violence and devastation, but also pleasure and excitement. This may be why many accounts that circulate around ruins articulate notions of disenchantment and re-enchantment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0309132512462271">Bennett, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr124-0309132512462271">Picon, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Yet, as the many accounts featured above demonstrate, the contemporary hunger for ruins transcends a simple romantic/dystopic dichotomy, and speaks also to urgent desires to experience and conceive of space otherwise. These desires may come into conflict (or co-exist) with other forces that attempt to label and control these spaces, whether in the numerous attempts to name urban disorder, in heritage strategies to arrest decay, or in the regeneration and reuse of industrial structures. However, because most ruined forms are inherently unstable and indeterminate, such inscriptions tend to be temporary and contingent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0309132512462271">Boym, 2010</xref>). While we have identified a host of ways in which ruins can be appropriated for various aesthetic, political or intellectual projects, we have also emphasized how the ruin’s ‘fundamental ambiguity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0309132512462271">Huyssen, 2006</xref>) repels interpretive fixing. The ruin ‘derives its power and promise from its refusal to be assimilated in the surrounding symbolic order’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr135-0309132512462271">Schönle, 2006</xref>: 654). Ruins merrily transgress and collapse a whole set of binaries: transience/persistence, nature/culture, attraction/repulsion, power/vulnerability, potential/purposelessness, abandonment/appropriation, presence/absence, aestheticization/abjection. Their oscillating identities ensure that no stabilized meaning can endure unchallenged, as long as the process of ruination continues. One person sees a derelict lot, another sees wildlife habitat. One sees a painful reminder of a colonial past, another sees affirmation of a glorious history. An artist sees abstract beauty while a resident sees painful abandonment. A squatter sees a home whereas a neighbour sees an eyesore. There are multiple ways of making sense and use of these sites; in this paper we have drawn out a host of contradictory impulses, attractions and evocations.</p>
<p>Although the critical power of ruins is fragile and tenuous, open to subversion and dilution, the desires explored in this paper – for resensualization, adventure, playfulness, contingency, the fleeting, the ephemeral and the incommensurable – testify to a gathering surge of resistance against the logics of commerce and bureaucracy that often seem to suffuse contemporary space and close off other possibilities. It is primarily their potential to offer a critical perspective on the contemporary production of space, we contend, that explains why ruins of the recent past have become such attractive objects of scholarship and contemplation.</p>
<p>The research discussed in this paper draws on a diverse range of methodological approaches – archival to experiential, analytical to embodied, visual to visceral. Ruins rarely lend themselves to representation in seamless narratives and, as we have inferred throughout, their indeterminacy and openness invites the testing of playful and experimental methods which attempt to articulate their complexity, and treat the ruined space both as a ‘way of seeing’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0309132512462271">Harbison, 1993</xref>) and as a material site for practice and action. Innovative methods for further investigation of ruins might include multi-sensory ethnographies which pinpoint the diverse and changing qualities of particular sites, or forms of action research which prompt participating groups to devise temporary practices in derelict space, expanding their potential uses and meanings. Alternatively, the accounts of botanists, temporary dwellers, former workers and urban explorers could be collected to form compositions of multivocal narratives which capture the fluid meanings that circulate around particular ruins and foreground the multiplicity of these places.</p>
<p>Many of the preoccupations and critical approaches already evident in ruin scholarship intersect with current geographical research, which, by virtue of its embrace of conceptual hybridity and border-crossing methodologies, has the potential to unlock critical synergies across diverse areas of disciplinary interest. A host of geographical approaches might be used to extend ruin analysis, and here we cite four possibilities. First, emerging approaches in historical and cultural geography offer critical tools for situating ruins in their particular spatial, historical and cultural contexts, and understanding their symbolic and allegorical significance as a material and social effect. As we have seen above, the interpretation and appropriation of specific sites depends on their location within settings ranging from the post-industrial to the post-colonial, and from the post-socialist to the post-military. Second, geography’s interest in temporality and materiality might be brought to bear on theorizing the <italic>process</italic> of ruination, and exploring the unstable and fluid entities that make and unmake the ruined form. As sites where material vitalism is accelerated and highly visible, ruins provide exemplary opportunities for study of the continual, dynamic transformation of matter and the contingent constitution of place. Third, an emphasis on the processual opens up scope for non-representational investigations of ruins, which, by drawing on current research into embodied geographies, might moderate the overriding focus on the visual in ruin scholarship and focus attention on the ways in which the material qualities of ruins afford particular sensual and affective experiences. Fourth, research could develop a more sustained understanding of how ruins are incorporated into networks and assemblages, by exploring, for example, the relational transformations that delink sites from dissolving infrastructures, and the ways in which derelict space becomes enrolled into new networks.</p>
<p>Beyond an exclusive focus on ruins and ruin-scholarship, the key themes identified in this paper chime with broader critical geographical concerns: about accelerating processes of economic restructuring and creative destruction, in a world where terra firma seems less secure than ever; about how we might respond to such transformations in composing historical narratives and organizing memories that complement and challenge official accounts; about the processes that produce aestheticized, commodified and tightly regulated urban spaces and undermine attempts to practise and imagine the city otherwise; and about more relational conceptions of urban ecology wherein non-humans are acknowledged as co-constituents of the city. Research into ruins, we argue, can inform and energize critical investigations of how expressions of power and resistance, and relegation and recuperation, circulate and inhere in all spaces.</p>
