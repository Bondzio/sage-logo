<p>From her opening sentence to her concluding reflections, Mary Jo Hatch artfully deconstructs the title and topic of her text. Despite the best attempts of her publishers to present this book as a contemporary inquiry into organizations as clearly demarcated thing-like entities, the author problematizes this understanding by inviting us to reconsider the relationships which tie together the secular trinity of organizations, organization and organizing. This is a book which is suitable for the general reader who welcomes the prospect of intellectual challenge to their everyday assumptions about organizational life. It is also likely to appeal to students and scholars, including those who are already familiar with Hatch’s work on organizational culture and symbolism, such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1350507611426451">Hatch and Cunliffe (1997)</xref>, which informs much of the thinking.</p>
<p>The introductory chapter is characteristically vivid, accessible and thought provoking, and begins by inviting the reader to consider a variety of organizational scenarios including rolling a large stone uphill, putting a man on the moon and supplying the Tsuskiji fish market in Tokyo. While many organizational scholars may now be familiar with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1350507611426451">Weick’s (1995)</xref> maxim that we should ‘stamp in verbs’ and the concerns of process philosophers for ‘organizational becoming’, such approaches will be less familiar to the uninitiated general reader. Hatch therefore provides a clear and friendly guide in explaining, for example, the ways in which the three Os of ‘organization’ and ‘organizations’ and ‘organizing’ may function and interrelate as nouns and verbs.</p>
<p>In a prose style which is, by various turns, conversational, elegant and gently humorous, Hatch suggests that organization can be thought of as either outcome or process, but that ‘it is tough to think both ways at once’. This is necessarily so, since ‘you have to be present in the moment to experience organizing, whereas you can observe organization(s) after the fact of their becoming’ (p. 9). As if anticipating the disparate nature and learning styles of her readership, Hatch articulates these distinctions through a variety of complementary means. Those with a preference for the visual and diagrammatic are well served throughout the book, and in this instance Hatch sets out a classic 2 x 2 matrix which contrasts Organization as entity and the generic act of organizing with Organizations as specific cases (e.g. IBM, The Red Cross) and Organizing as an actual process. Those who are familiar with the world of science may appreciate the analogy to the duality principle in physics, which recognizes that depending upon how you observe it, matter can appear as a particle or a wave, while others are likely to welcome the numerous specific illustrations such as Oxford University as a geographical entity and as a set of recurring educational activities. The conceptualization of these interlocking dimensions is articulated with alacrity, and throughout the text the reader is encouraged to reflect on the relevance of these concepts in an age of increasing complexity, globalization and technological change. For Hatch, the historical tendency of managers and organizational researchers to focus on outcome-based definitions needs to be refreshed by perspectives which favour richer and more dynamic understandings of organizing processes.</p>
<p>Throughout the book Hatch is at work in finding ways to activate and nurture the organizational imagination of her readers. In the opening chapter the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1350507611426451">Morgan (1997)</xref> is introduced, with particular attention given to the four classic images of organization as machine, organism (or living system), culture and psychic prison. A persuasive case is made for engaging with metaphors as means of understanding previously unnoticed qualities and aesthetic textures of organizational life. In the same way that the reader is encouraged to recognize the complementary insights and connections which are provided by ‘the three Os’, Hatch is keen to encourage the reader to appreciate both rational and metaphorical modes of understanding. Indeed, the importance of setting aside simplistic binary choices between the ‘right’ and ‘wrong’ ways of understanding organizations is one of the hallmarks of the text. Instead, we are urged to embrace the simultaneous existence of contrasting realities (such as the co-existence of cooperation and competition) and in so doing embrace complexity and paradox.</p>
<p>A whistle-stop tour is provided of organization as machine as exemplified by the scientific management of Taylorism and the functional analysis of companies such as Airbus, McDonalds and McKinsey and Co. Greater illumination is provided in the discussion of the organization as a living organism that depends for its survival on its ability to adapt to its environment and the idea that organizations, like organisms, have interrelated parts which produce a level of order and function that transcend the sum of the parts. The systems thinking of the biologist Ludgwig von Bertalanffy is then introduced, together with a helpful tabular representation of Boulding’s hierarchical framework of ‘systems within systems’. The thinking of such authors is explicated briefly but adequately with reference to the functioning of human biological systems (such as respiratory and digestive) and corporate ‘sub-systems’ such as human resources, finance and planning.</p>
<p>Given Hatch’s longstanding interest in symbolism and the affective dimensions of organizational life, it is not surprising that the metaphors of organization as culture and psychic prison are conveyed so richly. Hatch introduces the anthropological work of Clifford Geertz and illustrates concepts of custom, ritual and symbolism with an account of the formative influence of Herb Kelleher, the co-founder of South West Airlines. In this instance, Kelleher is seen to have played a critical role in fostering an organizational culture in which fun, loyalty and improved business performance are mutually reinforcing. The telling of a single accessible story is one of the author’s favoured explanatory devices and, in general, is one which provides an effective and economic means of communicating complex concepts within the tight constraints imposed by this series. Hatch is adept in balancing the light and the dark, and in explaining the metaphor of organization as psychic prison, she moves beyond conventional accounts of the transformative role of individual leaders. The thinking of Freud and Jung is introduced and seen to be highly relevant in understanding the disturbing and dysfunctional collective behaviours which may be manifested through the working of the ‘organizational unconscious’. Here Hatch provides a welcome corrective to the claim she makes elsewhere in the book that competition is a natural characteristic of organizations, and brings Morgan’s work up to date by relating the metaphor of the psychic prison to the contemporary concerns for environmental sustainability and social responsibility.</p>
<p>Having successfully orientated the reader to a variety of sophisticated conceptual schemas, the main chapters of the book proceed to address a number of basic but fundamental questions: what is the best way to organize, what does it mean to be an organization, who does organizing serve and how does organizing happen? In addressing the first of these questions in Chapter 2, the author explores issues of organizational social structure and design with reference to Weber’s work on the desirable and unintended consequences of bureaucracy, the organizational implications of Adam Smith’s thesis on the division of labour, and the relevance of Bentham in understanding the overt and subtle ways in which physical structures shape the patterning of organizational activities. One might expect the work of such figures to be explained competently in most, if not all, introductions to the study of organizations. Hatch’s book stands out for its capacity to introduce the ideas of less obvious and more challenging authors while connecting the concepts at hand to memorable and intriguing contemporary examples. For example, in the section on the influence of technology and the environment, the critical work of Heidegger and Marcuse is introduced. The work of these authors is supplemented with references to Orwell’s <italic>1984</italic> and the Wachowski’s brothers’ film ‘The Matrix’, which is also cited in Chapter 5 as an allegory for the critical postmodern critique of Enlightenment values.</p>
<p>One discussion of particular interest concerns the implications of new digital technologies and their contribution to the emergence of new forms of distributed and virtual organization. The example of txteagle, a crowd sourcing enterprise that draws on the contributions of people with mobile phones in developing countries, is informative and thought provoking. We learn how txteagle commissions a number of the two billion people who are estimated to live on less than $5 a day to undertake a range of text-, audio-, and image-based tasks such as translating short passages of text into their local dialect. These ‘freelance workers’ use their phones to receive assignments, complete tasks, mail in their contribution and receive their payment (typically a few cents per job). This example is one of many which would have lent themselves to a greater depth of analysis in the context of the theoretical perspectives introduced earlier in the book. Nevertheless, such examples may be considered to have served their purpose if, as I am sure they will, whet the reader’s appetite to reconsider taken-for-granted assumptions regarding the nature of organizational life. The concluding commentary suggests that while it is possible that formal organization may diminish and all but disappear, we can expect organizing (albeit in new forms) to continue to flourish.</p>
<p>In Chapter 3 Hatch proceeds to engage playfully with ontological considerations as she invites the reader to consider what it means to be an organization. Here the author conveys aspects of social constructionism, sense making and organizational symbolism with verve and evident enthusiasm. One senses, for example, her pleasure in introducing the thinking of Karl Weick, for whom ‘organizing exists, but organizations do not’ (p. 55). Hatch goes on to explain key concepts such as enactment in accessible terms, while also allowing space for the reader to appreciate the flavour of Weick’s distinctive literary style. Associated issues which are explored in this chapter include the nature organizational intersubjectivity and the legitimation of decision making with reference to the work of Garfinkel and the crisis of legitimacy arising from the conspiracy to cover up gross fraud at ENRON. Given Hatch’s prominence in the field of organizational symbolism, it must have been quite a challenge to restrict her exploration of this domain to a few short pages. Nevertheless, this is achieved successfully in the remaining part of the chapter, largely as a result of maintaining a consistent thematic focus on the dynamic qualities of organizational meaning. While the essence of Schein’s work on symbolism and organizational culture is conveyed clearly, more stimulating is Hatch’s own discussion of the ways in which symbols are constantly being created and changed through the expression of new meaning, or as old meaning takes on new forms. As Hatch points out, this suggests that not only do symbolic meanings multiply, but that multiple meanings will constantly shift about as processes of meaning-making evolve, often in unintended ways such as the provocative use of the slogan ‘Marlboro Country’ to adorn an image of a cemetery.</p>
<p>Chapter 4 addresses the question ‘who does organizing serve?’ and in so doing provides an idiosyncratic account of the nature of organizational power. The chapter opens with a brief acknowledgement of the insights offered by Marx’s critique of capitalist power. Recent concerns for workplace democracy and the organization of stakeholder influences are duly referenced before other dimensions of power are introduced such as formal authority and personal attractiveness. Curiously, despite being cited elsewhere in the book, this section does not include the discussion of Weber and his concept of rational-legal authority that one might have expected. In contrast, lesser known authors are introduced such as the sociologist Mary Parker Follet, for whom power is a source of creative energy which has the potential to transform and integrate opposing interests. Hatch notes that some feminist writers attribute the lack of take up of Follet’s ideas to her gender. It is appropriate then that Hatch proceeds to consider the politics of identity and diversity in some detail, before going on to highlight Foucault’s pioneering work on power and discourse. The chapter continues in a somewhat quirky fashion with an extended story about the behaviour of a pack of wolves which are looked after by a family who live nearby to the author. While this story may be helpful to some readers as a rich analogy for workplace struggles for power and status, I fear that others may read this account too literally and infer an implicit endorsement of biological determinism.</p>
<p>Chapter 5 revisits a number of themes explored earlier in the book such as organizational culture and identity. The case is made for understanding organization as a dynamic process of continual change, in preference to more traditional concerns for the way in which organizations should control disorder and regulate uncertainty. In a chapter which is widely divergent, the author highlights the antecedents of process thinking in the work Heraclitus, illustrates the theme of organizational change over time with a story about the growth of a small business dedicated to sale of handmade leather belts, and concludes with a discussion of complexity, emergence and networking. This latter theme is illustrated well in discussion of the distributed organization and partnership working associated with Benetton and the growth of social media such as Facebook and Linked-In. The diversity of this chapter is mirrored in the final part of the book, which asks ‘Where do we go from here?’. The answer appears to lie in directions which take us very far from the territory explored by more traditional organizational scholars, as Hatch invites the reader to consider such exotic themes as ‘culture, spirit and the new physics of hyperspace’ and ‘the art and craft of organizing: design aesthetics and jazz’. One wonders whether some readers may be experiencing symptoms of conceptual and sensory overload as consequence of these unexpected turns in their organizational journeys.</p>
<p>This book is one which cannot fail to stimulate and Hatch has undoubtedly succeeded in her implicit aim of firing the organizational imagination of her readers. Other recent guides to thinking about organizations have provided comparable clarity and accessibility in explaining complex and contrasting theoretical perspectives (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1350507611426451">McAuley et al., 2007</xref>). Hatch is also not alone in combining challenge and thematic diversity in such a short text, as the most recent revision to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1350507611426451">Chris Grey’s (2009)</xref> incisive and polemical guide to studying organizations demonstrates so ably. However, this book is likely to be valued by both the general reader and the organizational scholar for its colour, vibrancy and the infectious enthusiasm with which Hatch communicates her conviction that ‘We are made of and for organizing’ (p. 139).</p>
