<abstract>
<p>Since 1978, ASA has worked with poor vulnerable people to improve their socioeconomic status through delivering microcredit programmes in Bangladesh. This study aims at examining the effectiveness of the ASA microcredit programmes. It finds that ASA plays an important role in increasing the socioeconomic status of its beneficiaries and that there is a significant positive effect of the duration of involvement with ASA. Further, the effectiveness of the microcredit programme decreases with lack of sufficient amount of loans and training provision.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0269094212466036" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>According to the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269094212466036">Grameen Bank (2009)</xref>, microcredit is a special type of financial service for people who are underprivileged, unemployed, and unable to provide collateral to access the traditional banking system. The term ‘microcredit’ refers to programmes which provide small loans and other financial services without any sort of collateral for empowering women, supporting self-employment, and raising awareness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269094212466036">Daley-Harris, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269094212466036">D’Espallier et al., 2011</xref>). The Grameen Bank<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0269094212466036">1</xref></sup> created a new type of microcredit programme through its adoption of the group approach<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0269094212466036">2</xref></sup> to fight against poverty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0269094212466036">Morduch, 1999</xref>). Microfinancial institutions (MFIs) have provided financial services to poor people through the group approach on the basis of trust and personal relationships between staff and borrowers, although they take into account the income sources and inventories of households, for example bicycles, rickshaws, furniture, electric goods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269094212466036">Fernando, 2005</xref>). The objectives of the group approach include encouraging savings, improving the debt collection rate and the creation of platforms for providing training to borrowers so that they may gain confidence in tackling problems such as domestic violence, oppression, injustice, and illegal divorce (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0269094212466036">Zohir et al., 2001</xref>). Microcredit programmes also target small and medium enterprises (SMEs) for developing the socioeconomic status of poor people and easing the unemployment problem. It is not only widely known as a supportive programme for the poor but is also strongly believed to be a successful programme model that has managed to pull tens of thousands out of poverty.</p>
<p>The main research objective of this study is to explore the views of borrowers towards the microcredit programme in order to evaluate the effectiveness of the programme. It focuses on the impact of the borrowers’ socioeconomic characteristics, including income, living status, repayment, business skill, technical skill, social awareness, and child education, and how the effectiveness of the programme correlates.</p>
<p>Bangladesh has become well known to the international community because of its programmes and activities. Grameen Bank, BRAC International Ltd, PROSHIKA and ASA are world-renowned non-governmental organizations (NGOs) based in Bangladesh, and have played important roles. ASA is focused only on microcredit programmes, whereas Grameen Bank and BRAC International have provided other services such as health, education, and various types of awareness programmes along with the microcredit programme. Although there is no basic difference among these three organizations in terms of disbursing loans, to undertake this research we have selected ASA, since it only focuses on microcredit programmes. ASA used to stand for Association for Social Advancement, but it is currently known by its acronym ASA which means ‘hope’ in Bengali. Over the past few years, a large number of MFIs have been established both locally and nationally in Bangladesh. Today ASA has spread its operations to all parts of the country and has also been expanding activities gradually to some other parts of the world in a way similar to that of the other large NGOs in Bangladesh. Although Bangladesh is the pioneer in microcredit programmes, the evidence from Bangladesh regarding their effectiveness is as yet inconclusive.</p>
<p>Thus extensive research is necessary to assess the effectiveness of the microcredit programme. Huge numbers of poor people’s lives are touched by it, but there are other reasons for assessing the impact of the microcredit programme. MFIs obtain funds from bodies such as the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), the European Union (EU), the Asian Development Bank (ADB), the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), and the Department for International Development (DFID). In addition, a recent study conducted by the CGAP (Consultative Group to Assist the Poor) has revealed a growth rate of 15% for the world’s leading microfinance providers over the last five years. They are also making double the profit of the commercial banks. Moreover, according to the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0269094212466036">Second Poverty Alleviation Microfinance Project (2007)</xref>, the World Bank has disbursed $15 m for the years 2008 and 2009 in Bangladesh. Recently, the Government of India has expressed great concern over the activities of MFIs and is thinking about introducing an ordinance for cutting the interest rate charged, requiring borrowers to make monthly repayments instead of weekly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269094212466036">Banyan, 2010</xref>). Exploring the experience of beneficiaries in the micro financing activities in Bangladesh is a timely exercise.</p>
<p>The following section provides a little more background on ASA and offers a review of some of the existing literature on the activities of MFIs. The section after that introduces the methodology used in this study. The final sections set out results and policy recommendations.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-0269094212466036"><title>Context and background</title>
<p>ASA international (ASAI)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0269094212466036">3</xref></sup> was formed to assist microfinancing services around the world with funds from commercial and private investors. Under the banner of Green Field Operation, ASAI helps providing funds and technical assistance for MFIs to alleviate poverty globally. For this purpose, Catalyst microfinance investors (CMI),<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0269094212466036">4</xref></sup> a limited liability company incorporated under the laws of Mauritius, having US$125 m, invests in different countries around the world through ASAI. Gradually, ASA is extending a cost-effective and sustainable model for microfinance activities across the world. At present it provides technical assistance in The Philippines, Cambodia, Sri Lanka, India, Pakistan, Nigeria, Ghana, Afghanistan, and China (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269094212466036">ASA, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>In 2009, ASA had almost five and a half million members in Bangladesh of which 71% were women. It operates in 3011 rural and 283 urban branches in the country. In 2010, <italic>ASA</italic> reported that the outstanding loan amount (principal) in Bangladesh was US$343 m and that the rate of recovery was 99.59%. ASA <italic>c</italic>harges an interest rate of 12.5% (flat rate) on its lending (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269094212466036">ASA, 2010</xref>). On 3 June 2008, the <italic>Financial Times</italic> (London) and International Finance Corporation (IFC) jointly awarded ASA the FT Sustainable Banking Award under the category ‘Banking at the Bottom of the Pyramid’, for its cost-effective and sustainable model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269094212466036">ASA, 2008</xref>). In 2007, a survey in the US-based <italic>Forbes Magazine</italic> found that ASA was the top MFI in the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269094212466036">Forbes, 2007</xref>). ASA has been performing well, although its memberships declined to under six million in 2009 whereas Grameen Bank managed to reach around eight million in the same year (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0269094212466036">Figure 1</xref>).

<p>The microcredit programme appears to be an effective tool for reducing poverty that increases income, production and savings among the poor people in Bangladesh (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269094212466036">Halder and Mosley, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0269094212466036">Latif, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0269094212466036">Matin and Hulme, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0269094212466036">Rahman and Khandker, 1994</xref>). It has played an important role in reducing poverty, in promoting gender equality, human rights, and legal aid, and in disaster management and land reforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0269094212466036">World Bank, 1996</xref>). Studies have also revealed that the microcredit programme has enhanced women’s socioeconomic status by increasing their mobility, decision-making ability, social awareness, education, and scope of employment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269094212466036">Datta, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0269094212466036">Pitt et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0269094212466036">Ullah, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0269094212466036">Zaman, 2001</xref>). Marguerite Robinson<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0269094212466036">5</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0269094212466036">1997</xref>: 41) stated that: ‘Credit is a powerful tool but only for those borrowers who have the ability to use it properly and repay it on time’.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269094212466036">Khandker (2005)</xref> assessed the impact of microcredit programme in Bangladesh by using panel data from a household survey for the years 1991–1992 and 1998–1999. It was found that the poverty rate reduced by 20% during the period and microcredit contributed to half of the reduction. However, Khandker expressed concern over the impact of the microcredit programme. As the amount of loan granted is generally very small, the borrowers on the whole have failed to boost growth where the growth of the economy overall is very low. Recent studies show that the microcredit programme has a positive impact on the economy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269094212466036">Bruhn and Love, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269094212466036">Kaboski and Townsend, 2009</xref>). In the programme areas, business ownership and employment rates have also increased. Moreover, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269094212466036">Kaboski and Townsend (2005)</xref> concluded that MFIs with effective policies had assisted asset growth, consumption smoothing, and occupational mobility. Their study showed that ‘The Million Baht Village’ microcredit programme increased beneficiaries’ income and consumption but decreased future assets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269094212466036">Kaboski and Townsend, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite some considerable development and achievements by the MFIs, their activities have been under threat from officials, the business community, religious groups, politicians, local muscle power, and fundamentalists (Karim, 2004; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0269094212466036">White, 1999</xref>). Criticisms have been concerned with the use of a high interest rate, the possession of money and power without accountability, the alleged embezzlement of foreign funds, and involvement in local and national politics and profit-making business ventures. MFIs’ accountability is not clear in Bangladesh and an accountability system to clients still suffers from a number of deficiencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269094212466036">Khan, 2003</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0269094212466036">Matin (1997)</xref> has explored concerns about the debt trap of Grameen Bank borrowers. Borrowers of this institution are compelled to sell their land or borrow from other sources if they fail to repay weekly instalments. This could happen, for example, if funded projects did not generate enough income to pay the instalments. On the other hand, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0269094212466036">Osmani (2007)</xref> did not find any evidence of such a debt trap after informal discussion with the borrowers.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0269094212466036">Zohir et al. (2001)</xref> found a significant positive correlation between group functioning and group members’ performances. The success of a microfinancial organization depends on the group formation that brings joint liability among the group members especially through peer selection, peer monitoring, and peer pressure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269094212466036">Godquin, 2004</xref>). Loan recovery is expected to increase through social ties and homogenous groups because they facilitate peer monitoring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269094212466036">Besley and Coats, 1995</xref>). Moreover, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0269094212466036">Zeller (1998)</xref> has found that there are positive effects of group lending which results in higher repayment. Earlier studies have emphasized the effectiveness of peer selection and group homogeneity in leading to higher repayment rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269094212466036">Ghatak, 1999</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0269094212466036">Zeller, 1998</xref>). An empirical study on 128 credit groups from Grameen Bank, ASA and BRAC in Bangladesh by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0269094212466036">Sharma and Zeller (1997)</xref> suggested that variation of assets owned by the group members, even if it is little different in terms of land owned, has a negative impact upon the group<bold>.</bold> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0269094212466036">Sharma and Zeller (1999)</xref> confirmed that ASA maintained the following criteria regarding their prospective borrowers’ selection:
<list id="list1-0269094212466036" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>land owned by the borrowers is less than one half acre;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>monthly income is not over TK1200;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>people sell labour for at least 200 days in a year.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>It is evident that ASA, BRAC, PROSHIKA are mainly targeting those people who are landless or almost landless households that are the poorest of the poor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0269094212466036">Sharma and Zeller, 1999</xref>). Yunus<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0269094212466036">6</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0269094212466036">1999</xref>, cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269094212466036">Karlan and Validivia, 2007</xref>: 140) stated that:<disp-quote>
<p>I firmly believe that all human beings have an innate skill. I call it the survival skill. The fact that the poor are alive is clear proof of their ability. We do not need to teach them how to survive. So rather than waste our time teaching them new skills, we should try to make maximum use of their existing skills. Giving the poor access to credit allows them to immediately put into practice the skills they already know.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269094212466036">Karlan and Validivia (2007)</xref> have found that training is useful for microcredit in terms of high repayments rates and client retention. After receiving training, participants are able to show greater business knowledge, including keeping records of their businesses, and are also able to reduce sales fluctuations. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0269094212466036">Sharma and Zeller (1997)</xref> have shown that ASA, BRAC, PROSHIKA provide training activities in different areas such as entrepreneurial skill development, managing micro enterprises, shop keeping, crafts production, general awareness, family planning activities, and so forth. However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269094212466036">Karlan and Validivia (2007)</xref> warned that the programmes were losing some clients due to the duration of meetings that took place every week, putting people off from seeking further loans. It is claimed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0269094212466036">Langer et al. (1999)</xref> that more than 90% of programmes in the US focus on training activities, having transferred from an earlier focus on loans. By contrast, developing countries like Bangladesh, Indonesia, and Bolivia used to focus on training but they are currently focusing more on loans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0269094212466036">Schreiner and Woller, 2003</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0269094212466036">Servon (2001)</xref> has revealed that some fund providers prefer to pay for the loans rather than training but some of them still provide training to their borrowers in order to get funds from donors. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0269094212466036">Schreiner and Morduch (2001)</xref> have disclosed four reasons for avoiding training activities in developing countries:
<list id="list2-0269094212466036" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>most of the businesses are relatively simple and lenders expect borrowers to know about their businesses;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>borrowers will blame lenders’ training programmes in case of project failure – so lenders may face problem of getting regular instalments from borrowers;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>it does not necessarily follow that an efficient lender would be an efficient trainer; and finally,</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>training programmes incur some extra costs for the lenders.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-0269094212466036"><title>Data and methods</title>
<p>Earlier studies have applied a logit model in order to assess the effects of the microcredit programme, especially on social awareness and the empowerment of women, and found positive impacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0269094212466036">Mahmud et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0269094212466036">Zaman, 2001</xref>). This study is based on a primary dataset that had been initially collected for studying microcredit programmes and ASA activities in Bangladesh. Respondents were selected from ASA beneficiaries who had been involved in the microcredit programme for at least three years. The questionnaire design included a five-point Likert Scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269094212466036">Adams et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269094212466036">Dawes, 2008</xref>) which was used to explore beneficiaries’ attitudes towards their welfare under the ASA’s microcredit programme. Respondents were given five options to reveal their opinion from ‘strongly agree’ (5 points), ‘agree’ (4 points), ‘neither agree nor disagree’ (3 points), ‘disagree’ (2 points), and ‘strongly disagree’ (1 point).</p>
<p>Borrowers were asked questions about incomes, training, economic status, repayments, business skills, technical skills, social awareness, and children’s education. Borrowers from the Noakhali and Comilla districts of Bangladesh were targeted and the survey was undertaken in September 2009. Prior to conducting the interviews approval was sought and granted from the President of ASA as well as their research division. It should be mentioned that enormous support was received from District Officers of Noakhali and Comilla regions during the survey. Two neighbouring districts were chosen for the study because of their cultural similarity to each other. Proper training was given to the interviewers on various aspects of data collection. The questionnaires were subsequently checked by field supervisors as well as rechecked by data entry operators. There were 166,243 borrowers in the two districts. In total 400 questionnaires were distributed randomly among borrowers and finally 397 respondents were interviewed successfully (nearly 99%). The high response rate was made possible by the hard work of the interviewers as well as support from the targeted women borrowers sampled for interview.</p>
<p>We summed up the respondent points for the nine Likert-Scale questions that were asked to measure the effectiveness of the programme. The maximum and minimum scores were 45, if respondents strongly agreed with the nine statements, and nine if respondents strongly disagreed (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0269094212466036">Table 1</xref>). We considered that borrowers who scored at least 90% from the nine Likert-Scale questions believed that their welfare had improved as a result of the microcredit programme hence ‘improved beneficiaries’ were coded as 1, otherwise = 0. Beneficiaries’ improvement welfare was defined as those who had improved their income, economic status, business and technical skills, and whose assets had grown after joining the programme. Also taken into account were attitudes towards the contribution the ASA programme had made to improved welfare. The four selected independent variables were:
<list id="list3-0269094212466036" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>time with the ASA (AgeASA);</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>sufficient amount of loan provided by the <italic>ASA</italic> (Loansufficiency);</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>training provided by the ASA (Provtraining), and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>involvement with other NGOs or credit organization (OtherNGO).</p></list-item>
</list>Details of the dependent and independent variables are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0269094212466036">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0269094212466036">2</xref> respectively. To understand the effects of the independent variables on beneficiaries’ improvement we employed both bivariate as well as multivariate analyses. For bivariate analysis we carried out cross-tabulations for the dependent variable with the independent variables and performed Chi-square tests for associations. Finally, the logit model was built using all the independent variables:

<sec id="sec4-0269094212466036"><title>Results and discussions</title>
<p>As discussed earlier, as the beneficiary’s improvement is constructed by a set of socioeconomic characteristics, a preliminary analysis will help to understand the dependent variable (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0269094212466036">Table 1</xref>). The results indicate that a vast majority of borrowers expressed positive attitudes towards the ASA microcredit programmes. The highest proportion of respondents reported that they do mostly agree with all the selected dimensions used here to capture the dependent variable.</p>
<p>In this section we discuss the findings of the open-ended questions regarding overlapping involvement in NGO programmes, sufficient loan amount, and training programmes.</p>
<sec id="sec5-0269094212466036"><title>Are the borrowers overlapping?</title>
<p>Borrowers were asked whether they had been involved in any NGO or credit organization other than ASA. Overlapping is believed to be very common among borrowers and is a serious problem in programme activities. This is because borrowers who get involved in more than one credit organization might not be able to repay loans and they will not be able to turn up to weekly meetings either. The study has revealed that a majority (57.4%) of borrowers are solely involved in ASA. The term ‘involvement’ refers to the various purposes of involvement in another organization other than receiving credit. For instance, borrowers of ASA may have been involved in various organizations in terms of saving money, receiving training, or receiving formal education. For those reasons, borrowers are asked to find out how many borrowers enjoyed credits from other organizations apart from ASA at the same time. However, it is a matter of concern that 42.6% of borrowers may have been involved in another organization.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-0269094212466036"><title>Was the loan amount sufficient?</title>
<p>Why did borrowers approach different MFIs for loans? We believe that if one organization failed to provide the amount of money a borrower needed then the existing borrowers were bound to get involved in different MFIs to meet their need. That is why we asked borrowers whether the loan amount was sufficient for their project. It was found that 52.90% of borrowers thought that they were not getting a sufficient amount for their project from the ASA. We strongly believe that this is the main reason for overlapping.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-0269094212466036"><title>Is the training programme effective?</title>
<p>We know that training helps people to become more efficient. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269094212466036">Karlan and Validivia (2007)</xref> claimed that borrowers are able to show better business knowledge after receiving training. Considering the importance of training activity, borrowers were asked whether ASA provided any training activity or not. This study found that 70.50% of borrowers did not receive any training from this credit organization. It is reasonable to conclude that ASA was moving away from the training activity, and there is an important question as to why ASA was not providing more training given that almost 70.50% of borrowers thought that training was necessary. This concern has arisen elsewhere: for example, a study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0269094212466036">Schreiner and Woller (2003)</xref> raised concerns that in developing countries like Bangladesh, Indonesia and Bolivia, programmes were focused on loans rather than training.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-0269094212466036"><title>Bivariate analysis</title>
<p>Cross-tabulations were carried out between dependent and independent variables to test for associations (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0269094212466036">Table 2</xref>). The chi-square test performed for the association between beneficiaries’ betterment and length on the programme (AgeASA) was found to be significant (<italic>p</italic>-value = 0.001), and indicates that time in ASA has a positive impact on beneficiaries’ betterment. Second, this study examined whether or not borrowers received a sufficient amount of money for their project. Beneficiaries needed a sufficient amount of money to run their projects smoothly, and eventually a successful project could help borrowers to continue their weekly repayments whilst meeting their daily living needs. The chi-square test performed between beneficiaries’ betterment and loan sufficiency implied that Loansufficiency is associated with beneficiaries’ betterment (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). Third, borrowers’ betterment and OtherNGO are found to be associated to each other (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). This can be explained by the fact that ASA does not provide a sufficient amount of money to a majority to borrowers, therefore a number of them are bound to go to the other credit organizations to make up their cash requirements. Moreover, other NGO involvement may be associated with lower socioeconomic status which otherwise tends to lower outcomes.</p>
<p>The chi-square test did not show a strong association between training (Provtraining) and borrowers’ betterment. This unexpected finding may be due to confounding effects of other variables. The effect of training is dealt with in the multivariate analysis. It should be borne in mind that a large number of borrowers responding to this survey were not in a training programme.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec9-0269094212466036"><title>Multivariate analysis</title>
<p>Multivariate analysis allows us to provide the effects of each predictor while controlling for all remaining variables in the model. The results of the logit model (logistic regression) are depicted in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0269094212466036">Table 3</xref>. It has been found that all four predictors are significantly related with the dependent variable which indicates that the selection of variables is appropriate and the fitted model is adequate.

<p>ASA has been working with poor people over the last three decades. We can say that poor people stick to ASA for improving their overall livelihood and status. The duration with ASA (AgeASA) variable is found to be significant and positively related with the dependent variable. In other words, a shorter duration with ASA has less likelihood of improving beneficiaries’ status as compared to respondents who are involved for a relatively longer period. For example, those who were involved in ASA for 3–5 years were found to have a 64.9% <inline-formula id="ilm2-0269094212466036"><mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline" id="mml-math2-0269094212466036"><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>e</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>.</mml:mo><mml:mn>048</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>lower chance of improving their livelihood as compared to those who were involved for nine years or more. It means that beneficiaries are able to improve their socioeconomic status through prolonged involvement with the ASA microcredit programme.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, poor people have limited access to traditional credit facilities. However, it is very important to get enough money from the loan provider to run a project successfully. ASA gives a certain amount of loan to beneficiaries on the basis of their capability of taking a loan. In this study, the independent variable called Loansufficiency is found to have a positive significant effect on beneficiaries’ improvement. It means that those who are granted a sufficient loan are found to have <inline-formula id="ilm3-0269094212466036"><mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline" id="mml-math3-0269094212466036"><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>e</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>0</mml:mn><mml:mo>.</mml:mo><mml:mn>604</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>.</mml:mo><mml:mn>83</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>times or 83% (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01) higher likelihood of improving their livelihood as compared to those who do not get a sufficient ASA loan.</p>
<p>The logit model finds that training (Provtraining) has a significant positive effect on a beneficiary’s improvement. This means that those who have ASA training are likely to have a 67.8% (<inline-formula id="ilm4-0269094212466036"><mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline" id="mml-math4-0269094212466036"><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>e</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>0</mml:mn><mml:mo>.</mml:mo><mml:mn>518</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>.</mml:mo><mml:mn>678</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) higher chance of being improving livelihood.</p>
<p>Finally, overlapping in the microcredit programme is a big concern because it is believed that if the beneficiaries get involved with two or more microfinancial organizations they would not be able to repay their weekly instalment. It has been found that OtherNGO has a significant negative effect on the dependent variable which implies that involvement with two or more microcredit organizations reduces the chances of improving livelihood or overall wellbeing. This indicates that those who are also involved with other NGOs are 53.4% less likely to have improved their overall livelihood (<inline-formula id="ilm5-0269094212466036"><mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline" id="mml-math5-0269094212466036"><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>e</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mn>0</mml:mn><mml:mo>.</mml:mo><mml:mn>627</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0</mml:mn><mml:mo>.</mml:mo><mml:mn>534</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, p &lt; 0.01).</p>

<sec id="sec10-0269094212466036"><title>Conclusions and policy recommendations</title>
<p>The article uses a primary source of data set for the first time to test the effectiveness of ASA microcredit activities. ASA has been trying to raise the socioeconomic status of their borrowers since its inception. It has been shown that a huge number of borrowers are involved in several MFIs at the same time. Thus the question remains: ‘Why they are involved in more than one credit organizations?’ This study indicates that borrowers are poor and do not have sufficient education. One should realistically think about the level of skill of these borrowers to run independent businesses after receiving loans from an organization. The importance of training is confirmed by the finding in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0269094212466036">Table 3</xref>. The findings generally help us to conclude that the ASA programme is effective in increasing the socioeconomic status of its beneficiaries. The longer the period of involvement in ASA the better is the overall livelihood of beneficiaries, confirming the findings of earlier literature. However, it is found that the effectiveness of the programme suffers from an insufficient amount of loan provided by the ASA. This suggests that ASA should increase the size of loans. We would recommend reviewing the ceiling of the loan amount every two years.</p>
<p>Bangladesh is an agricultural country and most of its people are engaged in different kinds of farming. Poor people are not up to date with current technological innovations and production processes. They depend on traditional methods of cultivation which result in lower yields than those available through advanced methods. This study has found that training would increase the effectiveness of the microcredit programme. Training should be provided on the basis of the borrower’s geographical location and previous experiences. However, ASA is a financial institution, not a training provider, so we would recommend ASA’s District Officers liaise with the Local Office of the Department of Youth Development,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0269094212466036">7</xref></sup> under the Ministry of Youth &amp; Sports Bangladesh, for various aspects of training for its borrowers. ASA should select those borrowers for training programmes who are inefficient and have no knowledge of running projects.</p>
<p>Lastly, we should not regard microcredit programmes in a similar way as traditional credit practices where the main purpose is profit. Microcredit programmes deal with poor people. Therefore, ASA should widen practice and strategy from a preoccupation with loans and repayment to include skills development.</p>
<p>There remain gaps in our understanding of various aspects of microcredit programmes. It is necessary to establish the reasons why highly educated people are not being included in the programmes. We do not fully understand why some people improve their socioeconomic status by being included in the programmes whilst others do not and precisely how long borrowers need to stick to the programme in order to improve their living status.</p>
