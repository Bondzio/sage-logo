<abstract>
<p>Background: Although various solutions have been recommended for cleansing wounds, normal saline is favoured as it is an isotonic solution and does not interfere with the normal healing process. Tap water is commonly used in the community for cleansing wounds because it is easily accessible, efficient and cost effective; however, there is an unresolved debate about its use.</p>
<p>Objectives: The objective of this review was to assess the effects of water compared with other solutions for wound cleansing.</p>
<p>Search strategy: For this update we searched the Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register (Searched 22 February 2010); The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (<italic>The Cochrane Library</italic>, 2010 Issue 1); Ovid MEDLINE – 2007 to February Week 2 2010; Ovid MEDLINE – In-Process &amp; Other Non-Indexed Citations (Searched19 February 2010); Ovid EMBASE – 2007 to 2010 Week 06; EBSCO CINAHL – 2007 to 22 February 2010.</p>
<p>Selection criteria: Randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials that compared the use of water with other solutions for wound cleansing were eligible for inclusion. Additional criteria were outcomes that included objective or subjective measures of wound infection or healing.</p>
<p>Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently carried out trial selection, data extraction and quality assessment. We settled differences in opinion by discussion. We pooled some data using a random-effects model.</p>

<title>Main results</title>
<p>We included 11 trials in this review. We identified seven trials that compared rates of infection and healing in wounds cleansed with water and normal saline; three trials compared cleansing with no cleansing and one trial compared procaine spirit with water. There were no standard criteria for assessing wound infection across the trials, which limited the ability to pool the data. The major comparisons were water with normal saline, and tap water with no cleansing. For chronic wounds, the relative risk of developing an infection when cleansed with tap water compared with normal saline was 0.16, (95% CI 0.01–2.96). Tap water was more effective than saline in reducing the infection rate in adults with acute wounds (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.40–0.99). The use of tap water to cleanse acute wounds in children was not associated with a statistically significant difference in infection when compared with saline (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.43–2.64). We identified no statistically significant differences in infection rates when wounds were cleansed with tap water or not cleansed at all (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.07–16.50). Likewise, there was no difference in the infection rate in episiotomy wounds cleansed with water or procaine spirit. The use of isotonic saline, distilled water and boiled water for cleansing open fractures also did not demonstrate a statistically significant difference in the number of fractures that were infected.</p>

<title>Authors’ conclusions</title>
<p>There is no evidence that using tap water to cleanse acute wounds in adults increases infection and some evidence that it reduces it. However, there is not strong evidence that cleansing wounds <italic>per se</italic> increases healing or reduces infection. In the absence of portable tap water, boiled and cooled water, as well as distilled water, can be used as wound cleansing agents.</p>

<title>Comment on Fernandez R, Griffiths R. Water for wound cleansing. <italic>Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews</italic> 2008</title>
<p>Hand trauma generates an estimated 1530 outpatient consultations per 100,000 population per year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1753193412443640">Burke et al., 2004</xref>). The majority of hand lacerations are irrigated with sterile saline, pre and post operatively. In this 2010 Cochrane review Fernandez and Griffiths compared the use of tap water with normal (0.9%) saline and other solutions for wound irrigation. Most wounds that hand surgeons see would be amenable to the recommendations of this review.</p>
<p>Eleven trials were included, covering patients of all ages, wounds of all aetiologies, primary and secondary care settings, and trials from around the world, regardless of the quality of tap water. Only one study included hand lacerations (paediatric) and showed no difference in infection rates between wounds washed in saline versus those washed in tap water (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1753193412443640">Valente et al., 2003</xref>) . One study excluded all hand lacerations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1753193412443640">Bansal et al., 2002</xref>). The other studies included comparisons of tap water with saline, distilled water, cooled boiled water and various combinations. Irrigation versus no irrigation, and purity of tap water were also considered. The primary outcome measure was wound infection and secondary outcomes were, rate of wound healing or proportion of wounds healed, cost, patient and staff satisfaction and pain or discomfort. Owing to the widely differing studies the authors present the results as a narrative commenting on each trial. They conclude that tap water for wound cleansing is unlikely to be harmful providing it is of good quality (drinkable). Furthermore, the trials involving acute lacerations, which comprise a significant proportion of the hand injuries we see, reported lower infection rates with tap water compared with saline. In three trials postoperative patients were randomized to either tap water cleansing or leaving the clean wound dry, there were no statistical differences in infection rate. One of the studies found no statistical difference in rates of infection in open fractures irrigated with either saline, distilled water or boiled tap water (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1753193412443640">Museru et al., 1989</xref>), although this study was conducted on open tibial fractures in Tanzania over 20 years ago so may not translate to hand surgical practice.</p>
<p>There were limitations as the trials had varying methodology and outcome measures. Infection was a clinical diagnosis in all cases; six studies clearly defined their criteria for infection, the other five did not. Some trials used solutions of varying temperatures and volumes making comparison difficult. Nevertheless, the review does suggest that the use of fresh tap water is probably as safe and effective as saline for cleansing traumatic and postsurgical hand wounds.</p>
