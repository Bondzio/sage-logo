<title>Introduction</title>
<p>It is well known that patients who have undergone successful heart or lung transplantation face life-long challenges. It is generally agreed that transplant patients have to be taught about a new lifestyle, risk factors, medication, food restrictions, exercise, mood changes and stress management so that they can take active part in and responsibility for disease management after transplantation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1474515112466155">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1474515112466155">2</xref></sup> Risk for complications, side effects of long-term medication and psychosocial difficulties are realities after a heart or lung transplantation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1474515112466155">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1474515112466155"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1474515112466155">5</xref></sup> Moreover, patients can be hampered by the burden of immunosuppression and its potential long-term life-threatening complications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1474515112466155">6</xref></sup> Depressive symptoms in the long term after transplantation also have been reported.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1474515112466155">7</xref></sup> After the transplantation, patients describe varying degrees of contact with healthcare professionals from different healthcare providers, that is, the transplant centre, the local hospital or primary healthcare.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1474515112466155">8</xref></sup> A review article shows that healthcare professionals need to focus more on long-term support, often for many years after transplantation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1474515112466155">9</xref></sup> Non-compliance among organ transplant recipients is common, and healthcare professionals can reduce the occurrence of this dangerous situation by establishing a good relationship based on education, support, nearness and trust.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1474515112466155">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1474515112466155">11</xref></sup></p>

A number of informative and supporting structures in the healthcare system are present, but knowledge about how they are perceived is sparse. With the lack of research in this field in mind, the aim of the present study was to illuminate how patients six months after a heart or lung transplantation experience the information and support they have received in connection with and after the transplantation.</p>

<title>Data collection</title>
<p>From 1 August 2009 to 1 October 2010 patients aged 16 years or above, with the ability to communicate in Swedish, who had undergone a heart or lung transplantation about six months earlier were strategically chosen to ensure maximal variation in socio-demographic data and patient experiences.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1474515112466155">13</xref></sup> Gender, age, waiting-time, reason for transplantation and residence were specially chosen variables to ensure a broad selection. None of the patients had any prior relation to the interviewer.</p>
<p>The patients were informed by letter about the purpose of the study and that our intention was to conduct a personal interview. It was clearly stated that their participation was voluntary. The patients were later contacted by phone and asked if they agreed to participate, and if so, they could decide the location of the interview.</p>
<p>The study was conducted in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.wma.net/en/30publicat-ions/10policies/b3/">http://www.wma.net/en/30publicat-ions/10policies/b3/</ext-link>) and was approved by the Ethics Committee of Lund University, Sweden (LU 638/2008). The patients gave their written consent before the interview and were guaranteed confidentiality. They were told that they could withdraw from the study at any moment without any consequences to their ordinary care. The interviews were semi-structured and covered the following topics: (a) demographic details such as age, education and profession; (b) questions about information and support. The opening question was ‘Please tell me about your experience of information after the transplantation’. A question about their experience of support after the transplantation was also asked. Probing questions were asked for clarification and to continue the conversation. The interviews took between 10 and 52 minutes and were conducted in the patient’s home (7), at the hospital’s patient hotel (7) or at the interviewer’s office (2). The interviews were undertaken in a dialogue form and were tape-recorded and transcribed after each interview.</p>

<sec id="section10-1474515112466155">
<title>Data analysis</title>
<p>The text was analysed by means of qualitative content analyses as proposed by Burnard.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1474515112466155">14</xref></sup> The text of the interviews was read several times to obtain a sense of the whole. It was then divided into units based on aspect (the number of comments provided by each patient varied between six and 26), which were condensed, coded, sorted into groups with similar content and abstracted into sub-themes. Thereafter, three overall themes could be extracted (cf. Granehein and Lundman<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1474515112466155">15</xref></sup>).</p>

<title>Alternating between gratitude and satisfaction and resignation</title>
<p>This main theme consists of seven sub-themes showing a variation of revelations alternating between gratitude and satisfaction and resignation. The patients expressed thoughts on improvement of health but also on the appearance of adverse events or complications. They described how they obtained information and support from the healthcare organization as well as a lack of coherence and information transfer. The patients described the situation of being an organ recipient as a parent. Furthermore, they expressed gratitude and discussed their philosophy of life.</p>
<sec id="section13-1474515112466155">
<title>Experiencing improvement of health</title>
<p>Most patients experienced a rapid improvement of their health after the transplantation that was even faster than expected. However, the recovery time was perceived as heavy and long lasting, even if the patients felt well informed and were aware that it would take time to physically build up their strength again.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>‘I was informed in advance about the surgical procedure … I think I thought that my recovery would take longer.’ (P12)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1474515112466155">
<title>Thoughts when adverse events or complications appear</title>
<p>Some patients described suffering from complications in the direct postoperative period and still having after-effects. In retrospect, they expressed that they wanted to have more information about the risks for both mental and physical complications. Patients described that they had received information that an organ rejection could occur after transplantation. Knowing that a rejection is difficult to identify at home they often contacted the healthcare provider or hospital when they suffered from various non-specific symptoms. These situations were experienced as very stressful.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>‘I didn’t count on this kind of drawback directly but at the same time I knew that something could occur … you never know. I felt that I would receive a new lung and then work to improve my physical strength … Now it is something else [repeated fungal, viral or bacterial infections] that is limiting me, it is not the lungs but the rest of the body … that is what is clogging the wheels.’ (P5)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-1474515112466155">
<title>Obtaining information and support from the healthcare organization</title>
<p>Patients described that they did not remember much from the period of intensive care after the transplantation. However, they remembered that they were tired when they woke up and felt gratitude that they received information and support regarding physical activities already during the intensive care period. Furthermore, they described that once on the ward they received further information and support from the healthcare professionals as well as from physiotherapists, social workers and dieticians. Six months after the transplantation, they said that they received information and support primarily via telephone from the contact nurse in the transplant team and perceived a high level of continuity in the transplant team. The patients also described that the contact nurse in the transplant team was an important link to staff members and other resources especially if they needed support from or contact with their local hospital.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>‘I have talked to a nurse and in 99% of the cases it is the same nurse when I get my test results. I have the opportunity to ask if I have something on my mind. I find that absolutely fabulous.’ (P9)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-1474515112466155">
<title>Lack of coherence and information transfer</title>
<p>A few patients expressed their disappointment that their closest family or relatives had not been given any support in connection with the transplantation and wanted the healthcare organization to actively provide this. Patients described that although they received subsidized medical care and medicines, their health condition and overall situation drained their economy, as they had to remain on sick leave. The patients and their families faced many additional costs, for example, medical controls, taxi transportation, drugs, etc. Most patients described problems with the transfer of information between healthcare organizations and social services. The transplanted patients felt they were trapped in rules regarding return to work, transportation and family participation. They called for a greater understanding of the chronically ill patient and their families from the larger community.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>‘Now, she (the wife) cannot go with me (with benefits) to visit the hospital but I am very anxious about the anaesthetic procedure and it is comforting when she is with me. We have to pay that [the travel and stay at the patient hotel] ourselves.’ (P9)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-1474515112466155">
<title>Being a parent</title>
<p>Patients with children living at home were unsure whether their children understood what it meant to be terminally ill. They felt that their children desired a considerable amount of information related to transplantation. This information was often provided by another next of kin. When the transplanted patients returned from the hospital, their children reacted by not wanting to leave the parent. Patients felt this reaction was caused by fear that something serious would occur if the child left the parent alone. On the other hand, patients felt that their children were very happy to have a healthier parent. The patients expressed the wish that consultations or supportive phone calls could be provided for their children to help them manage their feelings regarding the transplantation.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>‘I called a paediatric specialist and was in contact with her a couple of times. She also called back and asked how things were. In particular about the wellbeing of the children and if they behaved strange in any way.’ (P11)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-1474515112466155">
<title>Expressing gratitude and philosophy of life</title>
<p>Many patients described how they learned to live more in the present after the transplantation. They found security in a philosophy of life that could rest on religious belief or self-esteem. Some stated that they knew that complications with the new organ could occur later and that they might be subject to another transplantation later on, but they decided not to think about that, just to enjoy life.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>‘The gift you get and if it’s from God or from whomever you get it … you must really embrace it. So far I only feel really, really happy.’ (P7)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-1474515112466155">
<title>Receiving a donated organ</title>
<p>Most patients denied having many thoughts about the donated heart or lungs, but when they had, it was shortly after the transplantation that thoughts about the donor’s age or gender had occurred. Patients expressed gratitude for the opportunity the new organ had given them. They understood that the law restricts all search about the donor and felt that this was a good thing.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>‘I am grateful for it … it is really amazing that you can do it. Mostly I think of it as my heart, you don’t think of it as someone else’s.’ (P8)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-1474515112466155">
<title>Striving to follow treatment strategies</title>
<p>In this main theme four sub-themes emerged. The patients described that they understood the importance of adherence, which was linked to confronting the drugs as well as the new diet and practising physical activity.</p>
<sec id="section21-1474515112466155">
<title>Understanding the importance of adherence</title>
<p>The patients felt that they had been instructed to follow strict rules regarding their medication, follow-up and lifestyle changes for the rest of their lives. They realized that this was their responsibility. They sometimes interpreted the planned treatment strategies differently, however, often choosing interpretations or alternatives that, from their perspective, benefitted them the most.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>‘The doctor said that we are very good at the transplant procedure, that we know, but afterwards it is up to you. One already knew that you have to struggle.’ (P6)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section22-1474515112466155">
<title>Confronting the drugs</title>
<p>Although the patients received information pre-operatively about the necessary drugs after the heart or lung transplantation, as well as the drugs’ side effects, the patients were surprised by the amount of drugs they had to take and that the doses were so difficult to adjust correctly. The patients felt uncertain when the doctors worked to optimize the doses of the different drugs.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>‘All the drugs and their side effects … it is not so good immediately after the surgery. In the matter of side effects, doctors can never really say. It varies of course, from patient to patient.’ (P3)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section23-1474515112466155">
<title>Confronting a new diet</title>
<p>The patients were aware that they had to avoid certain foods and follow the given instructions for handling of foods. However, they lacked clear, coherent, detailed, written information from dieticians about all the rules and time aspects of cooking. Patients described that even though they missed eating something specific, they did not have an issue with that restriction.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>‘What bothered me was that you got different answers from different dieticians regarding what I am allowed to eat and how to handle the food.’ (P15)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section24-1474515112466155">
<title>Practising physical activity</title>
<p>At the hospital all patients were aware of the need for physical exercise after the transplantation and they all received a written training programme together with coaching regarding physical activity. After discharge from the hospital few patients were able to follow the written instructions and train on their own, and most patients perceived the written instructions as difficult to understand. Patients described that everyday chores took over and it was hard to feel motivated to start exercising.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>‘I would have needed much more support from the physiotherapists. They only asked me once if I did my exercises. I said yes because I had just done them with the physiotherapists, that way I did not lie. They should have asked again and again. I took my walks and believed that was enough.’ (P7)</p>

<title>Returning to a relatively normal life</title>
<p>This main theme had three sub-themes, which relate to returning to a relatively normal life. The patients described meeting previously transplanted patients and how they successively returned to social networks and reviewing their professional situation.</p>
<sec id="section26-1474515112466155">
<title>Meeting previously transplanted patients</title>
<p>Some patients described a form of brotherhood with other transplanted patients, especially with those who had been transplanted earlier than themselves. They appreciated sharing their experiences with someone who could confirm their feelings and experiences.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>‘You should never compare your situation with someone else’s … how they [previously transplanted patients] are doing … but anyhow, you know that you are not alone.’ (P5)</p>

<sec id="section27-1474515112466155">
<title>Successively returning to social networks</title>
<p>Patients described that the more their strength came back after the transplantation the more they began to socialize with friends and family. From meeting with just the closest family in the first period after the transplantation they longed to meet others, albeit recognizing the need to be careful that no one in their environment was infected, particularly children.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>‘I have done this procedure to be able to live, not to hide for bacteria and viruses. If I need to be afraid for all that then there was no point in doing it [the transplantation], but I am careful when meeting small children or people with a cold.’ (P15)</p>
</disp-quote></p>

<sec id="section28-1474515112466155">
<title>Reviewing their professional situation</title>
<p>Six months after the transplantation, many patients reflected on their careers. They described a fatigue that they could not get rid of and realized it was best to begin working part time. Some patients pointed out that managers often lacked understanding and they did not know how to get them to appreciate the severity of their situation. Other patients had a good relationship with their managers. Many patients stated that they found it difficult to communicate how sensitive they were to infections and felt that they had difficulty in passing this on to employers, colleagues and others in their surrounding, for example, cleaning staff.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>‘Later I asked them to please sit on the other end when they had a cold … initially this didn’t work that well but then they got it … I was so afraid. I didn’t know how susceptible I was.’ (P12)</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The results of this study demonstrate that a heart or lung transplantation is a life-changing event, as can be expected. It was stated in a concept analysis that postoperative recovery is an energy-requiring process of returning to normality, including physiological, psychological, social and habitual recovery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1474515112466155">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>Patients in this study show that in general they were satisfied with the information provided, but some of the patients felt they did not receive sufficient information before the transplantation, specifically about risks for both mental and physical complications. This could be due to a lack of information, but it could also be that the patients’ cognitive ability fluctuated during the waiting period, which earlier research has demonstrated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1474515112466155">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1474515112466155">18</xref></sup> Another reason can be that some patients are very grateful for and excited by being placed on the waiting list so that future problems were of minor importance. In a previous study including patients on the waiting list for transplantation, the patients expressed that if side effects or complications occurred after the transplantation, they had to handle that then.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1474515112466155">19</xref></sup> The patients in the present study vaguely remembered the information on signs of a rejection. They had difficulties with this and several times thought that various non-specific symptoms could be a rejection and contacted healthcare professionals. Merckaert et al. showed that only 44% of stem cell transplanted patients could recall risk information, and information about death and infection were remembered more than that about rejection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1474515112466155">20</xref></sup> This indicates the importance of repeated and well-structured information. Therefore, relevant comprehensive, individual, evidence-based medical information given by doctors and other healthcare professionals is of great importance since there is otherwise a risk that narratives from other patients or information from the internet that is not quality audited etc. will unnecessarily increase anxiety and insecurity during the recovery period.</p>
<p>Grady stated that the presence of a partner’s support is important for patients’ clinical success in the early stages after a heart transplantation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1474515112466155">21</xref></sup> Not all patients in the present study received such support and most of the patients requested more information and support for their next of kin, and this should be a greater focus for healthcare organizations. The patients in this study found satisfaction in meeting previously transplanted patients, and with regard to next of kin, perhaps healthcare organizations could provide contact with other next of kin with experiences of transplantation, so that those who have less ability to be supportive could receive some input.</p>
<p>This study revealed that despite thorough pre-operative information about post-transplantation medication, the reality regarding drug intake came as a negative surprise. It is important that healthcare professionals establish an agreement with the patient if they want to be successful in guaranteeing effective adherence to drug intake, food restrictions, physical training, etc. In a review article, De Bleser et al. stated that a combination of different educational or behavioural interventions may be effective in the long term to increase adherence for transplant patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1474515112466155">22</xref></sup> This study indicated that the patients were aware of the necessity of avoiding unsafe foods, adequately cooking their meals, avoiding cross-contamination and adhering to careful personal hygiene practices. It has been shown previously that organ transplanted patients do not fulfil recommendations about food safety handling in a satisfactory manner.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1474515112466155">23</xref></sup> Since the immuno-suppressed transplant patients have an increased risk of achieving food-borne pathogens it may be a good idea to educate the patients regarding acceptable behaviour and food safety, and to develop guidelines that can be beneficial for the patient, their relatives and those healthcare professionals who do not usually care for transplant patients.</p>
<p>Despite the recognized effectiveness of physical activity the patients in the present study reported weak adherence to the elaborate physical training programmes. One study has shown that most heart and lung transplant patients acknowledged a marked improvement in physical activity after transplantation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1474515112466155">24</xref></sup> For some patients in this study the improvement during the first six months after the transplantation was perceived as so significant that they thought it was good enough. Educational or behavioural interventions aimed to enhance motivation and adherence should be developed and appropriately evaluated in healthcare organizations. Patients should be seen as learning individuals in order to help them achieve readiness, as described by Friberg et al. as a cognitive–emotive–existential state and emphasized as an important goal of patient teaching.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1474515112466155">25</xref></sup> In addition, in order to enable healthcare professionals to enhance their efforts to optimize motivation and adhesion, they need training in health behaviour strategies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1474515112466155">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>One study has described the uncertainty patients experience in being able to maintain employment after a transplantation, which could result in serious economic difficulties.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1474515112466155">27</xref></sup> The patients in the present study had questions about the possibility of returning to work and needed support from healthcare professionals including social workers in their dealings with insurance agencies and employers. Furthermore, some may need help to build social networks, such as contacts with a patient association or other societies. The direct link between psychosocial and physical health should not be overlooked.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1474515112466155">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>When a parent needs a transplant, his/her children naturally tend to worry, and they are afraid that the parent is going to die. This is a turbulent time for children since they do not know what is going on and parents in our study experienced situations when the health organization or social services could have functioned better. Moore and Rauch have described how to address parenting concerns of bone-marrow transplant patients and stated that healthcare professionals can assist patients’ efforts to communicate with and support their children by asking the patient about his/her children, providing some targeted information and discussing the potential impact of treatments on parenting capacity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1474515112466155">28</xref></sup></p>
<sec id="section30-1474515112466155">
<title>Methodological considerations</title>
<p>A qualitative single-centre study like this will have certain limitations, the first being the risk of subjectivity in the interpretation of answers. This was minimized by using two researchers, not involved in the care of the patients, for the process of analysis. The two researchers read the text independently of each other, constantly comparing and discussing the results, and the interrater reliability was high. Quotations were used to exemplify the findings. The second limitation is whether the results can be applied on a broader patient spectrum. With the study sample, involving a small number of patients selected from one transplant centre, generalization was not the aim. A qualitative study is suitable for the assessment of the concepts of a limited number of patients. Graneheim and Lundman proposed that the author can make suggestions regarding transferability to other contexts but that it is the reader’s task to determine whether or not the result is transferable and we suggest that the result may be transferable to patients sharing the same characteristics as the study sample.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1474515112466155">15</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="section31-1474515112466155">
<title>Implications for practice</title>
<p>Detailed written and oral information can be a useful base for fruitful conversations between healthcare professionals, the patients and their next of kin for better readiness. In striving to follow treatment strategies, regular information and support is needed from the healthcare professionals as well as internal self-motivation among patients. To be able to return to a normal life, patients, including those who have young children to care about, need support from healthcare organizations, families, employers and society in general. To facilitate this, healthcare organizations have a major role, personally or through social media, in mediating and facilitating information and support.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This study revealed that there are a lot of aspects regarding information and support that can be improved on the patients’ path from transplantation to a reasonably normal life, particularly patients with dependent children. The patients experienced gratitude and satisfaction because of a marked improvement in health. However, some patients expressed a feeling of discouragement due to lack of information and support once complications or side effects occurred.</p>
