<p>One of the first challenges in any book on global media and communication policy is convincing readers that there is such a thing that needs to be analysed. For some, policy-making is tied by its very nature to the nation-state, and globalization, in any and all of its forms, invariably causes national policy and regulatory frameworks to come unstuck. Whether this is to be welcomed or lamented then becomes the subject of debate, which would typically be based on how one views the nation-state as a guarantor of the public interest.</p>
<p>Others would see this as a minor sub-set of the more urgent task of understanding the dynamics of global capitalism, with the state largely acting as a functionary to enable private capital to achieve its expansionary goals. Writers in this tradition often invoke neo-liberalism as an overarching ideological framework that has led media policy-makers to abandon concern with national priorities and the public interest, and to become the handmaidens of multinational corporate capital. In the media policy literature, the focus can often be resolutely national and comparative, with detailed compendia about the differences in media policy between one nation and another, but little attempt to think beyond what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1742766512444345">Peter Taylor (1996)</xref> referred to as the ‘embedded statism’ of the empirical social sciences, where the roots of policy studies can be found.</p>
<p>Petros Iosifidis’ <italic>Global Media and Communication Policy</italic> does an admirable job of establishing the importance of critically analysing global media policy in its own right, joining other initiatives such as the Mapping Global Media Policy project that has been undertaken by Marc Raboy, Claudia Padovani and others through the International Association for Media and Communications Research (IAMCR), as well as a small but growing academic literature in the field. Iosifidis does this by avoiding a counter-posing of the national and the global as opposing policy spaces and, instead, stressing the central role that national governments continue to play, but pointing out that it is a role that increasingly coexists with the role played by a range of non-state actors who operate on a global scale. These include multinational corporations, multilateral clubs, international industry associations, international government organizations and global civil society organizations. It is the dynamic interaction between national and global, and between state and non-state actors, in setting the rules, laws, codes and norms that constitute media and communication policy, which is of interest in this book.</p>
<p><italic>Global Media and Communication Policy</italic> undertakes this task in four parts. Part One sets out the conceptual grounding of media policy and regulation in the normative theories of the public interest and the related concept of the public sphere. There is a detailed discussion of the varying perspectives on the public interest and the difficulties in constructing it simply around ethics and citizenship versus consumerism and markets, which informs a discussion of media policy changes since the 1980s and the ways in which international dimensions are layering upon shifting national policy priorities.</p>
<p>Part Two of the book deals with the theories of global communication, such as the political economy, cultural imperialism and globalization theories, and then develops an analysis of the changing relationship of the nation-state with media organizations and how this is understood in different media and communication paradigms. Importantly, Iosifidis argues that while it is the case that ‘since the mid-1980s, the terrain of media and communications policy-making has shifted’ from being something that was ‘essentially determined by national legislative and regulatory frameworks’, it remains the case that
<disp-quote>
<p>national governments maintain a significant amount of autonomy to shape national policy agendas and meanwhile continue to influence decisions in the international environment … it is the nation-state that decides which objectives to prioritise and consequently under which regulatory conditions the media will perform. (pp. 119–120)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Part Three of the book deals with global media policy proper, including the nature and role of supranational agencies such as the World Trade Organization, UNESCO and the International Telecommunications Union, as well as case studies such as the World Summit on the Information Society. It also addresses the development of media and communications policy in the European Union.</p>
<p>Part Four considers how media convergence is transforming the policy landscape worldwide, including the rise of regulatory convergence with media super-regulators such as the Office of Communications (Ofcom) in the United Kingdom. An important element of Iosifidis’ analysis is that while many of the principles of media policy and regulation such as controlling concentration of media ownership, safeguarding community standards and maintaining content diversity remain important, the context of media convergence and globalization also necessitates considerable innovation in terms of developing suitable policy instruments.</p>
<p>In particular, Iosifidis argues the case for a greater role for self-regulation and co-regulation in this new media environment, particularly in areas of content and social regulation, alongside the need to develop new mechanisms for international cooperation around issues such as privacy as they relate to new media technologies. Iosifidis concludes <italic>Global Media and Communication Policy</italic> with a cautionary note that ‘any new policy initiatives should rest on the principle that overregulation or inappropriate regulation of new on-line media and the Internet should be avoided’ (p. 237). As a range of reviews are taking place worldwide on how to adapt nationally-based media and communications policies and regulations to an era of media convergence, digitization and globalization, <italic>Global Media and Communication Policy</italic> is a vitally important contribution to such debates.</p>
