<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>We read with interest Al-Qattan’s recent article detailing his evolving management of unstable transverse proximal phalangeal fractures. Fracture stability is defined in part by the intensity of subsequent rehabilitation, in that an ‘unstable’ fracture that is protected without mobilisation throughout healing may preserve its alignment until union has occurred. Conversely, the philosophy of early mobilisation at our unit, aimed at reducing post-injury stiffness and optimising overall outcome, increases the demands for fracture stability, and the threshold for fracture fixation is accordingly lower. Implicit in this rationale is the need to preserve and maintain joint function wherever possible and avoid soft tissue transfixion through mobile regions. Thus we would strongly concur with Al-Qattan’s move away from K-wiring directly across a flexed metacarpophalangeal joint followed by 4–5 weeks of immobilisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1753193411433386">Al-Qattan, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1753193411433386">2011</xref>). Fracture union may be assured but stiffness is almost inevitable.</p>
<p>Open reduction and interosseous loop wiring can provide sufficient fracture fixation to permit early mobilisation and offers the advantages over the previous method of neither violating adjacent joints nor transfixing soft tissues. Using this method the author avoided post-operative splintage, achieved earlier mobilisation and better total active motion by final follow-up (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1753193411433386">Al-Qattan, 2008</xref>). Patients returned to work 1 week sooner, on average. There was no significant difference in complication rate compared with the earlier technique, although absolute numbers, and therefore statistical power, was low.</p>
<p>As an open technique, interosseous loop wire fixation mandates more soft tissue dissection than percutaneous K-wire fixation, which can be more time-consuming and technically demanding. Al-Qattan’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1753193411433386">2011</xref>) current strategy for proximal phalangeal fixation, by percutaneous K-wiring avoiding adjacent joints, therefore represents a natural progression, aiming to retain the simplicity of a percutaneous approach without compromising post-operative mobilisation. Marginal (statistically insignificant) improvement in total active movement was achieved using this technique, with similar complication rates to interosseous loop wire fixation.</p>
<p>The author should be congratulated on taking the opportunity to audit his outcomes with changing treatment protocols to identify an objective basis for favouring one of them. However, the departmental setup, in which a single operative surgeon was able to operate on all patients within 24 hours, and as the single surgeon presumably had a great deal of postoperative involvement, is uncommon and we would caution trainee readers against extrapolating these outcomes to their practice. Close supervision permitted good final outcomes despite long periods (up to 6 weeks) of immobilization. This aimed to reduce fracture redisplacement and was felt to be acceptable because joints were not crossed and attempts were made to avoid transfixing extensor tendons. However, in our experience mobilisation remains restricted due to soft tissue (including skin) impingement and oedema, which does not fully resolve until after wires are removed.</p>
<p>We prefer the skin entry point for transcutaneous wires to be mid-axial, where skin moves least during mobilisation, and intra-operatively test skin tethering throughout the range of joint movement, making a small releasing incision if necessary. Mid-axially the risk of extensor transfixion is less and we feel the reduction in repetitive skin movement during mobilisation reduces pin site and K-wire infections. The author illustrated using a single K-wire to immobilise a transverse fracture (although described sometimes using two). Fracture stability in all planes should be assessed intra-operatively, but generally we would recommend using two wires for such fractures to control both lateral and axial fracture redisplacement.</p>
<p>We would caution against prescribing any single method for fixing a particular type of fracture. Variables to consider include the fracture configuration and planes of instability, surgeon and patient preferences, facilities for post-operative rehabilitation and likely patient compliance with that strategy. Operative fixation aimed at permitting early mobilisation is redundant if the patient will not comply with their hand therapy regimen, if K-wires transfix joints, extensors or mobile soft tissues, or if they impinge on adjacent digits. All factors should be considered and an individualised management strategy devised that will best serve the patient.</p>

<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>First, I would like to thank Mr Urso-Baiarda and Mr Southern for their kind comments regarding my recent article and the evolving management of unstable transverse proximal phalangeal fractures. The authors have also made useful comments regarding transcutaneous K-wire fixation of these fractures. The mid-axial approach seems to be ideal. However, many of these fractures are open and it makes sense to utilise the existing lacerations if possible. I also agree that two K-wires provide better stability than a single K-wire. In all cases in which I have used a single K-wire, I have chosen a larger size wire so that it fits snugly within the medullary cavity. I also agree that the choice of fixation depends on many factors such as comminution and fracture configuration.</p>
<p>The authors have concurred with my evolving management of these difficult fractures. I consider this most interesting because I always believed that hand surgeons all over the world think and evolve in a similar way. Communications through our journal (including useful comments on published articles) will always help us obtain the best possible outcome of difficult problems such as these fractures.</p>
