<abstract>
<p>In this article we examine how members of fishing communities on the shores of Lake Victoria in Uganda respond to HIV diagnosis in terms of disclosure to sexual partners. We then explore the subsequent changes in sexual behavior and relationships. To access this information, we collected life history data from 78 HIV-positive individuals in five fishing communities. We found that the strength of the sexual relationships shaped how and why individuals disclosed to partners, and that these relationships tended to be stronger when partners shared familial responsibility. Those who perceived their current sexual partnership to be weak sought to conceal their status by maintaining prediagnosis patterns of sexual behavior. The majority of the study’s participants rarely changed their sexual behavior following HIV diagnosis, regardless of their relationship’s strength. These findings elucidate barriers to disclosure and behavior change, and suggest that a life-course approach might enhance individual-level counseling so that counselors can provide tailored support to individuals regarding disclosure decisions and outcomes.</p>

<p>The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disproportionately affects fishing communities in Africa, Asia, and South America compared to the general populations in these regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1049732313495327">Allison &amp; Seeley, 2004a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1049732313495327">Kissling et al., 2005</xref>). Kissling et al. estimated the seroprevalence among fisherfolk in Africa to be four to six times higher than the national averages. Many authors have pointed to the risks associated with fishing as an occupation and the lifestyle in the communities in which some fisherfolk live as the explanations for this disparity in prevalence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1049732313495327">Asiki et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049732313495327">Seeley et al., 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Fishing in East Africa’s freshwater lakes is a mobile occupation, and fisherfolk frequently follow income opportunities wherever fish stocks are most plentiful. Frequent and prolonged mobility often lead fishermen to establish relationships with women at various fish landing sites for domestic support, sexual satisfaction, and to secure trading ties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1049732313495327">Allison &amp; Seeley, 2004b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1049732313495327">Mojola, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1049732313495327">Westaway, Seeley, &amp; Allison, 2007</xref>). While traveling frequently among broad geographic sexual networks, the members of shoreline communities encounter numerous opportunities for infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1049732313495327">Nunan, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>In an analysis of Kenyan fisherfolk, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1049732313495327">Mojola (2011)</xref> suggested that mobility is not the sole risk factor for HIV transmission in the Lake Victoria region. Gendered and sexual economies also influence the shapes of relationships between women and men at fishing sites. Although researchers have documented the “fish-for-sex” phenomenon in various settings as an avenue for women to secure access to a fisherman’s daily catch, the nature of these relationships is not purely transactional (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1049732313495327">Kwena, Bukusi, Omondi, Ng’ayo, &amp; Holmes, 2012</xref>). In fact, many women regard their relationships with fishermen as established boyfriends/husbands and as valuable to their home life and their business (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1049732313495327">MacPherson et al., 2012</xref>). Nevertheless, many men and women have multiple successive and/or concurrent partners to cope with geographic mobility and the competition in the market place.</p>
<p>Fishing is a means of gainful employment for thousands of people in the Lake Victoria region, so scholars and counselors must recognize the vitality of fishing to communities and households along with the diversity of livelihoods and lifestyles related to the fishing industry. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1049732313495327">Westaway et al. (2007)</xref> warned against stereotyping fisherfolk as “feckless and reckless,” because generalizations detract from the complexity of fishing communities and the role of mobility in providing a consistent livelihood. However, the behavior patterns among those engaged in fishing can facilitate HIV transmission. Counselors must consider the particular relationship dynamics in these communities when designing interventions. Many of the younger men and women who move to fishing sites have left their families behind, experiencing for the first time the “freedom” as well as the challenges of living independently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049732313495327">Beuving, 2010</xref>). By narrowing the focus from population-level risk factors to individuals, the strategists of HIV prevention and harm reduction can target interventions in areas where individuals might have the greatest agency and opportunity to influence their own exposure to risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1049732313495327">Exner, Seal, &amp; Ehrhardt, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>An important component in this shift toward person-centric prevention strategies and treatment is empowering individuals in relationships to communicate their serostatus and to negotiate safer sex practices. A number of researchers have recently examined how diagnosis and disclosure to partners affect sexual behavior and relationships, and they have generally reported positive outcomes, including condom-use initiation, strengthening of bonds, and increased partner testing. Nevertheless, some scholars found no evidence that participants feared rejection from new partners or feared abandonment by current partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1049732313495327">Keegan, Lambert, &amp; Petrak, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1049732313495327">King et al., 2008</xref>). In some cases, diagnosis influenced the participants’ selection of new sexual partners (King et al.; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1049732313495327">Seeley et al., 2009</xref>). For example, “sero sorting” partners was one way of circumventing the perceived possible negative outcomes of disclosure to an HIV-negative partner.</p>
<p>Despite the evidence of disclosure benefits, significant proportions of people living with HIV do not wish to disclose their status to partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1049732313495327">Medley, Garcia-Moreno, McGill, &amp; Maman, 2004</xref>). This behavior is worrying in contexts with high levels of HIV serodiscordance, including Uganda and other parts of sub-Saharan Africa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1049732313495327">Carpenter, Kamali, Ruberantwari, Malamba, &amp; Whitworth, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1049732313495327">Lurie et al., 2003</xref>). While exploring the factors that influence someone to disclose, researchers in two recent studies found that the common reasons for nondisclosure included fear of abandonment and not wanting to disturb the relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1049732313495327">Siu, Bakeera-Kitaka, Kennedy, Dhabangi, &amp; Kambugu, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1049732313495327">Ssali et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The scope of existing literature on the determinants and outcomes of disclosure is typically limited to the time surrounding diagnosis and disclosure, even though HIV infection is lifelong. Knowledge of serostatus is an integral part of a person’s psychosocial experience throughout the life course (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1049732313495327">Baumgartner &amp; David, 2009</xref>). The outcomes of disclosure are parts of the ongoing social processes that take the shape of past experiences and evolve across time. Therefore, counselors need a more comprehensive approach to contextualize the influences on and impact of disclosure in the lives of people living with HIV.</p>
<p>In this article, we examine how individuals in fishing communities on the shores of Lake Victoria in Uganda respond to HIV diagnosis in terms of their disclosure to sexual partners and their subsequent changes in sexual behavior and relationships. We utilize a theoretical perspective that we based on two assumptions: (a) HIV diagnosis and counseling provide individuals with knowledge that compels them to make a decision regarding partner disclosure; and (b) disclosure introduces new information into relationship dynamics and therefore can be a mechanism for change. According to these assumptions, we synthesized two existing models to guide our analysis of the processes and outcomes of HIV disclosure in the context of the life course.</p>
<p>Disclosure can have reverberating effects on an individual’s life-course trajectory. Therefore, people living with HIV often carefully calculate when, how, and with whom they disclose. In a couple of studies, scholars have used the Disclosure Processes Model (DPM) to illustrate how seropositive people make these decisions by unifying different aspects of disclosure in a continuous cycle of cause-and-effect relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1049732313495327">Chaudoir &amp; Fisher, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1049732313495327">Chaudoir, Fisher, &amp; Simoni, 2011</xref>). One can use the DPM to link knowledge of HIV status to decision making and to changes in sexual relationships through a series of interconnected events. First, (a) antecedent goals drive how and why individuals decide to disclose to their partners; then, (b) the disclosure event elicits reactions from the recipient; (c) this response sets in motion mediating processes; and (d) these mediating processes lead to long-term outcomes, such as change in sexual behavior and relationships. Across time, the decision to disclose to new partners becomes part of a dialectic process influenced by previous disclosure event outcomes.</p>
<p>Overall, researchers benefit from the DPM approach’s dynamic framework for analyzing how the process of disclosure contributes to outcomes and future disclosure decisions. Nevertheless, the DPM’s longitudinal perspective is largely limited to the contribution of postdiagnosis factors in disclosure processes and outcomes. In fact, an array of factors beyond the period of diagnosis shapes how and why disclosure affects sexual behavior and relationships. Observers can add depth to their understanding of disclosure processes and outcomes by integrating a life-history analysis into the DPM, because this analysis captures a more complete picture of an individual’s life experiences since birth.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1049732313495327">Elder (1975)</xref> developed the Life Course Approach to demonstrate that individuals relate not only to the sociocultural structures that influence their sexual behavior, relationships, and HIV disclosure, but also relate to the cumulative effect of personal histories that shape identity and agency across time. The Life Course Approach comprises a four-part paradigm: location, linked lives, human agency, and timing. Location includes postmodern concepts of time and place in history as well as sociocultural structures. Linked lives are the interactions between individuals within the social groups and institutions in their location. Human agency encompasses the actions and ideas actualized by the individual. Finally, timing is the chronology of events in an individual’s life in relation to personal, group, and historical indicators (Elder; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1049732313495327">Giele &amp; Elder, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1049732313495327">Seeley et al., 2008</xref>). By applying the Life Course Approach to DPM, one can frame the factors influencing disclosure processes and outcomes in a comprehensive personal, historical, and sociocultural context. We combined the Life Course Approach with the DPM to guide our analysis and interpretation of the life history data we collected from the participants.</p>

<title>Setting</title>
<p>In Uganda, where more than two million people work in the fishing industry, researchers recently found HIV prevalence among fisherfolk to be 28.8%, and incidence to be 5% in the communities that we also sampled for this study. These fish landing sites are populated largely by young people (under the age of 35 years) working as fishermen, fish processors, traders, or barmaids, among other professions. We found that the participants engaged in risky behavior, such as regular alcohol and marijuana consumption and inconsistent condom use with partners, including those known to be seropositive. Moreover, we significantly associated symptoms of sexually transmitted infection within the previous 3 months with HIV infection. Nearly half (47%) of all fishermen who participated in recent studies reported spending at least 2 days away from home within the month prior to the interview (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1049732313495327">Asiki et el., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049732313495327">Seeley et al., 2012</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section3-1049732313495327">
<title>Data Collection</title>
<p>In this article, we analyze life history data collected by the Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI) as part of a prospective cohort study from 2008 to 2010 in five fishing villages and landing sites in the Masaka, Mukono, and Wakiso districts on the shores of Lake Victoria. We purposively selected participants for a qualitative substudy to reflect different age groups, occupations, and sexes from a sample of volunteers we screened out of the main epidemiological study that enrolled an HIV-negative cohort of 1,000 people. For this substudy, we focused on life histories and recruited participants from a group of volunteers who were ineligible for the HIV-negative cohort because of their seroposivity at the time of enrolment, as well as from volunteers who enrolled but later seroconverted during follow-up (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1049732313495327">Asiki et al., 2011</xref>). The epidemiological study and qualitative substudy received ethical approval from the Science and Ethics Committee of the Uganda Virus Research Institute and overall approval from the Uganda National Council for Science and Technology. All participants gave written, informed consent.</p>
<p>Seventy-eight HIV-positive individuals agreed to take part in two or three life-history interviews about their childhood, family life, sexual relationships, and HIV diagnosis. Experienced local fieldworkers conducted the interviews over several weeks and then compiled them into a single life-history narrative. The interview topics were sensitive in nature, so we generally matched the fieldworkers and the participants according to gender. However, one older woman interviewed several male participants, because this fieldworker’s exceptional interview skills and good rapport with the community made men more willing to talk to her than to a man of their own age.</p>
<p>Participants chose the location where they felt most comfortable for individual interviews. Often, participants selected their homes. This location provided them with privacy, because the other occupants were absent during the day. Furthermore, the community members did not wish to have their interviews recorded, because they were concerned about confidentiality and privacy. Therefore, the fieldworkers did not use tape recorders. They also removed identifying information, including names, from the interview transcripts.</p>
<p>During the interviews, the fieldworkers took extensive notes. Immediately following each interview, they transcribed the interview from their notes and memory, taking care to ensure the accuracy of statements and the sequence of events. In subsequent interviews, fieldworkers guided the conversation to address gaps in personal history, delve deeper into significant experiences, and clarify complex storylines. Although all interviews were unstructured, the fieldworkers used topic guides to direct conversations regarding childhood, schooling, marriage, work, children, and HIV experience. They also employed life-history calendars that marked major local and national events to trigger participants’ memories of certain periods in their life. They ensured that all life-history data included information on voluntary testing and counseling (VCT), partner disclosure, and condom use.</p>

<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>We analyzed the data in three steps (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1049732313495327">Figure 1</xref>). First, we coded the life histories in the original sample for emerging themes. Second, we applied the synthesized Life Course Approach and DPM theoretical framework to examine 20 randomly selected life histories. Finally, we selected four case studies to illustrate our findings for this article. For the initial analysis, McArthur free-coded 78 life histories for in vivo codes based on the themes and categories that emerged from the text, and then discussed them with the coauthors. With this preliminary assessment, we derived 88 free codes from the original sample. We then used the constant comparative method to explore the variation and similarities of the emerging themes, such as childhood mobility, sexual debut, sexual networks, condom use, infidelity, quarreling, and income insecurities.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1049732313495327-fig1.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>Based on the trends in the data, we employed a life-course approach to capture the cumulative effect of life-course factors and the dynamic quality of individual histories evolving across time. Then, we stratified the sample by gender and by 5-year age groups and selected 20 histories for in-depth analysis by using the simple random sample method. With NVivo software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1049732313495327">QSR International, 2008</xref>) we mapped the subsample of 20 life histories according to themes highlighted in the larger sample and explored individual sexual histories in relation to life-course factors, focusing on linked lives and social networks. Patterns emerged concerning the nature of sexual relationships throughout the life course, including sexual debut, marriage, concurrent partnerships, and casual sex. To understand these patterns, we conducted a closer examination of the social structures and interpersonal factors driving relationship initiation, sustainability, and separation before and after diagnosis. For each individual, we created a timeline of sexual relationships, HIV diagnosis, and disclosure. Then, we introduced the DPM to evaluate the goals driving disclosure decisions and outcome processes by considering how elements of the Life Course Approach—location, timing, linked lives, and human agency—influenced the interconnected steps of the DPM.</p>
<p>To illustrate the range of experiences and outcomes we found among the 78 participants, we purposively selected four case studies from the subsample that offered a complete life history and that reflected the themes in the larger sample. We selected the stories of 2 women and 2 men from various age groups to achieve a balance in perspectives, experiences, and structural factors relating to age and gender. In this article, we present the four case studies as unique accounts of shared experiences and social processes that shaped disclosure decisions, sexual behavior, and relationships of people living with HIV in Ugandan fishing communities.</p>

<title>Findings</title>
<sec id="section6-1049732313495327">
<title>Demographic Characteristics</title>
<p>Participants in the original sample of 78 people ranged from 14 to 48 years old, with a mean age of 33 years. About half of the people in the original sample were under the age of 35, and 59% of all participants were men. The majority of participants had attended primary school, many reached secondary school, and one obtained some postsecondary education. While living at the study sites, the participants engaged in income-generating activities that related to the fishing industry. “Fisherman” was the most common job description that the men gave. Although women reported a greater range of economic activities, all studied occupations related to fishing or fishermen. Women frequently worked in bars, restaurants, or as street vendors selling food and alcohol. Women with access to capital dried and traded small silver fish known locally as <italic>mukene</italic>. The majority of participants identified themselves as married “officially” (adhering to marriage customs) or “unofficially” (cohabitating); however, many participants did not cohabitate with their partners on a full-time basis. Some participants also reported engaging in polygamy.</p>
<p>All participants in this study were HIV positive, and the majority had been living with the knowledge of their serostatus for less than one year at the time of the interviews. Participants tested or retested for HIV when we screened and/or recruited them into the population cohort study, but a portion of them had already learned of their status by attending VCT mobile clinics or antenatal clinics in the past. During the cohort study, counselors advised the participants to disclose their status to their sexual partners and to use condoms following diagnosis. Responses to these recommendations varied, and decisions to disclose to at least one partner and subsequent relationship statuses differed among participants. The majority of individuals reported disclosing and being in a relationship at the time of the interviews.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1049732313495327">
<title>Four Case Studies</title>
<p>A single, streamlined representation could not capture the richness of detail and diversity in the data. Therefore, we chose to feature four purposively selected case studies to illustrate some of the experiences shared by various individuals in the larger sample. These four case studies reveal how the influence of life-course factors on individual disclosure decisions, behavior change, and relationship status following diagnosis relates to the trends we found in the original sample.</p>
<sec id="section8-1049732313495327">
<title>Beatrice, age 38</title>
<p>At the time of the interviews, Beatrice had been living with the knowledge of her positive HIV status for 2 months. She resided at a fish landing site with her current fisherman husband and their two children, and chose to disclose her HIV status shortly following diagnosis. Beatrice first became sexually active at age 13 and had a series of casual relationships, using condoms only with her first partner to prevent pregnancy. After she learned of HIV in 1997, Beatrice took what she considered preventive measures and had partners “one at a go” until she married a soldier at age 20 and gave birth to three children. During the 12 years of her first marriage, she had one concurrent partner for a short period until he dissolved the relationship for fear of being discovered by her husband. Thereafter, conflicts with her cowives arose, and Beatrice left the marriage, allowing her children to remain in the village with their father.</p>
<p>For 2 years, she lived independently and worked in a quarry, where she met her seventh and (at the time of the interviews) current partner. This partner later moved to a fish landing site in search of greater income opportunities, and she joined him after she became pregnant with their second child. Before she moved to the fish landing site, Beatrice tested HIV negative three times, including as recently as 6 months before her positive results in 2009. Following diagnosis and disclosure, Beatrice’s partner refused to seek antiretroviral treatment (ART) with her. Although her husband was frequently absent from home, Beatrice described her relationship status as married at the time of the interviews.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1049732313495327">
<title>Samuel, age 34</title>
<p>Samuel chose to disclose his HIV status to his partner with whom he had cohabitated for one month at the time of diagnosis. Upon his disclosure, his partner revealed that she was HIV positive, as well. At the time of the interviews, the couple had lived together for 3 months, along with the child of Samuel’s partner from another relationship. Samuel did not have children of his own, although he was married twice before and had a total of five lifetime partners. In the beginning, Samuel chose to delay his sexual debut until age 18 because he could not afford the gifts and material support that girlfriends, by local custom, required. Throughout Samuel’s early adult life, his relationships with women were often short and fraught with conflict.</p>
<p>A series of marriages and informal relationships ended, he said, because of his partners’ alcohol abuse and infidelity, and all abandoned the relationship to seek opportunities at other fish landing sites. Samuel was also very mobile throughout the two decades that he worked as a fisherman, and he continued to move after diagnosis. Samuel had tested for HIV a year earlier but failed to retrieve the results because he was away on a fishing island. When Samuel’s health began to fail, a clinic worker persuaded him to test again. When he received the results that time, Samuel decided to disclose to his partner, who responded with care and concern and suggested they seek treatment together.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1049732313495327">
<title>Patricia, age 17</title>
<p>At the time of diagnosis, Patricia did not have confidence in her relationship and chose to conceal her HIV status from her partner. They had been living together for one year with her child from a previous relationship when Patricia learned of her positive HIV status after testing at a local clinic. Although she had tested negative one year earlier at an antenatal clinic, she attributed the infection to her first sexual experience at age 13 with a schoolteacher who was rumored to have raped other school girls. During her adolescent years, Patricia became estranged from her father and moved frequently with her mother in search of work. At age 15, Patricia married a fisherman and cohabitated with him for one year until she became pregnant. The partner denied responsibility for the pregnancy and abandoned Patricia in the care of her mother, although he later attempted to regain custody of the child.</p>
<p>Thereafter, Patricia met her fifth and current partner while working in a bistro at a fish landing site. Against her mother’s wishes, Patricia resumed responsibility for the child and moved in with her current partner 2 months before she tested HIV positive. When she received her positive test results 8 months prior to the interview, a counselor encouraged Patricia to disclose and initiate condom use, but she chose to conceal her status from her partner.</p>

<title>Robert, age 28</title>
<p>Robert was diagnosed HIV positive in 2003 after he attended a community meeting that promoted free testing. At the time of the interview, Robert had not revealed his status to his current cohabitating partner. However, he disclosed to previous partners, including his ex-wife. He encouraged her to take a test immediately after he learned of his positive results, because she was pregnant with their second child. After Robert disclosed to his pregnant partner, she refused to receive testing and insisted that they use condoms until she abandoned the relationship 3 years later. Prior to this relationship, Robert had numerous casual partnerships.</p>
<p>From age 16, Robert shouldered the financial responsibility of his brother’s family and farmed coffee to support his sister-in-law. As a result, Robert preferred strictly transactional sexual encounters that did not require the additional responsibility of a relationship. At age 19, Robert moved to a fish landing site where he lived with a woman and her four children. The woman died of AIDS-related illness the following year. Robert then pursued other relationships but did not consider testing himself until years later, when he attended the community VCT meeting. After the breakdown of his relationship with his pregnant partner following diagnosis and disclosure, Robert resorted to prediagnosis patterns of casual sexual behavior and did not feel compelled to disclose to subsequent partners.</p>

<title>The Role of Life-Course Factors Following Diagnosis</title>
<sec id="section13-1049732313495327">
<title>The Ties That Bind</title>
<p>Relationships with sexual partners, families, and wider social networks shaped individuals’ antecedent goals that drove disclosure decisions following diagnosis. The location of individuals in social groups connected lives and livelihoods. The factors that maintained or broke these links illuminated how and why participants chose to disclose or conceal their serostatus from their sexual partners. Participants’ relationship histories, reliance on partners to fulfill needs, and the extent of other support networks drove their desires to sustain relationships, strengthen bonds between partners, or abandon the connection altogether. Furthermore, the value that individuals placed on particular relationships and their partners’ ability to meet expectations shaped the intended outcomes that the participants hoped to achieve through disclosure.</p>
<p>The varying nature of sexual relationships throughout the life course and between individuals reflected the diversity of partner roles and expectations that couples held in assorted contexts. Participants described the term <italic>relationship</italic> as a loaded concept, and degrees of responsibility, including psychosocial obligations and the material support that partners provided across time, differentiated the partnerships. Shared income, resources, and assets, such as inheritance and property, characterized cohabitating partnerships, whereas casual relationships were often transactional and temporary. Relationships frequently broke down when one partner did not support the other or neglected to fulfill his or her responsibilities to the relationship. Fisherfolk are vulnerable to this neglect because they are mobile, and distance and time have a weakening effect on linked lives. Many women participants who cohabitated with a fisherman expressed dissatisfaction with their relationship, especially with regard to shared child-rearing responsibilities.</p>
<p>Fishermen spent extended periods away from home, and their partners struggled to make ends meet (financially) on their own. Unfulfilled expectations among partners often bred resentment, and many women used serostatus disclosure as a vehicle to confront their partner about neglect. Beatrice’s case represents the antecedent goals and disclosure processes shared by many women who relied on partners’ contributions to maintain their livelihoods. By her own account, Beatrice’s relationship was weak, and she believed her husband did not honor his familial responsibilities or their marriage:
<disp-quote>
<p>He stays in the islands. He is very rare here. How could he be expected not to be with any other sexual partners? He takes too long to come back from the island. On coming back to us, he doesn’t come with enough food for us, neither enough cash. Whenever he goes back to the island he doesn’t leave us with enough money to sustain us [until the next time he returns]. Yet, I have his children.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Beatrice attributed her seroconversion to her husband’s infidelities. She wished for her partner to assume responsibility for the infection and to provide support for his family, so she disclosed her test results to her husband. This type of motivation was a common experience among participants, and the antecedent goals that motivated disclosure, especially among women, often hinged on the objective of increased support following diagnosis.</p>
<p>Conversely, some participants believed disclosure would lead to the dissolution of their relationship, so they concealed their serostatus from their partner to avoid perceived consequences. Although the majority of participants disclosed to their partner at the time of diagnosis, some women with children determined that they could not afford to forgo their partners’ material support, regardless of how meager, and they had little recourse through disclosure. A woman from the larger sample described a decision-making process similar to that of many women who chose nondisclosure:
<disp-quote>
<p>I have never disclosed to my current partner and I never will. There is nothing that has changed in my life because I still have the same partner ever since I tested HIV positive. My partner is promiscuous. Although his partners come and go . . . I have nothing to do about it. After all, I am already infected so I can’t dare lose my partner—for I regard him as my source of income because he gives me support.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Women in the study location often held a disempowered position in relationships, and thus bore an excess burden of child rearing; therefore, some felt discouraged from instigating change in their relationship for fear of losing a lifeline of support. Patricia, for example, chose to continue her relationship and forfeited her mother’s support, which left her entirely reliant on her current partner for her child’s maintenance. At the time of diagnosis, she worried that she would die from AIDS and leave her child without support. Her partner expressed strong prejudice against people living with HIV, so Patricia decided to disregard the counselors’ recommendations to disclose her status:
<disp-quote>
<p>My husband is an Acholi man [an ethnic group from Northern Uganda], very determined. I don’t even want him to know that I have HIV. He always says that the moment he gets to know that his wife has HIV, he can kill her then and there.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Patricia’s husband promised to support her baby as long as she produced a child for him in return. However, after they began cohabitating, he cited the commonly held belief that the presence of another man’s child prevented conception, and insisted that she abandon the child with relatives. She had struggled to maintain custody of her child in a previous marriage, so her current husband’s directive compelled her to question her commitment to the relationship. Although her relationship with her mother was not entirely broken, Patricia believed she had no other resources and chose to conceal her status to secure her husband’s support.</p>
<p>Concerns about child rearing also shaped the antecedent goals that drove some men’s disclosure decisions. In Samuel’s case, the absence of children compelled him to disclose to his partner immediately following diagnosis. Children have immense cultural significance, because they help their parents secure social position and legacy, and Samuel worried that he would die heirless from AIDS: “I am unfortunate! My pain is not to be with HIV but not to have a child in life!” The diagnosis renewed his sense of urgency to have a child, and Samuel perceived disclosure as a vehicle to unify his partnership through a shared priority. Samuel worried that being HIV positive would jeopardize his chances of having a child if his partner was in poor health:
<disp-quote>
<p>I have hope in this current partner; more so as she has promised me to get a baby with me when her baby that she came with makes one year of age. We trust each other and we have never used condoms, so I knew that she must have acquired HIV as well.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Samuel hoped his disclosure would convince his wife to initiate treatment with him and increase their chances of conception. Although Samuel had a history of short-term relationships, he did not consider the possibility that disclosure could potentially create distance or mistrust in his partnership. The reaction of his partner motivated Samuel to seek treatment:
<disp-quote>
<p>She wasn’t shocked at all. Instead, she was much concerned about the results. She just consoled me and encouraged me to go and start the ARVs early enough. She also suggested that she take an HIV test as well so that she also starts the ARVs in time in case she tests HIV positive. Her reaction instead enhanced my relationship with her.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The overwhelming desire to have a healthy child drove Samuel’s decision-making process and gave him confidence to disclose to his partner. In contrast, some participants formed their antecedent goals in response to the experiences they had while disclosing to multiple partners. The long-term outcomes of individual disclosure events shaped how and why participants disclosed to subsequent or concurrent partners. When Robert first learned of his HIV status 7 years prior to the interview, he also felt a sense of responsibility to disclose his HIV status to his partner, because he deemed it necessary to secure their children’s future:
<disp-quote>
<p>I told her after some time that I was HIV positive, but this was after we had got our second baby. I had tested when we still had one kid. So by the time I told her, I had already had live sex with her. On hearing this, she became so bitter, to the extent that she said that she could not handle staying with me anymore. But within me, I felt that I had done the right thing to tell her since we already had two kids together. We had to plan for them.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>After the breakdown of this relationship, Robert reconsidered the value of disclosure to subsequent partners. His casual connection with other partners relieved Robert of a sense of obligation to disclose his status, because he felt that their welfare was not his responsibility. At the time of the interview, Robert said that he intended to disclose to his partner, but he relied on passive techniques to communicate loaded information about this status: “I think it requires some skills, say counseling skills, if you are to tell her this. . . . I believe she already knows my status since she has been seeing me taking septrin [cotrimoxazole prophylactic] tablets.”</p>
<p>The decisions and outcome processes of disclosure to sexual partners reflected the complex and often difficult socioeconomic positions that the participants occupied in fishing communities. Participants were concerned not only about losing their partner but also about fracturing the social network linked to their livelihood. Therefore, disclosure pertains to more than just communicating one’s serostatus to sexual partners: it is also a decision that has repercussions in many aspects of an individual’s life.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1049732313495327">
<title>Sex in the Light of Diagnosis</title>
<p>Life-course factors that influenced disclosure decision-making processes also enabled or constrained change in sexual behavior after diagnosis. All participants received counseling on the importance of safer sex practices in protecting their own health and that of their partners. However, many described a wide variety of barriers to initiating safer sex practices, and few reported condom-use uptake following diagnosis. Participants often took to heart the counselors’ advice to lead healthier lives, but their partner’s behavior as well as their antecedent goals for disclosure, such as maintaining supportive relationships, constrained their agency to initiate change.</p>
<p>Many women disclosed to their partner with the intention of motivating them to seek treatment together. Although many husbands accepted their partners’ serostatus, they were not inspired to address the lifestyle aspects of HIV infection in their relationship. Beatrice had been cautious in the past to avoid infection, and felt motivated to use condoms after learning of her HIV status. However, her husband refused to cooperate, and Beatrice believed her partner was indifferent to his own HIV status: “This partner does not seem to be moved by the infection because whenever I tell him to go for the treatment where he was referred, he doesn’t take it as an issue in his mind.”</p>
<p>Even when partners responded receptively and supportively to the participants’ disclosure, change in sexual behavior was rare. In some cases, such as Samuel’s, the partner’s positive response to the disclosure event actually suppressed the participant’s intent to practice safer sex. Samuel believed disclosure had strengthened his relationship with his wife, and her response renewed his hope for a child. Their bonds strengthened through disclosure, which alleviated Robert’s inhibitions. He did not consider condom use for his partner’s protection because his partner was already infected:
<disp-quote>
<p>There is nothing I do about that issue [of using condoms], for my intention is to make her pregnant. Even if her baby is not yet a year, that is when I will be assured that I will have a baby . . . rather than [her] just consuming all of my money for nothing. Whichever partner I get for a wife, I trust her . . . but then I just find myself [without a child] when the relationship flops. Otherwise, if I had any partner outside marriage, that is when I would have used condoms as a matter of respecting my family.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Although he received counseling about the importance of condom use for preventing an additional sexually transmitted infection (STI), Samuel did not alter his sexual behavior because his antecedent goals related to fertility intentions. Women also wanted children and established sexual behaviors following diagnosis to secure their partnerships and antecedent goals. Additionally, many participants feared that condom-use initiation would implicate them as the party that introduced the infection in the relationship. In these cases, women disregarded condom use because of possible partner loss rather than disinterest in safer sex.</p>
<p>Participants who believed disclosure would alienate them from their partners and support networks continued their prediagnosis patterns of sexual behavior. In effect, participants used nondisclosure to portray a facade of normalcy. The issue of condom-use uptake seemed insurmountable to participants who wished to conceal their status from their partner, because they feared that even approaching the topic would stir suspicion about their status. Like many women whose livelihoods were linked to their partner and reproduction, Patricia’s insecure position in her relationship and wider support networks compelled her to disregard counselors’ advice about condoms: “I fear initiating the issue of condom use to my partner because he might start making investigations about my HIV status. More so, the man wants to have children.”</p>
<p>Participants commonly cited fertility intentions as a barrier to condom-use uptake. They perceived children as the glue that bound partners together, and many participants believed condoms interfered with a natural function of their relationship. For many people, the importance of childbearing overrode the potential health benefits and protection they could gain through condom use. A woman from among the 78 participants in the larger sample described the role of fertility in her relationship and her partner’s lack of concern toward safer sex and HIV:
<disp-quote>
<p>Now it is about five months ago since he left me. He demands for a baby. Yet he doesn’t mind about the HIV test, neither knowing my status. He kept on asking me as why I could not conceive till he left me, complaining that he is scorned in the community. He said he has an aged sexual partner who doesn’t produce. How I want to get a baby! To that extent, we have moved together to the witch doctor to see that I conceive!</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Many participants also failed to introduce safer sex practices into their relationships with concurrent partners. Although participants generally resented their partner’s affairs, many justified the existence of their own concurrent partnerships. Participants often acquired new partnerships during periods of separation related to the pursuit of income opportunities. Women typically described their concurrent partners as supplements to the periodic support they received from their absent husbands. Men cited their need for domestic support and companionship throughout long fishing trips, and referred to concurrent partnerships as “cassava to eat from elsewhere” while they worked away from home. A man from among the sample of 78 explained this common occurrence:
<disp-quote>
<p>For us fishermen like myself, we always get partners wherever we go for fishing. Should you stay there for some time, like more than a week, definitely you have a look around for a sexual partner. Otherwise how could you keep life going?</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-1049732313495327">
<title>Disclosure Outcomes</title>
<p>A number of participants reported positive outcomes related to partner disclosure, as well as a motivation to adopt healthier lifestyles. These individuals welcomed their partner’s cooperation in starting ART and their increasing participation in shared familial responsibilities. However, drastic changes in sexual behavior and relationship dynamics were less frequent. Some participants experienced disclosure as a unifying event in their relationship, as did Samuel, but even these participants were unaware of the effects of disclosure on other aspects of life and livelihood. Samuel’s relationship was still fresh at the time of the interview, and he had cohabitated with his wife for only a few months. As a young couple, they still faced many obstacles as their relationship matured, which could offset the disclosure event’s positive momentum. For instance, Samuel continued to work as a fisherman and traveled for long periods in pursuit of income opportunities. Prolonged absences complicated many of Samuel’s past relationships and had the potential to disrupt his new partnership.</p>
<p>The majority of participants chose to disclose their serostatus to at least one partner, and many relationships continued in the light of this information. However, these seemingly affirmative relationship statuses disguised the fact that some individuals faced substantial difficulties with their partner following diagnosis and disclosure, and that many wished to alter the nature of their partnership or abandon it altogether. Like many women, Beatrice’s strong desire for confrontation ruined her ability to disclose tactfully. Fueled by resentment, Beatrice shifted blame to her partner: “I was so hard on him and we exchanged words terribly. He was denying [having concurrent partners], and instead he was claiming that I’m the one that brought about the infection!”</p>
<p>Beatrice felt alienated by her husband’s indifference, and his refusal to engage in a healthier lifestyle signaled the end of their relationship. However, Beatrice’s work in drying fish did not provide sufficient funds, so she continued to rely on her husband’s infrequent support to meet her basic needs. At the time of the interview, Beatrice had neither gained the care she strove for with the original antecedent goals nor obtained the necessary means to support herself entirely on her own:
<disp-quote>
<p>I’m still with him in regards of marriage [cohabitating], but I no longer regard [respect] my marriage with him because he doesn’t give me any care. Yet, I’m sick and am sure that he is the one that infected me.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>At the beginning of their relationship, Beatrice earned wages and was financially independent without children in her care to support. After she joined her husband at the fish landing site with their two children, the burden of providing for her family fell primarily on her shoulders. The knowledge of her seroconversion and history of her husband’s neglect caused Beatrice to reflect on her past decisions:
<disp-quote>
<p>I’m regretting that I had followed this man to [the fish landing site]! I wouldn’t have acquired this HIV infection! It is so painful in a way that I have not gained [profits] ever since I came here. We are so poor. The partner can’t afford anything for me. For that matter, he can’t provide me with anything!</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Beatrice’s belief that she gained nothing from the partnership compounded the devastation of learning of her seropositive status and resulted in a sense of total loss. Women in this region expected to obtain social and financial security in formal partnerships, but Beatrice believed her partner only dragged her down. The restricted agency of many women in Beatrice’s situation contributed to the mediating processes of long-term outcomes and often reoriented their goals toward independence. Because Beatrice could not influence her husband’s behavior, she revised her original antecedent goals:
<disp-quote>
<p>I’m planning to leave him and go back to [her parents’ village] in case I get money. With such a miserable life, I’m longing very much to go back to [her parents’ village]. I’m sure one day he will not find me here when he comes back, in the case I get transport back to the village.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>At the time of the interview, Beatrice had not accumulated enough money for transport home—the barrier she identified to reaching her new goal of dissolving the relationship. That is, abandoning her marriage had not been the original intended outcome that motivated Beatrice to disclose to her husband. Instead, the dialectic processes of disclosure and outcomes changed the nature of Beatrice’s relationship with her husband.</p>
<p>Although Patricia did not disclose her status to her partner, a different set of mediating processes moved her toward outcomes similar to Beatrice’s. Unfulfilled antecedent goals changed how these two women regarded their relationships and, in turn, motivated them to sever ties with their partners. In the past, Patricia had struggled to maintain custody of her child after the father attempted to reclaim her on several occasions. The development of her husband’s intolerance toward her child changed the nature of their relationship and weakened Patricia’s resolve to maintain their linked lives:
<disp-quote>
<p>This man has given me two months to take away my child. He says that the moment I tell him that I’m not pregnant after this given period of time, I will find myself where to go. My child is young, and when this man insists I will separate from him and go live with my friends who pick grass. I, too, will start making ropes.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>She did not foresee this change of heart toward her relationship as an outcome of nondisclosure. The knowledge of her HIV status reaffirmed Patricia’s commitment to secure her child’s future and, in the beginning, this security meant maintaining the link with her husband. Fear of violence and abandonment led Patricia to conceal her status by not changing her sexual behavior.</p>
<p>In some cases, disclosure backfired on participants’ antecedent goals, and they responded to the long-term outcomes by revising their behavior and intentions. Initially, Robert had taken the initiative to learn his status and disclose to his partner because he was forward-thinking about his children’s futures. However, the disclosure event spurred mediating processes that created distance and mistrust between Robert and his wife. She reacted by abandoning the partnership, which isolated Robert from his goal of strengthening his relationship to support his children. In the end, Robert resorted to earlier patterns of casual relationships and no longer felt a sense of responsibility to disclose his status or to use condoms with his partners.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>As these case studies indicate, seropositive people who work along the shores of Lake Victoria live in complex socioeconomic and cultural environments shaped largely by the pursuit of income opportunities in the fishing industry. Fisherfolk’s mobility and the psychosocial benefits of sexual relationships motivate the establishment of sexual networks across time and space. HIV diagnosis can dramatically alter an individual’s life trajectory, and the individual might need to adapt his or her goals, behavior, and priorities so that he or she can cope. HIV-positive individuals not only must struggle to maintain their health and livelihood but also must address the socioeconomic and cultural value of sexual partnerships. Therefore, individuals often predicate disclosure decisions and behavior change on the context of their relationships.</p>
<p>By widening the scope in which we view disclosure and behavior change, we might see the cumulative effect of life experiences on decision-making processes. As individuals move through the life course, they establish social relationships that link them with opportunities and resources that might secure their social position and contribute to their personal development. In Uganda, as in many parts of the world, reproduction and parenthood codify these relationships, so we were not surprised to discover that fertility and child rearing were central to the disclosure decisions and outcomes of the fisherfolk we interviewed. Other scholars have noted the role of fertility in the “return to normalcy” processes associated with ART treatment and improved health and life expectancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1049732313495327">Laher et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1049732313495327">Seeley et al., 2009</xref>). Given our findings, we would also suggest that fertility and children are very important to people recently diagnosed with HIV and not yet on treatment.</p>
<p>Diagnosis can be a destabilizing event in a person’s life, creating for some a sense of urgency to procreate and fulfill what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1049732313495327">Smith and Mbakwem (2007)</xref> described as reproductive life projects: the social obligation to produce offspring, an achievement through which individuals gain full membership in their community. Some of the participants were chiefly concerned with reproductive life projects, whereas others focused on addressing the needs of sustaining their children in the event of the premature death that comes with HIV. Fertility intentions and parenthood were important considerations to the individuals who were planning to respond to the diagnosis. These considerations might drive individuals to choose unprotected sex to increase their chances of conception, or to disclose to a partner to gain long-term support for their children. These findings echo the call of other studies for health services to place a greater emphasis on the reproductive health needs of people living with HIV. Although traditionally reproductive health services target primarily women, these services should acknowledge that men’s fertility intentions could be equally significant drivers for disclosure and sexual behavior.</p>
<p>Many of the factors influencing fertility intentions also relate to sexual networks among fishermen and women in the Lake Victoria region. Sex can be a mechanism for formalizing relations and opening avenues of support in the absence of a primary partner, and such networks are often multidimensional. Many participants in our study alluded to having sexual relationships that intertwined with their income-generating activities. Other researchers have classified similar sexual arrangements as transactional, such as the “sex-for-fish” phenomena. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049732313495327">Béné and Merten (2008)</xref> reviewed evidence of this in multiple settings and cautioned against labeling the practice as prostitution.</p>
<p>Sub-Saharan fisheries are strongly gender-biased economies, yet women play a vital role in processing and marketing the final product. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049732313495327">Béné and Merten (2008)</xref> found that the women engaging in fish-for-sex practices were generally mature, established participants in the local markets and did not identify themselves as sex workers. Their sexual networks, in many ways like fertility, connected them with resources that supported their livelihood and their family’s well-being. Counselors should possess an understanding of this dynamic when considering disclosure decisions and behavior change, because some individuals might find it difficult, if not impossible, to disentangle their sexual networks from their access to resources. Therefore, counselors must make innovative strategies available to individuals in these positions. The development of effective microbicides could potentially benefit this particular demographic by enabling safer sex practices even without men’s cooperation, or without interfering with the established norms of the relationship.</p>
<p>Fertility intentions and sexual networks are among many factors influencing the disclosure decision-making process and outcomes. With the findings of this study, we contribute to a growing body of literature about the compound effect of sociocultural, structural, and interpersonal factors on disclosure, sexual behavior, and relationship change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1049732313495327">Batterham, Rice, &amp; Rotherham-Borus, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1049732313495327">Loubiere et al., 2009</xref>). The life experiences, decisions, and behaviors are variable in any population, so counselors should account for them while designing public health strategies and interventions for facilitating partner disclosure and promoting condom use. By adapting the Life Course Approach as a tool for individual evaluation and counseling, persons living with HIV can identify methods for disclosing and initiating safer sex practices that are appropriate and feasible for their relationships.</p>
