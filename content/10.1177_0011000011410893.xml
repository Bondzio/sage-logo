<abstract>
<p>The present study applied the theory of planned behavior (TPB) to unfold the social cognitive antecedents of acculturation and investigated the effects of acculturation on psychological distress using a longitudinal design. A total of 180 mainland Chinese university students studying in Hong Kong completed three sets of questionnaires every 2 months for a period of 6 months. Findings from structural equation modeling (CFI = 0.97, NNFI = 0.96, RMSEA = 0.05) confirmed the explanatory power of TPB on acculturation. The effect of acculturation on psychological distress was mediated by sociocultural adaptation and acculturative stress. The results highlight the importance of sociocultural adaptation in the course of acculturation and confirm acculturation as an identifier of risk rather than a direct predictor of psychological distress. Practical implications for university counseling centers in facilitating better cultural adjustment among students with a different cultural background are suggested.</p>

<p>In the era of internationalization, understanding students from diverse cultural backgrounds play an important role in facilitating intergroup harmony within college campuses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0011000011410893">Bochner, 2006</xref>), cross-national collaboration, and knowledge exchange between home and host cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0011000011410893">Heppner, 2006</xref>). An increasing number of universities are marketing their courses and degree programs across the globe, very often to the wealthy elites in developing countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0011000011410893">Bochner, 2006</xref>). Thus, it is anticipated that there will be a continuous rise in the number of international students in universities around the world.</p>
<p>Since its handover to the People’s Republic of China in 1997, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and the central government of mainland China have established close relations in political and economic development. With the encouragement of intellectual exchanges, the Hong Kong government constituted a policy to allow local universities to recruit students from mainland China in 1999. Since 2006, incoming students from mainland China have been granted the right to enter Hong Kong under the Quality Migrant Admission Scheme.</p>
<p>The number of incoming undergraduate mainland students has been increasing rapidly in the past decade. According to the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0011000011410893">University Grants Committee of Hong Kong (2011)</xref>, the number of undergraduate students from mainland China has increased more than 25 times from 177 (&lt; 1% of the undergraduate student population) in 1999–2000 to 4,562 (9% of the undergraduate student population) in 2009–2010. Among these nonlocal undergraduate students, 90% came from mainland China.</p>
<sec id="section1-0011000011410893">
<title>Acculturation Among Nonlocal Students</title>
<p>Acculturation is a process that involves the development of relationships with the new culture, independent from the maintenance of the original culture (enculturation; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0011000011410893">Berry, 2003</xref>). Research on acculturation has been dedicated to the understanding of how groups and individuals manage psychological and behavioral changes as a result of sustained contact with other cultures (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0011000011410893">Berry, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0011000011410893">Ward, 1996</xref>). Earlier theoretical work used a unilinear conceptualization of acculturation (i.e., individuals acculturating to the host culture only and ultimately losing ties to the home culture). Recently, increasing research studies have shown that a bilinear model (i.e., process of acculturation and enculturation could happen simultaneously) can better account for variance in culturally relevant variables, psychological and social functioning, and overt behaviors related to cultural adjustment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0011000011410893">Abe-Kim, Okazaki, &amp; Goto, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0011000011410893">Miller, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0011000011410893">Ryder, Alden, &amp; Paulhus, 2000</xref>). Nevertheless, the acquisition of the host culture appeared to be the more important of the two dimensions in terms of understanding psychological distress. Specifically, psychological maladjustment was associated with not acquiring the host culture, yet relinquishing the home culture had little effect on the mental health of Asian Canadians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0011000011410893">Ryder et al., 2000</xref>). Similarly, although a higher degree of acculturation to the host culture was associated with less psychological distress, greater identification with the home culture did not evidence a significant relationship in either direction among Chinese international students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0011000011410893">Wang &amp; Mallinckrodt, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Given that most of the research on acculturation has been specific to student groups coming from a different racial/ethnic background, it is important to examine its effects on nonlocal students, who share the same race/ethnicity as citizens of the host culture but have a different set of values, attitudes, practices, and statuses from them. This kind of acculturation can be found among students who go across the border to a culturally different region within the same country or among students with the same ethnicity who go abroad to study in another country (e.g., a Caucasian student from a European country who studies in the United States). In the present study, given that students who originally reside in mainland China and come to Hong Kong for their tertiary education had the same nationality as students in Hong Kong, we refer to them as “nonlocal students” instead of “international students.”</p>
<p>Being exposed to a new set of basic values, beliefs, and educational demands, these students are challenged to acclimate themselves to a variety of cultural differences. Although many of these international and nonlocal students are well adapted to the new culture, some face sociocultural problems including poor social integration, problems with daily life tasks, difficulties with cultural adjustment, homesickness, role conflicts, and academic concerns (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0011000011410893">Swagler &amp; Ellis, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0011000011410893">Ying, 2005</xref>). Some even develop depression and other psychological and physiological symptoms as a result of these adjustment concerns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0011000011410893">Rahman &amp; Rollock, 2004</xref>). In light of internationalization, the increase in pluralism and cultural diversity in the education system of the United States and around the world is suggestive of the need for counseling psychology research on this unique kind of acculturation process.</p>

<title>Differences Between Hong Kong and Mainland China</title>
<p>In the present study, individuals of the home culture (mainland China) and the host culture (Hong Kong Special Administrative Region) are of the same Chinese descent but endorse different value systems and lifestyles because of Hong Kong’s history as a British colony. Although Hong Kong is now a part of the People’s Republic of China, Hong Kong was under British sovereignty for more than 150 years, from 1842 to 1997. Under British rule, Hong Kong underwent huge economic development and social changes, which contributed to Hong Kong’s different cultural framework from that of mainland China today.</p>
<p>At the turnover of sovereignty in 1997, Hong Kong became a Special Administrative Region and is governed under the “one country, two systems” policy. It has a different set of economic, legal, and educational systems from those of mainland China. For example, mainland China is following a planned economy, whereas Hong Kong has a laissez-faire economic policy with little governmental intervention. The legislative and legal procedures adopted in Hong Kong are different from those of mainland China. In terms of the educational system, at the time when the study was conducted, the secondary school system in Hong Kong was 7 years, which is 1 year longer than the one in mainland China. Therefore, students who come to Hong Kong to pursue their university education are in general 1 to 2 years younger than local students in the present study. Nevertheless, it is noted that beginning in 2012, Hong Kong’s secondary school system will change from 7 years to 6 years, and at that time the college entrance ages of Hong Kong students and mainland Chinese students will be comparable. More importantly, the most commonly used spoken language in Hong Kong is the Cantonese dialect, followed by English. On the other hand, the national language adopted in mainland China since 1913, Putonghua (also referred to as Mandarin), is only the third most commonly spoken language in Hong Kong. Written Chinese used in Hong Kong (i.e., traditional Chinese characters) is also different from that of mainland China (i.e., simplified Chinese characters). In Hong Kong, English is the medium of instruction in the majority of secondary schools and for most subjects in universities; however, in mainland China, Putonghua is the medium of instruction in both secondary schools and universities. Thus, it is anticipated that when mainland Chinese students come to Hong Kong to study, they need to make considerable adjustments in their academic study and daily living.</p>
<p>Cross-cultural studies have also shown that Hong Kong is different from mainland China in terms of values and lifestyles. The pace of life in 31 countries or regions was investigated by citizens’ average walking speed in downtown, their work speed, and the accuracy of the public clock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0011000011410893">Levine &amp; Norenzayan, 1999</xref>). Findings showed that although Hong Kong ranked 10th in terms of its pace of life, mainland China was ranked 23rd (as a reference, the United States was ranked 16th). Moreover, a nation-level analysis of 10 regions examining within-culture differences of individualism–collectivism found mainland China to score highly on the dimensions of interdependence, family integrity, and family sociability but low in self-reliance and competitive hedonism. In contrast, Hong Kong scored high on the dimensions of self-reliance and competitive hedonism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0011000011410893">Triandis et al., 1993</xref>). In terms of worldviews, mainland Chinese international students are more goal-oriented and action-focused, whereas Hong Kong international students hold a more accommodating attitude toward the coexistence of diverse cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0011000011410893">Kwan, Sodowsky, &amp; Ihle, 1994</xref>). Because of these cultural differences, it is plausible that mainland Chinese students will experience considerable amounts of culture shock when they come to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Moreover, because mainland Chinese can still be distinguished from local Hong Kong residents based on their use of language and the way they dress, reports of discrimination by members of the host society have been noted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0011000011410893">Mak &amp; Cheung, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0011000011410893">Mo, Mak, &amp; Kwan, 2006</xref>). Featured articles from local newspapers and television programs have shown that recent immigrants from mainland China have been discriminated against because of their accent and physical appearance and are perceived as uncultured and unmannered (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0011000011410893">“It’s Difficult,” 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0011000011410893">“Because of their low socioeconomic status,” 2009</xref>). Four mainland Chinese students have committed suicide in the past 6 years, and an increasing number of attempted suicides have been documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0011000011410893">“Frequent Mood Problems,” 2008</xref>). The vice chancellor from a local university disclosed that there is an increasing trend in the number of nonlocal students who have mood problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0011000011410893">Kong, 2010</xref>). And cases where mainland Chinese students hid themselves in dorms and refused to attend classes have also been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0011000011410893">“Frequent Mood Problems,” 2008</xref>).</p>

<title>Theory of Planned Behavior on Acculturation</title>
<p>The theory of planned behavior (TPB; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0011000011410893">Ajzen &amp; Fishbein, 1980</xref>) is a model of behavioral change that offers a useful framework for counseling psychologists to conceptualize prevention and intervention programs as it suggests specific cognitions that need to be addressed to enhance intention as well as the multiple influences that TPB variables have on a particular behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0011000011410893">Romano &amp; Netland, 2008</xref>). The present study applied TPB as a framework to investigate some specific social cognitive factors that influence mainland Chinese students’ likelihood to adopt the cultural practices of the host culture during their stay. <italic>Attitudes</italic> refer to mainland Chinese students’ personal preference and evaluation toward adopting the local practices. <italic>Subjective norm</italic> refers to mainland Chinese students’ own estimate of the social pressure in acculturating to the host culture. <italic>Perceived behavioral control</italic> is mainland Chinese students’ beliefs on their own ability to acculturate to the host culture. These three components together create an intention to acculturate to the host culture. TPB may be useful in predicting the level of behavioral acculturation because it accounts for the potential personal and contextual constraints as perceived by the mainland Chinese students in the acculturation process. In the present study, mainland Chinese students are likely to acculturate if they have favorable attitudes, subjective norms, and strong perceived behavioral control that foster their intention to acculturate, helping them to learn the practices of the host culture. Based on the original conceptualization of TPB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0011000011410893">Ajzen &amp; Fishbein, 1980</xref>), perceived behavioral control is theorized to be directly related to acculturation as well.</p>

<title>Acculturation on Distress via Sociocultural Adaptation and Acculturative Stress</title>
<p>A vast amount of research has focused on the relationship between psychological adjustment and acculturation (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0011000011410893">Hwang, Takeuchi, Myers, &amp; Siddarth, 2005</xref>). However, the findings have been mixed, and the paradox that acculturation either improves or dampens mental health has been found (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0011000011410893">Mak, Chen, Wong, &amp; Zane, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0011000011410893">Rudmin, 2009</xref>). To explain the mixed findings, researchers have identified acculturative stress, rather than acculturation itself, as the more direct and proximal measure of psychological distress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0011000011410893">Escobar, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0011000011410893">Hwang &amp; Ting, 2008</xref>). Acculturative stress is defined as one kind of stress in response to life events that are rooted in the process of acculturation, which usually includes psychosocial difficulties (e.g., loss of social support, rejection by the host culture) when adapting to a new culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0011000011410893">Berry, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0011000011410893">Smart &amp; Smart, 1995</xref>). It should not be confused with the meaning of “psychological distress” used in the present study, which describes a clinical manifestation and poor health consequences such as depression, anxiety, and somatic symptoms.</p>
<p>Historical surveys of the 20th-century acculturation literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0011000011410893">Rudmin, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0011000011410893">2011</xref>) have suggested a model elaborating the relationship among acculturation, acculturative stress, and health consequences. It is presumed that the foreign nature of the host culture creates stress that motivates the individual to adopt different acculturation strategies. The acculturative changes result in different levels of acculturative stress. This acculturative stress can contribute to and interact with students’ overall stress, which in turn results in different health consequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0011000011410893">Berry, Kim, Minde, &amp; Mok, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0011000011410893">Myers &amp; Hwang, 2004</xref>). The mediating role of acculturative stress on the relationship between acculturation and mental problem was further demonstrated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0011000011410893">Hwang and Ting’s (2008)</xref> study. In this study, individuals less identified with the host culture were associated with higher psychological distress and clinical depression, but the linkage lost significance when acculturative stress was taken into account. Although acculturation is useful as an identifier of at-risk groups or individuals, it is the continuous exposure to acculturative stress that contributes directly to psychological maladjustment.</p>
<p>Aside from psychological adjustment, another outcome associated with acculturation is sociocultural adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0011000011410893">Berry, 2003</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0011000011410893">Masgoret and Ward (2006)</xref>, sociocultural adaptation is the acquisition of appropriate knowledge and social skills and behavioral competence that influence individuals’ ability to negotiate effectively in a new cultural milieu. Sociocultural adaptation and psychological adjustment are conceptually distinct, with the former referring to the ability to acquire the social skills needed to “fit in” or negotiate effective interactions in the host culture and the latter referring to mental health status and psychological well-being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0011000011410893">Berry &amp; Sam, 2006</xref>). Previous studies have found sociocultural adaptation to be positively related with psychological adjustment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0011000011410893">Ward &amp; Kennedy, 1994</xref>). Acculturative stress and psychological distress can be minimized when individuals acquire appropriate skills to adapt to the host culture.</p>
<p>Acculturative stress is considered to be a more proximal factor than acculturation in explaining psychological distress among ethnic minorities and immigrants because it accounts for the stress induced in the acculturation process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0011000011410893">Hwang &amp; Ting, 2008</xref>). In this study, we proposed that sociocultural adaptation can bridge the relationship between acculturation and acculturative stress because it accounts for the degree of “fitting in” in various intercultural contacts. Sociocultural adaptation is a measure of how much difficulty individuals experience socioculturally, behaviorally, and linguistically with people in the host culture. As many of the acculturative stressors are psychological stressors resulting from unfamiliarity with new customs and social norms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0011000011410893">Lin &amp; Yi, 1997</xref>), the amount of acculturative stress will be reduced accordingly when individuals experience fewer sociocultural difficulties and, in turn, reduction in psychological distress.</p>

<sec id="section5-0011000011410893">
<title>The Present Study</title>
<p>The primary aims of the present study are twofold. First, through the application of TPB on acculturation, this study aims to examine the roles of social cognitive factors on acculturation. The second aim is to unfold the relationship between acculturation and its mental health outcomes by parceling out the mediating role of sociocultural adaptation and acculturative stress using a longitudinal design over 6 months’ time. A secondary aim of was to explore the relationship between enculturation and psychological distress after accounting for the acculturation process in the model. Previous research has shown that adjustment issues emerge right after the individual’s arrival (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0011000011410893">Hunley, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0011000011410893">Ward, Okura, Kennedy, &amp; Kojima, 1998</xref>), and adjustment problems are the greatest immediately after the individual’s arrival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0011000011410893">Ward et al., 1998</xref>). In addition, given that the nonlocal students in the present study lived on a university campus and started their study soon after their arrival, the very intensive contact with the host culture made the 6-month period an optimal duration to examine their acculturation process and psychological adjustment.</p>
<p>In the present study, we hypothesized that (a) attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control will be positively related to intention (all in Time 1), which will be positively related to acculturation (Time 2); (b) perceived behavioral control will be directly and positively related to acculturation as well; (c) sociocultural adaptation will mediate the relationship between acculturation and acculturative stress (Time 3); (d) both poor sociocultural adaptation and acculturative stress will be positively related to psychological distress (Time 3), whereas acculturation will not be directly related to psychological distress; and (e) a weak but negative relationship will exist between enculturation (Time 2) and psychological distress (Time 3). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0011000011410893">Figure 1</xref> shows the proposed model specifying the hypothesized relationships.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>Participants were 180 undergraduate students from three major universities in Hong Kong. They participated in all three waves of data collection. From Time 1 to Time 2, the response rate was 70.5%. At Time 3, we retained 60.3% of the participants from Time 2. Analyses showed that there were no significant differences between the initial and the retained samples on their demographic characteristics. All the participants were ethnically Chinese students from a hometown in mainland China who came to Hong Kong to pursue their tertiary education. The sample was 59.6% women, with ages ranging from 16 to 23 (<italic>M</italic> = 18.9, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.23). The majority of the participants (68.9%) were freshmen who took part in the study shortly after they arrived at Hong Kong, 16.9% were sophomores, 10.7% were juniors, and the remaining 3.4% were in their senior year. Almost all (99.4%) of the participants were living in urban areas, whereas less than 1% were living in rural areas before coming to Hong Kong.</p>

<sec id="section8-0011000011410893">
<title>Measures</title>
<p>With the exception of the 21-item Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS-21) and Patient Health Questionnaire 15-item Somatic Symptom Severity Scale (PHQ-15), which have validated Chinese versions, and the TPB measure, which was developed in Chinese, the other measures were translated into Chinese (in simplified Chinese characters) by two independent bilingual translators using the back-translation method. The scale items and scale instructions were first translated into Chinese by a bilingual translator, and the Chinese version of questionnaire was then back translated into English by another independent translator. These three versions of questionnaires were compared by the authors, and refinements to wordings and content were made to enhance the appropriateness of the questionnaires to be used in the cultural context of Hong Kong. The translated version of the instruments was given to a group of nonlocal students during pilot testing. Two clinical psychologists and one social worker who have extensive experience in working with nonlocal students at universities’ Student Affairs Office were also consulted on the suitability of the measures. The meaning of the items was clarified, and the cultural appropriateness of some items was discussed. Further refinements in wordings were made by the research team to enhance the questionnaire’s appropriateness to the current sample.</p>
<sec id="section9-0011000011410893">
<title>Demographics (Time 1)</title>
<p>Participants provided demographic information including age, gender, study year, and living environment before coming to Hong Kong. Basic information about their knowledge on the host culture (i.e., proficiency of language used in the host culture and perceived familiarity of the host culture) was also collected.</p>

<sec id="section10-0011000011410893">
<title>Components of TPB (Time 1)</title>
<p>A total of 45 items were constructed based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0011000011410893">Ajzen’s (2006)</xref> guidelines in formulating a standard TPB questionnaire. In the present study, the behavior of interest is the adoption of cultural practices during participants’ stay in Hong Kong, and this behavior was measured by three behavioral domains, namely, language use, social affiliation, and involvement in the new culture. These were chosen because <italic>use of language</italic> and <italic>social affiliation</italic> were identified as two of the most frequently used domains to assess level of acculturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0011000011410893">Zane &amp; Mak, 2002</xref>). The third dimension, <italic>involvement in the new culture</italic>, is a general indicator for participants’ degree of actual participation in the host society. Items measuring subjective norm, attitude, perceived behavioral control, and intention were constructed based on these three domains.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0011000011410893">
<title>Attitudes</title>
<p>Attitudes toward acculturating to the host culture were measured by asking participants to rate a statement on each domain on a set of six 7-point semantic differential scales. Half of the six semantic differential items were pairs of evaluative adjectives with a cognitive tone (i.e., <italic>useful–useless; common–rare; desirable–undesirable</italic>), and the remaining half had a more affective tone (i.e., <italic>pleasant–unpleasant; wise–foolish; good–bad</italic>). Statements of each domain include “To me, using Cantonese instead of Putonghua to communicate during my stay in Hong Kong is . . .” (<italic>use of language</italic>), “To me, socializing and affiliating with Hong Kong students during my stay in Hong Kong is . . .” (<italic>social affiliation</italic>), and “To me, interacting with and participating in the Hong Kong society during my stay is . . .” (<italic>involvement in the new culture</italic>). The Cronbach’s alpha for this scale was .92.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0011000011410893">
<title>Subjective norm</title>
<p>Nine items were constructed to measure the participants’ perceived social pressure to perform the three domains (use of language, social affiliation, involvement in the new culture). The source of social pressure measured includes compliance with the normative beliefs of the nonlocal student community in Hong Kong and the general public in Hong Kong. Participants were asked to consider statements such as “All other mainland Chinese students use Cantonese instead of Putonghua to communication during their stay in Hong Kong” (<italic>use of language</italic>), “the Hong Kong society thinks that I should socialize and affiliate with local students during my stay in Hong Kong” (<italic>social affiliation</italic>), and “other students from mainland China approve me of interacting with and immersing in the local community during my stay” (<italic>involvement in the new culture</italic>) on a 7-point rating scale from 1 (<italic>strongly disagree</italic>) to 7 (<italic>strongly disagree</italic>). The Cronbach’s alpha for this scale was .74.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0011000011410893">
<title>Perceived behavioral control</title>
<p>Participants’ extent of belief in their ability to enact the behavior was measured by nine items. Again, participants were asked to rate three statements related to how much control a person has over the behavior in each domain with a 7-point rating scale. Sample items include “For me, using Cantonese instead of Putonghua to communicate during my stay in Hong Kong would be difficult–easy” (<italic>use of language</italic>), “It’s mostly up to me whether or not I choose local students to socialize and affiliate during my stay in Hong Kong” (<italic>social affiliation</italic>), and “I could interact with and immerse in the local community during my stay if I wanted to” (<italic>involvement in the new culture</italic>). The Cronbach’s alpha for this scale was .84.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0011000011410893">
<title>Intention</title>
<p>Behavioral intention to acculturate was measured by nine items using a 7-point rating scale. Participants were asked to rate themselves (<italic>extremely likely–extremely unlikely; definitely true–definitely false; strongly agree–strongly disagree</italic>) in response to statements describing their tendency to use the host language, socialize with Hong Kong students, and have general involvement in Hong Kong culture. Sample items included “I plan to use Cantonese instead of Putonghua to communication during my stay in Hong Kong” (<italic>use of language</italic>), “I will try to socialize and affiliate with local students during my stay in Hong Kong” (<italic>social affiliation</italic>), and “I am willing to interact with and immerse in the local community during my stay” (<italic>involvement in the new culture</italic>). The Cronbach’s alpha for this scale was .93.</p>

<title>Acculturation and enculturation (Time 2)</title>
<p>The Acculturation Index (AI; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0011000011410893">Ward &amp; Rena-Deuba, 1999</xref>) is a bidimensional scale of acculturation that measures participants’ degree of cultural adoption in the host culture as well as their cultural maintenance of their home culture. The original scale consists of 21 items. Most of them are in the behavioral domains, with some in the cognitive domains. According to the original authors, additions and deletions are permitted to make the scale more culturally relevant to the sample under study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0011000011410893">Ward &amp; Rena-Deuba, 1999</xref>). The scale was piloted with a few mainland Chinese students to assess its relevancy. As the majority of the participants were students who stayed in dorms and lived far away from their family, three items of <italic>family life, residence</italic>, and <italic>employment activities</italic> were deleted. Two ideological items (<italic>political ideologies, religious beliefs</italic>) were also deleted as they are sensitive issues for mainland Chinese that they may not be as forthright in answering. Participants were asked to rate the remaining 16 items with reference to the following two questions: “How similar are your experiences and behaviors to those of Hong Kong citizens? Citizens from mainland China?” They rated their degree of similarity on a 7-point scale ranging from 1 (<italic>not at all similar</italic>) to 7 (<italic>very similar</italic>). The AI yielded two independent scores, representing acculturation to the host culture (Hong Kong) and enculturation toward the home culture (mainland China). In this study, the Cronbach’s alphas for acculturation and enculturation were .90 and .92, respectively.</p>

<title>Sociocultural adaptation (Time 2)</title>
<p>The Socio-Cultural Adaptation Scale (SCAS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0011000011410893">Ward &amp; Kennedy, 1999</xref>) was used to assess skills that are required to manage everyday social situations in a new cultural environment. Similar to the AI, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0011000011410893">Ward and Kennedy (1999)</xref> indicated that the SCAS items can be modified according to the studied sample. The SCAS used for this study consists of 23 items with an emphasis on behavioral domains (e.g., understanding humor, using public transport, expressing your ideas in class). Participants were asked to indicate the amount of difficulty they experienced on a 5-point scale ranging from 1 (<italic>no difficulty</italic>) to 5 (<italic>extreme difficulty</italic>). This scale yielded a composite score that is named as <italic>sociocultural maladaptation</italic> in the figures presented below, with higher scores indicating higher degrees of difficulties encountered. Again, the scale was pilot tested with a few mainland Chinese students to gauge its relevancy. The Cronbach’s alpha in the present study was .91.</p>

<title>Acculturative stress (Time 3)</title>
<p>Acculturative Stress Scale for International Students (ASSIS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0011000011410893">Sandhu &amp; Asrabadi, 1994</xref>) was designed to measure acculturative stress. The original scale consisted of 36 items. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0011000011410893">Sandhu and Asrabadi (1994)</xref> extracted six factors and one nonspecific factor using a principal components analysis. The seven factors are Perceived Discrimination, Homesickness, Perceived Hate, Fear, Stress Due to Change/Culture Shock, Guilt, and Nonspecific. A confirmatory factor analysis was performed to examine the construct equivalence of the ASSIS to the current sample and showed the following close to good fit indices: comparative fit index (CFI) = 0.88, non-normed fit index (NNFI) = 0.86, root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) = 0.077, and χ<sup>2</sup>/<italic>df</italic> = 5.09. The Cronbach’s alpha of ASSIS in the present study was .95. The alphas for each subscale were .88 (Perceived Discrimination), .73 (Homesickness), .82 (Hate), .57 (Stress), .71 (Guilt), and .82 (Nonspecific). As all the participants share the same race with the majority in the host culture, one item related to skin color were deleted and replaced with one item on the use of dialect (i.e., Cantonese) in the host culture. Moreover, “ethnicity” and “race” were replaced with “different cultural group” (e.g., “I am treated differently because I come from a different cultural group”). Participants were asked to rate each item on a 5-point scale from 1 (<italic>strongly disagree</italic>) to 5 (<italic>strongly agree</italic>).</p>

<title>Psychological distress (Time 3)</title>
<p>Depression, anxiety, and somatization are the three most common psychiatric problems seen in primary care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0011000011410893">Kroenke, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0011000011410893">Ormel et al., 1994</xref>). In addition, research has shown that people from Asian cultures tend to express their psychological distress somatically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0011000011410893">Mak &amp; Chen, 2010</xref>). This made somatization especially relevant for this Chinese sample. Together with stress, these four problems are used as indicators for psychological distress in the present study.</p>
<p>The DASS-21 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0011000011410893">Lovibond &amp; Lovibond, 1995</xref>) consists of three subscales (7 items each) measuring depression, anxiety, and stress. The Chinese version of DASS-21 used in the present study was validated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0011000011410893">Taouk, Lovibond, and Laube (2001)</xref>. Participants rated the applicability of each statement over the past one week on a 4-point scale, with 0 (<italic>not apply at all</italic>) to 3 (<italic>very much or most of the time applied</italic>). DASS-21 has been used in a Hong Kong Chinese university student sample (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0011000011410893">Leung, Sanders, Ip, &amp; Lau, 2006</xref>). In this study, Cronbach’s alphas for the subscales are .88, .83, and .84. Item 12 (“I found it difficult to relax”) on the Stress subscale was deleted because of an inconsistent negative item-total correlation (<italic>r</italic> = –.68).</p>
<p>Somatic symptoms were measured by the PHQ-15 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0011000011410893">Kroenke, Spitzer, &amp; Williams, 2002</xref>). Participants rated the extent to which a range of physical symptoms bother them in the past 4 weeks, with a 3-point scale from 0 (<italic>not bothered at all</italic>) to 2 (<italic>bothered a lot</italic>). In this sample, the Cronbach’s alpha was .85.</p>

<title>Procedure</title>
<p>The study was approved by the university ethics committee. Freshmen were recruited during the orientation camps organized by the Student Affairs Office of each of the three universities shortly before the commencement of the academic year. For other students, they were recruited through the mainland student associations and the Student Affairs Office via email and poster announcements. Participants’ rights were explained, and all participants signed a written consent form for participating in all waves of this study. On informed consent, participants spent about 30 minutes completing the paper version of the questionnaire described above a couple of weeks before the commencement of the new academic year (Time 1).</p>
<p>The second and third waves of data collection (with all scales included) were conducted after 2.5 months (Time 2) and 5 months into the semester (Time 3). Participants received an invitation email sent by the research team with the online questionnaire’s hyperlink appended. Participants were debriefed regarding the aims and the design of the study on completion of the final wave. As an incentive for continued participation, participants were automatically enrolled in lotteries for book coupons and cash prizes that were held after the first and third waves of data collection.</p>

<title>Intercorrelations Among Variables</title>
<p>To examine the relationship among variables, zero-order correlations among variables were calculated. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0011000011410893">Table 1</xref> presents the means, standard deviations, and zero-order correlations for all variables. Results showed that the current sample was not experiencing a high level of psychological distress, given the relatively low scores on the DASS and PHQ. The correlations among all the variables were in the expected direction. There are two important points to note. First, no statistically significant correlations were found between any of the psychological distress variables with acculturation (<italic>r</italic>s ranged from –.06 to –.12, <italic>p</italic>s &gt; .05). However, they were significantly correlated with sociocultural maladaptation (<italic>r</italic>s ranged from .21 to .36, <italic>p</italic>s &lt; .01) and acculturative stress (<italic>r</italic>s ranged from .35 to .44, <italic>p</italic>s &lt; .01). This supported the hypothesis that acculturation itself would not directly affect one’s psychological distress. Second, enculturation was not correlated with any of the variables in the model.</p>

<p>All hypothesized path loadings were significant (<italic>p</italic>s &lt; .05) except for the direct paths from perceived behavioral control to acculturation. Indirect effects were analyzed to further investigate the way acculturation affects psychological distress. Tests of the two indirect paths between acculturation to psychological distress (through sociocultural maladaptation and acculturative stress) were significant (<italic>ps</italic> &lt; .05). After the mediating effect of sociocultural maladaptation was accounted for in the model, the direct path from acculturation to acculturative stress was not significant. This implies that acculturation’s effect on psychological distress was mediated through individuals’ sociocultural maladaptation and acculturative stress. Similarly, the effect of sociocultural adaptation on psychological distress was partially mediated by acculturative stress. Specifically, the direct path from sociocultural maladaptation to psychological distress was significant after accounting for the mediating effect between sociocultural maladaptation and acculturative stress.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study examined both the process and outcomes of acculturation by specifically looking at social cognitive factors of acculturation and the relationships among acculturation, enculturation, sociocultural adaptation, acculturative stress, and psychological outcomes using a longitudinal design. TPB can be used to understand acculturation of mainland Chinese students. In addition to understanding the developmental process of acculturation, the present study also confirmed past findings in showing that acculturative stress is a more proximal variable to psychological distress than is acculturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0011000011410893">Escobar, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0011000011410893">Hwang &amp; Ting, 2008</xref>). Extending from this acculturation–acculturative stress– distress link, the present study further demonstrated that the relationship between acculturation and acculturative stress may be mediated by sociocultural adaptation. In other words, depending on students’ acculturation, their adaptation to the sociocultural contexts in their everyday living may lead them to develop varying levels of acculturative stress. Consistent with previous findings, enculturation was not correlated with psychological distress. The present study further showed that enculturation was not correlated with any acculturation process variables. This implies that the relationship between enculturation and psychological distress is possibly masked by another set of process variables that await investigation in future studies.</p>
<sec id="section24-0011000011410893">
<title>Role of TPB in Explaining Acculturation</title>
<p>The findings from this study, the first to examine acculturation with TPB in a longitudinal design, provide some support for the role of social cognitive factors in understanding acculturation among nonlocal students with a cultural background different from that of the host culture. Specifically, mainland Chinese students’ initial attitudes toward acculturation, their perceived acceptance of their peers and perceived expectations from the general public toward acculturating to Hong Kong, and their sense of self-efficacy over their ability to acculturate were all related to their intention to acculturate. This intention can significantly predict their subsequent level of acculturation.</p>
<p>Overall, the present study extended the applicability of TPB to the understanding of acculturation among nonlocal students. The results suggested that attitudes were the most powerful predictor on intention, and the predictive powers of subjective norms and perceived behavioral control were similar. Although perceived behavioral control was found to be the dominant predictor in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0011000011410893">Armitage &amp; Conner, 2001</xref>), its effect on intention to acculturate was moderate in the present study. A possible explanation for this is that the magnitude of the perceived behavioral control–intention relationship was dependent on the type of the behavior and nature of situation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0011000011410893">Ajzen, 1991</xref>). A study looking at TPB’s predictability on 10 different behaviors showed that the lower the degree of volitional control, the more the behavior is guided by intention and less by perceived behavioral control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0011000011410893">Madden, Ellen, &amp; Ajzen, 1992</xref>). In the present study, mainland Chinese students may have perceived the acculturation process as low in volitional control as acculturation is a transactional process where a supportive social environment plays an essential role. Given the ability to exercise cultural practices may be contingent on a host of contextual factors in different social situations (e.g., infrastructure or organizational resources of the university in facilitating acculturation, receptiveness of people from the host culture; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0011000011410893">Berry &amp; Sam, 1997</xref>), having perceived behavioral control alone does not necessitate someone to acculturate.</p>
<p>Attitude was found to be the most important variable to one’s intention to acculturate. That is, nonlocal students’ subjective evaluation in adjusting to the host culture is essential. To strengthen nonlocal students’ positive evaluation on acculturation and change any biased attitudes toward adopting the local way of life, providing adequate relevant information for students to make an evaluative judgment is important (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0011000011410893">Petty, Wegener, &amp; Fabrigar, 1997</xref>). Take learning a new language as an example. Besides organizing a language workshop that aims at teaching the language, background information about the local culture, interesting facts and history of the language, and local dialect may enhance nonlocal students’ interest and positive evaluation in learning a new language.</p>
<p>Staff of the Student Affairs Office or counseling centers in the universities can enhance nonlocal students’ intention to acculturate by creating a positive and friendly environment for acculturation. Examples include organizing sharing sessions by nonlocal students who have stayed for a longer period of time, equipping them with essential social and language skills on their arrival, and arranging cultural functions where both local students and nonlocal students are encouraged to share their cultural practices and appreciate each other’s cultures. These activities may enhance nonlocal students’ attitudes, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control over the process of acculturation. Policies prohibiting discrimination against cultural groups and promoting equal opportunities at the university and societal level may be necessary.</p>

<sec id="section25-0011000011410893">
<title>Acculturation, Sociocultural Adaptation, and Acculturative Stress</title>
<p>In addition to showing that the current sample was generally not experiencing high level of psychological distress, findings of this study suggested that acculturation to the Hong Kong culture was not directly related to acculturative stress as well as any indicators of psychological distress. Specifically, the effect of acculturation on psychological distress was bridged via sociocultural adaptation and acculturative stress. These findings provided two important implications. First, this further supported the idea that acculturation was an umbrella term used to describe the degree of identification with host culture and the adoption of host cultural practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0011000011410893">Hwang &amp; Ting, 2008</xref>). Although acculturation may be a useful proxy to identify possible groups at risk for psychological distress, more proximal indicators of the acculturative process (i.e., sociocultural adaptation, acculturative stress) are necessary to understand its effects on mental health.</p>
<p>Second, the results demonstrated the importance of sociocultural competence during the acculturative process. The present study demonstrated that the effect of acculturation was very much manifested in individuals’ everyday intercultural contact. Through these daily intercultural encounters with the host culture (i.e., sociocultural adaptation), individuals may develop acculturative stress. The level of difficulties they experienced in the acculturation process can amount to varying levels of stress. For example, discrimination as a result of having an accent or using a different dialect can arise when ordering food in local restaurants, asking for directions, and other daily activities that involve intercultural encounters.</p>
<p>These two implications suggest that it may be useful for university counseling centers to help newly arrived students adjust by enhancing their sociocultural competence. Based on the culture learning approach to acculturation, this competence may include language proficiency, communication competence, and effective social interaction as three major keys to sociocultural adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0011000011410893">Searle &amp; Ward, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0011000011410893">Ward &amp; Kennedy, 1999</xref>). Knowledge of fundamental interpersonal communication skills (e.g., differences in intercultural communication styles, rules, and conventions), social interaction skills, new ecologies, and social norms is also important for sociocultural adaptation. Basic language courses can be held on nonlocal students’ arrival to equip them with basic communication competence.</p>
<p>In addition to the provision of language courses, social skills training, which incorporates local norms, slang, and etiquette, is essential as well. Information packs including information on local cultural practices, guidebooks for maneuvering in the city, and some practical information about the vicinities of the university may be useful in smoothing the transition of nonlocal students to the new environment. Given that many sociocultural difficulties are related to everyday life, such as finding directions and using the public transportation system, an information package, which is easy to prepare, can be a great asset to nonlocal students’ initial adjustment. Furthermore, when working with nonlocal students, it may be important for counselors and mental health professionals to assess for poor sociocultural adaptation as it may be early sign for later acculturative stress and psychological distress. It may be a simple thermometer in assessing the causes of adjustment problems and in understanding more about students’ functioning.</p>

<title>Limitations and Future Directions</title>
<p>Several limitations must be noted in this study. Participants were from mainland China who came to Hong Kong to pursue their tertiary education. This group of participants was unique in three ways. First, many of this group of mainland Chinese students were from a rather privileged class in mainland China. Many of them came from affluent families that enjoy relatively high socioeconomic status in China. They were usually the only child at home and enjoyed undivided attention from their family. The influence of this unique familial and socioeconomic status on this group’s acculturation process and outcome was not investigated in the current study, but this may contribute to some subtle differences when compared with other samples. Second, as Hong Kong is located in the southern part of China, relative to samples of international students in other studies, participants’ hometowns are mostly very close to Hong Kong, generally within four hours by plane. This allowed participants to go back to their hometown for holidays. Such geographic mobility may reduce the prominence of some acculturative stressors (e.g., homesickness, separation from family) among this group. Third, nonlocal university students may in general have a lower intention to acculturate given they may return to their home society on the completion of their undergraduate study. Therefore, the results should be interpreted with caution if they are used to apply to a population that intends to stay for a longer period of time or to permanently stay in the host society.</p>
<p>The present study is one of the few studies to investigate the antecedents and outcomes of acculturation longitudinally. Although the current longitudinal design contributes to the understanding of the temporal relationships of different constructs, a half-year longitudinal study may not be long enough to capture the changes in values or ideologies that may take a much longer time to materialize. A longer period of follow-up may be necessary to track students’ process of acculturation and interactions of acculturation and outcomes across time. Furthermore, some of the instruments (e.g., AI, SCAS, ASSIS) used in the present study were developed in the West. Despite some preliminary support for their validity was provided in the current study, their cross-cultural construct equivalences have not been carefully examined in the current sample. This methodological limitation may overlook elements within these constructs that are unique to the culture being studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0011000011410893">Ægisdóttir, Gerstein, &amp; Çinarbas, 2008</xref>). Future studies of this kind should examine the cross-cultural validity of instruments carefully when there are cross-cultural comparisons of psychological constructs, both within ethnic groups and between countries.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding its limitations, the present study not only tried to unfold the intention behind acculturation using the TPB framework but also unfolded the relationship of acculturation with psychological distress through sociocultural adaptation and acculturative stress using a longitudinal design. Findings have many implications for the design of workshops, assessments, and interventions for counseling psychologists who work with nonlocal students experiencing cultural adjustment during their years of stay in the host society. With internationalization being the norm, much effort is needed to smoothen the transition across cultures.</p>
