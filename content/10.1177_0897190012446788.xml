<body>
<p>To all of you here assembled, my colleagues, my friends, and family, I welcome you to our Annual Assembly of the New York State Council of Health-System Pharmacists.</p>
<p>I guess you could call me a well-traveled New Yorker. I was</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>Born in Syracuse,</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Schooled in Buffalo,</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Completed a residency in Cooperstown and</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>I live in Westchester County (no, this is NOT “upstate” NY),</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>I work in the Bronx and </p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Camp in the Adirondacks</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Montefiore Medical Center, Department of Pharmacy, Bronx, New York</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>I love this great state of ours, its people and what it stands for. I love this organization and I am thrilled to serve as its president over the next year. Thank you for the opportunity.</p>
<p>What I want to do now is talk about change. No, not the change in your pockets and purses, I’m referring to the change that occurs around us each and every day. This change cannot be saved or spent, it is always here—whether it be in the changing seasons, whether it be in the style of clothes we wear, or in my ever expanding bald spot.</p>
<p>Over the past few years, our profession in New York State has undergone a quiet, yet dramatic change:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>The 6-year entry level Doctor of Pharmacy,</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Changes in technology,</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>A dramatic increase in residency training, and most recently,</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Collaborative practice</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>This transition has allowed us, maybe forced us to look at ourselves, to see ourselves (our profession) and how we have been positioned within the overall health care environment. This introspection has certainly been accelerated due to some significant events:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>Health care reform is a high national priority for the public, policymakers, payers, health professionals, and health care organizations,</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>This reform will be driven by multiple factors including patient and caregiver demand for higher quality and safer care at lower costs,</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Reforms in health care reimbursement will lead to escalating pressure to adopt best practices and improve operational efficiency in all facets of patient care, including the medication-use process. 
</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Overall, there is growing pressure “to do more” with either more or even less resources than what we have right now.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>It’s clear that hospital and health-system pharmacists need to engage now in the development of a future practice model that is responsive to health care reform and the health system of the future.</p>

</fig>
<p>And this is exactly why it is a <underline>great</underline> time for our profession of pharmacy, for pharmacists overall. These changes, advances in technology, increasing and closer collaboration with our technicians, and an increase in the education and experience of our pharmacists have finally allowed for a change in the Pharmacy Practice Model; bringing the pharmacist to the bedside, working directly with our medical and nursing colleagues to provide evidenced-based medicine and improve medication safety and clinical outcomes.</p>
<p>I’ve gotten a chance to see pharmacy in action all over this great country of ours where as a matter of course, pharmacists order medications, laboratory tests and other monitoring tools to manage their patients’ pharmacotherapy outcomes and get reimbursed for their skills. Yes, we do see some of that activity in New York State, but not as a daily component of a pharmacist’s routine practice. However, finally, FINALLY, this type of practice, this change in our Practice Model will become standard in New York State.  Pharmacists are beginning to work at the top of their licenses.</p>
<p>Through the guidance of this organization, we have a better foundation to guide that change:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>First is the pharmacist as an immunizer. With the passage of the 2008 New York State Education law 6801, pharmacists now have the authority to immunize NYS residents against influenza. Thousands of pharmacists have immunized an estimated 1 million plus New Yorkers against this potentially deadly disease. Besides being an obvious improvement in the health of our patients, pharmacists as immunizers promote a change in our practice model, a change in how pharmacists are viewed by the public and our medical and nursing colleagues, as providers of direct patient care.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>As we all know, after a 16-year journey by primarily the NYSCHP and the NYS Board of Pharmacy, CDTM bill (S.3292/A.6448) was signed into law by Governor Cuomo authorizing pharmacists to provide collaborative drug therapy management with physicians. In my view, this is the most significant change to date in our pharmacy Practice Model in quite some time. A change that in the minds of most of us was obvious as we are and will always be the medication experts and will know more about pharmacotherapy than physicians and other health care providers . . . PERIOD. I hope that most of you were able to either participate in or utilize the information garnered from the CDTM summit that was held in February in Manhattan. At Montefiore, we have been able to use these tools to implement 2 collaborative practice models in anticoagulation and heart failure. Exciting times, exciting changes and more to come!</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Lastly, I am excited that the Council is working with the Board of Pharmacy on a bill to recognize and advance a component of our profession that is a fundamental foundation of our Practice Model: our technicians.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>We have the changing landscape of health care as a rationale to accelerate the need for the use of pharmacists as direct patient care providers. We have the tools to help accomplish this transition: the Doctor of Pharmacy as an entry level degree and residency training to improve competencies, the increasing use of technology, pharmacists as immunizers, and finally, the ability to collaboratively manage pharmacotherapy. What else is there?</p>
<p>We need to become that change we want to see . . .</p>
<p>Mahatma Gandhi was a 20th century pioneer who led the struggle for India’s independence from British colonial rule. Gandhi was an advocate of direct action. He said:<disp-quote>
<p>“As human beings, our greatness, lies not so much in being</p>
<p>able to remake the world as being able to remake ourselves”</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>If you change yourself, you’ll change the world. If you change how you think, you can change what actions you take. In other words, if you change yourself, you can have a change in your Pharmacy Practice Model. If you change how you think, you can change how you take care of your patients. Let’s face it—you can’t change change, you can only change how you deal with it.</p>
<p>I’ve always wondered how one can ever know what’s out there unless you try and give it a shot. Let me give you 2 examples: My friends Louis and Ella. Both these guys have the life. They don’t have to work, get 3 squares a day and frankly are spoiled rotten. It was clear to my wife Merrette and I how different these 2 were from the moment we met them: Ella is adventurous and inquisitive and Louis, well, he’s just Louie, content with what’s for dinner. You see, Louie and Ella are our cats. If I were to open the front door to our house and keep it open, Louie would probably stare at it, peek outside, and then return to whatever he was doing. Ella, on the other hand, would bolt out and come back a few days later with a dead bird, proud as can be. So who are you? Ella, willing to challenge the unknown or Louie, content with what just is?</p>
<p>Just like Louie, some of us just don’t take the chance and bolt out of the door of change even though it’s wide, wide open.</p>
<p>We have those reasons—the “BUTs” get in our way.</p>
<p>The truth is there is no option: the future is now, it’s ours and we can take it.</p>
<fig id="fig2-0897190012446788" position="float">

</fig>
<p>If you love pharmacy (and I LOVE this profession of ours), go and grab it. Just look all around you. Remember, we don’t want others to tell us what our profession is or what we can do. If we believe in what we do, that we are the medication experts in health care, if you believe in progress and possibilities, we can tell them.<disp-quote>
<p>“You have to be comfortable with being uncomfortable”</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>I’ll fill you in on a little secret: that change is all inside us and our pharmacists right now. As the Practice Model has progressed, I have seen (and I’m sure many of you have too) some excellent examples of success, of how we are transitioning to support the effective use of pharmacists. These examples of direct, prospective patient care are across New York State, whether it be at Kaleida Health in Buffalo, University of Rochester Medical Center, University Hospital in Syracuse, St Peter’s in Albany, Mt Sinai, Kingsbrook Jewish or Montefiore.  It’s what we see on a daily basis that reminds me why I am here on this podium, why I am a pharmacist, a residency director, and a leader at Montefiore. So let me give you just one of many examples. Let me talk to you about Mitchell Schumer.</p>
<p>Mitchell is a great pharmacist at Montefiore. I told him once that if I ever got sick and had to be admitted to our hospital, I would want him to be my pharmacist. A few years ago, we went live on CPOE and Pyxis Profile. Since we got rid of our medication carts and removed all drugs from our pharmacy satellite, Mitchell became one of our first decentralized clinical staff pharmacists. Now Mitchell was not unlike many other pharmacists in his position, still somewhat connected to the product and to the satellite. I told him “stay on the floor, review your orders there and eventually the nurses and physicians will come to you” . . . And they did! Just recently, I ran into Mitchell in the hallway. I asked him how he was doing. He looked at me in the eye, smiled and said “I love this job”. Isn’t that great?!</p>
<p>If we can get all of our pharmacists to have that passion and confidence, think about how much better off our patients, providers, nurses, and our profession would be? Remember, “If you build it, they will come.”</p>
<p>I want to leave you with what I think all pharmacists should be and what we should do </p>
<list list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>Remember, you are all leaders. Whether you direct a pharmacy department, recommend pharmacotherapy regimens during interdisciplinary rounds, teach our future pharmacists or coach a little league baseball team, all of you are affecting change, an essential component of leadership.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Secondly, we need to continue to develop ourselves as leaders.  As leaders we need to:<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>Be self-aware and fully present</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Continually know that service is the path to success</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Seek collaboration and consensus and</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Inspire and energize</p>
</list-item>
</list>

<p>Vince Lombardi was a true New Yorker. Born in Brooklyn, Lombardi was a Fordham graduate and an assistant coach for the New York Giants (when they played at the Polo Grounds, in New York State), Lombardi went on to win 6 football conference titles, 5 championships, and the first 2 Super Bowls.  Lombardi was a great leader. He said:<disp-quote>
<p>“It is time for us to stand and cheer for the doer, the achiever, the one who recognizes the challenge and does something about it”</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>We need to be that confident optimist, we need to stand up and cheer for those who promote a change in our Pharmacy Practice Model and participate in it.</p>
<list list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>It is well known that the Myers-Briggs personality test consistently indicates that pharmacists are driven to perfection. That’s probably a good thing, don’t you think? We are reviewing, approving, and dispensing potentially effective medications as well as potentially harmful medications to our patients. Well, as leaders, particularly as we evolve and change our practice, I think we may need to think differently. We need to learn how to fail . . .</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>American history is full of success stories accentuated as much by how these Americans failed as how they achieved their incredible triumphs. Let me give you a couple of examples:<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>Our 16th President, Abraham Lincoln is considered by most historians to be one of our greatest US Presidents. His leadership preserved the Union during a divided and bloody Civil War. Mr Lincoln was not a man known for failure. However, did you know that he lost 7 elections to Congress before being elected as President in 1860? I dare not think where this country would be now if he gave up and returned home to Illinois.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Thomas Edison was considered the greatest inventor of his time. He was responsible for 1093 different patents, including his refinement of the light bulb, the phonograph, and the motion picture camera. Edison is known for his successes; what he is not known for are the stumbles he made along the way. The story goes that Thomas Edison failed more than 1000 times when trying to create the light bulb. When asked about it, Edison allegedly said, “I have not failed 1000 times. I have successfully discovered 1000 ways NOT to make a light bulb.”</p>
</list-item>
</list>
</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>So you see, defeat is not the worst failure, it’s not having tried. So give PPMI a shot! If one model doesn’t work, try another. If plan A doesn’t work, try plan B. As Vince Lombardi said<disp-quote>
<p>“If you can’t accept losing, you can’t win”</p>
</disp-quote>
<list list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>Lastly, as leaders, we need to continue to develop the tools and skills needed to be successful in changing our Practice Model. Just like you, over the next 12 months, the Council will look at expanding and adding on to the programs and projects begun over the past couple of years, including:<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>a. A follow-up to the CDTM summit,</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>b. In collaboration with the Board of Pharmacy, introduction of a technician bill aimed at elevating and recognizing our most valuable assets within our departments, our technicians</p>
</list-item>
</list>
</p>
</list-item>
</list> We will also:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>c. Re-look at our leadership development strategy. This was started in part during our President’s retreat on Thursday,</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>d. Consider an expanded partnership with other state pharmacy organizations and lastly,</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>e. It goes without saying that a major focus will be in the development of a document for our legislators in Albany confirming the value of collaborative drug therapy management by pharmacists.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>We are in an incredibly important, crucial, exciting, and fun time for our profession.</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>We are the experts in drug therapy and</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>We have the tools to develop and offer a new paradigm to all pharmacists</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>So as we move forward with our new practice model within our changing profession, remember what Steve Jobs said in his 2005 commencement speech at Stanford University:<disp-quote>
<p>“Don't be trapped by dogma—which is living with the results of other people's thinking. Don't let the noise of others' opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition.”</p>
</disp-quote>
<disp-quote>
<p>Embrace Change . . . Be That Change</p>
</disp-quote>
