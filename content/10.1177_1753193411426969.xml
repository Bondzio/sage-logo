<abstract>
<p>We investigated the effects of acetyl-L-carnitine (ALCAR) on the recovery of sciatic nerve injuries in rats. Sprague Dawley rats were randomized to two groups: ALCAR treated (for 14 days) and control. Each group was divided into three subgroups: distal transection, proximal transection, and grafted. Distal latencies, amplitudes, and motor nerve conduction velocities were measured. In the third month, biopsies were taken and examined under light microscopy. Electrophysiological measurements demonstrated that regeneration occurred earlier and was better in the ALCAR group, particularly in the distal transection subgroup. Better results were obtained in the distal transection subgroup in terms of axonal regeneration compared with the proximal transection and grafted subgroups because the regenerating segment was shorter. ALCAR enhanced the quality of neural recovery at the different levels and in different types of repair, and led to a decline in nerve death.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>One of the most significant factors in morbidity after peripheral nerve injuries is the quality of motor and sensory recovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1753193411426969">Hart et al., 2002a</xref>). After peripheral nerve injuries, there may be significant deficiencies in sensory transmission and motor nerve function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1753193411426969">Bontioti et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1753193411426969">Hart et al., 2002a</xref>). Nerve recovery is achieved by neural regeneration, which bridges the repair site to the distal nerve segment, to reinnervate motor and sensory end organs with somatotrophic guidance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1753193411426969">Hart et al., 2002b</xref>). Although the surgical repair technique used and timing of repair are important, preventing the death of sensory neurons and facilitating neural regeneration improve recovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1753193411426969">Hart et al., 2002a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1753193411426969">2002b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1753193411426969">Wilson et al., 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>To increase peripheral neural regeneration, numerous neurotropic factors have been used experimentally, but with limited success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1753193411426969">Hart et al., 2002b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1753193411426969">2002c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1753193411426969">Wilson et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1753193411426969">2007</xref>). Acetyl-L-carnitine (ALCAR) is one of the agents most commonly used for this purpose. ALCAR has a physiological role in mitochondrial oxidative energy metabolism. The effects of ALCAR include increasing the recovery capacity of existing neurons and binding of neural growth factors to neurotrophin receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1753193411426969">Hart et al., 2002b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1753193411426969">2002c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1753193411426969">Wilson et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1753193411426969">2007</xref>). ALCAR also favours the restoration of appropriate rather than inappropriate synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1753193411426969">Pettorossi et al., 1993</xref>). It has also been reported to decrease neuronal death in delayed repairs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1753193411426969">Kostopoulos et al., 2009</xref>). The effects of ALCAR have been shown to be significant if it is administered in the early period after nerve transection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1753193411426969">Hart et al., 2002b</xref>).</p>
<p>Studies have demonstrated that ALCAR enhances recovery in sensory nerves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1753193411426969">Hart et al., 2002a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1753193411426969">Wilson et al., 2007</xref>). The primary objective of this investigation was to study differences in the rate and completeness of motor recovery with administration and non-administration of ALCAR. The secondary objective was to determine whether the effects of ALCAR in reducing the loss of neuronal cell bodies in dorsal root ganglia could be correlated with motor recovery.</p>

<sec id="section2-1753193411426969" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>Forty-two male Sprague Dawley rats (250–350 g) were kept in individual cages under a 12-hour light/12-hour dark cycle at 22°C and a humidity of 30%. Rats were kept in individual cages to prevent cannibalization, and we did not observe automutilation in any group. Rats were numbered and randomized into two main groups: the ALCAR-treated group and a control group. Each group was divided into three subgroups: distal transection, proximal transection, and grafted, with seven rats in each subgroup.</p>
<p>Ketamine hydrochloride (50 mg/kg) was used for anaesthesia, and the procedures were undertaken by one surgeon. The sciatic nerve was exposed at the mid-thigh by a dorsolateral skin incision and splitting the fascia between the gluteus and biceps femoris muscle. The procedure was carried out on the same side in each rat. In the distal transection subgroup, the sciatic nerves in the right leg were explored. The right sciatic nerve was transected proximal to its branching and the transection repaired end-to-end by the epineural technique using 10-0 nylon sutures. In the proximal transection subgroup, the nerve was transected 15 mm proximal to the branching of the right sciatic nerve. The incision was repaired end-to-end by the epineural technique using 10-0 nylon sutures. In the grafted subgroup, the right sciatic nerve was resected from 5 to 15 mm proximal to the branching of the sciatic nerve to form a 10 mm defect. The same segment was used as a graft and repaired end-to-end by 10-0 epineural nylon sutures. After all the procedures had been completed, rats were observed in their cages and their mobility monitored. The right legs of the rats had minimal mobility.</p>
<p>Studies have reported an effective ALCAR dose of 50 mg/kg/day and that this dose is safe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1753193411426969">Hart et al., 2002a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1753193411426969">Wilson et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1753193411426969">2007</xref>). We used the same dose of ALCAR and administered it by the intraperitoneal (IP) route to eliminate variability in gastrointestinal absorption. Physiological (0.9%) NaCl, which was administered to the control groups, has been reported to have no effect on the death or regeneration of neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1753193411426969">Hart et al., 2002a</xref>). Starting in the first hour after surgery, rats in the control group were given 0.9% NaCl (IP) for 14 days, whereas rats in the ALCAR group were given ALCAR (50 mg/kg/day IP) for 14 days.</p>
<sec id="section3-1753193411426969">
<title>Electrophysiological studies</title>
<p>Nerve conduction studies were carried out according to previously described protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1753193411426969">Ko et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1753193411426969">Navarro et al., 2009</xref>). Rats were anaesthetized with ketamine hydrochloride (50 mg/kg) before testing. Compound muscle action potentials (CMAPs) were measured using a Keypoint portable electromyographic apparatus (Medtronic Functional Diagnostics, Copenhagen, Denmark). Rats were assessed by the same neurophysiologist who was blinded to the study protocol. Room temperature was maintained at 36–38ºC during the electrophysiology studies. The sciatic nerve was stimulated at the right sciatic notch and the recording needle electrode inserted on the plantar muscles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1753193411426969">Figure 1</xref>). Impulses were delivered at two points on the ankle and sciatic notch. Distal latencies, amplitudes, and conduction velocities of the CMAPs on the transected and non-transected side were recorded. CMAP analyses were done before surgery and at week 1, month 1, month 2, and month 3 after surgery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1753193411426969">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

<title>Histological examination</title>
<p>In the third month, bilateral biopsies were taken from the L4–5 root ganglion to include the distal nerve segments of the right sciatic nerves of all rats. After fixation of the biopsies in 4% formaldehyde, segments were stained with haematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) and toluidine blue for examination under light microscopy. The number of nerve cell bodies in the root ganglion biopsy and number of axons in the peripheral nerve biopsy per square millimetre were counted by the same pathologist who was blinded to the study protocol. Axon diameters in the sciatic nerve were measured distal to the epineural repair. The percentage of nerve cell bodies in the root ganglion and difference in percentages between the transected and non-transected sides of the same rats were calculated.</p>

<title>Statistical analyses</title>
<p>Data are presented as mean (standard deviation). The following analytical procedures were used: Friedman test for repeated multiple group measurements; Kruskal–Wallis test for inter-group comparisons; Dunn’s multiple comparison test for the comparison of subgroups; Mann–Whitney U-test for comparison of pairs of groups; chi-square and Fisher’s exact tests for comparison of qualitative data; and Pearson correlation test to determine the relationships between variables. <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05 was considered significant.</p>

<p>Despite surgical repair in peripheral nerve injuries, normal functions may not be fully recovered. Neural viability is required for axonal regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1753193411426969">Hart et al., 2002a</xref>). For many years, attempts have been made to increase the success rates of repair by external administration of various agents to decrease neural death.</p>
<p>ALCAR treatment contributes to decreased neural death and increased regeneration. Studies have demonstrated that this agent enhances sensory nerve recovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1753193411426969">Hart et al., 2002a</xref>). Some researchers have compared the number of nerve cell bodies in the dorsal ganglia of axotomized and control nerves, and demonstrated that the percentage in the former can be decreased by 7–50% without any treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1753193411426969">Hart et al., 2002a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1753193411426969">Kostopoulos et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1753193411426969">Wilson et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1753193411426969">2007</xref>), changing to 81% at 6 months (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1753193411426969">West et al., 2007</xref>). Some studies have demonstrated that a 4.8% loss immediately occurs after a surgical repair of an axotomy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1753193411426969">Hart et al., 2002b</xref>). In this study, the rate of loss of nerve cell bodies in the experimental groups was lower than in the control groups, confirming the positive effects of ALCAR on recovery in different types of repair.</p>
<p>Electrophysiological studies constitute one of the most objective methods for the assessment of regeneration after peripheral nerve injuries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1753193411426969">Kostopoulos et al., 2009</xref>). Analyses of gait and walking can provide information on functional recovery, but only electrophysiological studies can show changes in nerve conduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1753193411426969">Bontioti et al., 2003</xref>). However, electrophysiological studies may be ineffective because regeneration is inadequate and axons have not reached the target organ in the early period after injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1753193411426969">West et al., 2007</xref>). Electrophysiological measurements demonstrated that regeneration occurred earlier and was better in the ALCAR group, particularly in the distal transection subgroup. Better results in terms of axon regeneration were obtained in the distal transection subgroup compared with the proximal transection and grafted subgroups because the regenerating segment was shorter, and therefore regeneration would be quicker. Significant differences were not obtained in the proximal and grafted subgroups. This could be because we complete the study at the end of 3 months, which may not have been sufficient for effective regeneration to occur.</p>
<p>CMAP distal latencies and conduction velocities represent the function of the fastest-transmitting fibres with large diameters. The CMAP amplitude is related to the number and integrity of the axons. Drawing upon the results of this study, it could be argued that ALCAR enhances the regenerative capacity of neurons after peripheral nerve repairs. The number of axons per square unit of the sciatic nerve was significantly higher in all the ALCAR-administered subgroups than in the control subgroups. This suggests that this agent could also increase the chances of success after nerve grafts, in which recovery is often poor.</p>
<p>Histological data yielded more significant results than the electrophysiological data. The number of nerve cell bodies per unit of area in the L4–5 root ganglia of the distal transection subgroup was higher than in the other subgroups. This was associated with the more rapid regeneration in the distal transection group. In the ALCAR group, the number of nerve cell bodies per unit of area in the L4–5 root ganglia of the proximal transection subgroups was found to be higher than in the grafted subgroup. This shows that ALCAR made an additional contribution to regeneration in the proximal transection group.</p>
<p>In all of the ALCAR subgroups, the number of axons per unit of area of a sciatic nerve at the distal side of the epineural repair was higher than in the control subgroups. This is a direct parameter that demonstrates the impact of ALCAR on axonal regeneration. The correlation between the number of nerve cell bodies per square unit in the L4–5 root ganglia and CMAP latency, and the correlation between the number of axons per square unit in the sciatic nerve and axon diameter with CMAP amplitude point to a connection between the histopathological data and electrophysiological parameters.</p>
<p>Some studies report that the ability of ALCAR to reduce neural death is higher if administered within the first 24 hours after injury. It has also been reported that neural death is less the earlier it is administered within 24 hours after trauma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1753193411426969">Hart et al., 2002b</xref>). Thus, in this study, ALCAR administration was started within the first hour after nerve transection. The rate of neural loss in the experimental groups was lower than in the control groups, and the number of axons in a unit of area of sciatic nerve at the distal side of the epineural repair was greater in all ALCAR subgroups. This supports the administration of ALCAR without regard to the type and level of the injury.</p>
<p>The 3 month study period prevented us from obtaining electrophysiological findings that were as clear as the histopathological data. However, there are some important consequences. ALCAR may increase nerve recovery even if the transection level is more distant from the end organs. Also, the electrophysiological and histological results in the distal transection subgroup suggest that administration of ALCAR can reduce recovery time. The positive effects of ALCAR were not strongly supported by the electrophysiological assessment, and significant data were obtained only in the distal transection group. A longer period of time would be required to demonstrate any electrophysiological recovery in the proximal and grafted subgroups.</p>
