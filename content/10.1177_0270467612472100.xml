<p>As video games have grown in popularity, not only has there been an increasing number of games and gaming systems but also a greater amount of research on the many detailed and nuanced elements of a complex and increasingly influential cultural form. With their cultural prominence and influence, many considerations and concerns around video games are now in play, both literally and figuratively. Consequently, out of the growth of video games has also come a vast array of research investigating many facets of an ever-broadening field.</p>
<p>Relative to games, there is now a greater wealth of texts, systems, interactions, and effects to study than ever before. The medium’s growth has generated a significant body of game texts through which to study elements such as narrative, game mechanics, representation, and immersion. Improvements in gaming systems have generated discussions around changing hardware and increasing technological capabilities. Ongoing game development has necessitated understanding design approaches and player motivations. The increasing acceptance of games and gameplay drives research into the social and cultural implications of gaming. Furthermore, the need for research into video games has generated additional inquiry into effective and appropriate methods for engaging in this kind of work.</p>
<p>As such, video game research continues a range of work that focuses on a series of different yet often interrelated facets of gaming. The diversity of this work is representative of the fact that we require a multiplicity of methods, theories, and approaches to adequately address some of the major concerns and challenges around video games today. Although there is a large body of work on the positive and beneficial effects of video game play, there are also significant concerns that need to be addressed. Given the popularity of games, there is a pressing need to consider what kind of influence games have over players in terms of shaping their perceptions of everything from race and gender through to the military and politics. These concerns also extend to the game industry itself, which is often criticized for creating repetitive and unoriginal games, promoting particular agendas and ideologies, and engaging in questionable labor practices. Furthermore, the fact that video game culture is often perceived in dismissive if not outright negative ways exacerbates the difficulty in acknowledging and rectifying existing problems.</p>
<p>On a more optimistic note, in attending to these issues one of the greatest challenges that video game research is undertaking is understanding not only what makes games engaging, immersive, motivating, and influential but also how to use them for more positive ends. Understanding the underlying issues and the structures that enable them provides a point of entry through which to innovate, repurpose, borrow from, and improve on the medium. While this approach helps address many of the current issues with games themselves, it also allows for new ways of dealing with a much wider range of individual and social concerns such as productivity, health, and learning in active and effective ways.</p>
<p>Collectively, the research in this issue represents the wide range of approaches to and applications of video game research, from close readings of particular video games through to broad considerations of the practices that surround different elements of play including development, mediation, stereotyping, and research. Furthermore, this work offers new ways to both consider many of the major concerns with video games today and to challenge these issues in useful and effective ways.</p>
<p>This issue begins with three articles that look in detail at the specific features of games and how they facilitate particular readings, meanings, and experiences. Arnott looks at video game narrative with respect to the idea of the imperative mood. This work reveals the links between narrative signification and puzzle games and examines the ways in which in-game objects are used as rhetorical devices and tools through which to make and interpret meaning.</p>
<p>Narrative is also considered in the work of Daviault. This approach examines the role of understudied persistent nonplayer characters (PNPCs). With PNPCs as an important aspect of gameplay, this work considers whether different levels of experiences are linked to a greater appreciation of PNPCs with respect to how they advance game narratives.</p>
<p>In looking at the idea of “predation play,” Bertozzi argues that female players can experience and excel in environments that promote both risk and reward. In doing so, they are engaged in a productive play experience that may also work to reduce gender disparities that exist, apart from the game and the player’s engagement within it.</p>
<p>Beyond research examining the behaviors and consequences of video games, this issue also includes three articles that examine practices and assumptions that surround gameplay. First, Jiow and Lim consider parental mediation of gameplay. In this work, the authors account for how the evolution of video games has both necessitated the supervision of video game play and made such practices a challenge for concerned parents.</p>
<p>In turn, Grey examines how minority players adopt and respond to innovations in the updated Xbox Live environment and what features facilitate or hinder the acceptance of these changes. With these challenges in mind, this article also proposes considerations that should be made with respect to new Xbox innovations, especially in light of including minority gamers in the decision-making process.</p>
<p>Although games are reaching greater levels of acceptance, even to the point of having recognized benefits, they do retain some negative associations. Kowert, Griffiths, and Oldmeadow look at cultural portrayals of gamers in order to ascertain the degree to which such representations have been become shared or personal stereotypes.</p>
<p>Moving toward an inquiry into development, two articles in this issue examine themes around game production. From an organizational perspective, van der Graaf examines the work structures that underlie game design within two development firms. In addition to detailing the work process within these organizations, this research also considers how work is related to the product being developed.</p>
<p>Buell and Cooley move beyond some of the more typical conceptions of play in favor of examining the role of games in engaging educational initiatives. In this work, the authors offer insight into the development and dissemination of “critical interactives” that offer participants a way to actively engage with difficult and controversial subject matter.</p>
<p>Finally, with an eye to critically examining video game research, Chee, Taylor, and de Castell consider the role of the end user license agreement (EULA) in this process. In particular, the authors are concerned with whether accepting the EULA as a requirement of gameplay is a valid form of informed consent adequate to the task of conducting ethical participant research.</p>
<p>This work reveals the breadth of research required to more fully understand the varied body of video games and systems. Moreover, it presents diverse and detailed approaches to studying the many facets of games from the features immediately present in games themselves through to the many practices that now surround video game play for the millions of players engaged in these activities.</p>
