<abstract>
<p>This case study examines the autobiographical writing and interviews of Lupe, an Indigenous Mexican immigrant, at multiple times in her life. The case study is contextualized within social, historical, psychological, and institutional spaces both in the United States and in Mexico. Consequently, Lupe’s journey is an example of how stigmatization and discrimination are critical issues affecting the educational experiences of immigrant adolescents in American schools. The case study, however, is also evidence of an immigrant youth’s perseverance, the factors that positively influenced her resilience process, and her ability to overcome the stigma placed on her throughout her education. Currently this college educated, Mexican, Indigenous women works as a teacher for a school with a predominantly low-income, Latina/o immigrant population.</p>

<p>[In high school] Some football players along with other White students would always call us “beaners, wetbacks, thieves, dirty, drug-dealers, gang members.” They would tell us to go back home to Mexico, some of my friends were from Central and South America, and some Chicanos had never been to Mexico and could not trace their family back to a region in Mexico. The principal’s assistant would not say anything to them, but if we called them “gringos” or “gabachos,” we would get detention. I come from a small Yucatec Maya town in Mexico; I had never felt the pain, anger, and frustration that come with racism. Not because racism against Indios does not exist in Mexico, but because [my hometown] is mostly Yucatec Maya. . . .</p>
<p>Some teachers and most classmates placed me at the bottom of my advanced placement classes, regardless of my performance in tests, class work, homework, and papers.

<p>Lupe,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0739986312449584">1</xref></sup> a first-generation Mexican Maya immigrant, referenced stigmatizing and discriminatory experiences as part of the obstacles she overcame throughout her public 8th- to 12th-grade U.S. education. Lupe also exposed the hurdles that she continued to encounter during her postsecondary, elite university education. Lupe’s daily discriminatory experiences or encounters with microaggressions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0739986312449584">Sue, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0739986312449584">Sue et al., 2007</xref>) often resulted in a decrease of her self-confidence, lowered self-esteem, and depression. Lupe’s autobiographical writing and interviews allowed me to explore the daily struggles she overcame that shaped the woman she is today, contextualizing her experience within the experiences of other resilient Mexican immigrant students.</p>
<sec id="section1-0739986312449584">
<title>Latina/o Immigrant Students in the United States</title>
<p>Latina/o immigrants are often profiled as an “inassimilable” homogeneous group. They are identified as an economic “burden” to society, taking educational and work opportunities from “Americans.” Anti-immigrant sentiment and xenophobia in American society aggravates the stigmatization and stereotypes placed on Latina/o immigrants, and specifically undocumented immigrants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0739986312449584">Abrego &amp; Gonzales, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0739986312449584">Cowan, Martinez, &amp; Mendiola, 1997</xref>). Anti-immigrant sentiment often increases during times of economic crisis, with fears of over population, crime, and terrorism, and with the implications of having a “multicultural” society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0739986312449584">Menjivar, 2000</xref>). Therefore, immigrants and their children attending the public schools across the country become the scapegoat. In an address to an ad hoc hearing of the U.S. House of Representatives, the American Psychological Association via Dr. Suarez-Orozco alerted Congress of the impact discriminatory legislation has on immigrant youth’s psychological well- being and the “negative implications for acculturation, social belongingness, and the civic engagement of the next generation of immigrant youth . . . likely to further inequality and lead to numerous adverse cognitive, affective, motivational, and behavioral effects . . .” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0739986312449584">American Psychological Association, Government Relations, 2010</xref>). The stigmatization and discrimination faced by immigrant children are critical to issues regarding educational equity.</p>
<p>The impact of discrimination felt by immigrant children affects their behavior in the classroom with the teacher, in the schoolyard with their peers, and at home with their parents. Stigma is defined as “an attribute that is deeply discrediting” of one’s social identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0739986312449584">Goffman, 1963</xref>, p. 3). Individuals make categories in which persons fit according to their attributes and then individuals establish certain anticipations that become “normative expectations” of people. When people do not fall under these normative roles or characterizations they are described as not “normal,” thus falling into a stigmatized group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0739986312449584">Goffman, 1963</xref>). At school, the immigrant students encounter discrimination, confusion, stress, and inferiority when they are labeled “ESLers,” a stigmatizing term stemming from English as a Second Language (ESL) classes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0739986312449584">Olsen, 1997</xref>). Immigrant students hence develop a sense of isolation within the school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0739986312449584">Olsen, 1997</xref>). In the United States, English becomes a “binding” marker to create a sense of national American identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0739986312449584">Portes &amp; Rumbaut, 2001</xref>). The host nation promotes the superiority of the primary language of the group in power (in the U.S. case it is English) and oppressive policies are placed against minority group languages to assert the higher status of the primary language (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0739986312449584">Meyers-Scotton, 2006</xref>). Through legislation and school socialization, American society attempts to create a unified homogeneous culture in which immigrant students must quickly and fluently learn English to avoid marginality.</p>
<p>Immigrant adolescents or children of immigrants must negotiate multiple cultures during their identity development and acculturation processes. The development of their identities depends highly on social mirroring and self-evaluation of the perceptions peers, family, and teachers may have of the youth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0739986312449584">Suarez-Orozco &amp; Suarez-Orozco, 2001</xref>). Acculturation occurs under three pathways that include (1) ethnic flight (when the immigrant child completely merges him or herself into the host culture and denies the native/home culture), (2) adversarial stance (when the adolescent only focuses on his or her native cultural values with little interaction with the dominant society), and (3) transcultural identity (when the youth interacts and transitions between the native and the host culture; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0739986312449584">Suarez-Orozco &amp; Suarez-Orozco, 2001</xref>). In shaping their identities immigrants and minorities assess the value of their in-group by comparing it to that of an out-group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0739986312449584">Deaux, 2000</xref>). When their in-group identity is stigmatized immigrant students face the predicament of learning to navigate and balance their home culture with the dominant culture.</p>
<p>When immigrant students face stigma at school they have to develop ways of coping with the emotionally taxing discriminatory experiences. Such experiences include racial microaggressions or “commonplace daily, verbal, behavioral, or environmental indignities, whether intentional or unintentional” that express covert racism toward minority persons in their mundane, everyday interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0739986312449584">Sue et al., 2007</xref>, p. 271). While experiencing these stigmatizing, discriminatory encounters the individual may use various coping mechanisms to moderate the aggression or threat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0739986312449584">Padilla, 2008</xref>). Some students develop resiliency to be able to succeed despite the discriminatory encounters. Resilience is a process in which a person can positively adapt and be competent within a context of great adversity and risk factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0739986312449584">Luthar, Cicchetti, &amp; Becker, 2000</xref>; Masten &amp; Powell, 2003; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0739986312449584">Yates, Egeland, &amp; Sroufe, 2003</xref>). Youth use internal and external resources to adapt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0739986312449584">Yates et al., 2003</xref>). Scholars suggest the key to promoting resilience is by developing healthy asset-building communities with an understanding of culture-specific contexts and fostering civic engagement that can create better infrastructure where children are the focal point (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0739986312449584">Benson, Leffert, Scales, &amp; Blyth, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>The analysis of Lupe’s experiences in the United States and specifically throughout her American education is framed around the stigmatization and discrimination themes revealed in the interviews conducted throughout her young adult life and in her writing. Stigmatization and discrimination have serious implications and consequences for the target’s well-being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0739986312449584">American Psychological Association, Government Relations, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0739986312449584">Sue, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0739986312449584">Sue et al., 2007</xref>). In this case study, I discuss the difficult pathways of success for an immigrant student who faced daily adversities due to stigmatizing labels. Lupe’s story exposes the discrimination, identity development, family, peers, and sociohistorical, cultural contexts affecting an immigrant student’s world in the United States. Most important, this article brings awareness to educators and practitioners working with immigrant adolescents of an immigrant student’s resilient triumph over a country’s hostile welcome.</p>

<title>Participant</title>
<p>Lupe is a female, first-generation college graduate, elementary school teacher, residing in the Los Angeles area. She permanently immigrated to the United States as a 13-year-old. Even though she is a naturalized American citizen, Lupe primarily identifies as an Indigenous Mexican Maya immigrant.</p>

<title>Materials and Analysis</title>
<p>For this case study, an open-ended interview protocol was prepared, which focused on themes surrounding Lupe’s life in Mexico; the migration experience from Mexico to the United States; her post migration transition in American schools; family, community, and college; and her professional career. Interviews serve as a very important data point for case study research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0739986312449584">Creswell, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0739986312449584">Yin, 2003</xref>). An autobiographic paper Lupe wrote for a class while attending college was also examined. Documents such as Lupe’s narrative are an important component of case study research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0739986312449584">Creswell, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0739986312449584">Yin, 2003</xref>). These documents can act as evidence to support other sources of data that are part of the investigation, such as interviews, triangulating the claims made about Lupe’s life trajectory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0739986312449584">Yin, 2003</xref>). I analyzed both the interview transcripts and autobiographical writing to explore Lupe’s experiences as a female Indigenous Mexican immigrant within the context of the United States.</p>

<sec id="section5-0739986312449584">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>I first spent several weeks conducting multiple phone interviews and one in-person interview with Lupe. Three years after conducting the initial interviews, I interviewed Lupe again to obtain an update on her life. I gathered information about her life trajectory up to the date of my last interview with Lupe (2006). After years of working on this case study, Lupe and one of her college professors provided me with an autobiographical paper she wrote about her immigrant experience. With Lupe’s permission, I was able to examine and incorporate excerpts of her autobiographical narrative in my case study analysis.</p>

<title>“Yucatan es muy diferente”: The Historical and Political Background of Mayas in Yucatan</title>
<p>Lupe was born in a small Mexican town of Yucatan, the town dramatically contrasted with the city she arrived at in the United States. Lupe wrote the following about her life in Yucatan:
<disp-quote>
<p>My homeland was a Maya village . . . El pueblo . . . has traditions which are rooted in our Maya past. In a spiritual ceremony, the men cook and ask for rain. Although the prayers come from the teachings of the Catholic Church, they asked for the rain with a traditional Maya prayer. Tourists would always come to town and try to take pictures of men, women, and children, my mom would always tell us to get inside the house. Almost every adult in the town spoke Maya. My grandmother spoke Maya most of the time. My older brother had learned Maya from her because he and my mom lived at her house until he was four. I do not remember seeing my grandmother until the age of five, and the passing of the language did not occur. As oppressed people, over the years the Maya communities teach their language less and less to their children. As a result Spanish has replaced Maya among many children. The use of Maya in my speech and that of other Maya children that never mastered their language was limited to phrases and words, and an understanding of the language without the fluency necessary to reply. Maya had been my parent’s first language, and it became my second language. Only one phone existed in the whole town, and four or five cars, five or six trucks. We had a house, my brother and I shared a room, we slept in hammocks.</p>
<p>The people would not allow anyone to starve. Poor people built their own houses from trees and dirt; my dad had been immensely poor as a child so he always talked about how to build these houses. Homelessness was non-existent; no one lived in the streets. Relatives and neighbors would not let anyone be homeless. (<italic>Autobiography</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0739986312449584">Lupe, n.d.</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>As Lupe described, her town has strongly held on to its Indigenous roots. In the interviews, Lupe stated that she enjoyed reciting poems at her school and loved getting involved with planning and participating in school events for the Mexican holidays. Lupe also enjoyed going with her grandmother to the outdoor <italic>mercado</italic> where people from the town brought the food they grew to sell. A strong, collective community existed in Lupe’s town, as she illustrated with the support given to the most impoverished people by their family and neighbors. Lupe had a major shift in environment when she immigrated to the United States, from a culture that has a collectivist cultural schema to the American culture characterized by individualism, independence, and individual success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0739986312449584">Markus &amp; Kitayama, 1991</xref>).</p>
<p>Within Mexico, one of the largest populations of Indigenous people is in the tropical peninsula of Yucatan, where 65.5% of the state’s population is Indigenous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0739986312449584">Lewin-Fischer, 2007</xref>). Yucatan has changed throughout time, politically, economically, and socially. The Indigenous populations’ traditional agrarian economies were heavily affected by the increased globalization policies in Mexico (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0739986312449584">Beaucage, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0739986312449584">Nash, 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0739986312449584">1995</xref>).</p>
<p>Similar to immigrants and other minorities in the United States, Indigenous populations are stigmatized in Mexico. Indigenous peoples are viewed as only being part of the past history of Mexico and blended into the <italic>mestizaje</italic> of the nation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0739986312449584">Castañeda, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0739986312449584">Fox &amp; Rivera-Salgado, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0739986312449584">Stavenhagen, 2002</xref>). Initially, the policy established for Indigenous populations in Mexico was one of “incorporating” them into Mexican society, so that they would assimilate into the national culture by learning Spanish and through reform of their agrarian way of life. In the late 1940s, however, <italic>indigenismo</italic> programs took on a more “integrative” role. Through this frame of <italic>indigenismo</italic>, Indigenous populations are seen as individually identifying with a community of people due to cultural factors such as language, values, specific consciousness, isolation, and residing within specific boundaries and locations, termed <italic>regiones de refugio,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0739986312449584">2</xref></sup></italic> where government agencies of <italic>indigenismo</italic> created zones of intervention to reach the goals of cultural integration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0739986312449584">Sariego-Rodriguez, 2003</xref>). The limitations of this nationwide system of intervention, however, lie in the homogenization of the different Indigenous ethnic groups and the assumption that every Indigenous person will want to fully integrate into the Mexican “mainstream” culture.</p>
<p>Alejos-Garcia discussed the changes the Maya identity has encountered as a marginalized community in Mexico. Although there has been a lack of respect by the dominant Mexican culture toward the Indigenous population and by the continuing globalization of Mexican culture, economy, and government influenced by Western culture, the Maya culture and identity has continued to exist. The Maya identity has endured all these changes by adapting and becoming inclusive of the influences caused by the globalization and domination of the Mexican and American nations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0739986312449584">Alejos-Garcia, 2004</xref>). Yet, although the Maya identity (in all its different forms) persists, the marginality found in Mexico toward her Indigenous populations permeates the contexts of the Maya people of Yucatan. Bracamonte y Sosa and Lizama-Quijano discussed the marginalization of the Maya populations of Yucatan as a result of both segregationist and national integrationist governmental policies. This marginality is not only seen in terms of high levels of poverty and lack of education but is also reflected in social and psychological issues affecting the Indigenous populations, such as alcohol abuse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0739986312449584">Bracamonte y Sosa &amp; Lizama-Quijano, 2003</xref>). In her writing, Lupe described alcoholism as one reason for migrating to the United States:
<disp-quote>
<p>My dad had become an alcoholic and life at home was anything but peaceful or happy. Due to his alcoholism and competition, his employment had been decreasing over the last three years. His clients did not like his drinking problem and other people has bought trucks [sic]. This lack of clients increased his drinking. (<italic>Autobiography</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0739986312449584">Lupe, n.d.</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Due to increasing economic hardships and scarcity of jobs in Mexico (Fitzgerald, 2008; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0739986312449584">Massey, Durand, &amp; Malone, 2002</xref>), many Yucatecos began to migrate to the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0739986312449584">Cornelius, Fitzgerald, &amp; Lewin-Fischer, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0739986312449584">Fox &amp; Rivera-Salgado, 2004</xref>; Sosa, 1997). The geographical changes that occur when migrating to a different physical space simultaneously occur with changes in the surrounding ethnic, racial, and cultural contexts. What follows is Lupe’s account of her crossings into the United States with her family; the challenges and risks faced at home, in junior high, high school, and college; and Lupe’s resilience throughout her journey.</p>

<title>Lupe’s Multiple Crossings to the United States</title>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>My uncle[s] became part of the bracero [farm worker] program. Eventually, they sponsored all of their family, including my mother. My dad, in order to earn sufficient money to marry my mom, came to the United States with my uncles. . . . My mom with a four year old, my brother, and a three month old, myself, crossed the border [later on]. My dad worked as a janitor at a fast food restaurant and at a private school. . . . My grandmother became ill, and my father wanted to be with her until she died. Thus, we returned to Mexico. My parents had planned to return to the United States after her death. However, when she died, about a year after we arrived, my dad had already bought a truck and had started his own transportation business. [My brother] was fifteen when he once again crossed the border with my uncle. My parents, my sister and I left Mexico in the summer. We left because my brother had asked us to come many times in his letters, and also because soon we would have had hard times as my dad kept falling deeper and deeper into alcoholism and losing his clients.

</disp-quote></p>
<p>After initially immigrating to the United States, Alberto, Lupe’s father, decided to return to Mexico, although Maria (his wife and Lupe’s mother) was reluctant to go because of the children and the better life they had in the United States. However, the family returned to Mexico and Alberto started his own business, but his sales decreased as the economy became less favorable for self-sufficient Indigenous populations of Yucatan. Coupled with despair and depression, Alberto turned to alcohol. Fortunately, Alberto and Maria decided that things would be better if they took their daughters and joined their son in California. This decision marked the beginning of a new chapter in Lupe’s life.</p>

<sec id="section9-0739986312449584">
<title>A Small Bedroom for Five</title>
<p>As Lupe described the host culture environment that received her in California, she recalled the small room in her uncle’s two-room apartment where her family lived for two years. She wrote the following:
<disp-quote>
<p>My whole family had to fit in one apartment room. We lived with my uncle and his wife in his two-bedroom apartment. My mom would not allow us to go to the living room because twelve other recent immigrants lived there. No backyard, no animals, no plants, only three uncles and five cousins whom we rarely saw. I wanted to go back, but I had no choice. I had to stay, listen, learn, adapt, and only remember [my hometown] through my memories. A room can be very asphyxiating for five people, no space to walk, and barely enough space to sleep. The end of the summer meant the beginning of school. And although school scared me, it represented the opportunity to get out of the room. (<italic>Autobiography</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0739986312449584">Lupe, n.d.</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Living in a small room, with four other people, made it difficult for Lupe to have any personal space. Lupe yearned for her hometown, as she saw her situation worsen in the place that, unlike the films and pictures she had seen, was far from glamorous or enjoyable. Even before they step foot on U.S. soil, teenagers all over the world are often immersed in the image of an American culture with infinite possibilities and comfortable lifestyles portrayed by media outlets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0739986312449584">Suarez-Orozco &amp; Suarez-Orozco, 2001</xref>). Yet, many immigrants to the United States become disappointed with the reception they face, as it contradicts the idea of an American dream to prosper and be successful (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0739986312449584">Hochschild, 1992</xref>).</p>

<p>Our [Mexican] English teacher spent an equal amount of time teaching us Maya as he did English. He made me aware that the Aztecs were not my ancestors, that Mexican history is only part of my history, not all of it. He made me realize that I was the dead Indian we studied in history class. In school we never switched rooms, the teachers did. We did not have lockers or bells . . . we never ate meals in school. Meals were a family affair; the whole family ate together during meals. (<italic>Autobiography</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0739986312449584">Lupe, n.d.</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>She described school in a positive tone and makes a reference to the importance of her culture and explanations her teacher gave of her ancestral roots. In contrast, when Lupe described the first day of school in California, as an eighth grader, she said, “At that age, of course they were going to laugh at me. I was very confused. Kids can be really mean at that age” (Lupe, personal communication, 2002). She also wrote:
<disp-quote>
<p>I was unable to join an ESL class right away. The counselor sent me to an adult school for half of the school day. I still cannot comprehend why I could not be placed in an ESL class. . . . Lunch confused me to the extent that reading a book at the library constituted my lunch. I never recognized any of the food. Schoolmates talked to me while I waited in line, but I did not understand what they said. Also, I had no friends to eat lunch with. The counselor had given me a locker number, never explaining anything, not even the location or purpose.</p>
<p>The first year, I spent a lot of time trying to figure out how a part of the school system worked. Simple things, which a counselor or a teacher could have explained in five minutes, took me days, weeks, and even months to understand. For example, had someone explained tracking to me, I would have known that my math class was too easy because I had been put in the wrong level. The math teacher could have also helped. . . . She just did not care enough to help. (<italic>Autobiography</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0739986312449584">Lupe, n.d.</xref>)</p>

<p>Teachers and counselors play a crucial role in the education of immigrant youth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0739986312449584">Suarez-Orozco &amp; Suarez-Orozco, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0739986312449584">Valenzuela, 1999</xref>). If educators do not care for the well-being of the students or help them navigate the new school system the youth will notice and this can influence the student’s sense of belonging and academic engagement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0739986312449584">Suarez-Orozco, Pimentel, &amp; Martin, 2009</xref>). Lupe came to the United States at a crucial age for any child. At 13, she was going through adolescence, a difficult time for children as they explore and develop their identity and self-concept (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0739986312449584">Erikson, 1950</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0739986312449584">Harter, 1990</xref>). Youth must learn to navigate the different contexts and cultures found at home and at school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0739986312449584">Davidson, Phelan, &amp; Cao, 1991</xref>).</p>
<p>When immigrants like Lupe enter an American school they have a harder time adjusting to the “teen culture,” especially when seen as an outsider by their peers. For Lupe it was difficult to define herself with her peers. “I was always wearing long t-shirts and sweats, that’s all we could afford,” she stated. Many times immigrant children want to “wear clothes that will let them be ‘cool’ or at the very least, do not draw attention to themselves” and “become acutely aware of nuances of behaviors that although ‘normal’ at home, will set them apart as ‘strange’ and foreign in public” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0739986312449584">Suarez Orozco &amp; Suarez-Orozco, 2001</xref>, pp. 88-89). In an interview, Lupe discussed her feeling of isolation from her peers. She stated:
<disp-quote>
<p>I had no peer relationships in part because they segregated us from all the kids. The only kids I knew and I developed some friendships with were the ones like me, who didn’t know any English. . . . School only taught me how to read and maybe how to be verbal in an academic sense, but not in a social sense. That is why I felt so isolated from all the other kids. (Lupe, personal communication, 2002)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Furthermore, immigrant children must often take on household responsibilities, such as translating documents or facilitating interactions between school officials and their parents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0739986312449584">Love &amp; Buriel, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0739986312449584">Suarez-Orozco &amp; Suarez-Orozco, 2001</xref>). The adolescents must learn to balance these family roles with their roles as students. Immigrant parents, like any American parent, worry about the influences of peers, media, and so on, on their children. However, immigrant parents are cautious of the changes their children go through in American schools that are different from their home country’s schools and worry about the influences of American culture on the rules they have set for their children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0739986312449584">Suarez-Orozco &amp; Suarez-Orozco, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0739986312449584">Suarez-Orozco, Suarez-Orozco, &amp; Todorova, 2008</xref>). A negotiation between parent and adolescent must occur as the adolescent navigates the new cultural schemas learned largely from attending school. Other factors shaping the immigrant adolescent identities are equally influential in the adolescent’s adaptation to multiple cultural contexts. These factors include level of acculturation, citizenship or residency status, parent’s socioeconomic status, teachers, and language (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0739986312449584">Olsen, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0739986312449584">Portes &amp; Rumbaut, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0739986312449584">2006</xref>). The language factor became a constant theme in Lupe’s narrative and interviews. Lupe discussed the hardships of continuing to learn English after she stopped going to adult school:
<disp-quote>
<p>I lacked confidence in my pronunciation and word order, and thought I might not be understood. To say something and be misunderstood . . . asking for permission “to live” instead of “to leave,” could be very embarrassing. Classmates laughed at me, and teachers could not understand me. Reading out loud in English brings fear to this day. Although many of my friends believe English is my first language, I cannot read English out loud without feeling uncomfortable about my accent, unless listeners are currently learning English. . . . When they stopped sending me to adult school, my counselor added eighth grade history and science to my schedule. Many students stay in ESL for a long time and sometimes until the end of high school, because their teachers do not believe in them and they do not have high self-esteem. My self-esteem had gone down when I arrived, due to the unknown environment, change of status, racism, etc. However, when the ESL teacher left in the middle of the year, the new teacher believed in me. She placed me in ninth grade college-preparatory English. She knew that ESL or a low track class could become a trap. (<italic>Autobiography</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0739986312449584">Lupe, n.d.</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>English as discussed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0739986312449584">Portes and Rumbaut (2001)</xref> comes to symbolize a sense of nationalism in this country. Many students are caught between learning this new language to stop being an outsider and losing their home language (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0739986312449584">Olsen, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0739986312449584">Suarez-Orozco &amp; Suarez-Orozco, 2001</xref>). Lupe described the challenges of being teased as she learned English. This not only influenced her discomfort with reading in English years later but also lowered her self-confidence and self-esteem. As was true in Lupe’s case, immigrants often experience ethnic and racial stereotypes and prejudices at school from their peers and with their teachers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0739986312449584">Olsen, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0739986312449584">Suarez-Orozco &amp; Suarez-Orozco, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0739986312449584">Tatum, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0739986312449584">Valenzuela, 1999</xref>). Equally important, Lupe highlighted that some teachers did care and believed in her (e.g., the new ESL teacher who placed Lupe in college-preparatory English). The support Lupe received from these teachers countered some of the prejudicial, stigmatizing acts from other instructors and peers. One particular teacher became a role model for Lupe, motivated her to apply to college, and helped her with the college application process.</p>

<title>The High School Years</title>
<p>Lupe remained in some ESL classes when she started high school. She was placed in the lowest tracks of the school and continued to get below-average grades in her classes. English language learners are frequently tracked into the lower-level classrooms that do not provide college-level preparation, do not challenge the students in learning English or in academic course content, and often have unprepared teachers with limited resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0739986312449584">Callahan, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0739986312449584">Katz, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0739986312449584">Olsen, 1997</xref>). Studies have found that placement of students in lower tracks results in less exposure to higher-order thinking skills, lower-quality discourse and language, and overall lower academic performance and achievement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0739986312449584">Callahan, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0739986312449584">Carbonaro &amp; Gamoran, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0739986312449584">Raudenbush, Rowan, &amp; Cheong, 1993</xref>). In addition, tracking of English language learners results in further social, academic, and linguistic isolation and stigmatization from other “mainstream” students, low teacher expectations, and, consequently, poor relationships between the teachers and students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0739986312449584">Katz, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0739986312449584">Olsen, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0739986312449584">Valdes, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0739986312449584">Valenzuela, 1999</xref>). The tracking systems found in schools influences the school culture and community, two key factors that shape how students will perceive going to college (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0739986312449584">Krovetz, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Having support from the other students helped Lupe build a community and cope with the sense of isolation and stigmatization. Lupe wrote about the importance of Chicano students as her peer support group:
<disp-quote>
<p>In ninth grade, Chicanos made English a comfortable language to communicate in. If I needed to say a word in Spanish they still understood me. The Chicano and Latino community had strong bonds and a special love for immigrants; differences were not made among wetbacks, US born <italic>raza</italic>, and the two brothers from Iran. The only year I have ever felt a sense of community in school, including college, was in ninth grade. Separated in one corner of the quad during lunch time, we stood together. At the end of ninth grade, Mr. V., a teacher, talked to us about forming a club to help each other with academics, coping with racism, and helping each other advance in the tracking system. We thought this would make our union official, and so we formed the Hispanic Connection Club, the name left out the two Iranian brothers, but they were still part of the club. The president of the club was my brother and I was the secretary. (<italic>Autobiography</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0739986312449584">Lupe, n.d.</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Lupe established friendships with other students of color to cope and learn to navigate her academic context. Building these peer networks is something many students of color engage in as they develop their racial and ethnic identities and encounter stigmatization and discrimination in educational contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0739986312449584">Tatum, 1997</xref>). Lupe’s older brother guided her in school and provided her some comfort. Yet, as her brother became more and more frustrated with the stigma and discrimination he faced in school and in society in general, he developed an adversarial stance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0739986312449584">Suarez-Orozco &amp; Suarez-Orozco, 2001</xref>) and turned to gangs. Alarmed by this, Lupe’s parents decided to do whatever was necessary to take their children out of that environment. They moved to an upper-middle-class suburb in southern California.</p>
<p>Lupe’s new high school was different from her first high school. The composition of the students was predominantly upper middle class White Americans and Asian Americans. Lupe described the transition into this new cultural context in her writing:
<disp-quote>
<p>However, moving does not solve the problem of racism in school or society. Throughout high school students would ask me, “Do you speak English?” One time they asked this question in a CP English class. Classmates sitting behind me would make comments about the barrios, Mexicans’ animal tendencies, or how much they would enjoy hurting us. A comment was made once about the day workers (<italic>jornaleros)</italic>. Two boys discussed how much fun they could have by offering jobs to these men, putting them in the back of a big truck but instead of taking them to work, they would take them down to the border. Afterwards they laughed. Racism places a veil of ignorance on the racist person. Not only can the person not learn from other races, but he or she knows nothing about these other races and they are quick to judge and hate out of ignorance. Hearing the comments of the upper class white community created pain in my heart. One teacher said, “look they’re like animals” [in response to watching minorities protesting on the news]. I told her that she did not know what it was like to be Black or Mexican living in Los Angeles. She gave me a B- in typing; I think my grade reflected my comment. (<italic>Autobiography</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0739986312449584">Lupe, n.d.</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>To live in this neighborhood in order to attend this college preparatory high school, Lupe’s parents made drastic changes in their living and family relationships. Her father at times worked three separate jobs. Her mother began to work full-time again and on her days off started to clean houses. At school Lupe was not labeled by a track or as an ESLer, but she still had trouble understanding some vocabulary. Lupe was challenged academically and re-tracked to be in advanced placement courses that would prepare her for college. Yet with this academic opportunity came more racial microaggressions, and in this high school Lupe did not have other minority students as a support network. The excerpts above are instances of microassaults from both peers and teachers. Microassaults refer to microaggressions that are deliberate, often conscious, and explicitly attack the victim of the aggression through derogatory comments or names against their group or avoidant behavior and discriminatory actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0739986312449584">Sue, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0739986312449584">Sue et al., 2007</xref>). Hence, the comparison of ethnic and racial minorities to “animals” by Lupe’s teacher is a clear depiction of a microassault.</p>
<p>The students in this school consistently made Lupe feel intellectually inferior. This would occur when the other students would patronize and act differently around Lupe because they ascribed a lower degree of intelligence to her due to her Mexican immigrant heritage. This type of microaggression is known as a microinsult, which is defined as an unconscious action or form of communication that has an insulting tone directed to a group or individual that demeans the person or group’s intelligence, forms of communication, practices, values, and/or characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0739986312449584">Sue, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0739986312449584">Sue et al., 2007</xref>). Due to their subtle nature, microaggressions are not taken as serious, harmful factors and passed off as an overreaction or oversensitivity on behalf of the victim (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0739986312449584">Sue et al., 2007</xref>). However, microaggressions do in fact represent the wider inequities and institutional discrimination embedded in American society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0739986312449584">Sue, 2010</xref>). They perpetuate stereotypes; cause anger, frustration, low self-esteem; and cumulatively become taxing, stressful, and straining to the emotional well-being of individuals targeted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0739986312449584">Sue, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>As a consequence, Lupe often felt like leaving high school and simply working full-time at her part-time job where she felt safe. Yet, she kept herself motivated by thinking of the trouble her family had gone through, especially with her brother in and out of prison. Lupe’s brother had been initiated in a gang since he was 16. The gang became her brother’s “family,” and like him the other members were disappointed by “the system.” Lupe explained that her brother and fellow gang members were referring to many systems, such as the education system, justice system, and those that automatically labeled them and their families as <italic>criminals, uneducated</italic>, and <italic>incompetent</italic>.</p>
<p>The experiences with Lupe’s brother affected everyone in the family; they felt the stigma of being related to a “criminal.” The mistreatment from the inmate facility employees and general process of visiting their son in prison had a large emotional toll on Lupe’s parents. Meanwhile, Lupe was trying to be successful and defy the established stereotypes society had of her and the Mexican community. Lupe stated that after relocating to their new community her mother and father felt closer to that “American Dream,” but her brother’s incarceration and the overt and covert racism exhibited by their neighbors, at the store, and at school parent meetings made their dream a nightmare. These abundant feelings of disappointment are common among racial and ethnic minorities, who are left at the margins of this “dream” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0739986312449584">Hochschild, 1992</xref>). Initially immigrants and their children have positive feelings toward the United States, yet with the negative cultural climates they face in their community and in school, they begin to develop different opinions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0739986312449584">Suarez-Orozco &amp; Suarez-Orozco, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>However, many immigrant adolescent and emerging adults thrive despite the various challenges encountered in their adaptation to the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0739986312449584">Suarez-Orozco &amp; Suarez-Orozco, 2001</xref>). Contextual moderators such as parental support, high academic achievement, and friendships with prosocial adolescents serve to buffer the negative effects of how persons perceive discriminatory experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0739986312449584">Brody et al., 2006</xref>). Although Lupe’s family encountered many setbacks in their transition and adaptation to the United States, her parents supported Lupe in school in whatever way they could and Lupe increasingly became more academically successful as she continued to master English. Lupe developed meaningful friendships with diverse, academically oriented students, and with White students who did not discriminate her. Studies have revealed that building friendships not only with other minority students but also with White students is important in the development of ethnic identity, in dispelling stereotypes and stigmas, and in academic achievement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0739986312449584">Gonzalez, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0739986312449584">Guzman, Santiago-Rivera, &amp; Haase, 2005</xref>). Lupe was also part of a wider immigrant network consisting of some of her relatives and other immigrants from her hometown. Immigrant communities cope with experiences of discrimination by using their immigrant social networks for support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0739986312449584">Portes &amp; Rumbaut, 2006</xref>; Prelat &amp; Maciel, 2007). Although at times Lupe was depressed due to the constant isolation she experienced at school and frustration she felt when encountering microaggressions, she strongly believed that she would be able to alleviate her family problems through education. This belief and her perseverance catalyzed Lupe’s decision to apply to college.</p>

<title>Applying to College</title>
<p>Lupe recalled applying to college in her writing. She described not only the obstacles she encountered while filling out applications, such as the lack of support from her school counselor, but also reflected on the help she did receive from other educators.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>During senior year, immigrant students need support from their parents as they decide what to do after high school. My schoolmates had their parents fill their financial aid forms, and help them with their college and university applications. They had their mom or dad pay for their SAT, ACT, and A.P. exams. I had to work to pay them or apply for financial aid, if offered. Sitting at the financial aid workshop, a tear dropped, I watched students with parents, or just parents, I was alone. Afterwards, I asked the school counselor a question about the FAFSA application, she told me to read the book. I had already read the book. The only help I received came from a teacher. Mr. V had been the only teacher at my old school, which had given any attention or devoted any time to the <italic>raza</italic> community. He had been my math teacher during the summer before tenth grade. More than a teacher, he had become my friend. And because he was an adult, a Chicano who had gone to a university, he wanted to see more <italic>raza</italic> go to universities. Even though I had changed schools, Mr. V and I stayed friends. He wrote me a letter of recommendation, when I was applying to universities. He was there to answer my questions I had about universities. Had I asked him to help me fill out my financial aid applications, he would have helped me. (<italic>Autobiography</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0739986312449584">Lupe, n.d.</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Lupe’s resilience through middle school and high school was influenced by the support she had from her teacher and mentor, Mr. V. The National Mentoring Partnership defines mentoring as a developmental process in which a caring individual offers “guidance, support, and encouragement aimed at developing the competence and character of the mentee” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0739986312449584">Darling, 2005</xref>, p. 177). Included in this guidance must be an understanding of the social context and stage of development of the adolescent. Mr. V. saw an intelligent adolescent in Lupe and with an understanding of her immigrant Latina student context, he informed her about college and encouraged her to apply. Mentors such as Mr. V. also serve as role models. Lupe states in her writing that Mr. V. was a Chicano who had gone to a university, and in this sense, she imagined herself following in his footsteps. The support mentors provide plays a large part in the resiliency process of any student.</p>
<p>Lupe’s mentor guided her through the college application process. Her school counselor, inflicting a microinsult, recommended that she not even go through the trouble of applying to 4-year universities because she could use the community college system to gain more experience with school. Meanwhile, Mr. V. urged her to apply to top-tier institutions because he saw a great potential in her. He guided her step by step through the applications, and ultimately, she asked her other teachers for letters of recommendation and help with her personal statement. Two of her history teachers, White males, also saw great potential in Lupe and were willing to help.</p>
<p>Lupe also wrote about the adversity she faced due to her many top-tier university acceptances:
<disp-quote>
<p>In the spring of my senior year, I received acceptance letters from UCLA, UC Berkeley, UC San Diego, UC Irvine, UC Santa Cruz, UC Davis, Occidental College, and Stanford. Many classmates and teachers had kept me at the bottom in all my classes and to them college never seemed like a realistic option for me, but now reality hit them. I had gone from the lowest levels of tracking to the highest levels. . . . However my counselor and schoolmates had a difficult time placing me at the top of the school because they had always placed me at the bottom. As a result, they said I had gotten in [to college] thanks to affirmative action. . . .</p>
<p>My parents helped me; they told me to study, even if they could not help me. I should have taken the time in high school to teach them English, but I never did. I could have taught them everything I knew; instead I chose the easiest solution, to do for them whatever they could not do because of their lack of knowledge of English. I made them dependent on me, and when I left home I felt guilty for not teaching them, and worried about people mistreating them. (<italic>Autobiography</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0739986312449584">Lupe, n.d.</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Lupe explained that teachers and peers attributed her college acceptances to affirmative action. Ascribing the academic achievement of minority students to affirmative action can be detrimental to the students’ self-confidence, ethnic identity, and school achievement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0739986312449584">Solorzano &amp; Yosso, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0739986312449584">Steele, 1997</xref>). Students feel conflicted when peers or teachers argue that they are only successful due to affirmative action, and hence the students may begin to doubt their academic performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0739986312449584">Heilman, Block, &amp; Lucas, 1992</xref>). Lupe faced doubt from others consistently during her high school years and even when accepted to prestigious institutions of higher education. However, it was not this attribution of her intelligence and academic success to affirmative action that made Lupe’s decision to go to college difficult; instead, it was her dedication to her family.</p>
<p>Lupe’s decision to go to college was initially only partly supported by her parents because she chose to attend a school that was 6 hours away from home. Her parents were uneasy of Lupe’s desire to attend a university that was far away. Immigrant parents worry about the “liberal” views of American society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0739986312449584">Suarez-Orozco &amp; Suarez-Orozco, 2001</xref>). Lupe’s parents believed the other college students could wrongly influence their daughter.</p>
<p>Lupe was also torn between attaining a college education and continuing to help her parents at home. She felt guilty for not teaching her parents English, although she had provided her parents with a copious amount of support as she took on many adult responsibilities. As addressed previously, many immigrant students take the role of helping their parents with necessary translations from English to their native language (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0739986312449584">Love &amp; Buriel, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0739986312449584">Suarez-Orozco &amp; Suarez-Orozco, 2001</xref>). Adultification refers to this process in which children from low-income backgrounds prematurely take increased responsibilities and adult roles within their family unit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0739986312449584">Burton, 2007</xref>). Lupe took the role of translator for her parents and also had the responsibility of caring for her younger sibling when both parents worked long hours. In addition, moving away from her family was extremely difficult since she was the first person to go to college. Although her parents were reluctant to let her go, they ultimately agreed that they had come to the United States to educate their children. Lupe recalled:
<disp-quote>
<p>They understood that I had chosen to go away and knew that holding me back would not be right. I became homesick a week before I left home, I no longer wanted to come to college or move from home. My mom told me sooner or later I had to leave home and what better reason than higher education. (Lupe, personal communication, 2002)</p>

<title>The University Years</title>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>College shocked my way of life; the English language took over the whole day. Home and school no longer divided the use of my languages, Spanish and Maya at home and English at school could no longer be. I found dining hall workers and housekeepers to be the only people who spoke Spanish like my family. The way people complained about the food made obvious their class status, middle to upper middle class. Also to my dorm-mates shopping was a form of entertainment or reward. Many of them found joy in material objects. The materialistic society that I lived in became more apparent because I spent all my days with people who live and enjoy life in a materialistic culture. Also during spring quarter of freshman year, the Chicano community felt racism during the showing of a movie. The incident took place in the auditorium, before a feature film a ten-minute video on the grape boycott by the united farm workers was shown. Before the short film ended, students yelled, “beaners go back home to Mexico, wetbacks, dirty Mexicans go back to Mexico.” I heard students at a prestigious institution of higher learning express their racial hate.</p>
<p>Sophomore year . . . was very confusing. I thought about transferring, or taking a year off. I decided to wait for things to fall in their places. In addition to these problems, my brother had been charged with armed robbery during fall quarter. His public defender convinced him to plead guilty as charged in exchange for less time in jail. The day after I came home for winter break, we attended his sentencing. The judge sentenced him to one year in county jail and five years probation. Five days before Christmas, two police officers placed handcuffs on his wrist and took him away. He served nine months . . . less than a year later he would be arrested again; this time his sentence would be 7 years in prison.

</disp-quote></p>
<p>In college Lupe felt uncomfortable with the campus community. Lupe found the university to be a larger version of the high school she attended, with regard to the high socioeconomic status of students and the treatment she received from peers. The cultural context of the university, encounters with microaggressions, and the institution’s lack of effort to embrace and encourage diversity definitely factor into the comfort and success of Latina/o students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0739986312449584">Gonzalez, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0739986312449584">Yosso, Ceja, Smith, &amp; Solorzano, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>During these years Lupe continued to develop her self-concept. The self-concept is composed of multiple role identities. Which of these identities becomes salient and how they are complemented or negotiated depends on the cultural contexts surrounding the individual (Nagel, 1994). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0739986312449584">Markus, Mullaly, and Kitayama (1997)</xref> describe the self as active and multifaceted, full of internalized images, schemas, and conceptions. Thus, when identity negotiation is conflicting between different possible self-ways and within different cultural contexts an individual’s behavior may be affected and the development of those identities can become stagnant or ignored. Minority students in 4-year universities often find it difficult to negotiate these identities and face a period of isolation and disengagement from the university (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0739986312449584">Cabrera &amp; Padilla, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0739986312449584">Gonzalez, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0739986312449584">Yosso et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Lupe dealt with this development and negotiation of multiple identities throughout her years in college. At times this led to depression that affected her academic work. However, Lupe graduated from this university despite her academic problems. This resiliency was partly due to her strong connection with her Indigenous Mexican roots, ethnic identity development, and close relationship with her family. A study about Native American students found students who maintained a strong connection with their cultural traditions and family and had a support network developed an academic plan that fostered resilience and success in college (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0739986312449584">Montgomery, Miville, Winterowd, Jeffries, &amp; Baysden, 2000</xref>). Another study of American Indians exploring depressive symptoms and perceptions of discrimination revealed that regular participation in traditional cultural practices served as a buffer for the effects of perceived discrimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0739986312449584">Whitbeck, McMorris, Hoyt, Stubben, &amp; LaFromboise, 2002</xref>). Ethnic identity research shows that individuals who reach complete ethnic identity achievement develop mechanisms to disengage from negative stereotypes of their racial and ethnic groups and do not internalize or allow the stereotypes to affect their identities (Phinney, 1993). This allows for positive psychological development.</p>

<p>I don’t mean to think like this, but I really couldn’t go back and permanently live in Mexico. And I know that in this country I will never feel fully American. (Lupe, personal communication, 2002)</p>
<p>I identify as Mexican. . . . I can identify myself with Native Americans as well, not from the United States, but from Mexico. And I guess I cannot be Mexican only, because I have adapted to life here so much. But I won’t say that I am American, because I don’t feel like I am. (Lupe, personal communication, 2006)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Lupe’s feelings toward being American are complex and conflicted. Lupe acknowledged that she has had more opportunities in this country than she could ever have had in Mexico, such as attending a prestigious university and becoming a teacher. Yet, Lupe also acknowledged the injustices and obstacles her family encountered. Situations like the incarceration of her brother and Lupe’s experiences with discrimination lead her to say, “I can’t go one day without reminding myself that I am Yucateco and Mexican, and that sometimes this can . . . [be enough to] get me in trouble” (Lupe, personal communication, 2006). Lupe believes there are many privileges she enjoys in American society (e.g., a college education), and she does not take these privileges for granted. However, Lupe stated:
<disp-quote>
<p>Sometimes I feel like this country is more and more hostile towards us and it is so sad. I see the kids that I am teaching and picture them dropping out of school or going to prison, because of the inadequate educational system, and I tell myself to believe in them. I do believe in them, but sometimes I am reluctant to believe in the system they are in. (Lupe, personal communication, 2002)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Currently, Lupe lives with her parents in an upper-middle-class suburb and teaches in a low-income, Los Angeles area community. Her students are predominantly immigrants. Lupe gets frustrated when some of the other teachers and administrators expect them to fail and engage in microaggressive comments about the students during faculty meetings. She is consistently bothered by the lack of resources she has available to her for the learning needs of her students. Within this context, Lupe believes that she faces many limitations as an educator. Teachers of English learners face multiple challenges in communicating with the students’ families, do not have enough time to teach all the required subject matter as well as the English Language Learner curriculum, lack the necessary resources to teach the students, and do not have the necessary support from schools, districts, and policymakers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0739986312449584">Gándara, Maxwell-Jolly, &amp; Driscoll, 2005</xref>). Nonetheless, Lupe serves as a role model for her students and for those individuals who may want to serve as educators for immigrant students.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This longitudinal case study of Lupe’s journey as an immigrant Indigenous Mexicana in the United States exposes three main themes: (1) the discriminatory and stigmatizing experiences Lupe encountered, (2) various sources of support Lupe received, and (3) Lupe’s resilience process and outcomes. Lupe faced stigmatization and discrimination at multiple levels during her adolescence and emerging adulthood. The stigmatization faced as a Latina immigrant and as an English Language learner was reflected in the multitude of microaggressions she experienced daily from her teachers, counselors, and classmates during junior high, high school, and college. In addition, Lupe experienced institutional discrimination through being tracked into lower-level classes due to her status as an English language learner and her immigrant background. However, Lupe found support in the same contexts where she faced stigma and discrimination, such as with particular teachers and with peers who helped her transition to the United States. Lupe also found support in her family, helping her develop her ethnic identity rooted in Mexican and Indigenous Maya practices and beliefs that became a coping mechanism during her college years. Ultimately, the support from these different sources led to a successful academic resilience process.</p>
<p>As Padilla argues, when experiencing stigmatization and discriminatory encounters, an individual may use various coping mechanisms to moderate the aggression or threat. One of these mechanisms is engaging in social activism (asserting their ethnic identity and responding to the social injustices their group faces; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0739986312449584">Padilla, 2008</xref>). Lupe engaged in social activism during her university years (protesting for worker rights and for ethnic studies programs) and still continues to participate in civic engagement activities as a public school educator. Another mechanism is to develop bicultural strategies, which Lupe also competently achieved, as she became an adult.</p>
<p>Lupe’s immigrant trajectory in the United States is a success story. Lupe coped with many of the same day-to-day struggles of any immigrant adolescent in the United States, and as an adult Lupe continues to see the experiences of new immigrants as she educates them. Lupe developed coping strategies at each stage of her life to counter stigmatization and discrimination. She used her multiple external support networks, composed of familial and community support systems, high school mentors, and her own individual motivation and dedication to succeed in school. Many at-risk students use similar external and internal developmental assets as part of their resilience processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0739986312449584">Benson et al., 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>Lupe and her family continued to encounter injustices, for example, the deportation threat of her brother. Fortunately, Lupe was able to provide her time and financial support to hire an immigration lawyer for her brother. He remained in the United States and is now working hard to provide his own daughter a good education. Lupe maintains a strong bond with her family and helps her parents financially. Lupe is well aware of the many issues encountered by immigrants and children of immigrants. She uses this knowledge as she continues to serve her community as an educator.</p>
<p>As the population of immigrants and children of immigrants increase in the United States, profiling such stories as Lupe’s can influence a shift away from the negative labels placed on immigrant students. The education system must respond to the needs of immigrant children growing up in a context where they are harmfully stigmatized, often tracked in lower coursework levels, and lack resources throughout their K-12 education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0739986312449584">Callahan, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0739986312449584">Carbonaro &amp; Gamoran, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0739986312449584">Rumberger &amp; Gándara, 2004</xref>). These issues of inequity that immigrant students face within educational institutions are not small or easily resolved. However, a step toward a more equitable and inclusive educational system for these children and adolescents is to change the stigmatized representations of immigrant students across schools, districts, local communities, state policies, and ultimately, nationwide.</p>
<p>The United States is a country made up of immigrants, from its roots, to its most recent inhabitants, and multiculturalism constitutes its core. Understanding the diversity, needs, and resiliency processes of our multicultural and multilingual students will be the only way to change the discrimination and inequities prevalent not only in institutions such as the education system but also in the daily lives of these students. Immigrant children cannot be overlooked since they constitute a rapidly growing population across U.S. schools. Politicians, policy makers, educators, and mental health practitioners must understand the crucial, harmful effects that stigmatization and discrimination have on immigrant students’ educational outcomes and on their mental health. Fostering socially adept, mentally healthy, and academically high-achieving students is crucial for the future of the United States.</p>
<p>Lupe’s case is a clear example of the determination and ability that immigrant students have to be academically successful and in turn contribute to American society. As a public school teacher, Lupe continuously fights the inequities prevalent in the education of immigrant and underserved children. Exposing Lupe’s trajectory from an immigrant English Language Learner student in the U.S. school system to one of many teachers of immigrant English Language Learners, which rarely asked about their teaching challenges and perspectives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0739986312449584">Gándara, Maxwell-Jolly, &amp; Driscoll, 2005</xref>), provides multiple layers of understanding of the daily stigmatization faced by immigrant students, the resilience of an immigrant student, and the service and dedication of an educator with a cultural and immigrant background similar to that of her students.</p>
