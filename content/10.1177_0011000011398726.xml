<abstract>
<p>This study tests the temporal stability and the concurrent and predictive validity of the Emotional and Personality-related Career decision-making Difficulties (EPCD) model and questionnaire. Five hundred forty-three participants filled out the EPCD twice, 3 years apart. The Anxiety cluster was the most stable of the three, followed by the Self-Concept and Identity cluster, and then the Pessimistic Views cluster, which showed a significant decrease. Participants who reported having made a career decision by the second administration had lower EPCD scores at Time 1 than did those who remained undecided at Time 2. Whereas the decided group showed a decrease in the EPCD scores during the 3-year interval, the undecided group showed no significant decrease. Significant correlations were observed between the EPCD scores and low satisfaction with one’s chosen occupation. Gender differences were also found: among the decided group, women had higher EPCD scores than did men; overall, women had higher EPCD scores than did men only in the clusters of Anxiety and Self-Concept and Identity.</p>

<p><italic>Career indecision</italic> is typically defined as involving the difficulties encountered by individuals in making career decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0011000011398726">Chartrand, Rose, Elliot, Marmarosh, &amp; Caldwell, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0011000011398726">Gati, Krausz, &amp; Osipow, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0011000011398726">Osipow, Carney, &amp; Barak, 1976</xref>) and refers to all problems and challenges that need to be dealt with prior to, during, or after the decision-making process. Indeed, career indecision is among the most well-researched constructs in vocational psychology (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0011000011398726">Betz, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0011000011398726">Campbell &amp; Cellini, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0011000011398726">Gati et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0011000011398726">Jepsen &amp; Dilley, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0011000011398726">Leong &amp; Chervinko, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0011000011398726">Rounds &amp; Tinsley, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0011000011398726">Santos, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0011000011398726">Slaney, 1988</xref>).</p>
<p>The term <italic>developmental indecision</italic> has generally been used to refer to a normative phase in vocational development encountered by many young adults who are about to make a career decision. This phase is usually resolved fairly easily, sometimes with the assistance of career counseling or the provision of career information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0011000011398726">Betz &amp; Serling, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0011000011398726">Meldahl &amp; Muchinsky, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0011000011398726">Slaney, 1988</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0011000011398726">Salomone (1982)</xref> claimed that temporary indecision is often caused by lack of knowledge about the choice process, and it may be enough for counselors to provide counselees with tools for collecting information about themselves and their career options and then direct them to an efficient decision-making protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0011000011398726">Leong &amp; Chervinko, 1996</xref>). Career indecisiveness, in contrast, involves more pervasive, severe, and chronic difficulties in making career decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0011000011398726">Meldahl &amp; Muchinsky, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0011000011398726">Osipow, 1999</xref>). Stemming from deeper roots, indecisiveness is also frequently reflected in other types of decision making and characterizes a smaller group of individuals than does indecision.</p>
<p>Researchers have developed a specific interest in the distinction between temporary, developmental indecision and more chronic, pervasive indecisiveness, stemming mainly from personality and emotional factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0011000011398726">Callahan &amp; Greenhaus, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0011000011398726">Cohen, Chartrand, &amp; Jowdy, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0011000011398726">Germeijs, &amp; De Boeck, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0011000011398726">Germeijs, Verschueren, &amp; Soenens, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0011000011398726">Kelly &amp; Pulver, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0011000011398726">Santos, 2001</xref>). However, the underlying assumption of these studies is that when certain traits are found to be empirically associated with career decision-making difficulties, they can be used to help understand the complex structure of indecision and the factors causing and maintaining it. Only a few studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0011000011398726">Santos, 2001</xref>) have considered these factors in a multivariate context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0011000011398726">Santos, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0011000011398726">Wulff &amp; Steitz, 1999</xref>), and a need for a general conceptual framework for emotional and personality-related career decision-making difficulties had emerged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0011000011398726">Saka, Gati, &amp; Kelly, 2008</xref>).</p>

<title>Emotional and Personality-Related Career Decision-Making Difficulties</title>
<p>Career decision-making difficulties that stem from emotional and personality-related sources are among the more significant difficulties faced by college students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0011000011398726">Amir &amp; Gati, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0011000011398726">Amir, Gati, &amp; Kleiman, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0011000011398726">Gati &amp; Amir, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0011000011398726">Gati et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0011000011398726">Saka et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0011000011398726">Santos, 2001</xref>). Career counselors consider these difficulties to be more severe than information-related difficulties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0011000011398726">Gati, Amir, &amp; Landman, 2010</xref>) because they may prevent the individual from making a conclusive decision or require long-term intervention that may exceed the scope of career counseling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0011000011398726">Gati et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Recently, Saka and her colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0011000011398726">Saka &amp; Gati, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0011000011398726">Saka et al., 2008</xref>) proposed a comprehensive theoretical framework that incorporates the main emotional and personality-related difficulties that are thought to underlie career indecisiveness. The proposed model was developed through an interaction between theoretical considerations. Specifically, based on previous literature, variables that were consistently found to be correlated with career indecision and indecisiveness were located, and these variables were analyzed in terms of their source, common characteristics, and possible effects on the decision-making process. This led to the formation of hypotheses regarding the implications of each variable for the career decision-making process and its relationships with other components and variables.</p>
<p>The proposed taxonomy is hierarchical, with three major clusters of difficulties—Pessimistic Views, Anxiety, and Self-Concept and Identity—that are further subdivided into 11 specific categories based on finer distinctions. The first cluster, Pessimistic Views, focuses on the cognitive aspect of indecisiveness, including negative cognitive biases and perceptions; it consists of three specific categories: (1) pessimistic views about the world of work—overly negative perceptions of occupations or the training needed for them (e.g., “It is impossible to find a job in an appealing occupation”), (2) pessimistic views about the process—low career decision-making self-efficacy, and (3) pessimistic views about one’s control over the decision-making process and its outcomes—attributing the process, the choice, and the outcomes to an external locus of control.</p>
<p>The second cluster, Anxiety, focuses on aspects of the anxiety associated with career decision-making and includes four categories: (1) anxiety about the process—feelings of stress and anxiety arising prior to decision making; (2) anxiety about the uncertainty involved in choosing—including uncertainty about the future, anxiety about being in an undecided state, and anxiety due to low tolerance for ambiguity; (3) anxiety about commitment to one’s choice—including perfectionism about choosing, fear of losing other potentially suitable options, fear of choosing an unsuitable occupation, and anxiety about one’s responsibility for the act of choosing; and (4) anxiety about the outcome—in cases where the individual is worried about being unable to actualize the chosen alternative.</p>
<p>The third cluster, Self-Concept and Identity, involves the individual’s developmental and personality-related aspects; it includes four types of difficulties: (1) trait anxiety—an ongoing personality characteristic that exists across a number of situations, (2) low self-esteem—including both general self-esteem and self-esteem specific to the vocational field, (3) uncrystallized identity—difficulties in forming a stable sense of personal identity, and (4) conflictual attachment and separation—difficulties with significant others.</p>

<title>Previous Research on the Emotional and Personality-Related Career Decision-Making Difficulties Questionnaire</title>
<p>To empirically test the proposed model, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0011000011398726">Saka et al. (2008)</xref> developed the Emotional and Personality-related Career decision-making Difficulties questionnaire (EPCD, see Instruments section). The reliability of the original, 53-item version of the questionnaire was high (<italic>r</italic> = .94; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0011000011398726">Saka et al., 2008</xref>). Later, a shorter, 25-item version was developed and highly supported as well: the correlation of the total EPCD score based on the 53-item version with the score for the 25-item version was .98 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0011000011398726">Malka-Gidron, 2006</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0011000011398726">Saka et al. (2008)</xref> also tested and supported the cross-cultural as well as the structural validity of the EPCD model and questionnaire using exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses. The convergent and divergent validity of the model and questionnaire was tested and supported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0011000011398726">Saka and Gati (2007)</xref> and by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0011000011398726">Gati et al. (2011)</xref>. Specifically, these analyses supported the hypotheses that the 11 difficulty categories comprise three theoretical clusters and that the combination of all 11 best represents the participants’ overall emotional and personality-related difficulties.</p>
<p>The temporal stability of the EPCD was tested and supported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0011000011398726">Saka (2004)</xref> in a 6-month follow-up study (<italic>r</italic> = .64). In addition, higher levels of emotional and personality-related career decision-making difficulties at the time of the first administration predicted less progress in the decision-making process 6 months later. However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0011000011398726">Saka and Gati (2007)</xref> tested only the stability of the total EPCD score and did not evaluate each cluster separately, thus ignoring possible between-cluster variance in stability. The three clusters may have different levels of stability; whereas one cluster may be rather stable over time, another may be more prone to change. In addition, stability across 6 months does not necessarily imply long-term stability (i.e., over several years) especially because the participants were still at the same life stage—students in a special precollege preparatory program—at the end of these 6 months. A longer follow-up is necessary for evaluating the long-term consequences of career indecisiveness. This study not only involves a follow-up after a substantially longer period of time (3 years) but also assesses the long-term ramifications of indecisiveness, as measured by the EPCD, on career choice satisfaction.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0011000011398726">
<title>Satisfaction With One’s Current Career Choice</title>
<p>Career-choice satisfaction is one of the most important factors associated with individuals’ well-being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0011000011398726">Spector, 1997</xref>). Previous studies have found that satisfaction with one’s choice of major or job is associated with higher grades and better work performance, whereas low satisfaction is associated with changing majors and not persisting with a single career (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0011000011398726">Graunke &amp; Woosley, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0011000011398726">Iaffaldano &amp; Muchinsky, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0011000011398726">Nauta, 2007</xref>). We use <italic>career-choice satisfaction</italic> rather than <italic>job satisfaction</italic> because job satisfaction is affected by many factors involving the particular job and employer, whereas career-choice satisfaction refers only to the satisfaction of the individual with the choice they made. Furthermore, job satisfaction would be irrelevant to many participants who have not yet entered the job market (e.g., students). We hypothesized that emotional and personality-related career difficulties would be negatively correlated with career-choice satisfaction.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0011000011398726">
<title>Gender Differences in Career Indecisiveness</title>
<p>Previous research has yielded inconsistent findings regarding gender differences. Whereas many studies found that women have more general indecisiveness than men do (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0011000011398726">Hijazi, Tatar, &amp; Gati, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0011000011398726">Rassin &amp; Muris, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0011000011398726">Serling &amp; Betz, 1990</xref>), the one study that tested the EPCD specifically found no gender differences in the level of career indecisiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0011000011398726">Saka et al., 2008</xref>). In light of these inconsistent findings, we tested for gender differences as well.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0011000011398726">
<title>This Study</title>
<p>This study had three goals. The first goal was to explore the chronic nature of career indecisiveness by testing the temporal stability of the EPCD with a 3-year longitudinal design. If indecisiveness is indeed chronic and personality related, then it should be fairly stable over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0011000011398726">Vaidya, Gray, Haig, &amp; Watson, 2002</xref>). Specifically, our first hypothesis was that there would be a high positive correlation between the overall EPCD scores in the first and second administrations (36 to 41 months apart), indicating that career indecisiveness, as measured by the EPCD, is a temporally stable construct.</p>
<p>In addition, we investigated the concurrent validity of the EPCD by testing the association between EPCD scores and making a career decision. Specifically, we retrospectively tested the differences between individuals who made a career decision (by Time 2) and those who did not in terms of their emotional and personality-related career decision-making difficulties at Time 1. To do so, we tested the hypotheses that decided individuals would have lower EPCD scores at Time 1 and that these scores would decrease over time. Furthermore, we hypothesized that undecided individuals would have had higher EPCD scores at Time 1 and that these scores would remain stable. Finally, we investigated the differences among the three major clusters of the EPCD—specifically, possible interactions between the three EPCD clusters and temporal stability as well as gender differences. Because many previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0011000011398726">Hijazi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0011000011398726">Rassin &amp; Muris, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0011000011398726">Serling &amp; Betz, 1990</xref>) found gender differences in career and general indecisiveness and only one study that tested the EPCD in particular did not find them, we hypothesized that women would have higher EPCD scores than men would.</p>
<p>The second goal involved the predictive validity of the EPCD. In addition to the hypothesis that career indecisiveness is a stable personality trait that reduces one’s ability to make a career decision, we further hypothesized that one’s indecisiveness score can predict whether one will make a career decision in the next 3 years (e.g., deciding on a major, choosing an occupation).</p>
<p>The study’s third goal was investigating the association between the EPCD and career satisfaction. We hypothesized that a negative correlation would be found between the EPCD scores (at both Time 1 and Time 2) and satisfaction with one’s chosen occupation or field of study as well as the decision-making process that led to it. This hypothesis could obviously be tested only among those participants who reported that they had made a career decision.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>The 543 participants in this study were a subgroup of participants from two former studies who agreed to take part in a future study. The first study investigated the association between career indecisiveness, as measured by the EPCD, and changing one’s major during undergraduate studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0011000011398726">Malka-Gidron, 2006</xref>); the EPCD data in this study were collected from 1,073 undergraduate students from December 2004 to January 2005. Most of them were students in the social sciences and the humanities at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem; 91% of the students were freshmen or sophomores. Two thirds (65%) were women, and the mean age was 23.33 (<italic>SD</italic> = 3.25). The research questionnaires (“aimed at studying decisions involved in the choice of a major”) were administered during or just at the end of various classes. The participants did not receive any reward for participation.</p>
<p>The second study investigated the associations between the EPCD and other personality traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0011000011398726">Gati et al., 2011</xref>); the EPCD data from 911 participants were collected from March to June 2006. This sample was heterogeneous: 66% of participants were individuals visiting the Future Directions website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.kivunim.com">www.kivunim.com</ext-link>; retrieved November 28, 2010), a free, anonymous, career-planning website developed at the Hebrew University as a public service to facilitate individuals’ career decisions (66% women; mean age = 23.25, <italic>SD</italic> = 5.34; mean years of education = 12.65, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.91); another 18% were students in the preacademic (preparatory) program at the Hebrew University (43% women; mean age = 22.51, <italic>SD</italic> = 2.18; mean years of education = 12.10, <italic>SD</italic> = 0.36); finally, 16% were train passengers who filled out the questionnaire during a 1-hr ride between two cities (51% women; mean age = 21.99, <italic>SD</italic> = 3.52; mean years of education = 12.8, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.74). In exchange for their participation in the research, the participants received personal feedback based on their responses as well as a user code for an Internet-based career guidance system (worth $20) for themselves or an acquaintance of their choice (the preparatory program students did not receive the user code because they already had free access to this system).</p>
<p>Of the 1,984 participants, 1,727 (87%) agreed to participate in future research and reported their e-mail addresses. We located valid contact information for 1,144 individuals (58% of the original samples) and contacted them; in the other cases, the e-mail addresses were no longer active or the handwriting was illegible. Of the 1,144 individuals we contacted, 577 (50.4%) clicked on the hyperlink and filled out the follow-up questionnaires. Data from 34 participants (5.7%) were not included in the analyses because of the questionable credibility of their responses (based on their responses to the validity items in the EPCD). Thus the final sample included 543 participants, 345 (64%) women and 198 men. The participants’ mean age at follow up was 25.84 (<italic>SD</italic> = 3.30).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0011000011398726">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>The participants were contacted via e-mail from March to May 2008 (36 to 41 months after their participation in the original studies) and were invited to participate in a study of career decision making; the importance of the study was explained, and the incentive offered was participation in a raffle with three monetary prizes worth about $40 each. Participants who did not respond to the first request received an e-mail reminder 14 days later.</p>
<p>Individuals who clicked on the hyperlink in the e-mail were directed to the research homepage embedded in Future Directions, which is an Israeli website developed at the Hebrew University as a free, anonymous public service website aimed at helping deliberating individuals make better career decisions. First, participants were asked to choose the one statement of the following four that best matched their current situation: (a) “I am studying / working in the career I chose,” (b) “I have already decided what I want to study / what career I would like to pursue,” (c) “I have not yet decided what I want to study / which career to pursue,” or (d) “I have already chosen a career path but I am considering changing it.” Participants who marked the first or second options were regarded as decided, and those who marked the third or fourth options were regarded as undecided. Two thirds of the participants (69%) were included in the decided group (<italic>n</italic> = 374), whereas the remaining one third were in the undecided group (<italic>n</italic> = 169). Based on this division, the participants were directed to the relevant online versions of the EPCD and the career satisfaction questions.</p>

<title>EPCD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0011000011398726">Saka et al., 2008</xref>)</title>
<p>The EPCD is a self-report questionnaire aimed at assessing the emotional and personality-related career decision-making difficulties model described in the introduction. The short version of the EPCD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0011000011398726">Gati et al., 2011</xref>) includes 25 statements: 2 in each of the 11 specific categories, 1 warm-up item, and 2 validity items. For each statement, participants were asked to rate, on a 9-point Likert-type scale, the extent to which each statement described them (1 = <italic>does not describe me at all</italic>; 9 = <italic>describes me well</italic>). For example, the first item in the pessimistic views about the world of work category is “Almost every job is boring.” The first item in the anxiety about the process category is “I am stressed because I need to deal with the complex process of choosing a career.” The first item in the trait anxiety category (in the Self-Concept and Identity cluster) is “Often I am worried about many things in life.” One of the validity items is “I am pleased when something good happens to me.”</p>
<p>The internal-consistency reliability of the questionnaire in the first administration of the current study was .91. The reliabilities of the three clusters were .71, .92, and .83 (for Pessimistic Views, Anxiety, and Self-Concept and Identity, respectively). The relatively low reliability of the Pessimistic Views cluster is in line with previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0011000011398726">Gati et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0011000011398726">Saka &amp; Gati, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0011000011398726">Saka et al., 2008</xref>). The questionnaire’s structural, convergent, and divergent validity have been tested and supported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0011000011398726">Gati et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0011000011398726">Saka &amp; Gati, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0011000011398726">Saka et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The EPCD questionnaire was initially designed to assess the emotional and personality-related sources of career decision-making difficulties for individuals who have not yet made a career decision. Because the participants in this study were approached again 36 to 41 months after the initial contact, many of them had already made a career decision by the time of the follow up. Therefore, we prepared an adapted version of the questionnaire for the decided participants, with slight changes in 12 out of the 22 statements, using the past tense instead of the present or future tenses (e.g., we changed “I am afraid I might make a mistake in my career decision, and not choose the right career” for undecided into “I was afraid I might make a mistake in my career decision, and not choose the right career” for decided). The adapted version of the EPCD was administered to the decided group. The internal-consistency reliability of the original (undecided) and adapted (decided) versions (in the second administration of the EPCD) were similar: .92 (<italic>n</italic> = 169) and .91 (<italic>n</italic> = 374), respectively. The reliabilities of the three clusters were .66, .89, and .84, for the undecided group and .64, .93, and .83 for the decided group (for Pessimistic Views, Anxiety, and Self-Concept and Identity, respectively). The slight modification in the phrasing of half of the items of the EPCD version for the decided group had only negligible effect, as reported in the Results section.</p>

<title>Career choice satisfaction</title>
<p>The participants in the decided group were asked two questions that focused on satisfaction with one’s current occupation or major (“I am satisfied with my current major or field of studies” and “When I made my career decision I was satisfied with it”). These questions were presented with a 9-point rating scale (9 = <italic>highly agree</italic>). These brief questions were used in an attempt to not burden the participants for a relatively marginal part of the research. In fact, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0011000011398726">Gati, Garty, and Fassa (1996)</xref> measured the degree of satisfaction of professionals from various vocational fields with their occupations using a single question with a 9-point scale. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0011000011398726">Meir and Glass (1995)</xref> found that the responses to this single question correlated highly (.84) with the sum of a 10-item satisfaction questionnaire used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0011000011398726">Meir and Yaari (1988)</xref>.</p>

<title>The Temporal Stability of the EPCD</title>
<p>The stability of the scores in the two administrations of the EPCD was tested using both Pearson correlations and comparison of mean scores.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0011000011398726">1</xref></sup> The correlation of the total EPCD score for the two administrations (across gender, decision status, and cluster) was moderate (<italic>r</italic> = .44). To test the stability of each of the clusters, taking gender and decision status into account, we conducted a four-way mixed-model Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) with gender and decision status (decided or undecided) as the between-subjects factors and cluster (Pessimistic Views, Anxiety, and Self-Concept and Identity) and time of administration (1 or 2) as the within-subject factors (2 × 2 × 3 × 2). The results of the MANOVA revealed two significant main effects and four significant two-way interactions. The three- and four-way interactions were not statistically significant. The significant main effect for cluster, <italic>F</italic>(2, 538) = 128.54, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, η<sup>2</sup> = .32, shows that Anxiety scores were the highest of the three clusters (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0011000011398726">Table 1</xref>). To test for the source of the Cluster × Time interaction, <italic>F</italic>(2, 538) = 3.25, <italic>p</italic> = .04, η<sup>2</sup> = .01, we conducted three paired-sample <italic>t</italic> tests (one for each cluster, with Time as the independent variable and the EPCD score as the dependent variable), revealing that Anxiety was stable, with no significant difference between administrations, <italic>t</italic>(542) = 1.46, <italic>ns, d</italic> = 0.13. However, the Pessimistic views cluster showed a significant decrease during the 3-year interval, with medium effect size, <italic>t</italic>(542) = 4.84, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, <italic>d</italic> = 0.42. The Self-Concept and Identity cluster also showed a statistically significant decrease between the two administrations, <italic>t</italic>(542) = 2.58, <italic>p</italic> = .01, <italic>d</italic> = 0.22; however, the effect size was small (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0011000011398726">Cohen, 1992</xref>). These findings were reaffirmed by the Pearson correlations between the two administrations (presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0011000011398726">Table 1</xref>), which were .43 and .40 for Anxiety and Self-Concept and Identity, respectively, but only .23 for Pessimistic Views.</p>
<p>The significant main effect for time, <italic>F</italic>(1, 539) = 5.02, <italic>p</italic> = .03, η<sup>2</sup> = .009, shows that the Time 1 scores were higher than were those at Time 2 (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0011000011398726">Table 1</xref>). However, this effect is qualified by a significant Time × Decision Status interaction, <italic>F</italic>(1, 539) = 6.65, <italic>p</italic> = .01, η<sup>2</sup> = .012, showing that the EPCD scores of the decided group significantly decreased, whereas those of the undecided group were stable, remaining high.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0011000011398726">2</xref></sup> The main effect for decision status, <italic>F</italic>(1, 539) = 48.76, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, η<sup>2</sup> = .08, shows that, as hypothesized, the EPCD scores of the undecided group were higher than were those of the decided group, supporting the concurrent validity of the EPCD.</p>
<p>To test for the source of the Cluster × Gender interaction, <italic>F</italic>(2, 538) = 5.89, <italic>p</italic> = .003, η<sup>2</sup> = .02, we conducted three independent-sample <italic>t</italic> tests with gender as the between-subjects factor and the mean scores for the three EPCD clusters as the dependent variables. These comparisons revealed that women had higher scores than did men for Anxiety, <italic>t</italic>(541) = 4.46, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, <italic>d</italic> = 0.38, and Self-Concept and Identity, <italic>t</italic>(541) = 2.86, <italic>p</italic> = .004, <italic>d</italic> = 0.25), but no gender differences were found in the cluster of Pessimistic Views, <italic>t</italic>(541) = 0.26, <italic>ns</italic>). The Gender × Decision Status interaction, <italic>F</italic>(1, 539) = 5.18, <italic>p</italic> = .02, η<sup>2</sup> = .01) shows that women had higher scores than did men in the decided group, but no such gender differences emerged in the undecided group.</p>

<sec id="section14-0011000011398726">
<title>The Predictive Validity of the EPCD</title>
<p>To test the predictive validity of the EPCD, we conducted a discriminant analysis with the three EPCD cluster scores (Pessimistic Views, Anxiety, and Self-Concept and Identity) at Time 1 as predictors of belonging to the decided versus undecided group. For men, this analysis resulted in one significant discriminant function, Wilks’s Λ = .93, χ<sup>2</sup> (3, <italic>N</italic> = 198) = 13.93, <italic>p</italic> = .003, correctly classifying 62.1% of the cases (κ = .21, <italic>p</italic> =.001). Based on the standardized canonical discriminant function coefficients, the most contributing predictor to the function was Anxiety (.48), followed by Self-Concept and Identity (.39), and Pessimistic Views (.35). For women, the discriminant function was in the same direction, Wilks’s Λ = .98, χ<sup>2</sup> (3, <italic>N</italic> = 345) = 6.92, but it did not reach statistical significance (<italic>p</italic> = .07).</p>
<p>We investigated the possible sources of the gender difference in the EPCD’s predictive ability. The cluster that emerged as responsible for this difference was Anxiety, which was the strongest predictor of decision status for men (standardized canonical discriminant function coefficient = .48; structure matrix = .89), but the weakest one for women (standardized canonical discriminant function coefficient = –.47; structure matrix = .24). Inspecting the mean Anxiety scores at Time 1 suggests a possible explanation for this finding. For men, the Anxiety scores at Time 1 were different in the decided (4.48) and undecided groups (5.63), <italic>t</italic>(196) = 3.40, <italic>p</italic> = .001. For women, however, no such difference emerged, <italic>t</italic>(343) = 0.65, <italic>p</italic> = .52; this lack of difference between the decided and undecided groups explains the low predictive power of the Anxiety cluster for women.</p>

<title>The EPCD and Career Choice Satisfaction</title>
<p>To test the hypothesis that higher levels of EPCD are associated with lower levels of satisfaction with one’s choice, we computed the Pearson correlations between the EPCD scores (at Time 1 and Time 2) and satisfaction with one’s current career (the mean of the two career choice satisfaction questions) reported at Time 2, only among the decided group (<italic>n</italic> = 373). The correlation between satisfaction with one’s career choice (reported at Time 2) and the EPCD scores at Time 1 was quite low (<italic>r</italic> = −.19, <italic>p</italic> = .024 and <italic>r</italic> = −.14, <italic>p</italic> = .034, for men and women, respectively), showing that the EPCD score at Time 1 could not predict career choice satisfaction 3 years later. However, fairly high negative correlations were found between satisfaction with one’s current occupational choice and the EPCD score at Time 2 (<italic>r</italic> = −.52, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001 and <italic>r</italic> = −.48, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, for men and women, respectively), showing that career choice satisfaction is higher among participants with lower levels of emotional and personality-related career decision-making difficulties (see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0011000011398726">Appendix</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This research focused on broadening our understanding of career indecisiveness, as defined and measured by the EPCD model and questionnaire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0011000011398726">Saka &amp; Gati, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0011000011398726">Saka et al., 2008</xref>). This study had three main goals. First, we wanted to test the temporal stability and concurrent validity of the EPCD and thus investigate the chronic aspects of career indecisiveness. Second, we wanted to test the predictive validity of the EPCD, specifically its ability to predict whether people would make a career decision. Finally, we wanted to test the association between the EPCD and career satisfaction.</p>
<sec id="section17-0011000011398726">
<title>The Temporal Stability of Indecisiveness</title>
<p>The results of the MANOVA, combined with those of the Pearson correlations, indicate that the three clusters of the EPCD have different levels of stability over time. Anxiety was found to be the most stable cluster of the three, whereas Pessimistic Views was the least stable and showed a significant decrease over a 3-year interval. The results for the stability of the Self-Concept and Identity cluster were mixed, which may be because the various components of this cluster behave in different ways, whereas the first two components, trait anxiety and low self-esteem, are unlikely to change over a 3-year interval, and the other two components, uncrystallized identity and conflictual attachment and separation (which refers to difficulties with significant others), are more likely to change over such a period of time.</p>
<p>These findings refine those of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0011000011398726">Saka and Gati (2007)</xref>, who found that the total EPCD was stable over a 6-month interval, though they did not test each cluster’s stability separately. Our finding that the different components of indecisiveness vary in their stability reflects its complex nature. Specifically, it seems that there is an essential difference between the cluster of Pessimistic Views and the other two EPCD clusters, Anxiety and Self-Concept and Identity. A possible explanation for this difference is that whereas Anxiety and Self-Concept and Identity are more emotionally related, Pessimistic Views is more cognitively related. This explanation is in line with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0011000011398726">Gati et al. (2011)</xref>, who found that there is a significant difference between the cluster of Anxiety and the cluster of Pessimistic Views in their pattern of correlations with the Big Five personality model (as measured by the NEO-Personality Inventory questionnaire; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0011000011398726">Costa &amp; McCrae, 1992</xref>).</p>
<p>The finding that decided individuals have lower EPCD scores than do undecided individuals (at both Time 1 and Time 2) supports the concurrent validity of the EPCD questionnaire, as the indecisiveness measured by the EPCD was in line with the actual indecisiveness reflected in being decided or undecided. Among the decided group, the overall EPCD scores decreased significantly over the three years between the first and the second administrations, which reflects the more persistent nature of indecisiveness among these individuals.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-0011000011398726">
<title>Gender Differences</title>
<p>Previous studies have shown that women have a higher level of career indecisiveness than do men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0011000011398726">Hijazi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0011000011398726">Rassin &amp; Muris, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0011000011398726">Serling &amp; Betz, 1990</xref>). Unlike previous research using the EPCD, which found no gender differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0011000011398726">Saka &amp; Gati, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0011000011398726">Saka et al., 2008</xref>), this study did find that, among the decided group, women had higher levels of emotional and personality-related career decision-making difficulties than did men. Specifically, gender differences were found in the clusters of Anxiety and Self-Concept and Identity, but no gender differences emerged in Pessimistic Views.</p>
<p>The explanation suggested here, that the Pessimistic Views cluster is more cognitive, whereas the Anxiety and Self-Concept and Identity clusters are more emotional, implies that the differences between the career decision-making difficulties of men and women are more in the emotional than the cognitive realm.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-0011000011398726">
<title>The Predictive Validity of EPCD</title>
<p>Using a 3-year longitudinal design, this study tested the predictive validity of the EPCD. Specifically, we tested the EPCD’s ability to predict whether an individual would make a career decision within three years. As hypothesized, the EPCD was able to make this prediction better than chance, although it was statistically significant only for men. This finding, though modest in terms of effect size, supports the predictive validity of the EPCD and is compatible with the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0011000011398726">Creed, Patton, and Prideaux (2007)</xref>, whose two-year follow-up of high school students shows that career indecision is an important factor in predicting future (and current) career planning and exploration (which are assumed to be associated with progress in the career decision-making process).</p>
<p>The finding that Anxiety levels at Time 1 were different in the decided and undecided groups only for men explains why this cluster contributed to the decision status prediction for men but not for women. As consistently found in previous research, anxiety often leads to avoidance (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0011000011398726">Mueller, Nguyen, Ray, &amp; Borkovac, 2010</xref>). We suggest that for men high levels of Anxiety lead to avoiding making a career decision. For women, however, Anxiety levels, although generally high, apparently did not lead to such avoidance and, therefore, could not serve as a good predictor for this issue. This finding is surprising and requires future replication.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-0011000011398726">
<title>EPCD and Career Choice Satisfaction</title>
<p>The third goal of this study was to test the association between career indecisiveness as measured by the EPCD on one hand and satisfaction with one’s current occupation or field of study and the decision-making process that led to one’s career choice on the other. As hypothesized, the correlations between indecisiveness and satisfaction with one’s occupational choice were negative (at both Time 1 and Time 2) and quite high (at Time 2, <italic>r</italic>s = −.52 and –.48 for men and women, respectively), showing that indecisiveness and career choice satisfaction are negatively associated, though the former cannot predict the latter over a three-year interval. This finding is compatible with that of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0011000011398726">Nauta (2007)</xref>, suggesting that individuals high in general indecisiveness may experience greater dissatisfaction with their choice because they are uncomfortable with a commitment to any choice.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section21-0011000011398726">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>Before discussing the implications of this research, we must acknowledge its limitations. First, only half of the 1,144 participants who were asked to participate actually filled out the follow-up questionnaires. This fact is partially explained by technical reasons, as much of the contact information (i.e., e-mail) was invalid at the time of the follow-up. However, more meaningful characteristics can explain people’s participating or not participating in the follow-up, such as conscientiousness, a sense of responsibility, or even being decided rather than undecided. Moreover, participants may also have been encouraged to participate by the financial gain from the monetary prizes offered, and hence individuals in greater need of cash might have been more likely to participate. Nonetheless, similar attrition rates have been found in other follow-up studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0011000011398726">Guay, Ratelle, Senécal, Larose, &amp; Deschênes, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Another limitation involves the measurement of the career-satisfaction variables, which were measured by only two items because of practical considerations. A small number of items adversely affects the reliability and hence the validity of any instrument. In addition, we only addressed the direct satisfaction of the participants and failed to inspect other aspects of satisfaction (e.g., “Would you recommend your choice to friends or acquaintances?” “If you had to make this decision again, would you make the same choice?”). Although, as explained in the Method section, this has been done and supported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0011000011398726">Gati et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0011000011398726">Meir &amp; Glass, 1995</xref>), future research should use more comprehensive assessment measures of career satisfaction (i.e., include more items).</p>

<title>Research implications</title>
<p>This study investigated various aspects of the validity of the EPCD model and questionnaire for measuring career indecisiveness. These findings for gender differences, differences in temporal stability, and the predictive validity of the EPCD suggest that there is a major difference between the cluster of Pessimistic Views and the other two clusters, Anxiety and Self-Doncept and Identity. One of the most plausible explanations for this finding is the weaker cohesion of the Pessimistic Views cluster, which is reflected in its lower internal-consistency reliability in comparison to that of the other two clusters.</p>
<p>One possible explanation for the differences found in this research between Pessimistic Views and the other two clusters of the EPCD may be the function of Pessimistic Views in career decision making. The theoretical model tested in this research assumes that career indecisiveness is mainly emotional and personality related. However, Pessimistic Views may have a more prominent cognitive component.</p>
<p>Future research should investigate the apparently spontaneous decrease in Pessimistic Views over several years and the factors that contribute to this reduction. Finally, it seems important to investigate the challenge faced by interventions aimed at addressing the difficulties involving Anxiety and Self-Concept and Identity discussed in this research in light of their fairly persistent nature.</p>

<title>Counseling implications</title>
<p>In addition to the psychological distress caused by career indecision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0011000011398726">Sabourin &amp; Coallier, 1991</xref>), this research describes the complex characteristics and long-term ramifications of indecisiveness. Based on this research, counselors can regard their clients’ difficulties involving Pessimistic Views as likely to change and, therefore, worth addressing even in short-term interventions. Cognitive restructuring is one short-term intervention that was found effective for handling irrational beliefs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0011000011398726">Kovalski &amp; Horan, 1999</xref>), which are very similar to pessimistic views. On the other hand, if difficulties involving Anxiety and Self-Concept and Identity are not addressed, they are more likely to remain stable for years. Whereas anxiety may also be dealt with using cognitive-behavioral programs, it seems that difficulties involving Self-Concept and Identity should be addressed by a professional career counselor. The challenge is how such persistent difficulties can be addressed during the typically limited number of counseling sessions available. Moreover, difficulties involving career indecisiveness highlight the mutual interplay between career and personal issues in counseling (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0011000011398726">Betz &amp; Corning, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0011000011398726">Niles, Anderson, &amp; Cover, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0011000011398726">Pace, &amp; Quinn, 2000</xref>). Career counselors working with clients who have emotional and personality-related career decision-making difficulties should also consider one of the long-term ramifications of career indecisiveness, as it emerged in this study: low satisfaction with one’s career choice.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The core feature distinguishing career indecision from career indecisiveness is the chronic, long-term stability of the latter (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0011000011398726">Germeijs et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0011000011398726">Guay et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0011000011398726">Saka et al., 2008</xref>). This research provides support for the temporal stability and predictive validity of the EPCD in measuring chronic indecisiveness, and it sheds light on some of the long-term ramifications of chronic indecisiveness. However, the results of this research point out significant differences between the three clusters of the EPCD: Whereas the clusters of Anxiety and Self-Concept and Identity tap into chronic indecisiveness, the relative weight of indecision and indecisiveness in the Pessimistic Views cluster remains to be clarified in future research. Future research should also continue to explore the associations between emotional and personality-related career decision-making difficulties, their specific behavioral consequences for the client, and their impact on the intensity and scope of the counseling treatment required.</p>

<p>These two indicators are complementary: Whereas the MANOVA and the consecutive <italic>t</italic> tests are sensitive to between-group changes, the Pearson correlation is sensitive to within-group changes (rank order of the participants within each administration). The MANOVA in itself is not sufficient because changes in individuals’ scores may cancel each other out, and thus no statistical difference between the means will be observable in such a case. Pearson correlation, on the other hand, would not be useful if the change between administrations is predictable (e.g., a similar increase for all participants) because the rank order of participants remains the same in such a case.</p>

<p>The gap between the decided and undecided groups was significant both at Time 1 and Time 2, <italic>t</italic>(541) = 3.85, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, <italic>d</italic> = 0.33 and <italic>t</italic>(541) = 7.48, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, <italic>d</italic> = 0.64, respectively. One could argue that the gap at Time 2 can be attributed to the modification in the phrasing in the EPCD version for the decided group. However, we repeated this analysis using only the 10 items of the EPCD that were not modified, and the difference between the decided and undecided groups remained very high, <italic>t</italic>(541) = 6.09, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, <italic>d</italic> = 0.52.</p>
