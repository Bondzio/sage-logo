<abstract>
<p>The ways that financialization has contributed to the technocratic and antipolitical management of economies have become ever more evident in the wake of the financial crisis that commenced in the autumn of 2007. This bracketing and suspension of politics occurs in various ways but significantly, it does so through the obscuring of work as a moment of economic life. If economics has been complicit in this antipolitics, can an aesthetic approach to financialization shed light on how work is rendered invisible? This article analyzes four short film clips all distributed through YouTube to show not only how their visual and narrative elements organize subjectivities for an antipolitics of finance but also to find in the popular aesthetic a different “distribution of the sensible” that permits moments of suspension or rupture that can politicize financialized subjectivity and begin to recover a politics of work.</p>

<p>In what sense is the “financial crisis” a crisis? At the beginning of <italic>Legitimation Crisis</italic>, Jürgen Habermas contrasts the medical use of the term with an aesthetic notion of crisis derived from theories of drama.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0304375412465039">1</xref>
</sup> The medical use refers to the moment in which the functioning of the organism is no longer automatic: failing organs may or may not recover, for example. Medical intervention is necessary at this point and the subjectivity of the patient is suspended: the functioning of the organism is reduced to an objective condition. Much of the debate on the financial crisis refers, implicitly or explicitly and in both technical and critical formulations, to this medical sense of “crisis.” The crisis in the financial system appears as an objective condition requiring either the correct application of technically defined policies or it appears as the objective symptom of the system’s imminent collapse.</p>
<p>The second sense Habermas invokes, however, refers to the crisis point in a drama. In a dramatic situation, a crisis occurs when subjectivities confront each other and can only move forward by modifying their own subjective conditions—otherwise the subject either remains mired in its own contradictions or it ceases to be. Gamble notes the distinction between the medical and the dramatic sense of crisis, though he does not go on to investigate the crisis’s aesthetic dimensions.<sup>

</sup> Clark, Thrift, and Tickell<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0304375412465039">3</xref>
</sup> analyze the development of the performativity of finance in the context of the deepening of the role of the news media in financial reporting, especially as this began to articulate a quasi-regulative role in the performance of finance, but their research was conducted before the generalized crisis of the financial system from 2007 to the present. This dramatic, subjective notion of crisis appears much more rarely in the literature on the financial crisis.</p>
<p>The preference for the medical, organic, or objective understanding of crisis in reflections on financialization is not hard to understand. Explanations objectify the crisis in order to imagine useful pathways for problem-solving interventions. However, once finance is understood to be a technical problem subject to technocratic solutions (however, these may be disputed and debated), the politics of financialization are suspended—that is, financialization is no longer a matter for contention or dissent. Indeed, one of the key features or processes of financialization, as we will see, is precisely that it depoliticizes economic and social relations generally. The depth and the breadth of the permeation of social relations by financialization make politicizing finance difficult to imagine.</p>
<p>But the subjectivity of the patient in a medical crisis does not disappear: it is merely suspended as the subject’s objective conditions are addressed through technical means. The <italic>politics</italic> of a crisis are more clearly seen when the subject itself must be changed—this is the issue that much of the reflection on the financial crisis so assiduously avoids. Can an aesthetic approach to the financial crisis shed light on these dramas? Is there an aesthetic of financialization that can signal the repoliticization of the issues surrounding finance?</p>
<p>This article examines the aesthetics of four short animated film clips distributed via YouTube that set out to analyze and explain the financial crisis running from 2007 to the present. The arguments put forward in these clips are informed by different understandings of the political economy of finance, but the present analysis will focus instead on how the visual fields deployed in the clips produce a particular <italic>partage du sensible</italic>, or more specifically for the present analysis a regime of the visible and invisible, in which the crisis and any possible imagined recovery can be staged. The aesthetic analysis will show how bringing work into focus blocks the suspension of the subjectivities in crisis and permits the dramatic confrontations that a political analysis requires.</p>
<sec id="section1-0304375412465039">
<title>Financialization, Depoliticization, and the Disappearance of Work</title>
<p>In both critical and technical economic literature, finance is understood as a process and not as a thing. It is not identical with money; it is, rather, the process of credit creation and provision that facilitates capital accumulation when money as a commodity is scarce. Financialization could be said to be the effects of finance on social relations.</p>
<p>One of the crucial effects of financialization, particularly in the current context, is that it depoliticizes the social relations of the economy: finance, in other words, can be understood in terms of how it forecloses the contestation or transformation of the social order necessary to sustain financially driven capital accumulation in order to safeguard the reproduction of the social relations that sustain financialization. The depoliticization of economic relations is an extension of the practical and cognitive processes behind finance.</p>
<p>Regarding practice, financialization is an element of the tactics that were deployed to break the political and economic impasse of the “stagflation crisis” of the 1970s. It is part of the policy of reducing the power of organized labor as a political actor: David Harvey, among others, argues that the promotion of home ownership in the United States was tied to the production of economic subjects whose debts and property would link their well-being and fortunes to the defense of property rights and individualized subjectivities, rather than pursuing collective interests through unions: “[debt]-encumbered homeowners, it was argued, were less likely to go on strike.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0304375412465039">4</xref>
</sup> By the 1990s, the property market in housing was absorbing a great deal of surplus capital and the inflation of housing asset prices fuelled the expansion of both the financial sector and consumerism.</p>
<p>Similarly, Adam Harmes argues that the broadening of participation in the purchase of and speculation in stocks and other financial instruments does more than provide a source of wealth to be incorporated into financial capital. It also produces a “culture of investment” organized by consensual participation in finance and investor subjects whose outlook and approach to the economy is highly individualistic. Harmes points out that while only 3 percent of US households had a stake in the stock market before the crash in 1929, by the 1990s over 50 percent of households participated in the market. Finance capital was thus able to link the interests of “tens of millions of workers to its own by embedding ‘investor practices’ in their everyday lives and offering them the appearance of a stake in the neoliberal order.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0304375412465039">5</xref>
</sup> Rob Aitken extends this analysis to the promotional practices of the New York Stock Exchange in the post–World War II period,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0304375412465039">6</xref>
</sup> providing a link between Harvey’s arguments about the individualized subjectivities of homeowners in the United States to the processes of the penetration of finance into cultural practice.</p>
<p>Julie Froud and her collaborators have shown how corporate governance has been reoriented around financial performance through shareholder value and through reliance on financial results as measures of competitiveness,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0304375412465039">7</xref>
</sup> enabling financial markets to “shape the behaviour of both firms and households.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0304375412465039">8</xref>
</sup> Randy Martin similarly notes the penetration of financial markets into the realm of social reproduction in the wake of a retreating Keynesian state as the provision of services is privatized and paid for out of household earnings, themselves increasingly dependent on investments made in financial markets.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0304375412465039">9</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Paul Langley’s work on credit and the financialization of everyday life goes further, highlighting the role of governmentality in producing individual subjectivities that police themselves, however uncertainly, as a precondition to the expansion of credit and financialization.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0304375412465039">10</xref>
</sup> Langley highlights the role of “affordable” financial products in producing the agency of borrowers in subprime markets as they oriented their economic practices around “getting on the property ladder” while house prices were rising.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0304375412465039">11</xref>
</sup> While neoliberal governmentality individualized responsibility for economic well-being and reduced the role of the state in regulation and welfare provision, the increasing complexity of financial instruments coupled with broadening participation in financial markets also made “financial literacy” and “investor education and assistance” into core elements of the role of the state in the production of the investor subject.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0304375412465039">12</xref>
</sup> Indeed, the promotion of financial literacy was an indispensable element of the New Labor government’s welfare reform policies in the United Kingdom.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0304375412465039">13</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>This “everyday financialization” is the counterpart to the attack on the state as an institution that can regulate capital accumulation. These processes are all depoliticizing in the sense that they represent moves to close down the spaces in which contestation of the social order as regulated by capital accumulation can be articulated: ownership of real property and portfolios, rather than collective identity and shared risk, becomes the basis of a highly constrained and circumscribed public sphere that is reduced in scope and subsumed to the technical requirements of the logic of accumulation. As the state and commercial media responses to the various manifestations of the “Occupy” movements show, those without property or who make claims outside these technical requirements are moved physically out of the public while their claims are dismissed as uniformed or idiotic.</p>
<p>Cognitively, in addition to these practical closures of the space for contestation, the conceptualization of financialization contributes to depoliticizing the economy. The financial crisis that followed the collapse of the housing bubble in the United States in 2007, giving rise to the “subprime crisis” and leading in turn to the “credit crunch,” provided a sharp impetus to the field of political economy to develop its concepts and research agendas concerning financialization.</p>
<p>Financialization remains a disputed and somewhat elusive concept. In one of the core texts on financialization, Gerald Epstein opts for an ecumenical approach: “financialization means the increasing role of financial motives, financial markets, financial actors, and financial institutions in the operation of domestic and international economies.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0304375412465039">14</xref>
</sup> Such a broad definition feels appropriate given the breadth of the impact of finance across economic and social life, from intimate to global scales.</p>
<p>But this economic definition of the concept gives a feeling of circularity: as values and their exchange are increasingly reduced to or mediated through financial instruments or derivatives of financial instruments, finance itself is financialized and financial motives, financial markets, financial actors, and financial institutions come to refer increasing to themselves. Under financialization, the (substantive) economy is increasingly reducible to the (formal) economy and politics vanishes. The way we think about the economy under financialization is circular or tautological, as both theory and policy come to refer primarily to the sphere of the circulation of money,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0304375412465039">15</xref>
</sup> obscuring not only labor as a political actor but also work as a moment in the economy. The problem with this closing of the economic circle by financialization, and one of the most pressing problems from the perspective of imagining a recovery from the crisis, lies in how it excludes politics by repressing work.</p>
<p>Finance confines social relations to the sphere of circulation. It is money begetting money, with the aspect of production occluded. Thus, financialization obscures work in at least two ways related to these forces of depoliticization. Theoretically, political economy understands its field in terms of accumulation but as the labor theory of value was abandoned in neoclassical economic thought, work as a theoretical object was displaced by the notion of marginal returns.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0304375412465039">16</xref>
</sup> Even for the emergent field of cultural political economy, production and work remain neglected concepts.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0304375412465039">17</xref>
</sup> Exchange relations are the main focus for economic theory and finance is thus examined in terms of how it shapes the capacity for the self-expansion of financial values. Production can appear in financial concepts but it appears in the guise of a demand for investment.</p>
<p>Second—as we saw regarding the social practice of finance—as actors orient their activities around securing access to finance, finance plays the principal role in identity formation or subject formation. In the imaginary of finance, producers and consumers become homogeneous, or at least only internally differentiated with regard to their credit worthiness. Exchange operates through equivalences: the differences between things to be exchanged vanish behind their representation as prices. In contrast, production is a realm of difference. Not only do different producers have different abilities and needs but also their very activity is transforming. Finance enables, practically and cognitively, the dominance of the exchange over production, imposing a realm of indifference or a zone of indistinction in which politics is inconceivable. The depoliticization effected by financialization is an extension of the cognitive and practical processes behind the obscuring of work.</p>
<p>In order to critique the exclusion of work and of politics from the political economy of financialization, inasmuch as financialization blinkers political economic theory and policy making for economic recovery, entails, in the context of insisting on the relevance of cultural political economy, exploring the place of work in the intersections and confrontations of aesthetics and political economy. This will signal both the foreclosings and the openings for a politics of work that can contest the closed economic circle of financialization.</p>

<title>What is the <italic>Aesthetic</italic> Problem Posed by Financialization?</title>
<p>By positing an analysis of the visual representation of the financial crisis, as will be discussed below, the aesthetic problem posed by the financial crisis would appear to be how to stage (<italic>mise-en-scene</italic>) the financial crisis. Thus, the YouTube clips will be examined here initially with regard to their formal elements: how they represent concepts and practices of financialization. But the notion of “aesthetics” is much more complex than would be suggested by a merely formal description of these representations.</p>
<p>Susan Buck-Morss, for example, in her discussion of Walter Benjamin’s “Work of Art in the Age of its Technological Reproducibility” essay, defines aesthetics not in relation to art but to the body, as what she calls “somatic cognition”:
<disp-quote>
<p>The original field of aesthetics is not art but reality—corporeal, material nature. . . .   It is a form of cognition, achieved through taste, touch, hearing, seeing, smell—the whole corporeal sensorium. The terminae of all these—nose, eyes, ears, mouth, some of the most sensitive areas of skin—are located at the surface of the body, the mediating boundary between inner and outer. This physical-cognitive apparatus with its qualitatively autonomous, nonfungible sensors (the ears cannot smell, the mouth cannot see) is “out front” of the mind, encountering the world prelinguistically, hence prior not only to logic but to meaning as well. Of course, all of the senses can be acculturated—that is the whole point of philosophical interest in “aesthetics” in the modern era. But however strictly the senses are trained (as moral sensibility, refinement of “taste,” sensitivity to cultural norms of beauty), all of this is <italic>a posteriori</italic>. The senses maintain an uncivilized and uncivilizable trace, a core of resistance to cultural domestication.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0304375412465039">18</xref>
</sup>
</p>
</disp-quote>For Benjamin, the technological reproducibility of the artwork is the result of the development of forces of production.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0304375412465039">19</xref>
</sup> Benjamin identifies two outcomes from the historical emergence of new forms of reproduction and reproducibility. First, the insertion of technical means, such as the camera lens, into observed realities produces new possibilities for perception: a new perceived space is produced with the technological extension of the body into the real. The development of the technologies of technical reproducibility alters the organism’s perceptual and cognitive abilities.</p>
<p>Second, the multiplicity and mobility of the copies, permitting the object to be perceived where the perceivers are rather than where the object itself must reside, changes the relation between the object and its objectivity—what Benjamin refers to as the loss of the art object’s “aura.” This helps to clarify the ways in which the social functions of the objects organize perception while allowing for the fragments of the real to be reordered. This prospect for reordering also disperses expertise. For example, the method of perception typical of architecture—based on use and habit, rather than on contemplation—suggests that instead of the authoritarian fixing of the object by the subject through contemplation, a “distracted” perception is possible, one that relies on the expertise embodied in the habitual uses of buildings. Following Henri Lefebvre, however, we can also note that the everyday—the banal, the ordinary, the habitual—is also opposed by expertise, which attempts to program it.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0304375412465039">20</xref>
</sup> This implies that the changes occasioned by the deepening penetration of technical means into the real will provoke struggles over creativity.</p>
<p>Thus, aesthetics also involves what Jacques Rancière refers to as the <italic>partage du sensible</italic>—the division and distribution of the perceivable. Rancière links aesthetics to politics through this notion: “A partition of the sensible refers to the manner in which a relation between a shared common (<italic>un comun partagé</italic>) and the distribution of exclusive parts is determined in sensory experience. This latter form of distribution, which, by its sensory self-evidence, anticipates the distribution of part and shares (<italic>parties</italic>), itself presupposes a distribution of what is visible and what is not, of what can be heard and what cannot.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0304375412465039">21</xref>
</sup> The antipolitical symbolic constitution of social order that Rancière terms “police” is a distribution of the sensible: it sums up the parts of the social and fixes things in their place. Politics is the disruption of this order by the “part that has no part,” the excess or supplement of the social order that dissents and, by doing so, changes the distributions of the visible and invisible or the audible and inaudible, or changes the distinction between what is heard as (political) speech and what is heard as mere (animal) sound.</p>
<p>Thus, the question of the <italic>aesthetics</italic> of financialization revolves around not only what its representation makes visible or invisible but also rests on the embodied, somatic experience of the partition, distribution, and fixing in place of the perceptive and cognitive capacities of its subjects. Furthermore, the question of the aesthetics of financialization must then also involve determining what its aesthetic regime attempts to render invisible and unperceivable. The hypothesis that financialization depoliticizes economic relations means that what is rendered beyond perception by financialization is that supplement that is the condition for the social and political economic order that sustains a financialized regime to exist but that cannot be acknowledged. In political economic terms, this supplement, and the source of dissensus, is work: work not only as the economic activity that produces values but also the creative activity of the body in its metabolic relation to its space. Financialization is an economic regime that denies embodiment through the force of abstraction. Aesthetics signals—even as it conceals—the concrete working body that finance abstracts.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0304375412465039">
<title>The Formal Elements of the Aesthetic of Financialization: How is Finance Represented?</title>
<p>So far, the argument here is that financialization cognitively and practically forecloses politics through its erasure of work. To be sure, depoliticization is not the only effect of financialization, nor is the disappearance of work the only means through which financialization effects depoliticization. However, an aesthetic approach to this problem is particularly well suited to analyzing this process of depoliticizing through the erasure of work because aesthetics is concerned with the body and the organization of the body’s capacity for perception. Furthermore, while neoclassical economic theory and policy informed by that theory have tended to render work conceptually invisible, work and the quality of working life in the context of dramatic crises is often an overt concern in popular culture.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0304375412465039">22</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Film clips available on video sharing website YouTube raise a host of analytical possibilities in this regard: users provide comments on the clips, which gives at least a partial view of the reception of the clips and the efforts to shape the discourses they articulate. The clips can be downloaded and manipulated, reshared, and remixed; each page on which a clip appears also contains links to clips deemed similar to the one being watched. Advertisements often pop up onto the clip, sometimes providing ironic commentary—such as ads for financial services on clips dealing with the financial crisis. The clips can be circulated more widely through embedding on other sites. Any one of these characteristics of YouTube clips would provide an interesting object for aesthetic analysis.</p>
<p>For the present, this analysis concentrates on the visual elements of the animated clips themselves. Animations were selected in part because animations minimize the analytical problems of the “reality effect”: the visual elements are all overtly designed and provide a denaturalized account of the conceptualizations behind the presentation of the concepts. As we will see, these conceptualizations often present attempts to deploy technical explanations of the crisis: the depoliticization effected by financialization is most evident in the register of the conceived. However, conception and perception are not necessarily identical. To portray the concepts in these animations, the filmmakers have to have recourse to practical elements derived from a pool of shared meanings: making the concepts perceivable, bringing them into an aesthetic regime, draws upon and shapes the shared meanings of the viewers. The following two sections of this article analyze the visual field in these animations from these perspectives.</p>
<p>However, the <italic>conceived</italic> and the <italic>perceived</italic> moments do not exhaust the reading of the visual field. Following Henri Lefebvre, the visual analytical method employed here also examines a third moment, what Lefebvre referred to as the <italic>lived</italic>.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0304375412465039">23</xref>
</sup> The lived is that which resists representation, a residue remaining when the conceptual and the practical are abstracted out, cognate to Benjamin’s “distracted perception.”</p>
<p>Several short animated films dealing with the financial crisis and that exemplify this aesthetic of representation of financialization have been produced and uploaded to YouTube. These short animations not only set out to explain the processes and events that led to the bursting of the financial bubble in 2007 along with the arcane financial concepts that then burst into the news media, they also do so using a particular graphic style. Three clips that have all been widely watched on YouTube and that have established and share a particular graphic style for financialization are exemplary: Say It Visually’s “Understanding the Financial Crisis—For Kids and Grown Ups” (http://youtu.be/h4Ns4ltUvfw; as of June 23, 2011, this film had 179,840 views on YouTube);<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0304375412465039">24</xref>
</sup> Enspire Learning’s “Understanding the Financial Crisis” (http://youtu.be/gF6LbFDjvW0; 45,944 views on YouTube);<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0304375412465039">25</xref>
</sup> and Jonathan Jarvis’s “The Crisis of Credit Visualized” (part 1,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0304375412465039">26</xref>
</sup> http://youtu.be/Q0zEXdDO5JU, had 1,081,767 views on YouTube, part 2,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0304375412465039">27</xref>
</sup> http://youtu.be/iYhDkZjKBEw, had 541,203; a full version, with both parts together, had 43,925 views). The explanations and the style help establish a kind of commonsense understanding of financialization and the financial crisis—an understanding that is as interesting for what it hides as for what it shows.</p>
<p>Say It Visually’s film opens with a seesaw rocking over a percentage sign while the voice-over tells the viewer to picture the seesaw: “It’s fun!” The film likens the fun of the up-and-down of the seesaw with borrowing and lending, payment and sale, investment and return, as each passes from one side of the plank to the other. The seesaw and the economy are thus not much fun when they stop going up and down. The other two films open with a slightly different approach, by beginning with the likely apprehensions of the viewer. Jarvis’s film starts with what is frightening about the crisis: a logo for the film composed of some of its visual elements explodes and the narrative begins by listing the obscure technical terms that the viewer might not understand: “subprime mortgages,” “collateralized debt obligations,” “frozen credit markets,” and “credit default swaps.” Similarly, Enspire Learning’s film starts with names that had been in the headlines: Lehman Brothers; Bear Stearns; Washington Mutual; Wachovia; it then introduces a concept that needs to be explained: “toxic assets.”</p>
<p>Other than the logo at the beginning of Jarvis’s film, the graphics deployed to this point in the latter two films are restricted to words floating into or appearing in the frame, like slightly sophisticated PowerPoint presentation slides. Say It Visually uses recognizable icons that look like stock graphic images or clip art: the percentage sign, bags of money passing back and forth, piles of paper that say “I owe you” (IOU) “credit.” The focus is on the exchange of money for the promise to pay.</p>
<p>Say It Visually’s film then goes on to explain the differences between depository banking and investment banking, and here it introduces the first human figures standing in for borrowers (thinking of buying a house) and lenders (representing a bank). The figures are male, in suits, white, but with no facial features: the simple graphics emphasize both that the explanations will be simple and that the crisis affects people generally—that is, generically. Similarly in Jarvis’s “The Crisis of Credit Visualized”: figures are introduced to show how the credit crisis affects “everyone.” The animated figures used are highly stylized and simple to read, appearing graphically similar to the figures in road signs: homeowners are signified by a male figure, a female figure (with a skirt), a baby (with a nappy), and a dog. Investors are given a bit more detail: they are round (fat), with hats and briefcases. Homeowners, the film says, represent their mortgages and investors represent their money. So here, again, the economic emphasis is on the exchange of money for a promise to pay.</p>
<p>By starting with the notion of “toxic assets,” Enspire Learning focuses instead on the failure of this exchange. It asserts that investors bought mortgage-based assets hoping to make money on the interest payments but as some of the homeowners failed to make their payments, the investments went sour and the banks could not unload them. The assets became “toxic,” “poisoning the banks’ balance sheets.” Here, the figure representing the economy is at first a tree with the investment banks hanging like fruit from its limbs—but a rising red vein at its roots makes them fall from the tree. Line drawings of houses spring up as the explanation turns to the purchase of mortgage-based assets, with stick figure people in front of the houses and a blue smiley face in the sky but with the houses turning red, the face turning red and frowning, and finally the houses collapsing as the assets become toxic.</p>
<p>In representations of financialization, the economic activities that are made visible are borrowing, lending, and investing: activities represented as geared toward the expansion of the sphere of the circulation of commodities. Economic agents are defined in terms of the tradable assets they own, such as homes, and the cash that needs to be invested; or they are defined in terms of their standing as institutions such as banks, represented by buildings whose function is to connect asset owners and investors. These economic agents can be represented with clip art type figures because they are generic types, freely interchangeable with each other as the sphere of circulation expands. From the perspective of the aesthetic of financialization, their subjectivities are only lightly differentiated within their generic types.</p>
<p>Thus, the subjects of finance in these short films are only lightly differentiated between their generic types and, as borrowing or indebted subjects, between reliable and unreliable, responsible and less responsible. The subject figures help represent the concepts of financialization—or rather, the concepts undergirding financialization—as the accumulated knowledge of the economy, technical explanations that apply generally and require technical solutions, rather than policy choices made and sustained by particular agents.</p>

<title>The Practical and Expressive Elements of the Popular Aesthetic of Financialization</title>
<p>The representation of financialization in these three films is supported by concepts that take on the air of technical, scientific knowledge to be conveyed to an uninformed audience. If, as Jacques Rancière argues, the representative regime of art is one in which the problems are about fixing things in their place, finding the appropriate or adequate rules governing representation,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0304375412465039">28</xref>
</sup> then the need to represent finance, in order to explain the financial crisis in the films, is about providing certain kinds of distinction (e.g., good subjects and bad subjects of finance) and fixing things in their place, however at odds this is with the nature of financial interaction. Fixing things in their place thus links the representation of financialization with what Henri Lefebvre called the representation of space, conceived or conceptualized space, which is the dominant space in any mode of production.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0304375412465039">29</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>For Lefebvre, representations of space exist in dialectical relation with spatial practice and with representational or “lived” space. Spatial practice “secretes” a society’s space: “Considered overall, social practice presupposes the use of the body: the use of the hands, members and sensory organs, and the gestures of work as of activity unrelated to work. This is the realm of the <italic>perceived</italic> (the practical basis for the perception of the outside world).”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0304375412465039">30</xref>
</sup> These three films can also be read in terms of their practical, expressive elements: what “distribution of the sensible” do these elements enable?</p>
<p>Graphically, an interesting contrast emerges between the three films regarding the explanation behind why people stopped paying their mortgages. Say It Visually is somewhat neutral in its portrayal of the defaulting homeowners. If a kind of hint about the problem is provided when a more diverse crowd of borrowers are getting on the seesaw as homeowners—bringing together diverse figures on both the borrowing and lending sides—the figures are simply removed from the frame when they default on their loans. Only by a rather indirect implication does the film make any kind of suggestion about how the expansion of the market for mortgages might have brought in more “unreliable” or “less responsible” borrowers. Similarly with Enspire Learning, where only an indirect hint about the nature of “unreliable” borrowers is made: by representing the loss of value with bar graphs, their film dispenses with the representation of the “unreliable” borrowers graphically. The action in the film takes place on the bars of a graph that grow and are covered in roses when payments are being made, accompanied by cheering and a smiley face, and that crack and turn brown when payments are not being made. Jarvis, however, does make a graphic assertion of what he means by “well, less responsible.” The male figure in the homeowner family is replaced by one that is fatter, has a cigarette in his mouth and a bottle in his hand; the female figure is given a cigarette and a baby in her arms; and the dog is replaced with three more children. These “less responsible” borrowers do not present an immediate problem in Jarvis’s explanation: they buy a “big” house, and “everybody gets rich.” All the same, and without saying why, Jarvis asserts: “not surprisingly, the homeowners default on their mortgages.”</p>
<p>The assertion of a kind of distinction between responsible and less responsible borrowers in all three films presents a problem both for financialization and for the aesthetics of financialization. For the former, the logic of the conceptions deployed both in the films and in economic thinking leads to situating the source of the crisis in the bad, failed subjectivities of unreliable borrowers. It is in their practices, specifically their failure to continue making payments on their mortgages, that the crisis of financialization is represented as occurring. The closed circle in the economic analysis of financialization precludes an examination of <italic>why</italic> they fail to continue making payments for the same reason that financialization transformed them from workers (with steadily declining wages and share of national income) into “subprime” or “high-risk” borrowers.</p>
<p>Financialization abstracts all economic activity into a sphere of perfect, high-velocity circulation, a realm of (nearly) perfect equivalences. The contrast between these films in the way in which they represent these “bad subjects” highlights this difficulty in representing difference. Jarvis must fall back on facile stereotypes: for the smoking, drinking, baby-making clip art figures, their practice uncritically confirms the perceptions encoded in concepts like “subprime” or “high-risk” while, simultaneously, confining the figures’ practice in spaces unrelated to work or to politics. The solution to this difficulty presented in the other films is equally insufficient: by <italic>not</italic> representing the unreliable borrowing subjects, financial failure and crisis appears as the outcome of the technical operation of the system itself.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0304375412465039">
<title>The Embodiment of Perceptions</title>
<p>While Jarvis is making a more plain assertion about what it means to be “less responsible,” none of the three films examines the reason for subprime borrowers to have found themselves in a position to borrow money to buy a house but then not to be in a position to repay the loan. The expansion of credit appears as the result of monetary policy and the demands of investors; the link between the expansion of credit and the decline of real wages in the United States or the declining share of US national income going to wages and salaries from 1974 onward is not pursued. This is a crucial omission in the “commonsense” explanation of the crisis that also plagues much of the polemics in both academic literature and in the financial press. What has been repressed in these explanations and in graphic portrayals of the financial crisis is work: how we work and what it means to us, how is work compensated, and what is the place of work in the economy. The political retrenchment after the period of “stagflation” in the 1970s involved breaking up the tripartite governance arrangements in the industrialized core—between the state, capital, and organized labor—and weakening and marginalizing labor as a political subject. Flexibilization in the labor process, geographical mobility of capital, and the consequent downward pressure on wages increased the power exercised by capital with the support of compliant—“responsible”—states.</p>
<p>However, this led to a problem for realizing value: with declining wages, where were consumers to be found? The expansion of credit and financialization address both the economic and the political problems: economic identity, rather than collectively configured as workers or bosses, could be refigured as individualized “consumer” and “investor”; homes and debts became assets, which, if not managed “responsibly,” would compromise these economic identities. The aesthetic of financialization also addresses these political and economic problems: it is an expression and a practical organization of perceptions that connects disparate practices within a (nearly) seamless space ruled by circulation, and a dominant representation of the technocratic, depoliticizing concepts of financialization.</p>
<p>But as Lefebvre demonstrated, this dialectic is not a closed circle between perception and conception. There is also always another space, a “lived space” or representational space: “[this] is the dominated—and hence passively experienced—space which the imagination seeks to change and appropriate.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0304375412465039">31</xref>
</sup> This representational space is relevant to understanding the aesthetic of financialization not in binary opposition to the dominant spaces secreted by practice and represented in concepts; it cannot merely be set opposed to these as an absolute difference. It is relevant insofar as it provides an opportunity for the perceptions and concepts to be reconfigured, where a disagreement and the effort to change and appropriate can be registered.</p>
<p>A fourth YouTube clip that asserts a different aesthetic of financialization registers precisely the imposition of the representational concepts of finance and the artifice of the fixing of the perception of practice among apparently abstract subjects. “The Crises of Capitalism” is a talk given by David Harvey at The Royal Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures, and Commerce (The RSA), in London, on April 26, 2010<sup>32</sup> (http://youtu.be/qOP2V_np2c0; as of 23 June 2011, this clip had 1,116,325 views). In collaboration with the company Cognitive Media, The RSA produces short animated films, condensed versions of talks given to the society (The RSA Animates). “The Crises of Capitalism” opens with the RSA Animates logo being drawn on a whiteboard. The hand of the artist is the visible moving element throughout the animation. The hand then draws a caricature of Harvey, giving the title and date of his talk and poses a question to begin the talk: “Is it time to look beyond capitalism towards a new social order that would allow us to live within a system that could be responsible, just &amp; humane?”</p>
<p>Harvey begins his talk with an overview of five different “genres” of explanation that have emerged to explain the financial crisis. The artist’s hand that produced the cartoon in the film records these ideas with both text and images on a whiteboard. The image of the writing and drawing hand is comically sped up to keep up with the pace of Harvey’s delivery, writing down his keywords and phrases, illustrating them with iconic images—an urn for Greece, Uncle Sam for the United States, for example. A comic element and commentary on Harvey’s talk is enabled by use of iconic imagery. With reference to the last of Harvey’s genres, both “the Glenn Beck wing of Fox News” and the World Bank are said to argue that the problem is too much regulation and of the wrong sort. This assertion is illustrated as a dominatrix whipping a client’s back; she says: “you naughty banker, you must pay” and he says: “oww, anything Mistress, except my bonus.”</p>
<p>Harvey says that each of these perspectives contains a certain truth and that skilled writers will take a perspective and builds a plausible story around it. The animation shows Snoopy on top of his dog house, writing “it was a dark and stormy night.” Harvey then asks himself what story he could tell—can he translate “systemic risk” into Marxian terms, that is, the internal contradictions of capital accumulation?</p>
<p>Harvey’s thesis is that the form of the current crisis is dictated by how we came out of the previous crisis in the 1970s, when the problem was seen to be excessive power of labor in relation to capital. Interestingly, the illustration places striking workers on the Monopoly board but then opposite them on the board, on a seesaw but stuck up in the air, is the character from the Monopoly game, here representing capital. In contrast to Say It Visually’s film, the seesaw here is not about “fun” or the back and forth of borrowing and lending; it is about the imbalance in power. The image recurs later in this film to illustrate the power of financial capital with regard to manufacturing.</p>
<p>Harvey goes on to show how labor was then disciplined in various ways and that by the mid-1980s, the labor problem was “solved.” So this time, no one is blaming greedy unions for the problems; if anything, the problem is excessive power of capital, specifically of finance capital. Harvey asks how this happened, and goes on to explain that since the 1970s, we have been in a period of wage repression, thus wages as a share of national income have been declining not only throughout the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, but even in China. Increasing effective demand thus depends on the inflation of asset prices and the Monopoly man inflates the credit sector with a bicycle pump. The United States and Britain become spaces with houses on them on the Monopoly board and Harvey points out the household debt in these countries roughly tripled over the last twenty to thirty years.</p>
<p>A new scene is then set up for Harvey to explain his theory that capitalism never solves its crises, it just moves them around geographically, thus an apparent recovery in the United States becomes a crisis across Portugal, Ireland, Italy, Greece, and Spain—the PIIGS (a wolf blows down the Acropolis over a pig on the next side of the Monopoly board), thus the finance crisis becomes a sovereign debt crisis. The introduction of this theoretical observation is the transition to a new scene on the whiteboard, where an open book is drawn with Marx on a page: the book is the <italic>Grundrisse</italic>. Harvey cites Marx, saying capital cannot abide a limit; it turns it into a barrier which it then circumvents or transcends: the Monopoly man is then drawn with a jet pack jumping over a barrier.</p>
<p>There are several barriers to capital accumulation; in the animation, we go immediately to the problem of how to get the money together in the right place at the right time and in the right volume. Harvey says, “That takes financial ingenuity. So the whole history of capitalism has been about financial innovation,” which has the effect of empowering the financiers. The illustration uses another seesaw to portray a now rather portly version of the Monopoly man weighing heavily on one side, with a rather thin looking workman sitting up on the other end to illustrate Harvey’s observation that from the 1990s, profits in the financial sector were rising while those in the manufacturing sector were falling.</p>
<p>Harvey’s conclusion is that at this point in time, any sensible person would join an anticapitalist organization. Harvey’s words are written almost verbatim on the board here: “Where’s the debate and discussion? [ . . . ] We have a duty to change our mode of thinking.” At that point, Harvey’s speech ends and the camera pans up from this last point back to the first Monopoly board where—and the viewer may not have noticed this as it was first drawn in—the Monopoly man has been put in jail under a title reading “It’s the excessive power of capital.” Finally, the camera zooms out to show the whole cartoon visualization of Harvey’s talk and closes with credit to Cognitive Media.</p>
<p>The contrast with the kinds of explanation presented in the previous three films is evident. Harvey is using different concepts and a different theoretical apparatus to explain the financial crisis. The confrontation between the commonsense explanations as developed in the first three films and Harvey’s Marxist explanation is interesting enough but what is important here is the very different aesthetic deployed to present Harvey’s ideas. Unlike the images from the first three films, these images do not simply present the ideas. Through the use of humorous iconography, puns, and asides, the animation enters into a dialog with Harvey’s talk. The figures presented are not generic as in the previous films but are readily identifiable and operate to differentiate between different kinds of subjects and subjectivities; they carry cultural values that the generic figures attempt to reduce, if not strip away, in order to confine their referentiality to the sphere of exchange. They thus operate by appropriating and changing the concepts presented in Harvey’s talk, working precisely from the lived space shared in the viewer’s cultural idiom.</p>
<p>Strikingly, this aesthetic, like Harvey’s Marxist account of the crisis, also presents a specific challenge to the notion that the (economic) subject is reducible to exchange relations. By animating not the cartoon images used to illustrate Harvey’s ideas but the hand that draws them, the film makes the making evident. The work or craft of producing the ideas is the foremost figure in every scene of the film. In this sense, the animation of Harvey’s talk goes beyond the argument that he presents. Unlike the commonsense explanations of the financial crisis of the first three films, Harvey presents and indeed emphasizes the issue of the power of capital confronting labor as a political actor, the role of falling wages and the reduction of the share of national income given to wages, and he explicitly links these to the roots of financialization and of the crisis. But in this animation, work becomes something other than a commodity, through the playfulness and the creativity of the hand illustrating Harvey’s talk. The possibility for work to be the basis of a subjectivity that can emerge from dominated, lived space to articulate a political critique and rejoinder emerges in the dialog between the animation and Harvey’s critique.</p>

<title>Conclusion: Recovering Work and Politics in the Aesthetics of Financialization</title>
<p>We conclude by asking, along with Claes Belfrage<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0304375412465039">33</xref>
</sup> and Marieke de Goede,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0304375412465039">34</xref>
</sup> can an <italic>aesthetic</italic> of financialization contribute to repoliticizing economic relations? The argument presented here has been concerned with depoliticization as a suspension of subjectivity and has sought to contrast this with attention to subjectivation, especially to work as a moment of subjectivity hidden by the depoliticizing effected by financialization. The practical and cognitive suppression of work forecloses politics; they entail domination in and through conceptions and perceptions. The common sense of financialization is typical of the antipolitical regime that Rancière calls “police,” which sums up the parts of the social and fixes things in their place.</p>
<p>Financialization has been seen here as an intervention in the constitution of the social, privileging the identification of the subject of finance with its property as assets and its confinement in the economic sphere of circulation where functional equivalences obscure difference. That which is obscured by financialization, both in the construction of the subject and in the constitution of the social, is this sphere of difference. The subject makes itself through differentiation and transformation, in short, through work. The foreclosure of politics is thus effected through the suspension of the work of subjectivation and, therefore, of work as a moment in social, cultural, political, and economic life.</p>
<p>The foreclosure of politics by finance has been noted by some of the critical scholars noted here; one of the most astute and deeply historical accounts of the depoliticization imposed by financialization is in the work of Marieke de Goede.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0304375412465039">35</xref>
</sup> De Goede emphasizes the discursive partitioning of practices and their naturalizing effects, showing how the process of abstraction, for example mathematical abstraction,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0304375412465039">36</xref>
</sup> situates finance in a technocratic space where risk and uncertainty can be managed. This abstraction that renders finance technical rests on a dense cultural network of interpretations, interventions, and moral proclamations that are themselves politically contingent. Thus, in her study of the regulation of finance in the context of the “War on Terror,” she argues that efforts to regulate finance are “not so much about preventing undesirable flows of money as [ . . . ] about governing networks of kinship and social affiliation.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0304375412465039">37</xref>
</sup> To repoliticize finance is, for de Goede, a matter of making visible the tenuous and conditional assemblages that lie behind the technocracy of abstraction. Thus, in a longer discussion of repoliticizing finance, she focuses on those critical practices that seek to resist the logic of dominant financial practices and to disturb and disrupt the image of finance as neutral and objective.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0304375412465039">38</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>De Goede’s analyses privilege the politics of resistance. She distinguishes the multiple/plural practices she analyzes from the “single locus of ‘great Refusal’ or the emergence of a ‘collective will’ that opposes the power of capital.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0304375412465039">39</xref>
</sup> Part of her reason for distancing herself from a politics of the “great Refusal” is her concern with the problem of subsuming all possible politics under an overly singular conception of the domination of capital, one that cannot recognize the multiplicity of forms of domination.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0304375412465039">40</xref>
</sup> At the same time, the logic of resistance depends upon the domination it resists. While the imposition of the singular logic of the “great Refusal” can be seen as antipolitical insofar as it seeks to fix all dissent and critique under a hegemonic sign, similarly the logic of domination fixes the absent center of multiple resistances in place while resistance reproduces the very relations that it presupposes. Political critique must seek a position beyond subsumption and reproduction.</p>
<p>The critique of finance, insofar as it drags finance out of the world of circulation and perfect equalities, has recourse to an aesthetics that posits a different <italic>partage du sensible</italic>, in Rancière’s term, that is, a sensual or somatic intervention that changes the sensible not only as perception but also as conception—and life. For as financialization seeks to foreclose the possibility of politics, it does so by making invisible the necessary but denied moment of work. The force of the abstraction underpinning financialization abstracts from the working body and the body—embodied, somatic cognition, as Buck-Morss reminds us—is the point of reference for aesthetics.</p>
<p>The working body is a zone where politics and aesthetics connect. It is the “part of no part” in a financialized regime. If the financialized social order is to be transformed, that is, if a recovery from the crisis is to be imagined and enacted, the suspension of its subjectivity will have to be disrupted. The working body as a dominated space will have to confront dramatically the conditions of its denial and invisibility—and change the subject.</p>
