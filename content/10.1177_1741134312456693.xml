<p>The product label is a required component of, and plays a critical role in, FDA review of a generic drug. As essential a role as the label plays for FDA regulatory purposes, it can also play an important role in patent infringement issues.</p>
<p>Aside from certain permitted differences under law and regulations,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1741134312456693">1</xref></sup> the product label of a generic drug must be identical to the product label of the branded Reference Listed Drug (the RLD or so-called “innovator product”). Permitted differences include omission of brand-name, change of manufacturer identity, etc. Further, when a generic applicant seeks fewer than all uses approved for the RLD, a “carve-out” of certain uses may be permitted under 21 U.S.C. § 505 (j)(2)(A)(viii).</p>
<p>The product label may be significant in a patent infringement suit when a patent claims a use of a drug that the RLD owner asserts would be infringed by a patient’s use of the generic product. In such cases, it is possible that the product label of the RLD and the generic drug may themselves be dispositive of infringement allegations.</p>
<p>It is important to keep in mind that when it comes to patents relating to methods of use, the generic company will rarely, if ever, be a direct infringer of the patent. That is, the generic company will not, itself, be practicing the patented use. Rather, it will be the patient who, for example, takes a generic drug to treat type II diabetes. It will generally be the patient (if anyone) who directly infringes the method-of-use patent. The question in these cases is whether the activities of the generic company are of such a nature to justify holding the generic company liable for the patient’s direct infringement of the patent, i.e., whether the generic company can be considered an indirect infringer.</p>
<p>The following section of this article presents a general background of the U.S. law of patent infringement, with emphasis on indirect infringement. The later section provides an introduction of how the law of indirect infringement has traditionally been applied in cases of generic drugs. Final sections present recent important developments in this area.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1741134312456693"><title>Direct and indirect infringement</title>
<p>Traditional notions of patent infringement are codified in 35 U.S.C. § 271 (a), which states that it is an act of infringement to make, use, sell, offer to sell, or import into the United States, a patented invention without authorization. A special act of infringement is also defined in 35 U.S.C. § 271 (e), under which it is an act of infringement to submit an ANDA containing a Paragraph IV certification.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1741134312456693">2</xref></sup> The purpose of the constructive infringement under § 271 (e) is not to infer or establish infringement, but to provide standing for the parties in a patent infringement lawsuit.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1741134312456693">3</xref></sup> Even when judicial standing is conferred under § 271 (e), actual infringement under § 271 (a) must still be established. Therefore, the question in generic drug cases is whether the generic drug, or its use, would infringe an Orange Book patent if the generic drug were approved by FDA and marketed with the approved drug label.</p>
<p>As noted above, patents claiming methods of use would generally be infringed, if at all, by the patient taking the drug, and not by the ANDA holder. However, the generic company might be found responsible (liable) for that infringement under the concepts of indirect infringement known as contributory and/or induced infringement. At its most basic level, the concept of indirect infringement asks, “Under what circumstances might the ANDA holder be held liable for the patients’ acts of infringement?”</p>
<p>In order to establish indirect infringement (induced or contributory infringement), there must first be an act of direct infringement<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1741134312456693">4</xref></sup>. In the absence of an act of direct infringement, therefore, there can be no liability for indirect infringement. <italic>Id.</italic></p>
<p>Induced infringement is defined in 35 U.S.C. § 271(b), which provides that “whoever actively induces infringement of a patent shall be liable as an infringer.” Although the statute does not specify what constitutes “active inducement,” courts have generally held that it requires “proof that the accused infringer knowingly aided and abetted another’s direct infringement of the patent.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1741134312456693">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>To succeed on the theory of inducement of infringement, a plaintiff must prove that the defendants’ actions “induced infringing acts and that they knew or should have known their <italic>actions</italic> would induce actual infringement.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1741134312456693">6</xref></sup> However, mere knowledge of possible infringement by others does not amount to inducement; specific intent and action to induce infringement must be proven.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1741134312456693">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>A second type of indirect infringement is contributory infringement. Defined in 35 U.S.C. § 271 (c), contributory infringement essentially requires that a material component of a patented invention, having no substantial non-infringing use, is sold, offered for sale, or imported into the United States. However, “[t]he mere sale of a product capable of substantial non-infringing uses does not constitute indirect infringement of a patent.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1741134312456693">8</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1741134312456693"><title>Indirect infringement and the generic product label</title>
<p>For the most part, questions of indirect infringement in pharmaceutical cases have been based on whether or not the product label, which includes all methods of use approved by FDA, leads a patient to directly infringe a patent. When the generic company seeks approval for a method of use that has been FDA-approved for the brand product, and when that method of use is clearly claimed in a patent, there will often be little disagreement as to whether the concept of indirect infringement applies.</p>
<p>However, until about ten years ago, there were still some very basic outstanding questions relating to off-label uses. In particular, there was some disagreement between brands and generics on whether a patent directed only to unapproved methods of use could be infringed by a generic (whose product label, like that of the brand, only includes approved methods of use). A pair of cases from 2003 essentially resolved that question.</p>
<p>In <italic>Warner-Lambert Co. v. Apotex Corp.</italic>,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1741134312456693">9</xref></sup> Warner-Lambert had sued Apotex over the latter’s ANDA for gabapentin. Apotex was seeking FDA approval for use of gabapentin to treat epilepsy, which was the only indication of use approved by FDA for gabapentin. Warner-Lambert’s patents on the molecule, and on the use of gabapentin to treat epilepsy had already expired, so the sole use for which Apotex sought approval was off patent.</p>
<p>However, Warner-Lambert also had listed a patent in the Orange Book covering use of gabapentin to treat neurodegenerative diseases, and sued Apotex for infringement of that patent. While the principle question in the case was whether it is only an act of infringement to submit an ANDA if the indication of use for which approval is sought is claimed in a patent,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1741134312456693">10</xref></sup> the court also addressed induced infringement under 35 U.S.C. § 271 (b).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1741134312456693">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>Warner-Lambert argued that Apotex should be found to be an inducer of infringement because only 22% of gabapentin sales were for treatment of epilepsy, while the remaining 78% was for off-label uses including use for neurodegenerative diseases. Warner-Lambert argued that physicians would prescribe generic gabapentin for the same indications as the branded product, and that Apotex knew this.</p>
<p>The Federal Circuit held that Apotex’s knowledge that physicians may prescribe and induce infringement is irrelevant, since mere knowledge of infringement of infringement by others is not enough to prove specific intent and actions to induce infringement. Therefore, the court held that a generic company does not induce infringement of a patent that claims only an unapproved method of use, even if that unapproved use is a known off-label use of the drug.</p>
<p>Later that same year, the Federal Circuit decided a second case, <italic>Allergan, Inc. v. Alcon Labs.</italic>,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1741134312456693">12</xref></sup> on virtually the same type of fact pattern. The only seeming distinction was that in <italic>Allergan</italic> (unlike in <italic>Warner-Lambert</italic>), the plaintiff alleged that the generic ANDA applicants intended to actively encourage prescribing the drug (brimonidine) for the unapproved use (ophthalmic neuroprotection).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1741134312456693">13</xref></sup> Nevertheless, despite that allegation, the three-judge panel held that <italic>Warner-Lambert</italic> was controlling, and so ruled in favor of the defendant.</p>
<p><italic>Warner-Lambert</italic> and <italic>Allergan</italic> were important for clearly establishing the important role of the product label for determining questions of indirect infringement, and infringement by filing an ANDA. In particular, these cases laid out situations which, as a matter of law, absolve the generic of accusations of infringement.</p>
<p>For the most part, the role of the product label in indirect infringement in pharmaceutical cases did not undergo major significant developments for almost ten years after the <italic>Warner-Lambert</italic> and <italic>Allergan</italic> decisions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-1741134312456693">14</xref></sup> However, this changed recently, with the Supreme Court decision in <italic>Caraco v. Novo Nordisk</italic> and the Federal Circuit decision in <italic>Bayer v. Lupin</italic>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1741134312456693"><title>Caraco v. Novo Nordisk<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-1741134312456693">15</xref></sup> and the misuse of use codes</title>
<p>In order to fully understand the U.S. Supreme Court case of <italic>Caraco</italic>, it is necessary to understand the special role of the Orange Book with regard to method-of-use patents. A rather complete explanation of this role is available in an article in a previous issue of this Journal that discusses in detail the treatment of <italic>Caraco</italic> in 2010 by the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-1741134312456693">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>In brief, patents directed to methods of use put FDA into an unwanted predicament. On the one hand, FDA must know when a patent is directed to an approved method of use because FDA must be in a position to determine whether a section <italic>viii</italic> carve-out can be accepted instead of a Paragraph IV certification. On the other hand, FDA openly takes the position that it does not know patents, has no experience with reading patents, and therefore refuses to apply or understand patents.</p>
<p>In order to get around this problem, FDA created the “use code.” When an NDA holder submits to FDA a patent claiming a method of using a drug, the NDA holder must certify which claims cover the method of use, and must also provide a description of the method of use claimed in the patent. FDA has clearly indicated that the required use code information should be “accurate and detailed.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-1741134312456693">17</xref></sup> FDA adopts the NDA holder’s description of the method of use and publishes it in the Orange Book as the “use code” associated with the patent.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-1741134312456693">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>FDA treats the use code as a substitute patent claim. That is, regardless of what the patent actually claims, if a use code recites a use approved in the NDA, and the ANDA applicant seeks approval for that use, then FDA will not permit a section <italic>viii</italic> for that patent.</p>
<p><italic>Caraco</italic> dealt with Caraco’s ANDA for repaglinide (branded product, Prandin®). The ‘035 patent at issue was directed specifically to use of combinations of repaglinide and metformin to treat diabetes, which was one of the three uses approved for repaglinide. Novo Nordisk originally submitted a use code for the ‘035 patent limited to treatment of diabetes with repaglinide and metformin. However, after Caraco’s ANDA was filed, Novo Nordisk changed the Orange Book use code associated with the patent to broadly read “a method for improving glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes,” which arguably covered all three approved uses for repaglinide, not just the patented use.</p>
<p>Even though Caraco had previously submitted a section <italic>viii</italic> carve-out to the claimed use, when Novo Nordisk changed the use code, FDA required Caraco to add the repaglinide-metformin indication into the ANDA label, and required Caraco to convert to a Paragraph IV certification, thereby permitting Novo Nordisk to sue Caraco for infringement of the ‘038 patent.</p>
<p>In essence, Novo Nordisk was using the use code narrative as a device with which to entrap the generic into inducing infringement by forcing the ANDA to adopt a product label that included the patented use.</p>
<p>However, the issue in the Federal Circuit and Supreme Court cases was not whether Novo Nordisk’s use code narrative was accurate. Instead, the issue was whether Caraco could file a counterclaim against Novo Nordisk to try to require them to correct the use code.</p>
<p>For purposes of the present article, the important take-away is in the Supreme Court’s decision. They held that it is a proper use of the counterclaim statute to seek correction of a use code narrative that is alleged to be incorrect. In doing so, they gave the generic the right (denied by the Federal Circuit prior to the Supreme Court decision<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-1741134312456693">19</xref></sup>) to challenge efforts by the NDA holder to force the generic to unwillingly adopt an infringing label.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-1741134312456693"><title>Bayer v. Lupin<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-1741134312456693">20</xref></sup> and whether a patented use is an approved use</title>
<p>In <italic>Warner-Lambert</italic> and <italic>Allergan</italic>, discussed in the section ‘Indirect infringement and the generic product label’, above, it was clear that the patents at issue claimed only uses not approved by FDA. In <italic>Caraco</italic>, discussed in the previous section, above, it was clear that the patent at issue claimed one of three uses approved by FDA. However, it is not always so clear when a patent does or does not claim a use that is approved by FDA. <italic>Bayer v. Lupin</italic> is the first appellate-level case the author is aware of to address this question head-on.</p>
<p>The product at issue was Yasmin®, an oral contraceptive comprising drospirenone and ethinyl estradiol. Bayer’s patent at issue, U.S. Patent No. 5,569,652, claimed use of drospirenone (under the name dihydrospirorenone) to simultaneously achieve three effects: a gestagenic effect (contraceptive); an antiandrogenic effect (for acne); and an anti-aldosterone effect (diuretic).</p>
<p>The label for the branded product mentioned all three of these effects in different places. The Indications and Usage section only indicated that Yasmin® was approved as a contraceptive. However, in the Pharmacodynamics subsection of the Clinical Pharmacology section of the label, it was stated that drospirenone has antimineralocorticoid activity. Though not mentioned on the label, it was apparently accepted in the case that this activity correlates with anti-aldosterone activity. With regard to the antiandrogenic effect, that same section of the label indicated that pre-clinical (animal) studies have shown drospirenone to have antiandrogenic activity.</p>
<p>These disclosures in the Yasmin® product label were what Bayer relied on to argue that FDA approved Yasmin® for all three indications. Because the generic label must copy this information, Bayer’s position was that the generics would thereby induce infringement of the ‘652 patent.</p>
<p>Lupin argued that FDA only approved Yasmin® as a contraceptive, as evidenced by the Indications and Usage section of the Yasmin® label.</p>
<p>The Federal Circuit held that only those uses that FDA has reviewed for safety and efficacy can be considered “approved uses.” It is clear that the uses listed in the Indications and Usage section meet this criterion.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-1741134312456693">21</xref></sup> while the court apparently acknowledged that uses reviewed for safety and efficacy do not necessarily have to appear in the Indications and Usage section,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-1741134312456693">22</xref></sup> the Court held that the brief comments in the label on antiandrogenic and anti-aldosterone effects do not rise to the level of FDA review of safety and efficacy for those indications. Indeed, the decision noted that the Dosage and Administration section of the label discussed dosaging for contraception, but not for the other two effects, re-enforcing their conclusion that that FDA did not review those other two uses for safety and efficacy.</p>
<p>Accordingly, the Federal Circuit held that the ‘652 patent did not claim an approved use of Yasmin®, which made this case fall squarely within the purview of <italic>Warner-Lambert</italic> and <italic>Allergan</italic>. The Court accordingly held that the label of Lupin’s ANDA would not induce infringement of the ‘652 patent.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-1741134312456693"><title>Conclusions</title>
<p>It has to be understood that there is a difference between practicing what is recited in a patent claim, and infringing the claim. To practice what is in a claim simply requires doing what the claim recites. Infringement, however, is a legal determination that the claim was practiced under such circumstances that someone (e.g., the practicer or a third party) should be held liable to the patent owner. Though often assumed to be the same, these two concepts are actually quite distinct from each other.</p>
<p>Especially with regard to patents claiming methods of using drugs, it is not enough for a patent owner simply to show that someone, somewhere might conceivably infringe the patent. In order to find that the generic is an indirect infringer, the patent owner must establish additional facts necessary to impute responsibility for the patient’s infringement to the generic company. As the cases discussed above amply demonstrate, in this analysis, the product label will often be determinative.</p>
