<abstract>
<p>Theories of concepts address systematically and productively structured thought. Until the Unified Conceptual Space Theory (UCST), based on Peter Gärdenfors’ Conceptual Spaces Theory, no one had attempted to offer an explicitly <italic>enactive</italic> theory of concepts. UCST is set apart from its competitors in locating concepts not in the mind (or brain) of the conceptual agent nor in the affordances of the agent’s environment but in the interaction between the two. On the UCST account, concepts are never truly static: conceptual knowledge is always in the process of being “brought forth”, such that neither agent nor environment can cleanly be separated from the other, and the preconceptual noumena cannot be reconstructed free of conceptual taint. Through such conceptual coloring, mind extends into the world. Concepts create binary distinctions – beginning, most importantly, with the self/non-self distinction – and discrete entities that mask what are, with respect to the conceptual framework, underlying continua. These distinctions – implying notions of e.g. internal and external, inner experience and outer world – are both conceptually necessary and, at the same time, lacking prior ontological status. They are meaningful only with respect to some identifiable observer (which could, in appropriate circumstances, be the organism itself). In consequence, phenomenology has a key role to play, and first-person methods are indispensable to any empirical investigation of concepts.</p>

<title>1.1 Concepts</title>
<p>Concepts<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1059712313482803">1</xref></sup> allow the conceptual agent to <italic>step back</italic> from the present moment to then <italic>engage</italic> with the present moment in a distinctively conceptual way. I will take a concept to be a unit of structured thought – or the ability to structure one’s thought in a certain way (I take the two formulations to be essentially equivalent)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1059712313482803">2</xref></sup> – so that the resulting thoughts are:</p>
<list id="list1-1059712313482803" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p><bold><italic>systematic</italic></bold>: what is substantively the same concept can be applied in substantively the same way across unboundedly many contexts;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><bold><italic>productive</italic></bold>: a finite number of concepts can be used to create an unbounded number of complex concepts and (at least in the case of linguistic agents) propositions;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><bold><italic>compositional</italic></bold>: concepts fit together in reasonably reliably predictable ways to form complex concepts, and at least certain concepts can be decomposed into component concepts;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><bold><italic>spontaneous</italic></bold> (in the Kantian sense): concepts are somehow actively under the agent’s own control; and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><bold><italic>subject to revision</italic></bold>: what is substantively the same concept can be applied in substantively the same way across unboundedly many contexts precisely <italic>because</italic> of its ability to adapt to each new context.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The first two fall out directly from Gareth Evans’<italic>generality constraint</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1059712313482803">Evans, 1982</xref>, pp. 100–104), subscribed to by most (although by no means all<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1059712313482803">3</xref></sup>) researchers in this area; this third is strongly implied by the first two. The fourth – what Jesse Prinz (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1059712313482803">Prinz, 2004</xref>, p. 97) calls <italic>endogenous control</italic> – is likewise uncontroversial. The fifth is anathema to, e.g., Jerry Fodor and his <italic>informational atomism</italic> theory of concepts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1059712313482803">Fodor, 1998</xref>) but is standardly assumed by prototype and prototype-inspired theorists and, indeed, anyone who takes beliefs to be partly constitutive of concepts (rather than only – as Fodor would have it, the other way around). What I have notably left out – even though, in earlier writings, I have included it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1059712313482803">Chrisley &amp; Parthemore, 2007</xref>) – is articulability; precisely because I want to side with the so-called <italic>animal concepts</italic> philosophers (see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1059712313482803">Newen and Bartels (2007)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1059712313482803">Allen (1999)</xref>) in holding that, although language transforms and extends our conceptual abilities, it does not make them possible in the first place. Like them, I take the empirical evidence to be overwhelming that, in a number of cases, non-linguistic species do exhibit conceptually structured thought in the sense of the five criteria above.</p>
<p>Two traditions have historically been dominant in discussions over concepts. The first is so-called <italic>classical definitionism</italic>, by which concepts are like entries in a dictionary; in technical terms, their specification provides the necessary and sufficient conditions for their appropriate application.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1059712313482803">4</xref></sup> Concepts are, paradigmatically, symbolic representations. The second is <italic>classical imagism</italic>, by which concepts are (like) pictures in the mind, and the paradigmatic concepts are not symbolic but <italic>iconic</italic> representations. The former is more aligned with the rationalist tradition, the latter the empiricist. In contemporary times, these begat, on the rationalist side, Fodor’s aforementioned <italic>informational atomism</italic> theory, by which concepts are physical symbols in the brain (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1059712313482803">Newell 1980</xref>) that track mind-independent entities in the world; and, on the empiricist side, Prinz’s <italic>proxytypes</italic> theory, by which concepts are like scale models, playing out their assigned roles in mental simulations. Meanwhile – in contrast to either of these representation-rich approaches – concepts, on Ruth Millikan’s teleological account (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1059712313482803">Millikan, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1059712313482803">2010</xref>), are not representations at all but <italic>abilities</italic> to form representations;<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1059712313482803">5</xref></sup> and Millikan clearly eschews representationalist language in her writings.</p>
<p>To an enactivist philosopher, all of these accounts suffer from a number of crucial shortcomings. Be the approach representationalist (<italic>per</italic> Fodor or Prinz), non-representationalist (<italic>per</italic> Millikan), or explicitly anti-representationalist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1059712313482803">Brooks, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1059712313482803">Perry, 1986</xref>), concepts are still basically “in the head”. They are detachable, in principle and in practice, from a given agent’s interaction with its environment: i.e., they work just fine “off line”. They are either not subject to revision at all (<italic>per</italic> Fodor) or, nevertheless, highly stable: subject only, at most, to incremental change.</p>

<title>1.2 Enaction</title>
<p>In contrast to the dominant rationalist or empiricist traditions – and with more than a passing nod to Edmund Husserl’s phenomenology – enactive philosophy emphasizes the way in which living agents actively create the worlds they experience. One of the founders of enactivism, Humberto Maturana, writes:<disp-quote>
<p>“I have proposed using the term enactive to… evoke the idea that what is known is brought forth, in contraposition to the more classical views of either cognitivism or connectionism”. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1059712313482803">Maturana &amp; Varela, 1992</xref>, p. 255)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Cognition is not brain bound; Evan Thompson writes:<disp-quote>
<p>“The roots of mental life lie not simply in the brain, but ramify through the body and environment. Our mental lives involve our body and the world beyond the surface membrane of our organism, and so cannot be reduced simply to brain processes inside the head.” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1059712313482803">Thompson, 2007</xref>, p. ix)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>In one stroke, any reductionist or straightforward emergentist account of the relation between mind and brain is rejected. Although importantly related, enaction should not be confused or conflated with the twin notions of <italic>embeddedness</italic> (or <italic>situatedness</italic>): the way an agent is located always in a particular spatiotemporal context, with which it substantively interacts; and <italic>embodiment</italic>: the way an agent takes a specific physical form that constrains its interactions with its environment. Enaction goes beyond embeddedness and embodiment by:</p>
<list id="list2-1059712313482803" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>understanding cognition as a <italic>lived</italic>, dynamic process logically grounded in an organism’s <italic>skillful activity;</italic></p></list-item>
<list-item><p>typically perceiving continuities as underlying that which appears individuable and discrete: most notably, the continuity between agent and environment, such that each brings the other forth and the agent’s mental life extends, in a meaningful way, into the world;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>taking an agent/environment, internal/external distinction to be both conceptually mandated and, at the same time, meaningful <italic>only with respect to an observer</italic>, and not to the organism itself, independent of some identifiable observer; so Maturana writes: “everything that is said, is said by an observer to another observer that could be himself” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1059712313482803">Maturana, 1978</xref>, p. 30);<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1059712313482803">6</xref></sup> and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>giving a foundational role to phenomenology <italic>qua</italic> Husserl and emphasizing the essential contribution to be made by first-person methods (see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1059712313482803">Varela and Shear (1999)</xref>).</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Closely related to the concept of enaction is that of <italic>autopoiesis</italic>, which offers an alternative description of what qualifies as a living organism in terms of <italic>operational</italic> and <italic>organizational closure</italic> (the dynamics of the system are produced from within the system; anything external to the system can play only the role of catalyst: organisms are “continually self-producing” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1059712313482803">Maturana &amp; Varela, 1992</xref>, p. 43)), a high degree of <italic>autonomy</italic> (“endogenous, self-organizing, and self-controlling dynamics… determines the cognitive domain in which it operates” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1059712313482803">Thompson, 2007</xref>, p. 43)), and <italic>adaptivity</italic> (the ability to adapt oneself to one’s environment and one’s environment to oneself: see especially <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1059712313482803">Di Paolo (2005)</xref>). An enactive agent is necessarily a living agent, but there is no a <italic>priori</italic> reason it must be alive in the traditional biologically evolved sense.</p>

<title>2 Concepts and enaction</title>
<p>Given my interest in concepts, I can take that a step further: a conceptual agent is necessarily a conscious (though not necessarily self-conscious) agent,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1059712313482803">7</xref></sup> where conscious presupposes enactive and enactive presupposes living. My direct inspiration here is Jordan Zlatev’s <italic>semiotic hierarchy</italic> of dependencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1059712313482803">Zlatev, 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1059712313482803">2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1059712313482803">2001</xref>). After all, concepts are meant to be under the agent’s endogenous control, and that is only possible if the agent is at least implicitly aware of them. Meanwhile, consciousness presupposes cognition and cognition – if the enactive perspective is right – presupposes life (indeed, on some accounts – e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1059712313482803">Stewart (1995)</xref> – is co-extensive with it).</p>
<p>Let me be clear: I am not attempting in this paper to offer a theory of consciousness, let alone cognition. I am to a large extent bracketing concepts from consciousness or, more broadly, cognition: something that the very enactive philosophy I embrace, with its holistic tendencies, warns against. At the same time, I do so to make the present project workable. Cognition is a huge area, philosophically or empirically, on which volumes are written; opinion ranges from those like John Stewart who find cognition in the simplest of organisms to those who, in the footsteps of Descartes, consider non-human species to be machine-like automata possessing nothing like a mind (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1059712313482803">Davidson (1987)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1059712313482803">Torey (2009)</xref>).</p>
<p>The relationship between concepts and consciousness I discuss elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1059712313482803">Parthemore &amp; Whitby, 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1059712313482803">2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1059712313482803">Parthemore, 2011a</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1059712313482803">8</xref></sup> It should be apparent that, given my approach to concepts, I see theories of concepts and theories of consciousness as closely intertwined; it is difficult to imagine offering a theory of consciousness that does <italic>not</italic> address the conceptually structured nature of that consciousness: for no one, it seems (excepting perhaps the panpsychists),<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1059712313482803">9</xref></sup> would deny that conscious thought is so structured. The omission of discussion of concepts from much of consciousness studies might seem like a significant omission.</p>
<p>So, without recapitulating Zlatev’s arguments or spelling out their precise relation to consciousness or cognition, concepts sit on a hierarchy of dependencies. At the same time, <italic>pace</italic> Donald Davidson, Zoltan Torey, Wilfred Sellars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1059712313482803">Sellars, 1956</xref>), John McDowell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1059712313482803">McDowell, 1996</xref>) and others, there is no obvious reason why concepts require language. As Merlin Donald writes, “humans are undoubtedly unique in their spontaneous invention of language and symbols; but, as I have argued elsewhere<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1059712313482803">10</xref></sup>, our special advantage is more on the conceptual side of the ledger. Animals know much more than they can express” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1059712313482803">Donald, 1998</xref>, p. 185).</p>
<p>Before describing the <italic>Unified Conceptual Space Theory</italic> as a distinctly and explicitly enactive theory of concepts – to the best of my knowledge, the first such effort to do so – I need to say something about the <italic>Conceptual Spaces Theory</italic> (CST) on which it is built.</p>
<sec id="section5-1059712313482803">
<title>2.1 Conceptual Spaces Theory</title>
<p>Peter Gärdenfors’ CST (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1059712313482803">Gärdenfors, 2004</xref>) is a similarity-space-based theory of concepts: by which I mean that the closer two concepts are located within a given conceptual “space”, the more similar they are judged to be. One creates a space by specifying the <italic>integral dimensions</italic> for that space along with a metric for each dimension.</p>
<p>CST owes particular debt to the prototype theories developed by Eleanor Rosch starting in the 1970s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1059712313482803">Rosch, 1975</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1059712313482803">1999</xref>). Drawing richly on the language of geometry, it pictures concepts as convex sub-regions of conceptual spaces (or associated sets of such sub-regions across different spaces, representing different domains), whose dimensions are precisely the integral dimensions for that space: i.e., the properties that collectively define the space (as hue, saturation, and brightness do for colour). The progressive carving up of a domain into its constituent concepts and sub-concepts imposes a <italic>Voronoi tessellation</italic> on the space – an example of which is given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1059712313482803">Figure 1</xref>, from a mind-mapping software tool written for my doctoral thesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1059712313482803">Parthemore, 2011a</xref>). Note how all of the cells are (as the Voronoi tessellation requires!) convex.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1059712313482803-fig1.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>CST is not at any point explicitly enactive; however, it is – as Gärdenfors himself notes<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1059712313482803">11</xref></sup> – amenable to an enactivist interpretation:</p>
<list id="list3-1059712313482803" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>concepts are intrinsically dynamic entities, arising and adapting continuously as the agent engages with its environment;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>the process of progressively carving up a domain into concepts and sub-concepts – in technical terms, the imposition of a Voronoi tessellation – imposes sharp boundaries on what are, from a conceptual point of view,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1059712313482803">12</xref></sup> underlying continua: cf. the phenomenon of <italic>categorical perception</italic>, described e.g. by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1059712313482803">Gärdenfors and Williams (2001)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1059712313482803">Harnad (1990)</xref>;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>concepts are never free-floating entities but are always concepts <italic>for a particular agent</italic>, who comes with her own perspectival biases – probably reflective of Gärdenfors’ metaphysical anti-realism;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Husserl may receive scant mention, but experience is – as it was for Husserl – taken as foundational.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>At the same time CST is – in light of the discomfort if not open hostility of many in the enactive community toward talk of representations (especially so-called <italic>mental</italic> or <italic>internal representations</italic>) – somewhat unfortunately loose with the representational talk. I shall say something about how I think the term “representation” should be used a little later on.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1059712313482803">
<title>2.2 Unified Conceptual Spaces Theory</title>
<p>The UCST, as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1059712313482803">Parthemore and Morse (2010)</xref>; Parthemore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1059712313482803">2011b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1059712313482803">2011a</xref>), is an attempt to fill in some of the self-acknowledged gaps in CST, at the same time pushing it in a more algorithmically amenable (and, therefore, potentially empirically testable) direction. It purports to describe how all of an individual conceptual agent’s many conceptual spaces map or weave together into a single unified space<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1059712313482803">13</xref></sup> – and, by extension, how all of the individual conceptual agents’ unified spaces map together, at least in linguistic human society, into a single, common unified space of the society. In either case, that unified space constitutes a “space of spaces” describable along certain common axes, to wit:</p>
<list id="list4-1059712313482803" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>an <italic>axis of generalization</italic> that reprises the familiar concept hierarchy: e.g., a poodle is a dog is a mammal is an animal is an organism is a something;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>an <italic>axis of abstraction</italic> from “zeroth-order concepts” (non-concepts) through first- (concepts of non-concepts) to higher-order concepts: from maximally concrete to maximally abstract (albeit in a different fashion from the axis of generalization);<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-1059712313482803">14</xref></sup> and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>an <italic>axis of alternatives</italic> derived from incrementing/decrementing the value of any one or more of the integral dimensions of a given concept.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>It should be clear, on some reflection, that all three of these axes are divergent in both directions – noting that each point in the unified space, and so each point along each of these axes, represents a distinguishably different concept. So many concepts can be described relative to multiple concept hierarchies (e.g. a person as a biological organism versus a person as a cognitive entity); many if not most “zeroth-order concepts” can give rise to multiple first- and higher-order concepts (e.g. the celestial body that is the planet Venus<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-1059712313482803">15</xref></sup> gives rise to “the Morning Star” and “the Evening Star”; likewise many first- and higher-order concepts can be described relative to multiple lower-order concepts); finally, the axis of abstraction will be divergent wherever a given concept is defined according to more than one integral dimension (colour can be adjusted according to any combination of hue, saturation, and brightness). In this way, a given space – relative to a particular instantiation of a particular concept – opens up into multiple, parallel spaces within an overall unified (hyper)space. In implicitly navigating this (hyper)space, the conceptual agent toggles constantly (if unconsciously) between two competing perspectives on that space: one whereby any given concept is a partially reified entity (paradigmatically noun-like; viewed this way, concepts are the building blocks of structured thought); the other whereby that same concept is a fluid process (paradigmatically verb-like; viewed this way, concepts are more like abilities to think structured thoughts). Viewing one and the same concept simultaneously from both perspectives would be – for most people at least – like seeing the same object as simultaneously red and green.</p>
<p>In addition to proximal connections along the three axes, concepts are connected to distal points of the unified (hyper)space in three possible ways:</p>
<list id="list5-1059712313482803" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>some things conceptually bear a mereological (part–whole) relation to other things: e.g., the head is a part of the body of an animal; I call these <italic>component</italic> relations;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>some things are, conceptually speaking, properties of other things (i.e., they constitute one of the integral dimensions for other concepts): e.g., colour is a property of certain perceived (non-transparent or not fully transparent) surfaces; I call these <italic>parameter</italic> relations;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>all things exist, somehow and somewhere, in the context of other things:<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-1059712313482803">16</xref></sup> the presence of one thing is commonly associated with the presence of others so that e.g. sand is commonly associated with beaches; I call these <italic>contextual</italic> relations.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Take the colour space: in CST, it is one among many conceptual spaces, with no specification of how it relates to those other spaces except in terms of its common internal structure. In UCST, it is a space within the unified space of spaces, proximally connected to such other properties of objects as weight, mass, density, and texture and distally connected both to its integral dimensions of hue, saturation, and brightness, and to those objects (and non-objects: i.e., light) to which, as a property, it applies.</p>
<p>All concepts are derived from a small set of proto-conceptual entities, consisting of proto-object, proto-event, and proto-property. These proto-concepts are not true concepts because they fail to meet all of the desiderata I listed earlier; most notably, they are not under the agent’s endogenous control (being, by one means or another, innate<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-1059712313482803">17</xref></sup>), and they are too few in number to be productive.</p>
<p>Unlike CST, UCST is explicitly enactive: concepts (along with conceptual spaces, and the unified space itself) are located not <italic>in</italic> the agent nor <italic>in</italic> the environment but arise <italic>out of</italic> the interaction of agent and environment: a formulation which, I believe, Gärdenfors would be amenable to, but does not, as said, explicitly endorse. Because that interaction is dynamic, the concepts themselves must be as well: never truly static, their apparent stability belies continuous underlying motion and change – if often only incremental. Concepts are continually in a process of being <italic>brought forth</italic>.</p>
<p>In keeping with the child development literature, UCST holds the self/other – self/non-self – self/world distinction to be foundational to all the other conceptual distinctions that a conceptual agent comes to make (see e.g. the discussion of Zachar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1059712313482803">2000</xref>, p. 144 ff.)); at the same time, it maintains that the distinction is ultimately a <italic>conceptual</italic> distinction: one that presupposes an underlying continuum. Indeed, according to UCST, what concepts do in general is to impose categorical boundaries onto what is, from a conceptual point of view, a continuous world; although the world constantly constrains <italic>how</italic> we conceptually carve it up, nevertheless, contra the natural kinds philosophers – I have in mind someone like Brian Ellis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1059712313482803">Ellis, 2005</xref>) – it does not come with pre-existing categories nor joints to carve along. To quote Francesco Varela’s translation of Anotonio Machado’s poem:<disp-quote>

<title>2.3 Enactive caveats</title>
<p>A few caveats are in order. Although it tries to be far more careful with its representational language than CST, nevertheless, UCST lacks the strongly anti-representational bias often found in enactivist circles – particularly amongst so-called radical enactivists (see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1059712313482803">Hutto (2005)</xref>). Indeed, it requires a role for representations, properly understood. Cognition is not just about being in the world but also – critically for human beings – about imagining oneself to step back from the world. It is not just about doing but – again, critically for human beings – about pausing and reflecting and representing.</p>
<p>“Representation”, as I wish to use the term, is a four-place relation involving an agent actively and intentionally using a <italic>something</italic> to stand in place of a <italic>something else</italic> for <italic>someone</italic> (who might be another agent, or might be the agent herself). I take my cue here from Inman Harvey:<disp-quote>
<p>“The underlying assumption of many is that a real world exists independently of any observer; and that symbols are entities that can ‘stand for’ objects in this real world in some abstract and absolute sense. In practice, the role of the observer in the act of representing something is ignored…. The gun I reach for when I hear the word <italic>representation</italic> has this engraved on it: ‘When <italic>P</italic> is used by <italic>Q</italic> to represent <italic>R</italic> to <italic>S, who is</italic> Q <italic>and who is</italic> S’” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1059712313482803">Harvey, 1992</xref>, pp. 5–7)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Note the way he sets up the four-place relation. I actually prefer a <italic>more</italic> restrictive definition of “representation” than Harvey, who is happy to attribute “minimal” representations to some of his artificial-life creations. For me, representations – like concepts – must be under the agent’s endogenous control, which Harvey’s “minimal representations” are not. Neither properly internal nor external to the agent, they are not reified entities of one sort or another but a <italic>perspective</italic> that certain agents are able to take toward the world they encounter. That is to say, it ultimately matters not <italic>where</italic> the representation is located – a painting on the wall or a poem in one’s thoughts – but how the agent views it. Nevertheless, I keep Harvey’s gun close at hand as well: one never knows when one might have to defend oneself!</p>
<p>As a consequence of its modest representationalism, UCST is favorable to the enactivist view of cognition as skillful activity, but only when interpreted sufficiently broadly – at least when it comes to concepts – as to bridge the <italic>knowing that / knowing how</italic> divide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1059712313482803">Ryle, 1949</xref>). Concepts sit between <italic>knowledge that</italic> and <italic>knowledge how</italic>, beholden to neither (an idea that, again, finds echoes in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1059712313482803">Gärdenfors (2004)</xref>). (Contrast this with Dan Hutto’s own commitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1059712313482803">Hutto, 2005</xref>), along with the radical enactivists, to founding cognition in <italic>knowing how</italic>.)</p>
<p>UCST sees cognition as dependent on – though, <italic>contra</italic> e.g. John Stewart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1059712313482803">Stewart, 1995</xref>), not necessarily equivalent to – life. That makes conceptual agency likewise dependent on life. At the same time, it borrows a page from autopoiesis in wishing to avoid any overly narrow biological view on life as “naturally” evolved. UCST leaves open the possibility that cognition, as we currently understand it, and life, as we currently understand it, <italic>could</italic> pull apart; while making it dependent on someone who thinks they <italic>can</italic> pull apart to show <italic>how</italic>.</p>
<p>Some enactivists are inclined to “solve” cognition bottom up: from simple to complex, from concrete to abstract, from “mere” associations to meaning-rich symbols. UCST is committed to the necessity of combining bottom-up with top-down approaches. For all of the unresolvable tension between the two approaches, UCST insists that neither can be given ultimate priority – in no small part because of our inability, as researchers, to set our intellectual, reason-driven, representation-rich, conceptually structured nature aside. The non-representational <italic>must</italic>, seemingly, logically be prior – on this point, the radical enactivists are right; but the representational is conceptually prior: wherever we look for them, representations (as I define them) are there.</p>

<title>3 Enactive consequences</title>
<p>As should be clear by now, taking an enactive perspective on concepts has, if I am at all right, a number of fundamental consequences; among other things, the stability of concepts is ultimately illusory, and the claim that concepts are ever timelessly fixed is wrong: concepts are intrinsically temporal entities. Beginning with the self/other – self/non-self – self/world distinction, concepts create binary distinctions and discrete entities out of what were continuities. These distinctions – implying notions of e.g. inner experience and outer world, internal thoughts and external actions – are both conceptually obligatory and, at the same time, not committed to any particular prior ontology. Furthermore, they shift over time or, sometimes, dissolve altogether as the conceptual agent lays down a path in walking. They are implicitly “meaningful” to any agent possessing and employing them non-reflectively but explicitly meaningful only with respect to an observer, and not to the organism independent of some identifiable observer. Phenomenology has a key role to play, and first-person methods are indispensable to any empirical investigation of concepts: a project to which I, for one, am committed – with several grant applications based on UCST and its associated mind-mapping application in development.</p>
<p>One of the most exciting consequences, to me, lies in how one thinks about that very foundational self/other – self/non-self – self/world distinction: that cornerstone of the conceptual worlds in which we all find ourselves. Some look at it and see a very clear, very well-defined boundary, whereby mind is strictly bound to body if not in fact to brain. I have in mind such people as Robert Rupert (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1059712313482803">Rupert, 2009b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1059712313482803">2009a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1059712313482803">2004</xref>) and Frederick Adams and Kenneth Aizawa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1059712313482803">Adams &amp; Aizawa, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1059712313482803">2001</xref>), all strident critics of the so-called <italic>extended-mind hypothesis</italic>: the idea, put forward by David Chalmers and Andy Clark (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1059712313482803">Clark &amp; Chalmers, 1998</xref>), that mind extends in substantive ways into the world.</p>
<p>I happen not to think much of the Otto/Inga thought experiment that motivated much of Chalmers and Clark’s original paper. Indeed, I agree with Rupert that, if Otto <italic>does</italic> represent a case of extended cognition, it either is so unusual as not to say much about cognition in general; or it risks over-generalizing, so that <italic>everything</italic> becomes cognitive. Far better, to my thinking, is the argument Clark puts forward at one point in <italic>Supersizing the Mind</italic>:<disp-quote>
<p>“[Profoundly embodied] agents are able constantly to negotiate and renegotiate the agent-world boundary itself. Although our own capacity for such renegotiation is, I believe, vastly underappreciated, it really should come as no great surprise, given the facts of biological bodily growth and change.” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1059712313482803">Clark, 2008</xref>, p. 34)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>As I argued in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1059712313482803">Parthemore (2011b)</xref>, the critics of extended mind are all committed to a well-defined and fixed boundary: one that can be determined untendentiously by empirical investigation, if it has not sufficiently been already. All the extended-mind proponent needs to do is show – not that the boundary between self and world does not exist – but that there are strong reasons to think it is flexible. If it is flexible <italic>enough</italic>, then the extended-mind proponent has proven her point.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, many if not most enactivist philosophers speak highly of the extended mind hypothesis. The often heard complaint is that the extended mind hypothesis <italic>does not go far enough</italic>, leaving much of cognition trapped in the head, cut off in some way from its environment. Much of Clark’s language, in particular, is strikingly in keeping with older, input-output-oriented, “cognitivist” ways of understanding cognition that most enactivist philosophers – including myself – think should best be left behind.</p>
<p>Remember that UCST holds the distinction between self and world to be, at heart, a conceptual and not a prior ontological one. Remember, too, that, on the UCST account, it is in the nature of <italic>all</italic> conceptual boundaries to be flexible and re-negotiable (albeit some more, and more visibly and easily, than others).</p>
<p>Here lies the heart of the UCST argument for extended mind. Consider that, if anything bears the “mark of the cognitive” (Adams and Aizawa’s pet phrase for determining where mind stops and world begins), concepts do. Experience gives rise to concepts; but – as I argued in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1059712313482803">Parthemore and Morse (2010)</xref> – concepts in turn structure experience, including all of the experience that gives rise to further concepts. The resulting model of causality is not linear but circular. Concepts and experience are brought forth from their interaction, just as agent and environment are brought forth from their interaction – such that neither can cleanly be separated from the other. If this view on things is right, then the preconceptual noumena – to borrow a page from Immanuel Kant – cannot be reconstructed free of conceptual taint: by which I mean, neither preconceptual agent nor preconceptual world.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-1059712313482803">18</xref></sup> Conceptual residue is <italic>there</italic>, wherever one looks in the lifeworld, because it is through our concepts that we apprehend the lifeworld. Through such conceptual coloring, mind extends in a meaningful and substantive way into the world.</p>
</sec>

<title>4 Conclusions</title>
<p>According to UCST, concepts are neither <italic>in</italic> the agent nor <italic>in</italic> the environment. In as much as concepts are located anywhere, they are “in” the interaction of agent and environment. Like enactivist approaches in general, UCST seeks to avoid what it sees as the extremes of internalism and externalism. Terms like “inside” and “outside” apply to physical volumes; but mind – although physically realized – is not, itself, a physical volume (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1059712313482803">Parthemore, 2011b</xref>). To say that concepts are in the mind is <italic>not</italic> like saying that neurons are in the brain.</p>
<p>Borrowing a page from Gärdenfors, concepts, according to UCST, sit between “low”- and “high”-level cognition, beholden to neither (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1059712313482803">Parthemore &amp; Morse, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1059712313482803">Parthemore, 2013</xref>). Push them in one direction, and they look more like iconic and symbolic representations; they get bound up with language. Push them the other direction, and they look more like non-representational bundles of associations. Just as concepts sit between levels of cognition, so, too, any account of concepts should complement an account of “low”- and “high”-level cognition. Both bottom-up and top-down methodologies are needed: where they meet and agree with each other, the theories can be considered at least partially vindicated.</p>
<p>UCST is committed to a role for representation(s), properly understood. It requires both a representational (reflective) and non-representational (non-reflective) perspective on concepts for agents who are capable of both. Neither perspective is or can be primary. Concepts are one thing when we stop and look at them; they are logically another when we get on with possessing and employing them non-reflectively. Yet, the moment we reflect on our possessing and employing them non-reflectively, they become representational.</p>
<p>To the best of my knowledge, UCST marks the first explicit attempt to offer an enactive theory of concepts drawing on the many lessons of the enactivist tradition. In contrast to the essentially skeletal structure of CST – on which point CST is refreshingly honest,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-1059712313482803">19</xref></sup> it offers an algorithmically detailed framework for specifying concepts as they evolve.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-1059712313482803">20</xref></sup> At the same time, UCST is committed, by the metaphysical stance it takes, to the view that there is no <italic>one</italic> “right” theory of concepts: that would require stepping outside one’s conceptual framework; something that, UCST argues, one can never do. Rather, a theory of concepts is particular to the questions one is asking and the applications to which one hopes to put the answers.</p>
<p>A parting thought: sciences of concepts – like sciences of consciousness – remind us of what we should have remembered all along: that the observer is always present, when we look for her; that the subjective is inseparably bound up with the objective; that science yields up not timeless understandings freed from cultural and historical contexts but working hypotheses. It is not only the mind that we cannot know fully and consistently, but the world.</p>

<p>Nothing of what I say about concepts directly addresses the neurological structures that – at least in part (cf. the extended-mind hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1059712313482803">Clark &amp; Chalmers, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1059712313482803">Clark, 2008</xref>)) – underlie them; even as it attempts not to contravene that which neuroscience has to say untendentiously about so-called higher-level cognition. Indeed, as the subsequent discussion will make clear, I believe that an enactive account of concepts rejects both a reductionist account such as mind/brain equivalency or any emergentist account whereby higher-level cognition emerges straightforwardly and so reconstructably from lower-level brain processes. I argue instead for the necessity of combining bottom-up approaches – such as neuroscience generally favours – with top-down ones.</p>

<p>Classical definitionist accounts tended to conflate conditions for appropriately identifying or employing concepts with the ultimate ontological nature of concepts: i.e., “how they are implemented”.

<p>Maturana’s point I believe, and mine certainly, is not that these distinctions have no prior ontological basis – to the contrary – but that they are <italic>conceptual</italic> distinctions, not prior ontological ones. Conceptual distinctions can only be made by certain sorts of agents – namely, conceptual ones – capable of taking on the role of observer and being at least implicitly aware of doing so. <italic>Pace</italic> the natural kinds philosophers, they impose categorical divisions onto what are, with respect to the conceptual frameworks, pre-existing continua – without requiring any assumptions about the ultimate ontological basis of reality, other than it exists and constantly constrains their formation and development (to borrow a Kantian formulation). Putting this another way, meaning-making is a conceptual ability; there is no reason to think that a bacterium’s cell wall is meaningful, in any strict sense, to the bacterium itself, even though the cell wall is critical to its continued existence.</p>

<p>At the same time, details of that algorithm, along with its empirical application, lie outside the scope of this paper; instead, see Parthemore and Whitby (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1059712313482803">2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1059712313482803">2013</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1059712313482803">Parthemore and Morse (2010)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1059712313482803">Parthemore (2011a)</xref>. As the references show, the algorithm and its software implementation – in the form of a mind-mapping program – continue to evolve, just as they predict any conceptual framework (and any concept within that framework) should continue to evolve. Empirical testing – plans for which are under development using the mind-mapping program – is needed to show whether UCST is on the right track or not.</p>

<title>About the Author</title>
<p><bold>Joel Parthemore</bold>, having successfully defended his doctoral thesis from Sussex University, UK, in March 2011, is in his third year as a postdoctoral researcher for Lund University’s centre for cognitive semiotics, where he works on the ontogenetic and phylogenetic development of conceptually structured thought, on the relationship between conceptually structured thought and language, and on further development of his Unified Conceptual Space Theory of concepts. He considers himself both a philosopher of mind and a philosopher of cognitive science, and has an increasing appreciation for the contribution that semiotics has to make to the story of concepts.</p>
