<abstract>
<p>This article argues that while notions of collective leadership, such as distributed or shared, are nominally more inclusive, barriers to inclusive ways of thinking about and relating to one another will be multi-faceted (past and present) and formidable to change. This argument emanates from a critical review of research literature and an in-depth ethnographic case study of leading teacher leadership in a multi-campus school. From this critical perspective of leadership and change, this article concludes that context must remain intact to the versions of collective leadership put forward. As a consequence, no-one should leave idle ideas about what works, for whom and in what circumstances. To anchor the fieldwork analysis, theories of power and the thinking from those in inclusive education are explored.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>This article draws first on a critical review of school leadership research and then the data produced from an in-depth ethnographic case study of leading teacher leadership in a multi-campus secondary school (Ebony River College, pseudonym) in Victoria, Australia. There is no universal policy definition in Australia of a multi-campus school or how it is configured in practice. At a superficial level, a multi-campus school can be defined as a school with more than one campus. What prompted this research was local and international policy interest in the notion of ‘distributed leadership’ and the silence about its relations with the concepts of change and power. An aim of the research then was to try and understand the contextual complexities, contradictions and conditions in which contemporary leadership in a multi-campus school is conceived. A further aim was to try and identify and understand how barriers to the practical realization of ‘collective’ forms of leadership, such as ‘distributed’ are being realized at the case study school and engaged with.</p>
<p>The central argument of the article is that while the proposition for collective ideas and practice of leadership in both the literature and fieldwork comments of school leaders (teachers, principal and assistant leaders) may signal change or the need for change, how this comes to life in particular conditions (if at all) is not value or context free.</p>
<p>The literature review and case study research on which this article draws suggests that what constitutes ‘collective leadership’ is also going to be historically, socially and culturally contextualized. These contexts can shore up the survival and advancement of particular leadership conditions, values, beliefs, ideas and practices and can work against transformative change. In this article, such change is encapsulated from the literature review in moral understandings of leadership concerned with struggles over contradictions and conflicts in values, beliefs and the interests of all.</p>
<p>It is for these reasons, and in light of what others have identified as the a-historical nature of much leadership writing and research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1741143212436955">Leo and Barton, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1741143212436955">Richmon and Allison, 2003</xref>), that the focus in this article from the ethnographic study is on the school’s inception and the affects this had on contemporary ideas and practices of leading teacher leadership. A major conclusion from the research was that the way the school was conceived and configured by bureaucrats and school leaders was a factor in laying the foundation for how contemporary leading teachers (a formal position of teacher leadership in Victoria, Australia that is secured based at least an interview, not just a person’s years of service), and in particular those teachers with a cross-college leadership responsibility were defined and configured in practice.</p>

<title>Introduction of Case Study: Ebony River College</title>
<p>Ebony River College became the school context for most of the 2-year fieldwork on which this article draws. Established in the early 1990s this government school has three campuses: two 7–10-year levels (Brindle and Casey Campuses both pseudonyms) and one 11–12-year levels (Airley Campus, also a pseudonym). Formed from five schools in the region, the then new metropolitan college was a combination of technical and high school students and teachers. The campuses were and still are today in different geographic suburb locations. All are within a 10 kilometre radius of each other and this equates to about a 15 minute trip between campuses, depending on traffic. The school is the only multi-campus in the area, but geographically it shares the area with several other government secondary and primary schools and an inordinate number of independent and Catholic schools: all within close proximity to the case study’s campuses.</p>
</sec>

<sec id="section3-1741143212436955">
<title>The Study</title>
<p>Consistent with the purpose and nature of critical ethnographic studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1741143212436955">O'Reilly, 2005</xref>), a number of research processes underpinned the study draw on in this article. Beyond the iterative development of the critical literature review, the fieldwork processes also included the keeping of a research journal prior to and during the 2-year fieldwork period; the research survey cooperation of 32 school leaders from eight Victorian government multi-campus schools (10 principal class: principals and assistant principals—4 female, 6 male; 21 leading teachers—14 female, 7 male; 1 unstated); the interview cooperation of seven education system leaders (2 Victorian and 4 New South Wales education department leaders and 1 Victorian secondary principal association leader); 17 leading teacher (10 female, 7 male); and 8 principal class (3 female, 5 male) leaders from the case study multi-campus school.</p>
<p>The interviews took between 1 and 2 hours and, in several cases, were spread over two sittings. An interview guide and accompanying letter of introduction was developed from the analysis of the pilot and literature review phases of the fieldwork and provided for comment to the school leaders being interviewed prior to the face-to-face interviews. Below are the four areas from the analysis of literature and data from the pilot study phase that formed a suggested focus for the interviews. The letter of introduction stressed to school leaders not to feel constrained by the areas or the order in which they appeared in the guide:</p>
<list list-type="simple">
<list-item>
<p>Area 1—Your own background and view of multi-campus configurations of schooling.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Area 2—What you do as a leading teacher and why.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Area 3—What you perceive supports or hinders your learning and development.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Area 4—How being a leading teacher in a multi-campus school impacts on you.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>A key purpose of the interviews was to learn more about what leading teachers think and do in the context of a multi-campus school setting. The interviews with the campus principals and deputy principals, and college principal used the same guide but sought their views about leading teacher leadership at the college from their perspective as a principal.</p>
<p>In addition to these research processes, two observations in 2007 of whole-school leading teacher meetings were conducted and more than seven field-site visits to discuss the research phases with staff from the school were made. In total, the views from 64 educational leaders were formally sought to inform the development of this study. Prior to the commencement of the study, formal ethics approval from the Victorian Department of Education was sought and granted.</p>
<p>Comments were sorted and thematically analysed following each interview and then comparatively across other interviews and in relation to issues and themes raised in the research literature and pilot survey responses. Iteratively the categories became more abstract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1741143212436955">Liamputtong and Ezzy, 2005</xref>). The qualitative software program NVivo7 assisted with the data management of themes, annotations and exploring new ways to analyse the text, such as the use of the word frequency function of the program. Collectively, these processes allowed the fieldwork comments to be approached from multiple perspectives.</p>

<sec id="section4-1741143212436955">
<title>Theoretical Framework</title>
<p>Taking a critical policy and research analysis of distributed leadership, a key aspect from the case study reported on in this article is the inception of the Ebony River College and the consequences this had on the development of leading teacher concepts and practice. The analysis required a theoretical framework that could cope with the contested and contextual nature of ‘distributed leadership’.</p>
<p>In addition to the school leadership research, inclusive education literature and engagement with theories of power from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1741143212436955">Bourdieu (1990</xref>) were also reviewed. This contrast of topics and sociological framing of the issues of power and change in the literature but with their overlapping themes of inclusion and exclusion helped orientate the analysis to take a relational and reflexive approach to what was and was not being said in the literature and fieldwork analysis. To this end, the simple but compelling questions, ‘Who’s in?’ ‘Who’s out?’ and ‘How come?’ from Slee’s (2006) writing about inclusive education were most instructive. Slee’s questions provided a framework through which to ask about the fundamental principles and assumptions in the research literature and fieldwork upon which ideas and practices of leadership are based. Unlike Slee’s (2006) use of such questions, I am using them in the context of inclusive social and cultural notions of school leadership.</p>
<p>This thinking in fields other than school leadership, such as inclusive education and disability studies offered fresh perspectives to identify and critically examine power and its different manifestations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1741143212436955">Ainscow and West, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1741143212436955">Barton and Slee, 1999</xref>). This could be seen through, for example, categorization, language, voices, silences and the dynamics of its relationship to the concepts of transformative change and leadership.</p>
<p>Bourdieu’s concepts of ‘field’, ‘habitus’ and ‘symbolic power’ were used to help focus the case study research on understandings and forms of power. Bourdieu conceptualizes power as fields of social and cultural struggles. He questions domination through the consequences of the exercise of symbolic power and the ways these are masked and revealed in the deeply structured cultural nature at a society, or institutional level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1741143212436955">Bourdieu, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1741143212436955">Grace, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1741143212436955">Webb et al., 2002</xref>). Bourdieu’s work assisted in the study with the complexities of what is a persuasive assertion in the educational leadership literature that leadership is a contextualized social practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1741143212436955">Blackmore and Sachs, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Language, in this case ‘leadership’, is used as a medium through which to communicate a particular view of the world. It is a view that ‘exerts itself only when a social space or a power is perceived’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1741143212436955">Bourdieu, 1990</xref>: 112–113). Language itself is not power. From a critical perspective, symbolic power raises the stakes in who defines leadership and for what purposes—two key political issues in current debates around the need and purpose of standards for school leadership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1741143212436955">Ingvarson and Anderson, 2007</xref>). Viewed in this way, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1741143212436955">Bourdieu (1990</xref>) asserts that it is the perception and use of language that can bring to life structure as a form of control that may otherwise be present but invisible.</p>
<p>A possible consequence then of symbolic power is that those positioned favourably by the use of it, accept that it legitimizes a cultural norm for their relations with others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1741143212436955">Grace, 2002</xref>). By naming the activities of some as leadership, then by association this suggests that other activities or the activities of some others are <italic>not</italic> leadership. Language then as a form of power can be used as, ‘a battleground and a weapon’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1741143212436955">Webb et al., 2002</xref>: 95): it can legitimize ideas and practice making them less open to challenge and change.</p>
<p>In these circumstances, inclusion is reduced to being taken as ‘good’ and exclusion reduced to being taken as ‘bad’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1741143212436955">Sayed et al., 2003</xref>). This fails to recognize how inclusive and exclusive ideas and practice can simultaneously co-exist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1741143212436955">Gunter and Ribbins, 2003</xref>). This suggests that a more productive analysis of leadership ideas and practice might be to identify and attempt to understand the ways in which people are disadvantaged because of inclusion and exclusion in different conditions.</p>

<title>Literature Review: Challenging Understandings of Collective School Leadership</title>
<p>For some years now, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1741143212436955">Gronn (2003</xref>) puts it, leadership has been in ‘vogue’. But many researchers identify that leadership is a contested domain, defying unitary explanations for the exercise of it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1741143212436955">Fitzgerald, 2003</xref>). Others argue that a focus on leadership is not a recent phenomenon in education but reflects a renaissance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1741143212436955">Grace, 1995</xref>). These views suggest that the concept and practice of leadership is relational and contestable. An issue then for this article, is not to debate whether the concept of leadership is new or that there are numerous ways to conceive it, but to attempt to understand the purpose and nature of leadership in relation to the conditions in which it is conceived and develops. This stance requires, as argued by others, the issue of power to also be addressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1741143212436955">Gronn, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1741143212436955">Hatcher, 2005</xref>). Similar to Bourdieu’s concept of symbolic power, Gronn’s (2003) proposition is that for leadership to retain its conceptual and practical utility, alternative concepts such as distributed leadership should be considered.</p>
<p>While forms of distributed leadership appear to be more inclusive, the basis on which such claims are made is contextual and contestable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1741143212436955">Leo and Barton, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1741143212436955">Shields, 2004</xref>). Viewed from this critical perspective, the focus becomes then to not only critically examine the adding of teachers as leaders in schools, but also to attempt to identify and understand how views about what is ‘in’ and ‘out’ take form in the first place; and how this affects the ways in which people frame and experience leadership.</p>
<sec id="section6-1741143212436955">
<title>Making a Difference</title>
<p>A strong and explicit theme identified in research and policy contexts is that the purpose and nature of leadership is to ‘make a difference’.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1741143212436955">Greenfield (2004</xref>: 174), in his review of how the concept of moral leadership is used in empirical studies of school leadership published from 1979 to 2003, picks up on this idea of ‘making a difference’ through what he argues is moral leadership’s importance and relevance because:<disp-quote>
<p>… the education of the public’s children is by its very nature a moral activity: to what ends and by what means shall public education proceed? … relationships among people are at the very center of the work of school administrators and teachers, and for this reason school leadership is, by its nature and focus, a moral activity …</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>From this perspective, the proposition is made that education and the leadership therein is a moral socially inclusive activity and as such for moral purposes. One view from these kinds of propositions is that public education is socially just and so, provided all those in education hold to that belief, public education will somehow configure itself towards that end. In other words, all barriers to inclusion in all of society (not solely but including education) will be understood and challenged. Another view from these kinds of propositions is that for a morally focused education system to emerge—accepting the proposition of leadership as a socially contextualized joint activity—the relations and commitment of not just one but many are required. But how this understanding of ‘many’ has been conceptualized and practiced over time in school leadership is not a straight forward matter.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1741143212436955">
<title>Who’s in? Who’s out? How Come?</title>
<p>Few would dispute that at the very least the rhetoric of the heroic, solo (usually male) leader, leading and leadership has been usurped by the language of collective leadership, such as distributed and shared.</p>
<p>But situating leadership concepts in Australia’s social and cultural history, Amanda <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1741143212436955">Sinclair (2004</xref>: 9) writes:<disp-quote>
<p>… the archetype is of the lone frontier settler who is stoic but resolute in the face of hardship. Such an image renders improbable a garrulous, emotionally expressive or more collectively oriented leader—women and many migrants from more group-based societies instantly struggle to earn respect in this context.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Against entrenched ‘archetypes’ of leadership in society, new forms and ways of doing leadership must struggle. Similar to this culturally and socially inclusive image of leadership from Sinclair, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1741143212436955">Grace (1995</xref>: 59) also asserts in his critical analysis of school leadership that:<disp-quote>
<p>… the authoritarian legacy of English school headship has to recognize that it is dealing with a strong historical formation that will not easily yield to notions of real participatory democracy as opposed to its rhetorical endorsement.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>While expressed in different ways, central to the comments from Sinclair and Grace is the importance to question the basis on which contemporary ‘collective’ notions of leadership are based. Their comments warn against underestimating the effect of conditions—historical, cultural and social—suggesting that these can work against inclusive notions of leadership beyond the rhetoric coming to life. Along with questioning, their comments suggest that the hallmarks of such inclusive notions are the values and valuing of diversity and difference. What Sinclair’s analysis does highlight, however, is the subtle ways in which ideas and processes of leadership may mute or perpetuate the existence of unjust social relations. Giving over then to a belief in a ‘collective effort’, as suggested by some interpretations of distributed leadership, is difficult if the culture does not support that norm. As I will expand on later in this paper, the analysis of interviews with 25 school leaders at Ebony River College suggest that while the college and campus principals had in mind a culturally and socially inclusive leadership frame of reference, it was not the only cultural code in circulation.</p>
<p>Elitist thinking and practices incubated in the school’s inception of the ‘flagship’ campus set in motion uneven conditions for contemporary cultural and social relations within the multi-campus school:<disp-quote>
<p>
<italic>Jane:</italic> … the argument is that the VCE [Victorian Certificate of Education] [Airley] campus is the flagship and the junior campuses are feeding off the senior campus and getting enrolments because kids want to come to the senior campus for the breadth of the curriculum.</p>
<p>
<italic>Interviewer:</italic> Where’s that idea coming from?</p>
<p>
<italic>Jane:</italic> That argument is, it’s almost like the universally accepted truth. … I mean, everyone would present that as the VCE campus is the flagship, it’s the reason we established the College, it’s the reason we’re attracting kids and why our junior campuses continue to flourish. … the raison d’être for the others; and so if the VCE campus is facing serious challenges and if that’s the flagship, then are we making the right decisions about where the energy’s being put? … But I think you’ve got three competing sets of interests … does it put its energy into all three places or does it put its energy into one, and how do we make the decision about where the energy is put?</p>
</disp-quote>
The analysis of conditions in which the college was conceived highlights how and why this idea of the senior campus as central to the thinking and practice within the college eventuated. In devolved self governance conditions, of which Victoria is said to be the most advanced, ultimately the problem and solution is said to rest with the leadership of the school. It was a tension not lost in the comments of school leaders as they sought to make decisions about where to place scarce funds. This said, the level of status afforded to the senior Airley (Year 11 and 12) campus over the other campuses suggests that a historical cultural disposition to favour the senior campus was a key pull in thinking and practice, even in the face of values and beliefs to the contrary. The flagship—a nautical term indicating that the admiral is on board—was used to lever the structure and nature of relations in different contexts at the college.</p>
<p>Central to Sinclair’s (2004) critique on leadership is that the ‘archetype’ of leadership becomes itself an obstacle to change, with alternative visions rendered improbable. Leadership conceived in these conditions, as illustrative in the quote from ‘Jane’, means that inequitable effects ‘can be ignored as ‘natural consequences’ or at least transitional phases …’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1741143212436955">Blackmore, 2000</xref>: 28). The message this sends is that inequitable outcomes and processes are ‘okay’, and that contexts can be treated as unproblematic backdrops. Left unchallenged, these sorts of messages permit leadership concepts to become institutionalized and, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1741143212436955">Shields (2004</xref>) notes, as alternative visions for change to become pathologized. In other words, difference is categorized as a deficit to some already instilled ‘mainstream’ idea and practice of leadership. A consequence of this thinking is that change is located as the responsibility of those who are categorized as deficit. This position contrasts to conceptions of leadership from research based on moral values of social inclusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1741143212436955">Leo and Barton, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>A critical analysis of distributed leadership in Ebony River College shows that bringing about change was seen as problematic for those leading teachers who occupied a cross-college leadership role:<disp-quote>
<p>But it makes it difficult for anyone, particularly in curriculum where you’ve got the cross-college responsibility. So it probably didn’t bother a lot of other people and it wouldn’t bother me if I didn’t have to worry about the other two campuses. (Kathy, leading teacher)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>For leading teachers with a cross-college responsibility, who were already pressed for time, differences between the campuses were not seen as resources to be engaged with, but barriers to them doing their job. This meant that when it came to living out the values of the school to be ‘one college’; ‘differences’ in the way curriculum was delivered and assessed were unwelcome hurdles to be overcome for these leaders especially. As I will expand upon later, the notion of ‘who’s in’ when it comes to school leadership from these cross-college teacher leaders’ perspectives is highly contested and contextual.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1741143212436955">
<title>Principal Leaders and Leadership</title>
<p>Historically, research into school leadership has focused predominantly on principal leaders and leadership. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1741143212436955">Spillane et al. (2004</xref>: 4) this focus:<disp-quote>
<p>… reinforced the assumption that school leadership was synonymous with the principal, resulting in researchers for the most part ignoring other sources of leadership in schools.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Consistent with Slee’s (2006) critical framework, introduced earlier, the analysis by Spillane and colleagues serves to challenge the status quo. This opens the possibility for alternative visions of research and school leadership to be conceived and examined in practice.</p>
<p>A number of scholars argue for the need to enlarge and embed issues within a broader context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1741143212436955">Barton and Slee, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1741143212436955">Becker, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1741143212436955">Grace, 2002</xref>). At the time of the fieldwork for the study reported on in this article, similar to scholarly observations in other international contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1741143212436955">Whitty, 2002</xref>), state and national policies were directing the conversation toward the importance of a productivity agenda—earn and learn (Department of Premier and Cabinet, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1741143212436955">2007</xref>) and a social inclusion agenda (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1741143212436955">MCEETYA, 2008</xref>). In this sense, Australia is not immune from policy directions and developments elsewhere, especially in Britain. Through our colonial roots, Australia has often been positioned in the research and policy literature as taking its lead from England (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1741143212436955">Caldwell, 2001</xref>). This meant school principal leaders were expected to lead and manage a school within a complex and contentious set of issues: markets, marketization, equality, equity. New challenges, such as school-based management resulted. With these challenges came consequences for the idea and practice of school leadership.</p>
<p>In the past, few may have questioned the idea that school leadership meant principals and principal leadership. The narrower scope and nature of principals’ work meant demands upon teachers beyond classroom practice in schools were limited. But contemporary policy shifts for greater accountability through performance focused structures and processes, such as standards and high-stakes testing, have changed the conditions and, as researchers question, the purposes for school leadership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1741143212436955">Lingard et al., 2002</xref>). A number of researchers remark that to meet these changing demands for leadership in such conditions the idea and practice of teachers as leaders was brought to the forefront in policy rhetoric (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1741143212436955">Reid et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1741143212436955">Hatcher (2005)</xref> alerts the reader that distributed forms of leadership are not devoid of issues of power. Collaboration, often a taken-for-granted feature of these collective notions of leadership, is still a form of control and therefore subject to rules of engagement. Whether moves to de-monopolize leadership from one source and voice to many equates to the emergence of democracy is a source of critique and debate in the research literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1741143212436955">Gronn, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1741143212436955">Hargreaves and Fink, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1741143212436955">Hartley, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1741143212436955">Hatcher, 2005</xref>; Nguyễn and Maxcy, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1741143212436955">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1741143212436955">Woods, 2010</xref>).</p>

<title>Teacher Leaders and Leadership</title>
<p>One view in the research literature of distributed leadership in action is the establishment of multiple leaders within the school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1741143212436955">Gronn, 2000</xref>). Viewed from this perspective, a function of the principal leader is to ensure the development of leadership density, while simultaneously improving performance of individuals and the school. This appears to be a similar view taken by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1741143212436955">Harris (2008</xref>) in regard to the function of formal teacher leaders in schools. These leaders, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1741143212436955">Harris (2008</xref>: 175) suggests, ‘are the gatekeepers to distributed leadership practice in their schools’. In both views the political purpose, nature and consequence of what ‘developing leadership density’ and ‘gatekeeping’ means in practice is an important and challenging issue.</p>
<p>Others suggest that teachers have always been leaders, pedagogical leaders, but whose capabilities have not been recognized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1741143212436955">Crowther et al. 2002</xref>). From this perspective, a positive effect of positioning teachers as leaders is that it opens the possibility for those who are directly affected by change in education to have a stake in how change is envisaged and enacted. As noted already, this was not a straightforward matter when it came to the complex setting and conditions of Ebony River College for all leading teachers.</p>
<p>A second interpretation of distributed leadership is that of a moral concept reminiscent of understandings of moral leadership embodied by notions of it being a socially just and equitable endeavour. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1741143212436955">Harris (2004</xref>) articulates this as:<disp-quote>
<p>… a shift from one of ‘individual leader agency’ to ‘collective agency’ incorporating the activities of many individuals in a school. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1741143212436955">Harris, 2004</xref>: 14)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Division of labour and not formal roles and relationships appear central to these interpretations of the concept and practice of distributed leadership. While the aggregated concept of distributed leadership does not necessarily presuppose a hierarchal relationship, it is the second interpretation that is said to frame an expectation of challenging excessive individualism and hierarchy. This opens up the possibility for a conviction about the collective good and cements an understanding of leadership as a joint social endeavour. In turn, this led to the elevation of notions of teacher leadership and what it is for (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1741143212436955">Crowther et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1741143212436955">Duignan and Marks, 2003</xref>). Whether teachers even want to be cast as leaders, however, is typically a silence in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1741143212436955">Leo and Barton, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>A key tension for teacher leaders in the research surfaces around issues of responsibility, authority and agency. An explicit effect of these roles on teachers was the introduction of formal authority. As a consequence, new hierarchal relationships were being established or implied. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1741143212436955">Simkins (2005</xref>) concludes, however, that in practice authority depends much more on colleague’s perceptions of the person, their actions and performance as teachers.</p>
<p>Coming back then to Slee’s (2006) framework of: ‘Who’s in?’ ‘Who’s out?’ and ‘How come?’ simplistic decontextualized notions of leadership can suggest or mask that voices are left out of official representations altogether (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1741143212436955">Barton and Armstrong, 1999</xref>). Typically, leadership concepts derive from western ideas and processes of what constitutes effective leadership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1741143212436955">Fitzgerald, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1741143212436955">Walker and Dimmock, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1741143212436955">Duignan and Marks (2003</xref>: 19) raise a complex set of issues and research tasks that in their view demand attention if tensions and understandings of leadership rhetoric and reality are to be addressed:<disp-quote>
<p>… While much is written and spoken about the need for shared leadership in schools, the characteristics of, the context for, and the obstacles to its more complete implementation need to be explored and understood.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>These kinds of observations in the research literature suggested that an important research task is not only to examine leadership within its wider conceptual contexts and conditions, but in doing so, attempt to understand forms of exclusion in the pursuit of more inclusive ways of thinking about and doing leadership. From these observations and suggested research approaches, the notion of ‘what works’ then is one that is deeply contextual, contestable and rooted in the conditions in which concepts and practices of ‘collective’ leadership have developed and are developing. What this led to in the ethnographic case study of leading teacher leadership at Ebony River College was an attempt to understand forms of exclusion in the pursuit of what distributed leadership concepts suggest are more inclusive ways of thinking and doing leadership.</p>

<title>The Inception of Ebony River College: Legacies for Leadership</title>
<p>In the fieldwork for the study, much was made of the complexities of a multi-campus school—physical and cultural distances between campuses—and the challenges this presented to leadership attempts to develop and sustain inclusive relations for all. As the pilot-study revealed, it is rare for all staff in a multi-campus school to only work at one of the campuses. While school leaders at Ebony River College articulated with conviction their belief in being identified in text and talk and practice as ‘one college’, as noted earlier this was not the only belief in circulation within and beyond the campuses. Policy conditions at global, federal and state government levels, in dynamic tandem with those presiding at the time of the college’s inception, brought other beliefs to do with the market and performativity into play. As a consequence, what leadership meant and how it should be practiced was also subject to contradictory values and beliefs about understandings of an effective school.</p>
<p>The configuration of Ebony River College was to introduce a new arena, or as Bourdieu (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1741143212436955">Webb et al., 2002</xref>) frames it, a field of struggle for the cultural and social relations in it. The ‘flagship’ senior campus was a metaphor, albeit expressed in different ways and contexts that was to surface in many interviews with both leading teachers from all campuses and principal class leaders. In relation to students, the senior campus was perceived by leaders as a place to aspire to visiting: ‘the Mecca’ (Mary, principal); and a delayed reward for their time at a junior campus: ‘the pot of gold’ (Ian, leading teacher).</p>
<p>While language itself does not necessarily determine practice, it does contribute to meanings and expectations of whom and what is valued. The passing comment by Jane, a leading teacher, about the college configuration that ‘it works’, made in relation to the initial decision and her perspective on the decision today, was unchallenged by me at the time. But as data for the study was produced, this comment started to take on a new meaning when seen in relation to ‘Jane’s’ professional history (strong ownership for the development of her leading teacher role) and positioning within the college (at the ‘prized location’). As with Jane, those leading teachers with forms of cultural and social capital that made it possible to achieve certain ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1741143212436955">Bourdieu, 1997</xref>) rarely queried the status quo in relation to the organizational and cultural structure of the college.</p>
<p>When the topic of campus relations came up in interviews, which it did frequently (suggesting it was a matter of importance and interest to those interviewed), this tension over what ‘one college’ meant and the type and nature of relations conceived and expected as a consequence, was not far behind. But in practice, the principals (college and campus) more so than leading teachers, with the exception of those with cross-college roles, expressed a greater need and concern for keeping the whole at the forefront:<disp-quote>
<p>Keeping that College ethos at the forefront and not breaking down into campus differences and people want to focus on their campus and forget the College. I could talk about that for a long time … It’s an ongoing tension. (Gary, principal)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>A strategy implemented by the principals (college, campus and assistant principals) to address this problem and a distinctive feature of formal leadership positions within the college was its cross-campus emphasis for many of the positions. Some leading teacher positions were purposefully created to assist with the development of relationships and processes of working together across campuses (for example, curriculum). But as I introduced earlier, inequitable social and cultural conditions can perpetuate when context is treated as an unproblematic backdrop. In the case of cross-college leading teachers’ experiences of leading and managing change, differences in the ways the campuses were led and operated made leading learning across them more challenging. For these cross-campus leading teachers, it brought additional conceptual (for example, how to frame learning opportunities for teachers) and practical (for example, how to get on top of an expanded leadership portfolio) leadership challenges. This meant that when it came to living out the values of one college, especially although not exclusively for these leaders, often ‘difference’ was reconceptualized as a deficit, a problem, a barrier to realizing a conceptualization of ‘collective’.</p>
<p>Leading teachers who had a cross-college responsibility appeared most conflicted in what they envisaged was needed to develop socially inclusive relations focused on learning compared to what they experienced it to be:<disp-quote>
<p>Developing that shared view is a really difficult thing when you don’t necessarily have any working personal relationship with somebody on another site even though, like, I know them, but I don’t really, I’m not working with them. They don’t see me as necessarily a co-learner, which is probably what people on this site would be more inclined to say that I’m in there doing the classroom stuff. I’m working with them I’m trying to develop things. So the people on this site would see me more like that. (Raylene, leading teacher)</p>
<p>… because I teach classes at this campus I don’t exist on the other two campuses or the timetable or, you know, I visit them and things like that but … in terms of understanding how it’s running, it can be really hard to find out what’s going on at the other two campuses and it depends on who the site coordinators are, and just opportunities to meet people … they don’t see me teaching, they don’t see me with the kids. You know, I can share curriculum documents with them, I can … advise them on how to write the reports and assess … it’s just funny, I think your credibility as a teacher stems from what you do in the classroom. (Kathy, leading teacher)</p>
<p>We have the KLA [Key Learning Area] meetings which are two or three a term so you get to see people then; but you don’t get to see them in action. You don’t see them in their classroom and you don’t see them in their student management role. (Natalie, leading teacher)</p>
</disp-quote>
In these cases, Who’s in?’ ‘Who’s out?’ and ‘How come?’ was deeply connected to issues of power. Leading Teacher may be a formal position of leadership and therefore considered ‘in’ when it comes to bringing about change at the college. But as Bourdieu’s (1990) work illuminates, language itself is not power. While it presents a form of symbolic power, this form of power alone falls short of how these Leading Teachers define and configure their understanding of what it means for them to <italic>be</italic> a leader and to <italic>enact</italic> leadership.</p>
<p>As other critical studies of leadership conclude, leadership is a socially contextualized practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1741143212436955">Blackmore and Sachs, 2007</xref>). Testament to this stance was the numerous comments from leading teachers about why their role was so difficult. These cross-college teacher leaders held being ‘seen’ and developing ‘relationships’ over time, and in the context of ‘teaching’ a class as critical non-negotiable features of what being a leader, leading and leadership meant to them in practice. From their perspective, the challenges of leading change rest in a mismatch between what their roles may have specified on paper and how they envisaged it needed to be enacted in practice. The historical contested cultural contexts and conditions of the campuses served to further cement their stance. As one Leading Teacher commented, more time to do their role does not address such concerns. Thus, ironically, the leading teachers simultaneously experienced feelings of being both ‘in’ and ‘out’ when measured against their understanding and expectation of their leadership.</p>
<p>These complexities to cross-college leadership for learning were not confined only to those in such roles. The consequences were also a source of comparison for other campus-based leading teachers’ leadership:<disp-quote>
<p>I don’t really have a cross-college role, but for the people who have a cross-college role, it’s really tough. Because they work with people they don’t know. Every year it’s a new staff. They’re going to meetings where they’re supposed to be meaningfully discussing the implementation of a new course at Year 10 but they haven’t been at that campus ever and they don’t know about that subject. So they’ve got to have; be across all of that and I don’t have to do any of that. So the curriculum people have to be across the other sites in a way that I don’t. (Craig, leading teacher)</p>
<p>I don’t feel that the multi-campus is set up for a success because you’re working at three different schools and they operate quite differently, it’s a big job to get three lots of teachers, to the senior campus and … meetings and development meetings, we all operate a bit differently … and that didn’t really appeal to me. (Julia, leading teacher)</p>

</p>
<p>In these institutional conditions, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1741143212436955">Sayed et al. (2003</xref>) warn that people and groups can become positioned against the people and groups who are ‘included’. Over time, the cumulative effects of such thinking and practice can become barriers to what others identify as a hallmark of social capital—trust (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1741143212436955">Bottery, 2003</xref>). This is not to suggest that ideas of social capital as a source of power and driver of change were absent in the quality and nature of relations at the College. But, as the differentiated perspectives of leading teachers in this study showed; such relations can be uneven in their quality, distribution and consequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1741143212436955">Sayed et al., 2003</xref>).</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Positioning teachers as leaders can open the possibility for those who are directly affected by change in education to have a stake in how change is envisaged and enacted. This is a positive effect of reconceptualizing and reconfiguring, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1741143212436955">Slee (2006</xref>) puts it—‘Who’s in?’ ‘Who’s out?’ and ‘How come?’ when it comes to teacher leadership. But a narrow view of inclusion suggests that once people are included then the goal of inclusion is achieved. This is not what I conclude from the study reported on in this paper. The leading teachers at Ebony River College—a formal position of teacher leadership in Victorian, Australia government schools –did not understand or experience leadership in unified ways.</p>
<p>The use of theory and thinking from critical policy perspectives in leadership and inclusive education helped identify nuances in teacher leader experiences of distributed leadership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1741143212436955">Blackmore and Sachs, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1741143212436955">Bourdieu, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1741143212436955">Grace, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1741143212436955">Leo and Barton, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1741143212436955">Slee, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1741143212436955">Sayed et al., 2003</xref>). Their use also provided a framework allowing the analysis to bring to life social, cultural and historical factors as different forms of control. Without such perspectives, these forms of control may otherwise be present but invisible in the fieldwork and literature. In other words, in this study’s context the use of critical theory allowed similarities and differences to be identified in what might otherwise be a ‘unified’ and ‘homogenous’ take on teacher leadership.</p>
<p>A core leadership challenge that remains at Ebony River College, is the perennial tension of how to live out their values of ‘one college’ when, among other factors, they are spread across three campuses. When it comes to leading teacher leadership in a multi-campus school, it cannot be concluded that ‘inclusion’ (‘Who’s in?’) is ‘good’ and ‘exclusion’ (‘Who’s out?’) is ‘bad’. For the leading teachers at Ebony River College, inclusive and exclusive thinking and practice co-existed. The data produced in the case study and reported on in this article, suggests as much.</p>
<p>These observations from the study highlight the importance, overall, of not treating teacher leadership and its development as some homogenous category of school leadership. More specifically, the use of a critical framework in which Slee’s (2006) three simple but powerful questions are key, also meant that forms of ‘exclusion’ in teacher leadership concepts and practice could emerge in more detail. The proposition underpinning such a position is that ‘exclusionary’ factors need to be identified, challenged and changed for more socially and culturally inclusive concepts and practice of teacher leadership to thrive. This is exemplified in the nuanced comparisons of leadership within and between different leading teacher roles (campus and cross-college based) that may have otherwise been down-played or at worst overlooked altogether.</p>
<p>Such calls for more contextualized understandings of the complexities of leadership, and the obstacles for its complete implementation have been made by other scholars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1741143212436955">Duignan and Marks, 2003</xref>). This case study analysis leads me to conclude that leading teachers, in particular those with a cross-college role, at Ebony River College were a symbolic and practical reflection of attempts by principal leaders to solve a perennial challenge and tension of how to create and develop cultural and social relations of ‘one college’. But it also raises a further question to take into subsequent studies of teacher leadership. In this case study and possibly other multi-campus contexts of leadership, the question of who benefits from cross-college leading teacher roles is a question worth asking again and again. More contextualized research is needed about the purpose and benefit of such distributed leadership roles.</p>
<p>The concept of ‘struggle’ and the use of it in this paper in the end is a positive relationship with change. But this understanding of change is also political. It recognizes that change does not just happen but must be struggled for in the face of entrenched historical leadership thinking and practice. This means that collective notions of leadership, such as distributed cannot be examined in the present day only and in isolation to understanding other contextual complexities.</p>
