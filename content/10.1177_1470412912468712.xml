<abstract>
<p>In this article, the author posits and argues for a new category of museums: the conceptual museum. By taking the Sigmund Freud Museum Vienna and its Contemporary Art Collection as a case study, she suggests that museums that are seemingly empty, for instance, without objects, are, in fact, filled with their own histories, contingencies and epistemological confluences, which, when they come into contact with the personal histories, fantasies, knowledge, expectations and longings of their visitors produce a rather full encounter.</p>

<p>Now let us, by a flight of imagination, suppose that Rome is not a human habitation but a psychical entity with a similarly long and copious past – an entity, that is to say, in which nothing that has once come into existence will have passed away and all the earlier phases of development continue to exist alongside the latest one.</p>

<p>There is no replacement, no reconstruction; one just realizes that there are empty rooms [in the Sigmund Freud Museum Vienna], and one has to find one’s way through them. There is no memorializing, rather, the experience is always different, and is concerned with challenging and playing with the viewer’s expectations. The challenge of the last 25 years has been to communicate through space (rather than objects) and ask questions of space, its histories, etc.</p>

<p>In 1975, the time of my first visit [to the Sigmund Freud Museum Vienna], it was an apartment with bare walls, no furniture, and a few glass cases with manuscripts and other minor memorabilia. It was dominated visually by [Edmund Engelman’s 1938] photographs, blown up to life size, of how it once had been, photographs that stood in for all the objects that had been removed to London when the Freuds escaped from the Nazis. It had a derisible atmosphere, perhaps one deliberately induced to remind visitors of yet one more loss that the war had visited on Vienna; but it still prompted the thought that a museum of fake souvenirs is a fake museum – a screen museum, the Freudian might say.</p>
<attrib>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1470412912468712">John Forrester, 1997</xref>: 132)</attrib>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>‘I remember that I was both excited and afraid as I walked through the empty streets [of Vienna] toward Berggasse 19 that wet May morning in 1938’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1470412912468712">Engelman, 1998[1976]</xref>: 89; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1470412912468712">Werner, 2002</xref>). And so begins the young photographer Edmund Engelman’s memoir, recounting his journey to visit the aging and ailing Freud at the behest of the psychoanalyst’s close friend and colleague August Aichhorn. The surreptitious, and highly dangerous visit was undertaken in order to photograph and record Freud’s professional and personal living quarters at Berggasse 19: spaces that the psychoanalyst had occupied for the previous 47 years; and to do so immediately as the Freud family were in the midst of the complex coordination of their flight from Nazi Vienna to a life of freedom and exile in London.</p>
<p>On 4 June 1938, the Freud family fled Vienna with all of their possessions in tow, leaving their apartments in Berggasse 19 empty. After a short stay in Paris, the Freuds made their way to London, and within a few months they settled into their new home at 20 Maresfield Gardens. Here the family unpacked their belongings, including the psychoanalyst’s famous couch with its Persian rug laid over it, his peculiar anthropomorphic chair, his desk, ashtrays, writing implements, his enormous collection of over 2,000 antiquities and the remainder of his book collection, as well as the family’s private furnishings. As visitors to the Freud Museum at Maresfield Gardens London know, here we are able to view and experience these objects in their then new, and now permanent surroundings.</p>
<p>Engelman shot 106 photographs of Berggasse 19, Vienna (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1470412912468712">Werner, 2002</xref>: 447).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1470412912468712">2</xref></sup> Enlargements of the photographs he took of Freud’s consulting room and study – the spaces that form the core of psychoanalytic practice and its theorization – together with a collection of archival material, form the basis of the Sigmund Freud Museum Vienna. Otherwise, the Museum is almost entirely empty. As Lydia Marinelli, the late Director of Research at the Museum, and the editor Georg Traska succinctly put it: the Freud Museum Vienna is ‘a site stripped of its material core’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1470412912468712">Marinelli and Traska, 2002</xref>: np). This stripping highlights, embodies and echoes the Freud family’s departure; a pervasive impression of absence; and an irreducible rupture in history.</p>
<p>The Museum’s emptiness and the profound sense of absence it affects on its visitors have been negatively remarked upon since it opened. One of these commentators is the historian and philosopher of psychoanalysis and the human sciences John Forrester. As quoted in the epigraph above, Forrester’s first visit to the Sigmund Freud Museum Vienna produced in him, as he remembers it, a rather harsh and negative reaction. The ‘derision’ with which he recalls the Museum was based on the fact that it was a great disappointment. ‘With bare walls, no furniture, and a few glass cases with manuscripts and other minor memorabilia’, and dominated by Engelman’s photographs, the Freud Museum in Vienna held within it a host of ‘fake souvenirs’. It was, and it has been argued that it remains, devoid of any real, proper objects. It is filled with nothing, and thus ostensibly empty. For Forrester it is a ‘fake museum’, which, he suggests, Freudians may refer to as a ‘screen museum’. Forrester is not alone in his assessment of the Museum; many other visitors throughout its history have shared this type of reaction.</p>
<p>I will return to consider Forrester’s and some of the other comments made about the Sigmund Freud Museum Vienna quite closely but, for now, I would like to pose a few questions in order to frame my discussion in this article. What exactly is it that Forrester and others, including myself, see and experience when visiting the Sigmund Freud Museum Vienna? What is it that we wish or desire to see and experience? And, what, in the end, do we not see, but do experience? As I propose and argue in this text, at Berggasse 19 we have so much that is present, but not in the traditional way in which a museum functions. In the Sigmund Freud Museum Vienna, and other museums that are founded upon empty spaces, something different occurs. Rather than a museum’s objects and collections driving our visit, a museum of empty spaces institutes a radical difference in what a museum is, how it functions, and our experience of it. That is, the empty spaces – their histories, representations, memories, and our experiences of these spaces – come together to form what I would like to name a ‘conceptual museum’.</p>
<p>The Sigmund Freud Museum Vienna is just such a conceptual museum. In this analysis, I consider the history of the Freud family’s living and work spaces and the documentation of these spaces as a vital, living archive. I see the negative critiques of the seemingly empty Museum and what they offer us in terms of our understanding of a museum of radical difference. The Freud Museum’s small, yet permanent ‘site-responsive’ conceptual Contemporary Art Collection will be my guideline. This will lead to the suggestion that the Museum can be understood to be modeled on Conceptual Art. This, then, will shape the way in which together these aspects of the Freud Museum in Vienna foster a notion of a conceptual museum.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1470412912468712">3</xref></sup> Through this accumulation of argument and analysis I posit that a conceptual museum more generally, and the Sigmund Freud Museum Vienna specifically, are based upon a complex interweaving of the historical, theoretical and imaginative potentialities of a site, and their affect on the viewer.</p>
<sec id="section1-1470412912468712">
<title>A Living Archive In the Making</title>
<p>Freud and his family were forced to leave Vienna after the German Anschluss of Austria by Hitler’s Third Reich on 12 March 1938 had a very real impact on them.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1470412912468712">4</xref></sup> On 15 March, the Gestapo searched Freud’s home. On 22 March, the Nazis detained Freud’s youngest daughter Anna for interrogation. ‘In her bag, she hid a capsule with a lethal dose of Veronal that she had received from Dr Schur, the family physician’, so that, if necessary, she could choose to take her own life. After an entire day of being held and ‘several hours of interrogation, Anna Freud was released’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1470412912468712">Scholz-Strasser, 1998</xref>: 8; see also, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1470412912468712">Schur, 1972</xref>). On that day, 22 March 1938, Freud, anxious for the safety of his daughter and taking heed of the spread of anti-Semitism across Europe made a decision. Although, as Freud wrote to his friend and colleague Arnold Zweig, he was still in a frail condition and recuperating, on ‘the couch which is meant for others’ in ‘unusually violent pain’, from one of his ‘normal operations’ for the mouth cancer that he had been battling for 15 years, Freud knew, without a doubt, that emigration was a necessary measure for the survival of his family (Freud in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1470412912468712">Scholz-Strasser, 1998</xref>: 8).</p>
<p>In this hostile climate, the Jewish photographer Engelman understood what was at stake in his visit to the Freuds less than two months later. Engelman continues his memoir by stating that:
<disp-quote>
<p>I carried a little valise filled with my cameras, tripod, lenses, and film and it seemed to become heavier and heavier with every step. I was convinced that anyone who saw me would instantly know that I was on my way to the offices of Dr. Sigmund Freud – on a mission that would hardly have pleased the Nazis.</p>
<p>It had only recently stopped raining. The sky was still dark and the cobblestones of Berggasse were glossy and wet. The dark day worried me. I was afraid that there might not be enough light for good interior photographs of the Freud apartment. Flash and floodlights were out of the question. I had been told that the apartment was under constant surveillance by the Gestapo. The only permanent record of the place where Freud had lived and worked for the last forty years would have to be made without arousing any suspicion whatsoever. I felt fear for my own safety and also for the Freuds, for I did not want to be responsible for some misstep which would endanger them now that they were so close to leaving Vienna safely. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1470412912468712">Engelman, 1998</xref>[1976]: 89)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Having met with Freud’s friend and colleague Aichhorn at the Café Museum on Karlsplatz a few days earlier, Engelman agreed that, as
<disp-quote>
<p>the historic apartment and offices were about to be broken up for storage and shipment … it would be of utmost importance for the history of psychoanalysis … to make an exact record of every detail of the place where it was born so that, in Aichhorn’s courageous words, ‘a museum can be created when the storm of the years is over’. (p. 93)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Thus, for posterity and the projection of a Freud Museum in the future, Engelman spent four days taking photographs of Berggasse 19. As we can see from Engelman’s photograph (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1470412912468712">Figure 1</xref>), he took shots of the building’s exterior, including the street, the building’s façade with all the windows of the Freud family’s residence, Kornmehl’s kosher butcher shop, and the cooperative food hall that was a branch of a Social Democratic Consumers’ Union both on the ground floor, as well as the imposing front door to the building (which as Engelman notes, ‘on this day was draped with a swastika flag; another large swastika flag hung from the roof of the building’ (p. 95). Once inside, Engelman photographed the spacious entrance and hallway, the glorious 19th-century stone staircase, and the exterior doors to apartments 5 and 6 (Freud’s living and professional quarters, respectively). Stepping inside Freud’s apartments, Engelman shot detailed photographs of their interiors.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1470412912468712">5</xref></sup> Engelman’s mission was to photograph the spaces of Freud’s personal life and professional practice, including his study, consulting room and his patients’ waiting room while always ‘keeping in mind that some day these photographs might be the only record available to recreate Freud’s offices and living quarters’ (p. 96).</p>

<p>The photographer, using two cameras (a Rolleiflex and a Leica), two lenses (a 150mm lens and a 28mm wide-angle lens) and a light meter, wanted to record as much as possible ‘from positions where Freud usually stood or sat … to see things the way Freud saw them, with his own eyes, during the long hours of his treatment sessions and as he sat writing’ (p. 96). However, in practice, this presented technical difficulties and Engelman conceded to taking photographs from different vantage points, including those of the patient or visitor.</p>
<p>Most of Engelman’s photographs are of what he called the ‘important rooms’ – the study and consulting room – that he rushed to enter, unwittingly having taken only a couple of photographs of the waiting room (p. 96). Upon entering the consulting room, his ‘first glance’ of ‘the famous couch’ left him somewhat disappointed, as it struck him as ‘relatively small’; but he was ‘overwhelmed’ by the ‘masses of figurines which overflowed every surface’ and ‘filled every available spot in the room’ (p. 97).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1470412912468712">6</xref></sup> He photographed the consulting room in detail. An example of this close attention to detail can be seen in the photograph (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1470412912468712">Figure 2</xref>) which includes the couch and its surround, the many pictures and pieces of art in the room, the typical Viennese ceramic tile stove, and the cabinets holding some of Freud’s vast collection of antiquities. In other photographs, Engelman shot the chair Freud sat in during his patient’s analysis, and the mementos and awards hanging on the room’s walls. Engelman visited the Freuds over only a few days, which afforded him very little time to photograph the study. In one of these shots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1470412912468712">Figure 3</xref>) we can see a part of Freud’s extensive library and antiquities collection; his desk with its army of antique figurines which faced him while he read and wrote; the ‘quite strange’ chair that was designed especially for Freud; and the ‘oddly decorative mirror’ that hung from the large windows in his study. The view from the windows looked out onto a courtyard (p. 98). Engelman made notes as he worked across the consulting room and study: his archival gaze documenting the spaces and their contents was meant to ensure that nothing was missed and that the photographs overlapped one another, thereby creating a detailed and complete panorama of the rooms.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1470412912468712">7</xref></sup> And yet, as the literary theorists <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1470412912468712">Diana Fuss with Joel Sanders (2004</xref>: 78) note, at times, Engelman’s working methods became ‘slightly manic’ as he ‘obsessively transvers[ed] the same spaces’ and found it difficult to ‘negotiate the crowded terrain of Freud’s office, so cluttered with objects that many of the two thousand antiquities can be seen in these photographs spilling onto the study floor’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1470412912468712">8</xref></sup></p>

<p>During one of these visits, while Engelman was at work, Freud unexpectedly interrupted him by walking into his study. Surprised by the meeting, as Engelman was told explicitly that he would not be meeting Freud who was not well enough to receive guests, the two men were introduced by Aichhorn who explained the photographer’s visit to the psychoanalyst. Upon meeting and liking Engelman, Freud agreed to have his portrait taken by him, as did his wife Martha and daughter Anna. Engelman was welcomed to photograph the family’s living quarters, which were furnished in traditional upper middle-class Austrian design, with hardwood furniture, Oriental rugs, decorative crystal and China objects, family photographs and other memorabilia. Engleman also gained access to, and photographed Anna Freud’s consulting room and sitting room, which she used for her professional psychoanalytic work with children. Each day as the photographs were shot, Engelman spent the entire evening and much of the night developing his pictures. The photographer organized and collated all of the images into an album, which, upon completion, Engelman presented to Freud.</p>
<p>Engelman understood that, as a Jew, he too needed to escape Nazi Vienna. He knew that the negatives could not travel with him in case they were found by the Nazis on his person, and threatened his life and the lives of the Freud family. As such, he left the negatives with Aichhorn in Vienna. After many months of hope, despair and hardship, Engelman managed to leave Vienna in January 1939, spent some time in a French detention camp, and finally made his way to New York in early 1940. Many years later, Engelman followed the trail back looking for the negatives. He found out that they had been sent by Aichhorn’s secretary Miss Regele to Anna Freud in London for safe keeping. Engelman visited Anna Freud at Maresfield Gardens and collected the negatives.</p>

<title>From 1891 to 1938: A Brief History of Berggasse 19</title>
<p>Freud and his family had moved into the newly built apartment 5, Berggasse 19 Vienna, in 1891.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1470412912468712">9</xref></sup> Berggasse 19 was built as a part of a major process of city planning during the mid-19th century:
<disp-quote>
<p>The decision to raze the city’s fortifications in 1857 and replace them with a magnificent avenue encircling the inner city, the Ringstrasse, as well as the building activity throughout the city that accompanied those economic and political boom years of successful bourgeois industrialists and entrepreneurs, the so-called <italic>Gründerzeit</italic>, transformed the appearance of Vienna and determined to a great extent how the city looks today. The monumental buildings along the Ringstrasse were an architectural manifestation of the relationship between conservative-imperial and liberal-bourgeois modes of self-perception. The domestic architecture of the municipal districts adjoining the ‘Ring,’ numbered as they were at the time in Roman numerals II. to IX., was characterised by a specific type of multiple-story, bourgeois apartment building. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1470412912468712">Scholz-Strasser, 1998</xref>: 15)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The Freuds moved into one of these typical buildings in a ‘socially diverse’ part of the city that represented a mixture of the noble, secular, ecclesiastical, Jewish, economic and intellectual life of Vienna (p. 16).</p>
<p>A few years after taking up residence in Berggasse 19, Freud began to see his patients there. His practice migrated into the ground floor apartment 4 in Berggasse in 1896, and then, in 1908, when his sister Rosa Graf and her family vacated apartment 6 – the flat adjoining the Freud family quarters – Freud moved his practice into it. In 1923, Anna Freud began her practice as a child therapist in apartment 5, the family’s private quarters, and her patients shared the waiting room with her father’s analysands in apartment 6. For over 15 years, with a great deal of praise from her father and the psychoanalytic community, Anna Freud also carried out her work and writing at Berggasse 19.</p>
<p>Freud lived and worked at Berggasse 19 for 47 years. As we know from Engelman’s photographs, as well as through correspondence and various texts written by friends, colleagues and patients, the psychoanalyst surrounded himself in his study and consulting room with his sizeable and treasured collection of antiquities and artifacts, and a substantive library. Freud was able to engage with these objects and books while sitting in the comfort of his unique anthropomorphic chair (a gift in 1930 from his daughter Mathilde, designed by Paul Hofmann, and made by the architect and family friend Felix Augenfeld), pacing within these spaces, or lying on his analysands’ couch (a gift in 1891, apparently from his grateful patient Mrs Benvenisti). At Berggasse, Freud saw nearly all of his patients; wrote the bulk of the major works of psychoanalysis; carried out a lengthy correspondence with colleagues and friends; hosted the Wednesday Psychological Society (which became the Vienna Psychoanalytic Society in 1910) that met at Berggasse from 1902–1922 (until the waiting room became too small to hold all of its members); worked with his students; welcomed guests; and raised a family.</p>
<p>Having lived a full and productive life here, Freud, at the age of 82, along with his wife Martha, sister-in-law Minna Bernays, and his daughter Anna had no choice but to leave Vienna. In order to pay the heavy taxes levied by the Nazis on Jews hoping to leave occupied territory, the Freud family had to sell a large portion of the psychoanalyst’s book collection, borrow funds from family and friends – particularly the author and psychoanalyst Princess Marie Bonaparte –and, with the assistance of the American and British Governments, were finally granted permission by the Nazis to leave Vienna on 4 June 1938. Astonishingly, they were able to take with them almost all of their belongings, and these are what we can still view today in the Freud Museum London.</p>
<p>With the Freuds’ departure from Berggasse 19, the Nazis at first used their apartments as a form of ‘communal housing’ for Jews. In 1941 or 1942, the occupants were transferred to an official Jewish ghetto in the 2nd district of Vienna. Here they were detained until they were deported to concentration camps. Freud’s four sisters, all over 80 years old, were victims of this process, eventually being murdered in the concentration camps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1470412912468712">Scholz-Strasser, 1998</xref>: 21).</p>
<p>In extreme contrast to this, the Nazis then used these ‘vacated’ Jewish apartments to house non-Jewish Viennese families. As Hertha Pfeiffer (quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1470412912468712">Scholz-Strasser, 1998</xref>: 21) told a journalist in 1989:
<disp-quote>
<p>We got the apartment number 5 on Berggasse 19 in 1942, the Freud apartment … My God, the apartment was available … The apartment was available. Completely empty. There was absolutely nobody in it. That’s the way it was then. It was so simple. There was no problem. …</p>
<p>In 1942, the Nazis appropriated apartment number 6 and declared it to be a <italic>Reichsmietwohnung z.b.V</italic>., a ‘vacant’ apartment especially designated for relatives of soldiers serving in the German Wehrmacht. The apartment was subdivided in the same year. The Henkel family moved into the former rooms of Sigmund Freud’s practice, and the Stoff family moved into Anna’s.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>After the War, Vienna made very little effort to acknowledge Freud’s life, exile, and legacy. It was not until 1953 that a plaque was attached to Berggasse 19. It simply states: ‘From 1891 to 1938, in this house, lived and worked Professor Sigmund Freud, creator and founder of Psychoanalysis.’</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1470412912468712">
<title>An Archival Museum</title>
<p>Then, in 1968, with the founding of the Sigmund Freud Society in Vienna, Frederick J Hacker, its first President, received grants from the federal government and the Vienna city council to begin the process of acquiring apartment 6 – the central spaces of Freud’s professional practice between 1908 and 1938, including the hallway and coat rack, the waiting room, consulting room and study – in order to establish a museum. (Apartment 5, Freud’s family home, was not acquired by the Museum until 1986.) Under the purview of Dr Harald Leupold-Löwenthal, who later became President of the Sigmund Freud Society, the rooms of apartment 6 were quickly renovated in order for the Museum’s opening to coincide with the 27th International Psychoanalytic Congress in 1971 in Vienna. This was the first Congress to take place in Vienna since the rise of National Socialism. These spaces formed, and remain to this day, the core of the Sigmund Freud Museum Vienna. In 1971, almost 35 years after Freud was forced to leave Vienna, the empty spaces of Berggasse 19, once alive with the private lives, and the intellectual and professional labour of Freud, his family, colleagues and friends, became a Museum dedicated to Freud. On 15 June 1971, the Freud Museum opened to the public. Anna Freud, having been kept abreast of the Museum’s development returned to Vienna for the first time since the Freuds fled Austria, to celebrate this occasion: a Museum in Vienna dedicated to her father’s life and work.</p>
<p>Before the Museum’s launch many design options were discussed by the committee, headed by Leupold-Löwenthal, which was in charge of its design, organization and display. The committee conferred upon, but decided against an extreme conceptual arrangement. One possibility was to have a replica couch and a single armchair placed in their original positions during Freud’s time, within an otherwise empty consulting room (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1470412912468712">Marinelli and Traska, 2002</xref>: np). Instead of this type of a radically empty, conceptual installation for the Museum (i.e. having only an armchair and a replica couch occupying the entire space which was once inhabited by Freud’s study, consulting room and waiting room), ‘the basic idea of [the Museum’s] design’ was ‘to present the 1938 appearance of the rooms by means of enlargements of Engelman’s photographs and, in addition, to give a pictorial presentation of Sigmund Freud’s life and development and of his creation, psychoanalysis’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1470412912468712">Leupold-Löwenthal, 1994/1995</xref>: 7). This is the design the committee duly employed for apartment 6.</p>
<p>During the Museum’s planning stages, Anna Freud was contacted and as a part of her contribution to the Museum she sent from London the furniture that once inhabited the waiting room in Berggasse, so that that space would to a certain extent resemble the layout during her father’s lifetime. Anna Freud also donated a small selection of Freud’s antiquities, several volumes from his book collection, and various other documents to the newly formed Museum.</p>
<p>Because the bulk of Freud’s collection of antiquities, books, and furniture remained at Maresfield Gardens, where Anna Freud was still living and practising, the Museum staff in Vienna decided to produce a rather ‘didactic’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1470412912468712">Marinelli and Traska, 2002</xref>: np) display of Freud’s consulting room and study through various types of archival documentation: photographs by Engelman and others; diagrams; first editions and off-prints of Freud’s work leant by various institutions and private collectors; hand-written inscriptions; souvenirs; as well as other archival material.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1470412912468712">10</xref></sup> For the first decade of the Museum’s life, a total of 140 photographs and original documents were placed in the consulting room only, which is a great deal of material for a rather small room. In 1974, further material was added (Scholz-Strasser, 1994/1995: 9). The archive and documentation on display in this core part of the Museum – the waiting room, consulting room, and study - now total 351 pieces. This is quite an archive, and quite an extensive exhibition of material. Intriguingly, the majority of the archive is displayed around the edges of the consulting room and study, and housed within flat, built-in wall cabinets. Engelman’s enlarged photographs are displayed on the bottom half of the cabinets, forming a flat, panoramic screen-like display of how the vibrant and brimming rooms once were. Thus, the two-dimensional display emphasizes both what is absent – all of the objects, artifacts, books, furniture, that were once held within the two rooms - and the emptiness of the rooms themselves. It is this sense of emptiness that provokes such confusion, hostility, anger, and disappointment in the Museum’s visitors. It is also one of the most intriguing and meaningful aspects of the Sigmund Freud Museum Vienna. I will return to this again later.</p>
<p>For now, I would like to simply introduce a context for this type of radically conceptual installation in relation to Conceptual Art exhibitions. In order to do this, I will bring to mind both the radical possibility that the Freud Museum committee entertained – of having only a replica couch and chair in the consulting room – and the display that the Museum ended up with, which produces a concerted sense of emptiness. Both of these spatial arrangements echo, and in fact contribute to, the long history of the radical empty gallery space as employed by artists, mainly conceptual artists, as a means of pointing to and denoting the constitution of the gallery and the artwork as an ideological, social, economic and cultural construction. This genealogy begins with Yves Klein’s <italic>The Specialization of Sensibility in the Raw Material State Into Stabilized Pictorial Sensibility</italic>, otherwise known as <italic>Le Vide/The Void</italic> (Paris: Galerie Iris Clert, 1958). It has a crescendo in the late 1960s and early 1970s at the height of Conceptual Art with installations by Art &amp; Language, Robert Barry, Robert Irwin and Michael Asher; and then moves intermittently from the early 1990s with shows by Laurie Parsons and Bethan Huws to the early 2000s with exhibitions by Maria Eichhorn, Ilya and Emilia Kabakov, through to the recent work by Roman Ondák.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1470412912468712">11</xref></sup> Clearly the opening of the Sigmund Freud Museum Vienna in 1971 occurs in the middle of this history, and notably coincides with the focal point of the empty gallery exhibition at the height of Conceptual Art. This coincidence draws our attention to the wider reverberations induced by the Freud Museum: the relationship between the Museum and Conceptual Art’s exhibition history; the Vienna Museum’s conceptual Contemporary Art Collection; the radically conceptual emptiness of the Museum and the criticisms it provokes; and the historical, cultural and ideological context for the Museum.</p>
<p>The opening of the Sigmund Freud Museum Vienna in 1971, and the creation of this seemingly empty museum with its paradoxical excess of archival documentation require further reflection. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1470412912468712">Leupold-Löwenthal (1994/1995</xref>: 7) thought that the visitor required some support in garnering a sense of what was once in these spaces, and the proliferation of archival documentation on display. For this purpose, he and Hans Lobner produced,
<disp-quote>
<p>with the simplest apparatus … the first mimeographed catalogue, which was needed because it was our policy to avoid having captions under the pictures, so as not to disturb the graphic representation and the arrangement of the photographs and documents.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>To this day, visitors are presented with the option of using one of these catalogues – now photocopied and translated into several languages – to assist them as they make their way through the Museum. The catalogue gives detailed information of each of the 351 items on display. This abundance of archival material and documentation resonates with the ways in which, at its height, Conceptual Art also had a similar reliance on this type of material.</p>
<p>The visitor to the Freud Museum cannot possibly read the 100-page booklet of documentation that he or she is given upon arrival at the museum, or consider it in its entirety while visiting and viewing the 351-item strong archive on display. There is simply not enough time to read through the documentation, and thus I suspect that very few visitors use it in any extensive or exhaustive manner. This means that visitors are left to view the archive on display in a rather cursory fashion, glancing from one item to the next, until their gaze lands upon something that is of particular interest. This item is then looked up in the catalogue and read about in detail. This sense of vagueness about what one is looking at and sees must certainly add to the sense of absence and emptiness that visitors experience in the space.</p>
<p>As each item on display is numbered and referenced in the catalogue, this programmatic structure within the display determines to a large extent how the visitor moves in and around Freud’s professional work spaces. After walking across the entrance hallway and through the analysands’ waiting room, the visitor, like the analysand, is guided into the consulting room. The display and catalogue strictly orient the visitor in the consulting room and study (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1470412912468712">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1470412912468712">5</xref>): immediately upon entering the consulting room, the viewer’s gaze is shifted to the left; the first item in the catalogue is described. He or she is then guided around the edge of this space, until reaching the doorway to the study. As in Freud’s time, these double doors are always open. Thus they emphasize the correlation between practice and theory, between listening and writing. Having moved halfway around the consulting room, Museum guests are then invited into the study and led around it in a counter-clockwise rotation. Eventually they arrive at the small mirror that hangs at the centre of the large windows in the study, so that the visitors, like Freud before them, can gaze upon their own image. From here, visitors return to the double doors and move back into the consulting room, to complete the viewing of this room’s other two walls, and then back out to the waiting room. This counter-clockwise movement through the consulting room and study establishes their integral connection to one another, a connection that was of vital importance to Freud.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1470412912468712">12</xref></sup> What is striking about this path is that the visitor is made to walk around the edge of the exhibition space, rather than across, or through it, thereby emphasizing once more and physically experiencing its overall emptiness and strong sense of absence. This also makes clear that there is a radical difference between this museum and a traditional museum filled with objects in vitrines situated within its exhibition space rather than around its edge.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1470412912468712">13</xref></sup> Together, the archival, documentary, and anthropological approach taken in the Freud Museum’s display – the flattened, two-dimensional layout creating a screen-like display; the use of souvenirs, the prevalent use of photography; the didactic nature of the catalogue; and the way in which visitors are guided around the space – come together to emphasize a seeming emptiness, and thus make apparent what is seemingly absent in the Museum.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-1470412912468712">14</xref></sup></p>

<p>Seemingly empty, seemingly absent. And I will return to this ‘seemingly’ later. For now, I would like to emphasize that, as my analysis has made clear so far, the Sigmund Freud Museum Vienna functions, on one level, as an archival museum. Many of the most important of Engelman’s 106 images have been on display since the Museum’s opening as they are to this day. As a whole, they still constitute a vital photo-documentary archive with and through which we can ostensibly recreate, imagine, and understand what was present in the site where psychoanalysis’s beginnings, histories, genealogies and its ruptures took place: Berggasse 19. These photographs embody a sense of the aura of Freud’s consulting room and study; the spaces of life and labour within which the practice and writings of psychoanalysis became manifest. In thinking through the abundance of documentation and archival material though, the image-screen created by Engelman’s photographs, the relatively few pieces of furniture in the waiting room, and the substantive catalogue detailing each item on display and its importance to Freud’s life and work, it becomes clear that the Sigmund Freud Museum Vienna display in apartment 6 is extraordinary. There are very few objects to be viewed; however, there is a great deal of documentation to be seen and a proliferation of notes to be read. And, yet, in spite of this proliferation, the consulting room and study remain seemingly and strikingly empty; the overriding sense of the Museum is that it is paradoxically full of absence.</p>
<p>This paradox, a Museum that is both overflowing and yet empty, reminds us, as Ingrid Scholz-Strasser, the Director of the Sigmund Freud Museum Vienna, insists, as quoted in the epigraph at the beginning of this article, that any endeavour to retrieve and represent the past, to ‘replace’ or ‘reconstruct’ it, is impossible. What this means in light of my analysis, is that the aura of these spaces during Freud’s lifetime is irrecoverable, the historical rupture is irreducible, and the images thus function as a loss through and with which we live. It is this absence and paradox that produces such negative reactions in visitors, and, which also provides them with some rather disturbing fantasies.</p>

<title>This Is Not a Museum</title>
<p>Lydia Marinelli, affiliated with the Freud Museum since 1992, and the Director of the Research Division at the Sigmund Freud Museum Vienna from 2004 until her untimely death in 2008, cogently writes about the complicated responses that visitors and museum experts have had and, one can conjecture, continue to have towards the Museum. She remembers attending a course for museum professionals. During this event, the functions and conditions of what constituted a museum were being discussed, and one participant spoke up and said, ‘I don’t think you [the Sigmund Freud Museum Vienna] deserve the name. You shouldn’t call yourselves a museum, what you have here has nothing to do with a museum. Museums exhibit works of art or collections, but this…’ Although the instructor attempted to explain the ways in which the definition of the museum had been opened up, and the possibilities it could now serve had shifted, it seemed that even the most liberal and open-minded of the participants had difficulty in accepting the Freud Museum as a museum. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1470412912468712">Marinelli (2009</xref>: 161) explains that:
<disp-quote>
<p>the reservations expressed concerned the Sigmund Freud Museum in Vienna, which had been branded the product of name usurpation … It was not a matter of revising the definition of ‘museum’ or of less outmoded objectives for the institution. What was being expressed here was the inadequacy of this place itself, the incongruity between the notion and the location, the idea and the social institution, which initially eluded conceptual systematization. This sense of incongruity is caused by the fact that this museum does not offer to the eye what the associations surrounding the institution demand; instead of satisfying visitors’ expectations, it disappoints them.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Disappointment and frustration are responses that the Museum has provoked for some time. In the 1960s, the French psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan visited Berggasse 19, and ‘found to his disappointment nothing but a shabby and locked door. What had he hoped to see but a house, plain and simple?’ (p. 163). Other visitors bring such longing and desire with them that they imagine seeing what is not there: the couch, for instance. Marinelli mentions how visitors coming back to Vienna to visit the Museum once more, insist that during their last visit Freud’s couch was in Vienna: which of course it was not, since it has not been in Vienna since Freud’s exile in 1938. Berggasse 19, and Freud’s life are so many things to so many visitors.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>For some it is an everyday residence where they have led their day-to-day lives since the end of the Second World War; others confront this life with traumatic memories in which this mundane, everyday life was founded on violence; still others believe that a center of the psychoanalytic world lay buried here. (p. 164)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The radical difference of the Sigmund Freud Museum Vienna means that all of these interpretations and desires of what will be found at Berggasse are thwarted. It simply does not function in the way that traditional ‘personality museums’ based on the life and work of a famous person (most often a man) do.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-1470412912468712">15</xref></sup> Traditionally, the visitor expects to see ‘the remains of an authentic-looking interior, preferably one that creates the impression that the poet, philosopher, etc. has just left the room’. This creates ‘a continuum between past and present through a suggestive interplay of absence and presence. Things of the past do not seem lost in this context, but rather <italic>aufgehoben</italic> in both senses of the Hegelian term, i.e. both preserved and raised to a higher level (p. 164). This is certainly what the Freud Museum in London accomplishes. It is a memorial and mausoleum to Freud. This is precisely what the Freud Museum in Vienna cannot fulfil. In Vienna, ‘normality, banishment, genocide, and psychoanalytic myths of origin commingle’ and these ‘stories converge that in other narratives move apart’ (p. 163).</p>
<p>This convergence of narratives, and its irreducibility, must be maintained within the Freud Museum Vienna in order for it to reverberate with its own history. The core of the Museum must remain
<disp-quote>
<p>an empty place, an empty apartment, which has nothing but an address to mark it and serves as a permanent reminder of obliteration and banishment, the room resists the affirmative construction of meaning and remains inherent as a block in traumatic constellations. The story that can be told about it creates no safe horizon that could lend itself to stabilization. In fact, the exhibited emptiness is not merely the product of history, but is equally the product of a form-giving intervention – as are other undertakings working in three dimensions also. The museum answers the question of what there is to see here by highlighting the moment of disappearance and becoming the signpost to a place located elsewhere. (pp. 165–166)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>What Marnielli points to, and enables me to argue is the way in which the Sigmund Freud Museum Vienna puts the issue of representability itself into question. Here, it is not a matter of representing trauma, but the impossibility of doing so that is embodied, enacted and affected by the Museum. This Museum is not a trauma museum. Rather it is a site of trauma.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-1470412912468712">16</xref></sup> The Freud Museum Vienna does not function as a form of memorialization, as positive reassurance as Marinelli rightly states.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-1470412912468712">17</xref></sup> Rather, it maintains the displacement and irreducibility of history, memory and meaning. In these ways, the Museum’s seeming emptiness functions and resonates in such a way as to point to a radical difference from other trauma museums. These radical differences form the basis for an alternative understanding of what a museum can be and does by enabling me to conceive of a conceptual museum.</p>
<p>Here, in Vienna there is no ‘stabilization’, ‘no safe horizon’. It is, as Marinelli (pp. 165–166) puts it, a ‘signpost to a place located elsewhere’. Having said that, what I think it is vital to remember in this Freud Museum, is that this elsewhere is actually located here, in and at the Sigmund Freud Museum Vienna. It is here, that the <italic>lieux de mémoire</italic>, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1470412912468712">Pierre Nora (1989</xref>: 9) would say, is located; where ‘memory takes root in the concrete, in spaces, gestures, images, and objects’. It is, as Freud notes about Rome in the first epigraph to this article:
<disp-quote>
<p>a psychical entity with a similarly long and copious past – an entity, that is to say, in which nothing that has once come into existence will have passed away and all the earlier phases of development continue to exist alongside the latest one. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1470412912468712">2001[1929/1930]</xref>: 70)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>As I continue to argue in this text, the Sigmund Freud Museum Vienna, as a site of radical difference, as a site of memory is an historical, material, theoretical and affective exemplar of a conceptual museum.</p>

<title>Conceptual Art Inside the Museum</title>
<p>The archival, documentary and photographic aspect of the Vienna Freud Museum’s display, as well as Forrester’s summation of it as a ‘screen museum’, are briefly commented upon by the art historian Mignon Nixon in her article on Conceptual Art and psychoanalysis. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1470412912468712">Nixon (2005</xref>: 72) writes:
<disp-quote>
<p>It is important to observe that certain of the strategies informing the installation of the Freud Museum are also characteristic of Conceptual art. These include the displacement of the object by the photograph and the text and the concomitant frustration of scopic desire, as well as the reorientation of the museum or gallery from an exhibition space, or space of display, to an archive. The Freud Museum, with its ‘derisible atmosphere,’ its photographic record of the rooms in Freud’s time, its research library, its carefully labelled and indexed ‘minor memorabilia’ – and, ultimately, its art collection curated by Kosuth – is a screen museum on the Conceptual art model.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-1470412912468712">18</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In these three sentences, Nixon makes a series of important analogies: between the strategies of Conceptual Art, the Vienna Museum’s display, screen memories and the Museum’s Contemporary Art Collection. In an earlier section of this article, I analysed the archival, documentary, anthropological and screen-like aspects of the Museum’s core display. And it is certainly the case that some of these traits are concomitant with Conceptual Art. Perhaps, though, the Sigmund Freud Museum Vienna is more closely aligned with the history and criticality of the radically empty exhibition, and its radical difference as a conceptual museum. In this section, I would like to consider more fully the Freud Museum’s Conceptual Art Collection and the unique role it plays within the Museum, as a conceptual museum.</p>
<p>In order to achieve this, I would like to begin by turning to the history of the extraordinary transformations that the Sigmund Freud Museum Vienna underwent between 1984 and 2003 under the current Director Inge Scholz-Strasser. These include significant changes to the Museum’s architectural design; the acquisition of estates; the funding, organization and ownership of the Museum; its philosophical, conceptual and epistemological remit; and, last but not least, its relationship to contemporary art. The highlights of these changes are as follows.</p>
<p>In 1984, under Leupold-Löwenthal, the display in Freud’s study and consulting room was rearranged. In 1986, the Sigmund Freud Society, through proceeds from a musical charity event and government funding acquired apartment 5 of Berggasse 19 for the Vienna Museum. This apartment was the Freud family’s private residence between 1891 and 1938, and included Anna Freud’s consulting room from 1923 until 1938. On 23 September 1989, apartment 5 opened to the public. Beginning in January 1991, the apartment underwent an extensive ‘conceptual reconstruction’, in the form of structural renovations initiated by Scholz-Strasser and managed by the conceptual architect Wolfgang Tschapeller.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-1470412912468712">19</xref></sup> In 1992, the Museum set up the Anna Freud Rooms, which include home videos of the Freud family; and the original waiting room shared by Freud and his daughter was modified in 1993. By 1996, the alterations were complete and the Museum now houses spacious offices for the staff; the largest library of psychoanalysis in Europe, with over 35,000 volumes; an archive of over 50,000 objects; and several impressive exhibition spaces for both historical shows and the exhibiting of the Museum’s Contemporary Art Collection.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-1470412912468712">20</xref></sup> In addition to these extensive renovations and changes, in 2002, the Museum opened the then recently acquired entire ground floor of Berggasse 19. What was the cooperative food hall during Freud’s lifetime is now a lecture theatre and seminar room for the Museum’s ongoing research and education programme, and the space adjacent to it, which housed Siegmund Kornmehl’s kosher butcher shop, has become a unique glass-fronted, street-level exhibition space informally referred to as the Storefront Gallery.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-1470412912468712">21</xref></sup> Many of these transformations to the Museum are clearly punctuated by a very real relationship to contemporary art. There are three main moments in this history that I would like to focus on: the first in 1989; the second in 1997; and the final one beginning in 2002.</p>
<p>In 1989, on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of Freud’s death, and the centenary of the Austrian philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein’s birth, Vienna planned a series of celebratory events. One of these was an invitation extended by the Freud Museum’s Director Scholz-Strasser and the Viennese curator and gallerist Peter Pakesch to the American conceptual artist Joseph Kosuth.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-1470412912468712">22</xref></sup> Scholz-Strasser and Pakesch invited Kosuth to create an artwork that would mark the occasion of these significant historical milestones, and to coincide with the Museum’s opening to the public of apartment 5 at Berggasse 19. Being the first contemporary artist to exhibit at the Museum, Kosuth took the opportunity to make a work that was decidedly responsive to the site. As I mentioned earlier, the Pfeiffer family had inhabited apartment 5 since 1942 after they had been granted the right to move into it under the auspices of the Austrian government’s relocation scheme, and after the Freuds had been forced to leave Vienna. In 1989, when Kosuth was invited to exhibit in the site, the Museum had not yet renovated the apartment. Clearly this was an important moment in the Museum’s history; as well as marking Vienna and Austria’s acknowledgement of Freud and his legacies, it highlighted the relationship between Conceptual Art and psychoanalysis, and Kosuth wanted to ensure that all of this was suitably recognized and made manifest.</p>
<p>In the mid-1980s, Kosuth was working on, amongst other things, his serial installation entitled <italic>Zero &amp; Not</italic>. The form and content of this work was indebted to Freud’s writings. Kosuth’s project began in 1985 and grew out of his 1981 work <italic>Cathexis</italic> in which he first posited the notion of a ‘conceptual architecture’, which involves an artwork’s activation of the space, history and memory of its architectural context.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-1470412912468712">23</xref></sup> In each of the works in this series, Kosuth takes an excerpt from Freud’s writings and has the text silkscreened on paper and then applied as wallpaper onto the interior walls of the site. Each paragraph of the text is numbered, and the text is struck through by black masking tape so that the words remain barely legible. Having been given the opportunity to exhibit in the Freud family’s apartment, it seemed only appropriate to construct a piece from the <italic>Zero &amp; Not</italic> series for the space. For the Sigmund Freud Museum Vienna installation Kosuth used an excerpt from the original, German version of Freud’s important, and in the psychoanalyst’s mind his best work, <italic>The Interpretation of Dreams</italic> (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1470412912468712">Figure 6</xref>).</p>

<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1470412912468712">Kosuth (1993[1986]</xref>: 221–222) states that in the <italic>Zero &amp; Not</italic> series there is an ‘absence presented’ which precipitates a manifold deconstructive play. For the art historian <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1470412912468712">Charles Green (2001</xref>: 20), the particularity of Kosuth’s method highlights the fact that Freud’s ‘text alternate[s] as figure and ground, it also work[s] as discourse itself’. For me, this alternation, and the discursive implications of it bring to mind the terms of Jacques Derrida, wherein the Freud text is put under erasure; struck out, made seemingly absent, and yet is still present in its trace. Because the text is both legible and illegible, this artwork offers us an interpretation of how language and meaning are reliant on the flow of words and their relationship to one another. This is what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1470412912468712">Kosuth (1993[1986])</xref> calls the ‘texture of reading’. In addition, for the artist, by using only Freud’s words as the basis for his own work and yet putting them under erasure, the work interrogates the notion of artistic as well as psychoanalytic authorship and authority.</p>
<p>The version of <italic>Zero &amp; Not</italic> made and housed in the Sigmund Freud Museum Vienna also reminds us of many other psychoanalytic lessons. The text under erasure, with its lasting trace encourages us to think about Freud’s insights into the functioning of memory, repression and screen memories, wherein experiences leave an ever-present trace of themselves even when they are linked to another experience, barely remembered, or not remembered at all. The textual erasure also brings to mind Freud’s understanding of the human subject as archaeological. For him, our formation is stratified and covered over in various ways. It is the function of psychoanalysis to excavate these layers in order to bring our memories to the fore and offer us self-knowledge and relief from our symptoms. And finally and quite literally, having an excerpt from Freud’s <italic>The Interpretation of Dreams</italic> reminds us of the psychoanalyst’s groundbreaking work on this subject, especially his use of condensation, displacement and translation, which are quoted in Kosuth’s installation, as pivotal modes of understanding dreams. Interestingly, with regards to the Vienna Freud Museum and my analysis of it, the <italic>Zero &amp; Not</italic> artwork also brings to the fore the hauntedness of the site, by evoking and activating the spatial configuration, history and memory of the architectural context, what Kosuth calls the artwork’s ‘conceptual architecture’. The text as an imprint of language on the walls of Berggasse reminds us of the importance of language for psychoanalysis, it is after all the talking cure. As well as echoing the multitude of voices indebted to it that spoke to Freud as his patients, colleagues, friends and visitors. Together, these interpretations of Kosuth’s artwork and the lessons it offers us, function intriguingly as a type of screen memory – layering memories and contingent histories (as well as text) – and thus echo the core installation of the Freud Museum itself. From this analysis, it is clear then, that Kosuth’s Freud Museum installation responds and activates the site in numerous ways.</p>
<p>The initiative to show contemporary art in the Freud Museum in 1989 did not stop with Kosuth’s <italic>Zero &amp; Not</italic> intervention. The artist, working together with Scholz-Strasser and Pakesch, came to invest the Freud Museum, and Vienna, with a vital link to Conceptual Art in another significant way. They decided to procure a contemporary art collection for the Museum, and asked six of the most important conceptual artists of the time to donate one work each to what they initially called the Foundation for the Arts, Sigmund Freud Museum Vienna. Along with Kosuth’s <italic>Zero &amp; Not</italic> and his work <italic>(O.&amp;A./F!D! (TO I.K. and G.F.)</italic> (1987), the Foundation acquired John Baldessari’s <italic>Study for a Red Intruder (Blue)</italic> (1989), Pier Paolo Calzolari’s <italic>Avido</italic> (1968), George Herold’s <italic>Amor and Psyche</italic> (1989), a piece from Jenny Holzer’s <italic>The Living Series</italic> (1981–1982), Ilya Kabakov’s <italic>The Man Who Flew into His Picture</italic> (1987–1989) and Franz West’s <italic>Liège</italic> (1989). Thus, in 1989, what had originally been scheduled as a one-person show of Kosuth’s work in apartment 5, ended up being a group exhibition wherein all of the eight artworks were installed in the Freud Museum, and became its first contemporary art intervention. Kosuth’s <italic>Zero &amp; Not</italic> placed on these walls, imbued as they are with layers of history and memory, became the intellectual and conceptual wallpaper – literally and metaphorically – for the exhibition: the piece and the site function as the context and ground against which all of the other works were displayed.</p>
<p>Within and in relation to Kosuth’s <italic>Zero &amp; Not</italic> intervention, each of the other artworks found a place in apartment 5: the entrance hall, Freud’s bedroom, Anna Freud’s therapeutic quarters and Freud’s sister-in-law Minna Bernays’ sitting room and bedroom are all inhabited by a work of art. Each work responds to the site and animates the space and its histories in its own way. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1470412912468712">Jan Avgikos (1990</xref>: 88) points out, there is what he calls an ‘intimation of connection’ here between works and context such that:
<disp-quote>
<p>Kosuth’s <italic>(O.&amp;A./F!D! (TO I.K. and G.F.)</italic>, taken from Freud’s text on ‘Condensation and Displacement in the Dream-work’ <italic>belongs</italic> to Freud’s bedroom, installed on the spot where he slept, and dreamed. Verging on hallucinatory representation, in Minna Bernays’ bedroom (its only access through Freud’s own <italic>Schalfzimmer</italic>), Calzolari’s blue neon <italic>Avido</italic> (eagerness, greed) mounted above salt-crusted bar and low-slung leather belt is an optative apparatus … we know that all histories, in the retelling, are fictions. Who better than Kabakov to demonstrate. In the large outer sitting room, a free-standing banister demarcating zones signified by text and canvas, he orchestrates a game of transference. In the entrance hall, Baldessari waits to be announced.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The artworks engage with psychoanalysis in various ways. For instance, Herold uses humour to play with the ideas of sex, gender and lust; and several other pieces evoke specific aspects and concepts from psychoanalysis – desire and wit for Calzolari, the uncanny for Baldessari. The functions of dreamwork are clearly referred to in Kosuth’s <italic>(O.&amp;A./F!D! (TO I.K. and G.F.)</italic>. Here, an excerpt from Freud’s work on dreams, condensation and displacement is represented on a panel with a mirror in front of it prompting us to simultaneously read the text, think about dreams, perhaps our own, and view our reflection (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1470412912468712">Figure 7</xref>). In addition to these, Franz West’s installation <italic>Liège</italic>, named after a noun which refers to both the German word for a divan-like couch and the town in Belgium, is made up of three items: an iron couch, a pedestal on which it sits, and a document that invites the viewer to lie down on the couch. Together, these secure the installation’s meanings as a work of art, as a participatory and social object, and its dual relationship to psychoanalysis wherein, physically, the analysand lies down during their session, and the way in which the theoretical work of psychoanalysis comes from this therapeutic practice. Kabakov’s installation <italic>The Man Who Flew into His Picture</italic> brings together a painting made up of an expanse of white background and a tiny, silver figure flying into or perhaps out of the picture frame (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1470412912468712">Figure 8</xref>). For this work, Kabakov reuses objects found in the Freud apartment when the Museum purchased it: a wooden table, two chairs and a trestle. On the table are a series of notebooks recounting fictitious stories based on the artist’s life and memories of Soviet Russia. The furniture and painting are situated in positions that encourage the viewer to sit down and read through the notebooks. Strongly evoking the site, as well as the notion of memory, what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1470412912468712">Scholz-Strasser (2010)</xref> calls the ‘objects and memory of the site’, this work animates and punctuates Freud’s life, work and exile in provocative and yet subtle ways.</p>

<p>At the end of the 1989 show, the seven works of art, excluding Kosuth’s <italic>Zero &amp; Not</italic>, went on loan to the Museum Moderner Kunst in Palais Liechtenstein for five years and, following the temporary closure of this Museum, the works were sent back to the Freud Museum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1470412912468712">Scholz-Strasser, 2006</xref>: 4). Kosuth’s <italic>Zero &amp; Not</italic> installation remained a permanent feature of the Sigmund Freud Museum Vienna until 1995 when, due to the extensive renovations of the site, it was taken down. Kosuth visited the Museum and carefully dislodged the wallpaper, turning parts of it into 60 smaller works entitled <italic>Schachtel Fragment Zero &amp; Not</italic> (1996); 40 of these pieces were given as gifts to members of the Society of Friends of the Sigmund Freud Museum, donors and persons who had made major contributions to the Museum.</p>
<p>The second phase of the Freud Museum’s Contemporary Art Collection’s history occurred in 1997. At that time, the Foundation, still under Kosuth’s directorship, and always in discussion with Scholz-Strasser and Pakesch, expanded to include seven additional new works: Clegg and Guttmann’s <italic>Text in Context</italic> (1997); Jessica Diamond’s <italic>Tributes to Kusama: Me Constellation</italic> (1995); Marc Goethals’ <italic>Le Nom-du-Pere</italic> (1996); Sherrie Levine’s <italic>A Pair of Shoes</italic> (1974); Haim Steinbach’s <italic>AHA!</italic> (1997) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-1470412912468712">Figure 9</xref>); and Heimo Zobernig’s <italic>Untitled</italic> (1997).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-1470412912468712">24</xref></sup> Clegg and Guttmann’s photograph depicts a life-size view of one of the bookshelves in the library at the New School of Social Research in New York, which holds the complete 24 volumes of Freud’s writings, nestled in between other texts related to the psychoanalyst’s thoughts, thereby clearly evoking Freud’s ideas and genealogy. Another artwork which functions in a similar fashion is Zobernig’s silver-sparkled silkscreen print which represents an enlargement of the memorial plaque at the Belle Vue House on the outskirts of Vienna, wherein Freud is said to have discovered the secret of dreams. Goethals’ <italic>Le Nom-du-Père</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-1470412912468712">Figure 10</xref>) plays with the notion of the phallus and paternal authority, and is heavily indebted to Jacques Lacan’s rewriting of Freud’s work. While Diamond and Levine’s contributions evoke memories of earlier times in one’s life; and the witty work by Steinbach entitled <italic>AHA!</italic> speaks to that strikingly revelatory and dawning moment in a psychoanalysis when something becomes clear.</p>

<p>It was at this time in the Museum’s history that the Foundation changed its name and the collection became known as the Contemporary Art Collection, Sigmund Freud Museum Vienna. All of the earlier works along with these later donations were exhibited between November 1997 and January 1998; and then again recently between October 2009 and July 2010.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-1470412912468712">25</xref></sup> In addition to these major exhibitions of the entire Collection, the works are also always making a ‘physical intervention’ into the Museum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1470412912468712">Scholz-Strasser, 2010</xref>): shown in varying arrangements throughout the Museum’s exhibition rooms and, since 2008, one work from this Collection is always on display in the Storefront Gallery. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1470412912468712">Kosuth (1998</xref>: 13) succinctly states about the Collection,
<disp-quote>
<p>I thought it would be valuable to put together an art collection in which post-Freudian thought would actually be manifested internally in the work, rather than simply illustrate the person or times of Freud. To honor this man, the philosophical depth and meaningful role of art in society must be made visible and understood as a valuable part of our cultural experience. The artists invited to join our foundation, as diverse as they are, have an agreed understanding of art’s serious intent, even when humor is its vehicle. The art of this foundation is not simply in the world to decorate, it is here because it has something important to say. As the foundation grows, and its collection, The Sigmund Freud Museum will offer Vienna and the world an ongoing record of the work of succeeding generations of international artists acknowledging the imprint of Sigmund Freud’s life on that cultural horizon which forms our consciousness. It is a monument to Sigmund Freud, and it is a living one.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>With this constellation of work in the Contemporary Art Collection and its continued display in the Museum, it is clear that, as the Museum Director Scholz-Strasser notes, ‘a link between psychoanalysis and art [is] established at Berggasse 19’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1470412912468712">2006</xref>: 4).</p>
<p>The third and final significant moment to date in the coordination and intervention of contemporary art into the Freud Museum began in 2002 with a series of temporary exhibitions in the Storefront Gallery. Entitled <italic>A View From Outside</italic>, the series has included nine installations of site-responsive and site-specific works. The series is coordinated and curated by Scholz-Strasser and Pakesch in cooperation with the Society of Friends of the Fine Arts. The artists are given ‘free rein’ to work within the space and site, what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1470412912468712">Scholz-Strasser (2010)</xref> calls the Museum’s ‘laboratorium’, as they see fit.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-1470412912468712">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>These interventions are not a part of the Contemporary Art Collection. As I have mentioned, they are commissioned for the Storefront Gallery and exhibited in what was during Freud’s lifetime Siegmund Kornmehl’s kosher butcher shop. And yet, they have a very particular relationship to the Collection and the Museum. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1470412912468712">Scholz-Strasser (2009</xref>: 31) notes:
<disp-quote>
<p>In 2001, within the framework of the museum’s expansion, the integration of the street-level space created a new external surface through which it can communicate with a wider public. The ‘display window’ gave a new definition to the building’s entrance by providing a platform for artistic intervention. Since then, temporary installations on the museum’s ‘outer skin’ have been drawing attention to the Sigmund Freud Museum Contemporary Art Collection.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The Storefront Gallery thus provides an exterior, outside, public space within which contemporary art can be viewed at the Museum. When it is not being used for these temporary exhibitions, the space is employed to exhibit one work from the permanent Contemporary Art Collection.</p>
<p>The architectural and aesthetic make-up of the ‘display window’ Storefront Gallery is that of a glass-fronted white cube space. Standing outside the space, the viewer is able to look inside. It is not possible to walk into and enter the space in order to be next to or view a work of art more closely. This makes for a very peculiar and specific type of viewing practice and scopic regime where we are invited to look into the gallery, rather than be in the gallery. It also highlights two important differences in relation to the viewing practices of the Contemporary Art Collection within apartment 5, wherein we have the opportunity of being and inhabiting, momentarily, the spaces of Freud’s private life and Anna Freud’s professional practice, while circulating in and around the artworks.</p>
<p>In relation to history, as with Freud’s apartments, the space of the Storefront Gallery has a vital, although once more, a different connection to it. In the butcher shop space we are offered a site that connects directly to, for instance, Freud’s everyday life, as well as the lives of another Jewish family, the Kornmehl’s (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-1470412912468712">Figure 11</xref>) who were also forced into exile in 1938 by the Nazi regime. Within this context, the interventions exhibited in the Storefront Gallery, like the artworks displayed in Freud’s apartment, have an immediate relationship to various social, cultural, personal and political histories, as well as the ideas and genealogies of psychoanalysis.</p>

<p>Kosuth’s intervention, <italic>A View to Memory</italic> (1 May 2002 – Autumn 2003) reflects this connection with these histories in a very clear and direct manner. The artist has taken one of Engelman’s photographs of the occupied, open and active butcher shop from May 1938, and enlarged a fragment of it to fit the inside of the ‘display window’ of the Storefront Gallery; thereby bringing history to life, while keeping it behind doors. The entire photograph is duplicated, framed and hangs to the side of the gallery. Placed at the top of the storefront is an excerpt, in German, from Freud’s <italic>Psychopathology of Everyday Life</italic>. The text reads:
<disp-quote>
<p>It is universally acknowledged that where the origin of a people's traditions and legendary history are concerned, a motive of this kind, whose aim is to wipe from memory whatever is distressing to national feeling, must be taken into consideration. Closer investigation would perhaps reveal a complete analogy between the ways in which the traditions of a people and the childhood memories of the individual come to be formed. SE (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.freud-museum.at/e/inhalt/museumausstellungenKosuth.htm">http://www.freud-museum.at/e/inhalt/museumausstellungenKosuth.htm</ext-link>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Fitting images and text: they respond, activate and resonate precisely with various lived and traumatic histories embodied in this site.</p>
<p>Again, by employing Engelman’s photographs, this time those of Freud’s consulting room and study, the artist Lala Rascic in <italic>A Load From the Inside – Reviewed</italic> (22 June – 2 October 2011) engages with the history of the site, and everyday life, this time through Freud’s ideas on memory, forgetting and mistakes. By making a humorous video in which the artist has inserted herself walking, running, sitting, lying down, slipping, sliding and skipping within Engelman’s photographs, Rascic brings to life Freud’s consulting room and study. The mise-en-scène of psychoanalysis becomes the site of a mystery, clues, and its detection. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1470412912468712">Jasna Jakšić (2011)</xref> has said of Rascic’s installation:
<disp-quote>
<p>The key question is not ‘who did it’, but rather ‘where are the slips’ hidden in the formal or narrative weave and in which places does reality radiate through? The mechanisms of confusion, misreading, oblivion and faulty memories are significant in the construction of elliptical narrative structures. Along many examples from his own analytical practice and from the experiences of people close to him, Freud also mentions several examples of slips in literature in his ‘Psychopathology of Everyday Life’, placing these slips at the same level with the narratives of ‘real life’.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Another artwork that deals with the histories of Berggasse 19 is Clegg and Guttmann’s complex installation <italic>Sha’at’nez or The Displacement Annex</italic> (19th March – 19th September 2004, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-1470412912468712">Figure 12</xref>). This intervention weaves together Freud’s exile and displacement, psychoanalytical ideas and books on displacement, and the Biblical Hebrew term <italic>sha’at’nez</italic> from Leviticus 19:19, meaning a combination of things that are foreign to one another, and thus displaced. The installation is of a usable library and desk, open to guests. It brings together for the first time since 1938 volumes of books (originals, facsimiles and dummy books) on the topic of displacement that had been a part of Freud’s library at Berggasse. Clegg and Guttmann’s assemblage also reproduces parts of the libraries where these books are now kept: Freud’s study at Berggasse; the new library in the Sigmund Freud Museum Vienna; the study at the Freud Museum London; the library and collection at the Psychiatric Institute of New York City which bought books from an antiquarian bookseller known to have purchased volumes directly from the Freuds in 1938. The installation is ‘a hybrid, leaning tower of books, temporarily reuniting his dispersed collection’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1470412912468712">Scheyerer, 2005</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1470412912468712">Clegg and Guttman, 2004</xref>). This annex to Freud’s libraries, past and present, is represented in an installation where knowledge sits seemingly unsteadily, yet securely in place. Through a series of displacements, and absent presences, various histories are brought together in a displaced site: Kornmehl’s butcher shop, now the Storefront Gallery.</p>

<p>Kosuth, Rascic and Clegg and Guttmann’s interventions clearly evoke, respond and activate the site of Berggasse 19. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1470412912468712">Scholz-Strasser (2009</xref>: 32) states about the <italic>A View From Outside</italic> series more generally:
<disp-quote>
<p>The installations confronted passersby, museum visitors and art lovers with a variety of artistic approaches to the site Berggasse 19, and with artistic interpretations of key concepts in the work of Sigmund Freud, such as repression, displacement, condensation, dream and trauma.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>So, yes, it is true as Nixon intimates, and as I have shown, the Freud Museum’s core display functions in similar ways to Conceptual Art. But it is also clear that the Museum’s relationship to contemporary art does much more than iterate these alliances. Like the earlier pieces acquired in 1989, the 1997 donations to the Museum, and the <italic>A View From Outside</italic> series function as site-responsive artworks, enlivening the Museum in specific ways, while also being animated by the particularity of the site’s historical, theoretical and phenomenological context. What is especially important to remember is that the exhibition spaces in the Freud Museum are spaces that are inhabited by history and memory, haunted by them, and not by objects. And unlike white cube spaces in the modern art gallery, wherein there is a presumed and supposed erasure of history and memory, a notion that the Conceptual Art exhibitions I discussed earlier critique, the Freud Museum, even with its white walls, still retains its histories and memories.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-1470412912468712">27</xref></sup> In this space, the Contemporary Art Collection – its presence and display – and the <italic>A View From Outside</italic> series enable certain types of practices to take place: Conceptual Art; thinking art; referential art; an art of displacement, of analogy; an art of classification, of archives, and, to a certain extent of objects; and most certainly an art of meaning and of interpretation. Thereby they make an important and subtle connection to Freud’s interest in art, which was not concerned with aesthetics but with meaning and interpretation (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1470412912468712">Forrester, 1997</xref>; also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1470412912468712">Bettelheim, 1989a[1956]</xref>).</p>

<title>A Conceptual Museum</title>
<p>For Forrester, as I have noted, the memory of his visit to the Sigmund Freud Museum Vienna included a ‘derisible’ atmosphere; made up as it was of ‘fake souvenirs’ within a ‘fake museum’. This reference to ‘fakeness’ evokes the analogy he goes on to make between the Museum and Freud’s notion of screen memories. Simply put, a screen memory is when a memory is screened over by another memory. So, in the case of the Sigmund Freud Museum Vienna, Freud’s life and career in Berggasse is screened over by the ‘fake souvenirs’; by the photographs and the rather scant, almost negligible collection of objects which come to stand in for Freud’s couch, chair, his extraordinary collection of antiquities and impressive library. But is this necessarily the case? In bringing this article to a close, I would like to take a closer look at Freud’s theory of screen memory and the way in which visitors, including Forrester and Lacan, have reacted to the Freud Museum. In so doing, I continue to argue that what we have here is not a screen museum as much as a conceptual museum.</p>
<p>For Freud, screen memories are a function of memory based on distortion, displacement, substitution, forgetting and remembering. Freud posits that in screen memories a child has an important experience that is essentially to do with thwarted desire; it is repressed and seemingly forgotten. This process leaves a distorted trace of the experience as a mnemic image. This mnemic image is screened over by a manifest congruent, earlier, or later, and often unimportant experience and its mnemic image trace. The screening over takes place through contiguity, displacement (metonymically), substitution (metaphorically), or translation. The screen memory becomes manifest, substituting the important experience and memory. Sometimes the memory is ‘falsified’, but, as Freud makes clear, ‘these falsifications of memory are tendentious’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1470412912468712">Freud, 2001[1899]</xref>: 322). The mnemic image becomes entangled and remains so, until it is, as Freud puts it, ‘formed’ by being remembered, uncovered, unknotted, revised, reinvented, redescribed, narrated and understood later in life, often during a patient’s psychoanalysis. Thus at the centre of screen memories and the mnemic image is desire: forbidden, thwarted, repressed and forgotten. We would do well here to bring to mind <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1470412912468712">Adam Phillips’ (1994)</xref> work on forgetting:
<disp-quote>
<p>Forgetting in its versions of disguise, makes desire accessible by making it tolerable. We can only desire because we can hide things from ourselves. The defences, as described by Freud are a repertoire of forms of forgetting … psychoanalysis is a cure by means of the kind of remembering that makes forgetting possible. (pp. 24–25)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This is a rather complex formulation, and becomes more complicated in light of the Freud Museum. To begin, we can now understand why, for many, visiting the Sigmund Freud Museum Vienna is disappointing and frustrating. The image-archive constitutes the Museum’s main display, and evokes an ‘archaeology of the image’ as screen image and mnemic image: what I have called a screen-like display. As we see clearly in Freud’s analysis of screen memories, the image is key to understanding the formation and function of memory, as well as to understanding psychoanalysis as a theory and practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1470412912468712">Pollock, 2006</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-1470412912468712">28</xref></sup> The image-archive on display in the Vienna Museum and the few objects in the waiting room are supposed to function contiguously, metonymically, synecdochally, or through translation as substitutions for our desires. Fulfilling, at least momentarily, our earlier thwarted, repressed and forgotten desires. But, they do not and cannot fulfil our expectations and desires. Why?</p>
<p>The photographs for Forrester are fake souvenirs, and perhaps this is the case, but they are also a form of documentation, a type of screen image, a memory trace of what once was and, in this way, they function as a form of remembering. Whether it be the history of Freud’s life and work, or the trauma of his exile, or displacement more generally, they are a reminder of what is missing, of what has been seemingly forgotten, repressed and hidden from memory. Again, there is this ‘seemingly’ to think and work through. To a certain extent our frustration, anger, resentment, confusion and the fantasies that confront us in the Freud Museum Vienna are the function of what Freud calls the ‘working-through’ of psychoanalysis: the remembering, uncovering, acting out, resisting and repeating that takes place through a long period of time, through the transference in a psychoanalysis that leads to our understanding and overcoming of our histories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1470412912468712">Freud, 2001[1914]</xref>: 145–156). Freud never suggested that working-through was pleasurable.</p>
<p>Moreover, we bring so much to the Museum. We bring our expectations, desires, understanding, longing, fantasies and forgotten memories and their relations to Freud. They relate to his life and exile; to the objects we know or want, or falsely remember even, to be in the Museum and on the site; to psychoanalysis as a history, theory, practice; to our selves as human subjects; to what our expectations are as tourists and visitors to a site of historical significance, and to what a museum should be. We come to the Freud Museum with these and other desires, expectations, longings, fantasies, memories. Whether mundane, serendipitous, highly significant, conscious or unconscious, we do not come to the Museum empty-handed. When we enter the Museum and are confronted by its absences, our desires are seemingly screened off and thwarted: we are frustrated and disappointed as we encounter seemingly empty spaces.</p>
<p>But it is vital to remember that we have not arrived empty-handed. Although there is seemingly nothing to see, I would like to suggest that, with our desires and fantasies in hand, there is too much to see, and too much to remember in these spaces. Too much that is ‘<italic>of</italic> desire’, as Freud would say. And this makes personal, historical and collective forgetting impossible. Our resistances are down as our memories and desires rise to the surface, emerge and reemerge in these spaces; we remember too much, and are able to forget too little.</p>
<p>These memories and desires are set alight and brought to life by what is present at Berggasse 19: by what we are unable to forget. By the fact that there is a great deal that is present. The building’s architecture, including its façade, and famous 19th-century stone staircase. On the ground floor we find the first consulting room and study in the apartment which is now used as one of the Museum’s offices, as well as Kornmehl’s butcher shop and the cooperative store. Upstairs, in apartment 6, we enter Freud’s inner sanctum, the joint consulting room and study, filled with 330 documents that line their walls representing Freud’s life and work. Adjoining them is the waiting room with its pieces of furniture, antiquities, books and documents donated by Anna Freud in 1971. Anna Freud’s work space includes the family’s home movies playing on a continuous loop. And finally, we encounter the Freud family’s private residence that is now an expansive exhibition space. These spaces constitute a complex historical, imaginative and theoretical site that reverberates and is haunted by the history of the lives of those who lived there – Freud and his family – and by the lives of its visitors – the family’s friends and relatives, as well as Freud and his daughter’s colleagues, patients and guests – all of whom occupied it. Together these come to form the Museum’s life: its past, present and future.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-1470412912468712">29</xref></sup></p>
<p>As we know, in psychoanalysis, forgetting is vital to the formation of the human subject, whether this occurs through the function of the unconscious or our conscious capacity to forget. The Sigmund Freud Museum Vienna is problematic because it is all about remembering: it does not allow the visitor to forget.</p>
<p>The challenge that the Freud Museum Vienna presents us with is not that it is a ‘fake museum’ made up of ‘fake souvenirs’, but that it is all too real. In its seeming emptiness and absence, the mnemic images confront us with our own desires, by eliciting us to remember and insisting upon the impossibility of forgetting. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1470412912468712">Phillips (1994</xref>: 34) reminds us about the interplay of forgetting and remembering,
<disp-quote>
<p>Remembering, at any given moment, is a process of redescription; the echo can be different each time. The past is in the remaking. Remembering is a prospective project. But it is as though we are continually remaking something that to all intents and purposes never existed; or perhaps because we are making copies without an original – a representable original – all the copies are different?</p>
<p>Meaning is made, according to Freud, in the revision consequent upon deferral. The status, or the state, of what is forgotten is, in his account, indeterminate, so memory is a way of inventing the past. We are compulsive revisionists with an unknowable vision.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>We bring to and fill the Sigmund Freud Museum Vienna with our stories, memories, desires, fantasies, expectations, as well as our historical knowledge, our investments in psychoanalysis, our understanding of what a museum is, how we expect it to present itself to us and its various functions. This is the fullness that we bring to the seemingly empty conceptual museum. Upon encountering a conceptual museum, something that seems so empty without objects and collections, we are provoked by it to remember what we bring to it. In doing so, we are made to reinvent and remake the past – as well as the present and future – of the museum, and our own. Thus, the seeming emptiness and absence played out through the spaces and the screen-like images and display of the Sigmund Freud Museum Vienna open up to the viewer to be filled again. In this conceptual museum there is no restitution on offer for our expectations, for our desires; with the past, and with our memories. And this lack of restitution encountering the fullness that we bring to it, makes the seeming emptiness and absence all too full; all too present.</p>

<p>I am introducing and using the term ‘site-responsive’ as a necessary means of understanding the unique blend of a particular site (with all of its historical, conceptual and imaginative certainties and contingencies) and the ‘responsivity’ of the contemporary art placed within it. In this instance, I am concerned with the Sigmund Freud Museum Vienna and its relationship to contemporary art, specifically, through its Contemporary Art Collection. In defining site-responsivity, I refer to the ways in which these works are shown and (sometimes) housed in the Museum, but were not made ‘specifically’ for the Museum; instead the works are ‘responsive’ to the site in that they activate and animate in new ways the complex historical, theoretical and imaginative aspects of the Museum. In return, the Museum sheds new light on the artworks and interventions held therein. Thus I claim in my book <italic>Inside the Freud Museums: Art, Curating and Site-Responsivity</italic>, that site-responsive artworks, whether in Vienna or the Freud Museum London, or in other locations, activate a reciprocal dialogue between artworks, exhibitions and context.</p></fn>

<p>The stone staircase was curved. There were two doors on the landing. The one to the right was the Professor’s professional door; the one to the left, the Freud family door. Apparently, the two apartments had been arranged so that there should be as little confusion as possible between family and patients or students; there was the Professor who belonged to us, there was the Professor who belonged to the family; it was a large family with ramifications, in-laws, distant relatives, family friends.</p>

<p>Of course there is a type of empty museum that is common: one that does not have a permanent collection or display, but prefers to show temporary exhibitions. These types of museums are different from the Sigmund Freud Museum Vienna and from the conceptual museum for which I am arguing in that the former always have an exhibition on display – albeit a temporary one – when visitors attend; whereas the latter seems to be open when empty, and that emptiness is its exhibition.

<disp-quote>
<p>The terms prehistory, sedimented layers, and temporal strata evoke what has been frequently noted as the ‘archaeological metaphor’ that is deeply embedded in Freudian psychoanalysis. For Freud … memory was never … a recoverable world of sensation laced with emotion. It is already a mnemic trace that functions psychically … whose substance is marked only by a psychic representative – a coded displacement or translation. A memory image structures for the subject the remnant of unfinished emotional business that hinges the subject and human culture forever between an incomplete past and an ever fully experienced present. This suggests, therefore, that subjectivity can only be grasped chrono-topologically and in a profound relation between what is absent(ed) – the lost moment of formative sensation and emotion – and what is imaged/imagined as its trace in the psychic representational system generated in response to the initial welter of impressions and intensities. (pp. 5–6).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>[And earlier in the text]</p>
<p>Now Vienna’s Freud Museum, the Berggasse 19’s empty shell houses only photographic replicas of the contents of a complex interior scheme of images, books and artifacts in which Freud’s passions and his professional and vacation journeys through art, archaeology, anthropology, and psychology were visually charted in a rebus of images. (p. 2)</p>
<p>[And then later]
<disp-quote>
<p>The reference to archaeology [and we can include here the entire rebus of images that Pollock mentions above] demonstrates, I suggest, a profound engagement with both the function of the image in the structure of memory and the structure of mnemonic images in the formation of the subject.
