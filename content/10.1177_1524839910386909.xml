<p>Effective nutrition education training should be guided by sound theory that specifically addresses behavior change. A 3-hour training was developed using diffusion of innovations (DOI) and social cognitive theories and formative assessment. Essential training components included interactive learning techniques and curriculum lesson practice. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze training satisfaction, paired samples t tests determined pre- to posttraining differences, and Pearson correlations and stepwise multiple regression were conducted to explore predictors of future curriculum use. Paraprofessional nutrition educators (NEs) and their supervisors rated the training high in acceptability, benefit, and clarity. NEs and supervisors improved knowledge about teaching the curriculum (<italic>t</italic> = 5.12, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01 and <italic>t</italic> = 8.31, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01, respectively), confidence (<italic>t</italic> = 3.93, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01 and <italic>t</italic> = 3.62, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01, respectively), motivation (<italic>t</italic> = 3.71, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01 and <italic>t</italic> = 2.63, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, respectively), and information (<italic>t</italic> = 7.17, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01 and <italic>t</italic> = 4.15, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .01, respectively) to teach the curriculum. The DOI attributes of relative advantage and trialability were correlated with intended future curriculum use by NEs (<italic>r</italic> = .577, <italic>p</italic> = .002 and <italic>r</italic> = .418, <italic>p</italic> = .027, respectively). Relative advantage was correlated with intended use by supervisors (<italic>r</italic> = .502, <italic>p</italic> = .040). These results underscore the importance of using both theory and formative assessment for successful training development.</p>

<p>Effective strategies for dissemination and implementation of health education programs are needed. Didactic education and passive dissemination are generally ineffective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1524839910386909">Bero et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1524839910386909">Forsetlund et al., 2009</xref>). Interactive education, including discussion or practice, is consistently effective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1524839910386909">Bero et al., 1998</xref>), and a mix of interactive and didactic elements are more effective than either didactic or interactive meetings alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1524839910386909">Forsetlund et al., 2009</xref>). Others suggest effective nutrition education programs and trainings be guided by sound theory that addresses behavior change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1524839910386909">Achterberg &amp; Clark, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1524839910386909">Ayala et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1524839910386909">Contento et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1524839910386909">Townsend et al., 2003</xref>), but multiple theories may be needed to adequately address behavior(s) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1524839910386909">Achterberg &amp; Clark, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1524839910386909">Achterberg &amp; Miller, 2004</xref>). Additionally, interventions designed using results from formative evaluation offer greater opportunity for success because they build on needs and strengths of their intended audience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1524839910386909">Ayala et al., 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Diffusion of Innovations (DOI) theory states that perceived attributes of an innovation (new practice) strongly affect its adoption and dissemination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1524839910386909">Rogers, 2003</xref>). These attributes include relative advantage, compatibility, complexity, trialability, and observability. Four of these attributes positively influence an innovation’s adoption and dissemination, while complexity has a negative influence. A lack of complexity, or simplicity, would therefore positively affect adoption and dissemination. For clarity, the term <italic>simplicity</italic> is used to describe this concept.</p>
<p>Social cognitive theory (SCT) is often used in behavior change interventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1524839910386909">Perry, Baranowski, &amp; Parcel, 1990</xref>). This framework uses cognitive, environmental, and behavioral variables to explain and describe human behavior and learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1524839910386909">Bandura, 1986</xref>). SCT can be used to study diffusion where the behavior of interest is program adoption, implementation, and maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1524839910386909">Perry et al., 1990</xref>). Several strategies, including modeling, incentives, guided practice, and goal setting can influence health promotion program dissemination and diffusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1524839910386909">Contento et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1524839910386909">Perry et al., 1990</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1524839910386909">Kirkpatrick and Kirkpatrick (2006)</xref> specify four levels of evaluation for training programs: reaction, learning, behavior, and results. Reaction measures “customer satisfaction” with training from the participant perspective. A positive reaction does not ensure learning; however, a negative reaction almost certainly reduces that possibility. Learning measures the extent to which training participants change attitudes, improve knowledge, and/or increase skill as a result of training. Although many training evaluations include some learning assessment, it is essential to measure attitudes, skills, and results before and after training, to fully assess training outcomes.</p>
<p><italic>Cooking with Kids</italic> (CWK) is an experiential school-based program that encourages healthy eating behaviors by engaging elementary schoolchildren’s innate curiosity and enthusiasm for food through direct experience with fresh, affordable foods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1524839910386909">Walters &amp; Stacey, 2009</xref>). The bilingual (Spanish/English) curriculum includes 2-hour cooking and 1-hour tasting lessons. Cooking lessons emphasize foods from around the world. Tasting lessons engage students in sensory exploration of fruits and vegetables, with minimal food preparation and no cooking. Lessons align with state academic standards and provide applied learning opportunities in language arts, social studies, math, science, and health education.</p>
<p>CWK was well integrated in Santa Fe, New Mexico by program developers, but there was a state-level request for broader dissemination. Therefore, a decision was made to disseminate the CWK tasting curriculum through training of Extension-based paraprofessional nutrition educators (NEs). Extension programs are administered through county and regional extension offices, which bring land-grant college and university expertise and resources to the local level through informal, noncredit programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1524839910386909">U.S. Department of Agriculture, National Institute of Food and Agriculture, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The purpose of this article is to describe the development of the CWK curriculum training and report changes in participant attitudes, knowledge, and skills as a result of attending training. A subsequent article will describe training impact on curriculum implementation. The Colorado State University Institutional Review Board approved the study.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section2-1524839910386909">
<title>Formative Assessment Interviews</title>
<p>To understand paraprofessional NE training needs, interviews were conducted with seven New Mexico State University Cooperative Extension System (NMSU CES) staff responsible for nutrition education programming for low-income audiences. Interviews were semistructured, using open-ended questions to explore elements of effective trainings and reasons for adopting, adapting, and rejecting nutrition education curricula. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and uploaded into NVivo 8® (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1524839910386909">QSR International, 2008</xref>), a software program that supports qualitative data analysis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1524839910386909">
<title>Pilot Study</title>
<p>Five months prior to the training intervention, an overview of the CWK program and tasting curriculum was presented to paraprofessional NEs and their Family and Consumer Science Extension Agent (EA) supervisors. Volunteers were then recruited to pilot the tasting curriculum. Four NEs representing three counties piloted the CWK curriculum. Each NE was interviewed regarding her experiences using CWK and suggestions for implementation throughout NMSU CES.</p>

<sec id="section4-1524839910386909">
<title>Training Development and Format</title>
<p>A 3-hour CWK tasting lesson training was developed using DOI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1524839910386909">Rogers, 2003</xref>) and SCT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1524839910386909">Bandura, 1986</xref>) as the theoretical framework. Training methods that addressed DOI perceived attributes and selected SCT constructs are outlined in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1524839910386909">Table 1</xref>. Information from the formative assessment interviews, pilot study, and pretraining survey (described below) informed the training design. NEs and EAs participated in the CWK training during 2-day meetings conducted in the three regions of the state. A substantial portion of the training included modeling and practice of experiential learning activities from the curriculum.</p>

<title>Survey Development and Content</title>
<p>A series of four surveys (pretraining, posttraining, 4-month follow-up, and 8-month follow-up) were developed (available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.fshn.cahs.colostate.edu/faculty_staff/cunningham-sabo/cooking%20with%20kids.aspx">http://www.fshn.cahs.colostate.edu/faculty_staff/cunningham-sabo/cooking%20with%20kids.aspx</ext-link>). Separate surveys were developed for NEs and EAs. A panel of experts reviewed each survey for content validity. The 46-item NE pretraining survey was tested for face validity and test–retest reliability with demographically similar paraprofessional NEs. Posttraining and follow-up surveys were similar to the pretraining survey as further described below. This article reports results from pre- and posttraining surveys.</p>
<sec id="section6-1524839910386909">
<title>Pretraining survey</title>
<p>The pretraining survey included 13 items regarding NE and EA demographics, NE teaching preferences, and format of current youth classes. The NE pretraining survey included 14 items addressing attitudes, knowledge, and skills using a 6-point Likert-type scale. Items addressed NE comfort with and enjoyment of food preparation; confidence with, knowledge about, and motivation to use CWK; and information and skills needed to teach CWK. The EA pretraining survey included the same items with the exception of two items that related to teaching since EA do not regularly teach nutrition education sessions. A total of 15 previously tested DOI-perceived attribute statements were included in the survey to assess prediction of curriculum adoption and implementation. Prior work from our group indicated perceived relative advantage, simplicity, and trialability were correlated with planned future curriculum use and simplicity predicted future use (Diker, Walters, Cunningham-Sabo, &amp; Baker, in press). To guide training development, the NE pretraining survey included four open-ended questions about NE attitudes toward their current curriculum, the new CWK curriculum, and teaching fourth graders. Similar questions were asked of EA but focused on their supervisory role.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1524839910386909">
<title>Posttraining survey</title>
<p>Following the CWK training, NEs and EAs rated the training’s acceptability, benefit, and clarity using a 6-point Likert-type scale. Questions related to attitudes, knowledge, skills, and thoughts and concerns about the current and new curricula were repeated. Participants responded to questions regarding future CWK use. Participants ranked available resources (training participation, CWK video, CWK tasting curriculum, EA, and NE) by perceived utility for implementation. To address the SCT outcome expectations construct, participants wrote short-term (1 month), medium-term (4 months), and long-term (8 months) goals related to implementing CWK. Four additional DOI-perceived attribute (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1524839910386909">Rogers, 2003</xref>) statements were assessed using a 5-point Likert-type scale.</p>
</sec>

<sec id="section8-1524839910386909">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>Formative assessment interview transcripts were coded inductively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1524839910386909">Thomas, 2006</xref>) and deductively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1524839910386909">Miles &amp; Huberman, 1994</xref>) using directed content analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1524839910386909">Hsieh &amp; Shannon, 2005</xref>). Two coders independently coded two transcripts to assess reliability. Quantitative data was analyzed using SPSS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1524839910386909">SPSS Inc., 2008</xref>). Principal factor analysis with varimax rotation, test–retest, and Cronbach’s alpha assessed the underlying structure, reliability, and internal consistency of the 14 attitude, knowledge, and skill items. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze demographic data, training satisfaction, item rankings, and planned future CWK use. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) determined training location response differences. Paired samples <italic>t</italic> tests determined pre- to posttraining differences. Pearson correlations and stepwise multiple regression were conducted to explore predictors of future curriculum use. Significance was set at <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05. Effect size was calculated as a measure of practical significance. An effect size (<italic>d</italic>) of |0.20| is smaller than typical, |0.50| is typical, |0.80| is larger than typical, and ≥|1.00| is much larger than typical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1524839910386909">Cohen, 1988</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section10-1524839910386909">
<title>Formative Assessment Interviews</title>
<p>Interviewees (<italic>n</italic> = 7) were female (100%), Caucasian (71%), and held graduate degrees (86%). State-level (43%), county-level (43%), and collaborator (14%) participants were interviewed. Coding reliability using percentage agreement was 93% to 100%, indicating good agreement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1524839910386909">Miles &amp; Huberman, 1994</xref>). Analysis revealed the following features for effective training of paraprofessional NE: face-to-face training; interactive, hands-on learning; enthusiastic, skilled trainers; lesson observation and practice; pilot testing; and ability to contact trainers after training.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1524839910386909">
<title>Pilot Study</title>
<p>Four paraprofessional NEs piloted CWK in nine Grade 4 classrooms. NEs incorporated two new tasting lessons into existing programming, either adding new lessons to existing lessons or replacing an existing lesson with a tasting lesson. NEs’ comments from the pilot included the need to minimize paperwork, have adequate information about paperwork submission, and accurately capture CWK within the reporting database.</p>
<p>Teacher reaction to CWK was generally positive, as evidenced by comments such as “. . . students were enthusiastic about not just eating the food but where it comes from and how they are grown.” One NE reported that teachers wanted more content in lessons. Student reaction included comments such as “I liked CWK class because I can try and observe the food by tasting and looking at it. We could be fourth grade scientists.” However, some preferred the previous curriculum because they could participate in food preparation and eat more food.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1524839910386909">
<title>Pre- and Posttraining Survey</title>
<p>Factor analysis yielded four factors accounting for 78% of the variance (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1524839910386909">Table 2</xref>). Internal consistency analysis indicated acceptable reliability (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1524839910386909">Table 2</xref>). Survey reliability was acceptable as no significant differences were found between test and retest scores (<italic>p</italic> ≥ .07). Significant pretraining survey differences between NE training group locations included percent of classes taught to children. There were no significant differences between NE groups at posttest. EA training groups differed by ethnicity. Posttraining survey differences between EA training groups included reported enjoyment of preparing food at home, motivation to use CWK, and likelihood of using CWK in the future. In addition, there were post-training EA training group differences regarding level of agreement with the statement “I really think CWK matters. I see kids learning a lot with this program.” Since there were no significant differences between training groups for most survey items, data from all trainings were combined.</p>

<title>Training development</title>
<p>Pretraining survey responses informed training development. Prior to training, participants perceived CWK tasting lessons to be interactive, easy to understand, expensive, and time intensive. Positive perceptions solidified the decision to use an interactive training approach. Negative perceptions were addressed during training through lesson implementation discussions. Concerns about teaching fourth graders included keeping students engaged and potential behavior and attitude problems. These concerns were addressed during training by using specific examples of how to talk to and engage fourth graders. Concerns about teaching CWK included funding for food and learning a new curriculum. These concerns were addressed at training through discussions of budget and appropriate amounts of food to buy for tasting lessons and direct experience with the curriculum.</p>

<title>Planned CWK implementation</title>
<p>During training, NMSU CES state-level administrators indicated they expected each NE to complete two lesson series that each incorporated three existing nutrition education lessons and three CWK tasting lessons during the upcoming school year. This expectation was included as an application of the SCT expectancy construct. At the conclusion of the training, participants wrote short-term (1 month), medium-term (4 months), and long-term (8 months) goals related to implementing CWK as an application of the SCT outcome expectations construct. NE short-term goals included becoming familiar with the curriculum and recruiting schools to participate. Typical NE medium-term goals included conducting at least one class series using CWK. Typical NE long-term goals included teaching at least two class series using CWK. EA goals mirrored goals set by NE at each time point.</p>
<p>Participants were asked how likely they were to use CWK for future classes. The scale ranged from <italic>not at all likely</italic> (1) to <italic>extremely likely</italic> (6). At the end of training, both NEs (<italic>M</italic> = 5.6 ± 0.7) and EAs (<italic>M</italic> = 5.1 ± 0.9) reported that they were very likely to use CWK in the future. Participants also commented on their numerical response indicating they were likely to use CWK because it enhanced current programming, they had agreed to teach at least two class series with CWK, and it was an exciting new program they thought children would enjoy. Differences in ranking were seen between EAs at different training sites. The lowest likelihood of future CWK use was reported by Site C participants (<italic>M</italic> = 4.0 ± 0.8) and the highest likelihood was reported by Site B participants (<italic>M</italic> = 5.7 ± 0.5), which mirrors motivation results.</p>
<p>Participants responded to statements related to DOI perceived attributes which were collapsed into summed scales based on previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1524839910386909">Diker et al., in press</xref>). In this study, NEs summed scales of relative advantage and trialability were significantly correlated with likelihood of future CWK use (<italic>r</italic> = .577, <italic>p</italic> = .002 and <italic>r</italic> = .418, <italic>p</italic> = .027, respectively). The simplicity summed scale was not significantly correlated (<italic>r</italic> = .357, <italic>p</italic> = .053). Only the relative advantage summated scale was significantly correlated with likelihood of future CWK use for EA (<italic>r</italic> = .502, <italic>p</italic> = .040). Stepwise multiple regression revealed that relative advantage significantly predicted likelihood of future use for NEs (<italic>p</italic> = .003). The adjusted <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> value was .29, indicating that 29% of the variance was explained by the relative advantage summated score. This is a small to medium effect size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1524839910386909">Cohen, 1988</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our formative assessment indicated active participation was critical to include when training paraprofessional NEs, findings consistent with the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1524839910386909">Contento et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1524839910386909">Norris &amp; Baker, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1524839910386909">Olson, 1994</xref>), DOI-perceived attribute of simplicity, and SCT behavioral capability and self-efficacy constructs. Therefore, the developed training focused on active participation, such as participating in lessons and sharing NE pilot experiences with the larger group. Formative assessment also revealed lesson observation as essential for new curriculum training, consistent with the DOI-perceived attribute of observability and SCT constructs of behavioral capability and observational learning. This element was incorporated into training by showing a video of an educator teaching CWK to fourth graders. Formative assessment results also led to a pilot study prior to training as an application of the DOI trialability perceived attribute. Incorporation of pilot county verbal reports during training related to the DOI-perceived observability attribute and SCT expectancy construct. Others suggest that interventions designed using formative evaluation have greater opportunity for success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1524839910386909">Ayala et al., 2001</xref>). Data obtained from the interviews, pilot, and pretraining survey helped inform training development and is likely a key factor in the positive responses to training.</p>
<p>Results comparing post- and pretraining surveys indicate significant improvement for NEs and EAs in teaching attitudes, knowledge, and skills, and motivation to use CWK. NEs and EAs were very likely to use CWK in the future. However, motivation to use CWK and the likelihood of using lessons in the future differed for EAs by training site. The lowest motivation levels and likelihood of future use were reported at Site C, which was the smallest in participant size and had a higher proportion of rural counties than other sites. The highest motivation levels and likelihood of future use were reported at Site B, which was the largest in participant size, had a relatively high proportion of participants from urban counties, and likely had the most prior knowledge of CWK since they were geographically closest to where CWK originated. It is possible that training group size or composition affected motivation and likelihood of using CWK in the future. Care was taken to follow the same training schedule and provide the same content at each site, so training site order is not a likely explanation for differences. Research has demonstrated behavior change can be underestimated using the pretest–posttest self-report method as compared with a retrospective post–pre method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1524839910386909">Rohs, Langone, &amp; Coleman, 2001</xref>), so the impact of the training is possibly greater than reported. Many participants scored highly on several pretraining questions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1524839910386909">Table 4</xref>) and therefore could not improve substantially on these behaviors. Many of these behaviors are related to food preparation and teaching skills that NEs regularly perform, so high scores were expected.</p>
<p>Previous work indicated relative advantage, simplicity, and trialability summed scales were significantly correlated with planned future use of CWK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1524839910386909">Diker et al., in press</xref>). In this study only relative advantage and trialability scales were significantly correlated with NE likelihood of using CWK in the future. The simplicity scale indicated a trend toward significance but was not significantly correlated. Only the relative advantage scale was significantly correlated with likelihood of EA using CWK in the future. It is possible that relative advantage is important for all groups when adopting a new curriculum, but trialability is only important for those who will be teaching.</p>
<p>The significance of these results are limited by the following: (a) the participants are a convenience sample, although they represent 78% and 96% of NMSU CES NEs and EAs, respectively; (b) the lack of a control group; (c) potential bias toward socially desirable responses as with any self-reported assessment; and (d) limited reliability of the survey since the same group was used for face validity and test–retest reliability.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>These results underscore the importance of combining theory and formative assessment for successful training development. DOI and SCT were used as the framework for training development and shaped the inclusion of many components, including experiential learning and goal setting. However, without information from formative assessment interviews and surveys, the training would likely have been less effective in achieving the reported results. Although it is perhaps expected that training would increase participant knowledge about a new curriculum and confidence to use it, this study also revealed significant improvement in motivation to use the curriculum. Improved motivation may be attributed to use of pilot study results and having paraprofessional NEs share their pilot study experiences during training.</p>
<p>Recommendations for practitioners who design and conduct training sessions include the following:</p>
<list id="list1-1524839910386909" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Use formative assessment to understand target audience needs and strengths. For example, ask trainees and their supervisors what an ideal training on the topic would look like, including content, format, length, and location. Incorporate findings into training design and implementation.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Ideally, pilot the new curriculum or program with a small sample of the target audience prior to the training. Interview pilot participants about their experiences, what went well, what did not go well, and their suggestions for training. Include their feedback during training.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Use behavioral change theory or theories, as appropriate, to guide development and evaluation of training.</p></list-item>
