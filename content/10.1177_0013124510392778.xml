<abstract>
<p>Homeless youth face many barriers that limit success in the educational process. Subgroups of homeless youth frequently experience the educational process differently depending upon their residential context. Recent years witness the federal government’s expanding the definition of homelessness to include youth living doubled-up. This residential formation involves multiple families forced to live together as a result of economic crises. Although the largest subgroup of the homeless youth population, they are the least studied. This 7-month multiple case study of 4 adolescents living in Los Angeles uses data gathered from interviews, observations, and document analysis to explore how this residential context shapes educational participation. In particular, the division of labor and presence of a head of household influence how youth participated in school. Findings suggest (a) families have multiple ways of arranging doubled-up residences, and, (b) how the families structure the doubled-up residences influences educational participation.</p>

<p>Homeless youth are not a homogenous group. They experience the educational process differently depending upon individual, family, and community factors. High housing costs coupled with limited affordable housing units have led to an increase in the number of families living doubled-up (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0013124510392778">Dyrness, Spoto, &amp; Thompson, 2003</xref>). More than 75% of those who lost homes to foreclosure during the economic downturn beginning in 2007 began sharing the residences of family or friends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0013124510392778">Erlenbusch, O’Conner, Downing, &amp; Phillips, 2008</xref>). This residential arrangement—living doubled-up—falls under the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. §§11431; 42 U.S.C. §§11434A), which protects the educational rights of homeless youth. State, local, and district school staff have been slow to classify doubled-up youth under the protections of McKinney-Vento, in part due to suspicion that families may be abusing the law (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0013124510392778">Ascher &amp; Deinya, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Doubled-up individuals are among the least studied of all subgroups of homeless youth; however, they compose the largest segment of individuals covered by McKinney-Vento. Nearly 60% of youth identified as homeless by school sites nationwide live doubled-up as compared to 3% who are unsheltered, 7% living in hotels, and 24% who live in shelters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0013124510392778">National Center for Homeless Education, 2007</xref>). The exact number of families living doubled-up is difficult to calculate because government agencies do not track this residential arrangement.</p>
<p>The sections that follow explain the varying aspects of living doubled-up that shape how youth participate in school. Since little is known about this group of students, the purpose of this article is to provide a description of their residential experiences. An overview of how homelessness, broadly defined, influences educational participation frames the discussion of doubled-up youth. After explaining the data collection process, the experiences of youth living doubled-up are shared to illustrate how this residential context shapes participation in school. The final sections discuss how different formations exist within doubled-up residences, which influences how youth participate in the educational process.</p>
<sec id="section1-0013124510392778">
<title>Educating Homeless Youth</title>
<p>Residential context influences how homeless youth perceive and participate in school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0013124510392778">Finley &amp; Finley, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0013124510392778">Smith &amp; Ferrari, 1997</xref>). For example, the life experiences of youth living in an abandoned building without adult supervision differ from those who live in a shelter as part of a family unit and follow strict rules to remain sheltered. The sections that follow provide an overview of the barriers homeless youth face before turning to a specific subgroup—those living doubled-up.</p>
<sec id="section2-0013124510392778">
<title>Educational Barriers</title>
<p>Although barriers exist, the majority of homeless youth express a desire to earn a high school degree and transition to college (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0013124510392778">Tierney, Gupton, &amp; Hallett, 2008</xref>). These aspirations may be difficult to achieve as many youth and families prioritize daily survival and immediate needs over the long-term goal of academic achievement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0013124510392778">Stronge, 1993</xref>). Attending school regularly and persisting through graduation is frequently a challenge for homeless students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0013124510392778">Thompson, Zittel-Palamara, &amp; Maccio, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0013124510392778">Tierney &amp; Hallett, 2010</xref>). More than 60% of homeless youth are not proficient in math or literacy and less than 50% of youth who become homeless before they graduate from high school will earn a diploma or GED (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0013124510392778">Freeman &amp; Hamilton, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0013124510392778">National Center for Homeless Education, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Homeless youth living in these communities are vulnerable to victimization and may become involved in deviant social networks that discourage educational participation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0013124510392778">Greene, Ennett, &amp; Ringwalt, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0013124510392778">Tyler, Hoyt, &amp; Whitbeck, 2000</xref>). Violence frequently frames the lives of homeless youth, including physical attack, sexual assault, and observing violent acts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0013124510392778">Kipke, Simon, Montgomery, Unger, &amp; Iversen, 1997</xref>). The length of time spent unaccompanied on the street or in a shelter is linked with the probability of physical or sexual victimization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0013124510392778">Greene et al., 1999</xref>). Homeless youth engage in high-risk behaviors more often than their housed peers, which disrupt their educational participation. Specifically, homeless youth have increased rates of substance abuse, mental health disorders, sexual risk taking, and violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0013124510392778">Lifson &amp; Halcon, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0013124510392778">Rew, Taylor-Seehafer, &amp; Fitzgerald, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0013124510392778">Thompson et al., 2004</xref>). The environmental risks influence youth’s attendance, focus, and persistence in school.</p>
<p>Homeless youth have social networks that differ from their housed peers, including limited connection to school staff and difficulty forming long-term friendships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0013124510392778">Greene et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0013124510392778">Kipke et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0013124510392778">Tyler et al., 2000</xref>). These youth are highly mobile, which is associated with low rates of educational participation and the impact on achievement increases with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0013124510392778">Buckner, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0013124510392778">Decter, 2007</xref>). Residential mobility negatively influences homeless youth’s ability to form relationships with educational mentors and peers engaged in the educational process.</p>

<title>Doubled-Up Youth</title>
<p>A growing body of research explores the experiences of specific subgroups of homeless youth—primarily those living on the street or in shelters (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0013124510392778">Freeman &amp; Hamilton, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0013124510392778">Karabanow, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0013124510392778">Kidd, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0013124510392778">Rew et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0013124510392778">Thompson et al., 2004</xref>). Research is relatively thin with homeless families and youth living in precarious or semistable residences, for example, those living doubled-up. Although researchers are beginning to gather basic demographic information about doubled-up families, less is known about how youth experience life within these residences. The majority of studies focus on homeless youth living in shelters and on the streets—two of the smallest subgroups of the homeless student population (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0013124510392778">Bassuk et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0013124510392778">Lifson &amp; Halcon, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0013124510392778">Rew et al., 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Living doubled-up is part of a cycle of homelessness and often a precursor to other forms of residential instability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0013124510392778">O’Toole et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0013124510392778">Rog &amp; Buckner, 2007</xref>). Families transitioning from a shelter to a doubled-up situation return to the street or a shelter more frequently than those who find independent housing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0013124510392778">Wright, Caspi, Moffitt, &amp; Silva, 1998</xref>). Families are more likely than single individuals to live doubled-up and fluctuate between different forms of homelessness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0013124510392778">Rog &amp; Buckner, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0013124510392778">Tepper, 2004</xref>). Family and friends are typically contacted before social service agencies when an economic crisis occurs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0013124510392778">O’Toole et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The relationships doubled-up families form with friends and relatives enable them to avoid moving into a homeless shelter, hotel, or car when economic crises initially occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0013124510392778">Bolland &amp; McCallum, 2002</xref>). Karin Eyrich-Garg and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0013124510392778">Eyrich-Garg, Cacciola, Carise, Lynch, &amp; Thomas McLellan, 2008</xref>) found that doubled-up youth and families have stronger social support than other subgroups of homeless persons; however, stress placed on these relationships as a result of shared housing and limited resources often lead to an eventual breakdown in the social network. Friends and relatives may be willing to share housing for a short period, but financial strain and overcrowded conditions limit the length of time a family is welcomed in another’s home (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0013124510392778">Julianelle &amp; Foscarinis, 2003</xref>). After the social network is exhausted, the family has few other options than seeking refuge in a shelter, motel, or vehicle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0013124510392778">Rog &amp; Buckner, 2007</xref>).</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>Doubled-up residences in Los Angeles with at least one adolescent served as the context for this study. This 7-month case study of 4 adolescents living in Los Angeles used data gathered from interviews, observations, and document analyses to identify the influence of residential context on educational participation. The following sections outline how data were collected by beginning with a justification of the geographic location and participant selection criteria before explaining the methods used.</p>
<sec id="section5-0013124510392778">
<title>Site Selection</title>
<p>Los Angeles County has a larger homeless population than most states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0013124510392778">Los Angeles Coalition to End Hunger</xref>and<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0013124510392778">Homelessness, 2005</xref>). Nearly a quarter of a million individuals in the county experience homelessness over the course of each year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0013124510392778">Tepper, 2004</xref>). More than 25,000 are youth, less than half of whom attend school on a regular basis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0013124510392778">Los Angeles Coalition to End Hunger</xref>and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0013124510392778">Homelessness, 2005</xref>). An additional 500,000 individuals live in acute poverty, which means they are in a financial crisis and will likely lose their housing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0013124510392778">Flaming &amp; Tepper, 2004</xref>). Many of these individuals and families may live in doubled-up situations and transition between other subcategories of homelessness.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0013124510392778">
<title>Participant Selection</title>
<p>Identifying youth to participate in this study proved to be a challenge. The youth did not readily identify as doubled-up when interacting with peers, teachers, or school staff. Programs or school organizations, such as those for undocumented or foster youth, did not exist at the school sites. Two points of entry were used. First, a relationship was established with a family living doubled-up during a previous research project (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0013124510392778">Tierney &amp; Hallett, 2010</xref>). Isaac, a member of that residence, agreed to participate and introduced me to Kylee, who lived in the same apartment complex. Second, two youth were contacted, Marco and Juan, who participated in a mentoring program through the Center for Higher Education Policy Analysis. The study’s purpose was explained as well as reassuring the participants that declining would not influence their involvement in the mentoring program. Both agreed to participate. Youth were provided a US$10 gift card for each interview. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0013124510392778">Table 1</xref> summarizes basic demographic information of the participants. Although two of the youth had lived in other countries during elementary school, all of the participants were citizens of the United States.</p>

<title>Data Collection and Analysis</title>
<p>Three primary methods of data collection were used: observations, in-depth interviews, and document analysis. Youth were visited or contacted a minimum of once each week over the seven months of data collection—totaling approximately 180 hr of observations. The total time with each participant ranged from 30 to 60 hr and depended on their availability. Particular attention was paid to how youth and families discussed and supported education. The process of observing Juan differed. His aunt refused access to the apartment where his family lived, but he agreed to participate in additional interviews and observations outside the residence.</p>
<p>The youth participated in three semistructured interviews, which lasted approximately 1 hour, were digitally recorded, and generally occurred in their residence or a public space (e.g., restaurant or coffee shop). The first interview focused on outlining their residential histories, educational backgrounds, and social networks, whereas the second interview clarified issues that occurred during observations. The final interview involved clarifying details of the youth’s lives and how they understood their residential situation. Youth were given a copy of vignettes written about their lives and encouraged to comment on the accuracy of the findings. In addition, family members and others who influenced the youth’s educational choices (e.g., peers or mentors) participated in semistructured interviews. These interviews focused on aspects of the residence that the youth were unable to explain. For example, Kylee’s mother discussed her decision to move her children into a doubled-up residence.</p>
<p>Throughout the study, a variety of documents were reviewed that helped clarify data collected using other methods. Documents specific to the youth included high school transcripts, letters from colleges, and homework assignments. At times a document was requested to verify information (e.g., high school transcripts for a youth’s grade point average), and at other times a member of the residence solicited assistance understanding a form or letter. Isaac’s stepmother, for example, asked for help reviewing an eviction notice and letters sent from the school district concerning her children’s attendance.</p>
<p>A qualitative data analysis software program—Atlas.ti—was used to organize and manage data. The software program assisted but did not replace the researcher as the primary tool of data analysis. The constant comparative method enabled data to be collected and analyzed simultaneously.</p>

<title>Living Doubled-Up</title>
<p>The stories below offer a glimpse into the lives of four youth living doubled-up and the influence their residential arrangements had on their educational participation. All of the youth had aspirations that included attending a postsecondary institution; however, their participation in the educational process did not always match their goals. The social environments of the youth primarily involved their residence, school, and friends’ homes. The limited space and economic necessity of living with multiple households in a single residence were shared by all of the youth. Although relationships formed with peers and educators influenced how participants viewed educational processes, this article focuses on the residential context.</p>
<p>A few points of clarification are worth noting. First, the term <italic>residence</italic> encompasses all individuals who live in a specified space (e.g., an apartment or house) and <italic>household</italic> refers to a family unit (e.g., mother and children). Therefore, a doubled-up residence is composed of multiple households. Second, economic necessity, not cultural preferences, explained why the families in this study lived doubled-up. Several of the households stated a preference for living alone and actively pursued alternative living arrangements. However, financial limitations resulted in one remaining doubled-up. Third, the individuals within the residence were not necessarily related. Two youth (Kylee and Isaac) lived in homes where their parents negotiated rental payments and space with friends or acquaintances. Finally, one of the residences involved a household that sought refuge in the home of a family member. Marco’s aunt owned the home where his father rented a room. In this situation, Marco and his immediate family were doubled-up; however, his aunt and her immediate family were not. As will be discussed later, this influenced how space and power were negotiated. In the other three residences, all of the households relied on the economic contributions of the other residents.</p>
<p>A singular residential formation did not emerge from the data. Two distinct arrangements existed: separate households and merged residences. The differing arrangements created differing social environments that shaped how youth participated in the educational process. In the sections that follow, the experiences of the 4 participants are presented beginning with an abbreviated residential history of each youth before discussing two aspects of the residence that influenced educational participation: head of household and division of labor.</p>
<sec id="section9-0013124510392778">
<title>Merged Residences</title>
<p>Merged residences occurred when two households blended families, which resulted in shared responsibility for children and division of labor to complete household tasks. These residences had a clearly defined head of household. Kylee and Marco lived in merged residences that each functioned similar to a single nuclear family. The parents each took the lead for different aspects of the residence and provided that function for both households. The families living in merged residences expected to remain a single unit in the future.</p>
<sec id="section10-0013124510392778">
<title>Residential history</title>
<p>Marco was born in Hollywood. His family rented a three-bedroom apartment in South Central Los Angeles until his parents’ divorce during first grade led to residential instability. Marco initially moved with his mother and sister to Mexico. He had a difficult time adjusting to the new environment, in part because he could only speak conversational Spanish. After a year, his mother no longer wanted the responsibility for raising children and he returned to Los Angeles. Marco moved with his father and sister into his aunt’s spare bedroom. The two households had lived in the same house for nearly a decade when this study began.</p>
<p>The residence was comprised of two households: Marco, his father and sister, and, his aunt, uncle, and two cousins. The structure of the residence was distinct from the other participants. Marco’s father experienced economic crises and sought refuge in his sister’s home. The distribution of space reflected the inequality of financial abilities. Whereas his extended family had separate rooms, Marco shared a bedroom with his father and sister. His father paid rent to his sister who owned the house.</p>
<p>Kylee lived in a three-bedroom apartment in a lower-middle-class neighborhood with her mother, father, and two siblings when she was a toddler. Similar to Marco, her parents’ divorce was the impetus for their residential instability. Kylee moved with her mother and siblings into her grandmother’s house. She described the composition of their first shared residence as “sometimes it was us and sometimes it was my uncle, and then sometimes it was like another family member from my godmother’s side.” Kylee’s family moved out of her grandmother’s house after conflict arose between family members. They lived with a friend for a year until being evicted. “We didn’t have a place, we were. . . .” Kylee’s voice trailed off. They spent the next few years moving between apartments. For as long as Kylee could remember, she enrolled in a different school each year. She attended eight elementary schools, two middle schools, and three high schools.</p>
<p>Her family moved into a three-bedroom apartment with a friend 9 months before the study began. The US$1,200 rent was more than her mother, Lucy, could afford on a welfare stipend, Kylee explained how they recruited someone to help:
<disp-quote>
<p>We knew Angela ever since [her daughter] was born. And we always kept in touch. My mom was kinda struggling and my mom didn’t know where to go. So when she heard about Angela wanting to move out from where she lived. My mom saw it as an opportunity, so my mom was like, “Well, we’ll just move with her.”</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The three-bedroom apartment was the home of two households: Kylee, her mother, and two siblings, and, Angela and her two children. Each of the mothers had her own room, and their children shared an 8’ by 10’ room. Similar to Marco’s residence, the two households merged their resources and delegated responsibilities.</p>

<p>Each of the merged residences had an authoritarian head of household who made decisions concerning household management and her decisions were considered final. In Marco’s case, the presence of a head of household was immediately evident. When his father was asked whether Marco could participate in the study, he responded, “I don’t know.” His aunt allowed Marco to participate after the purpose of the study was explained to her. He described his aunt as “like my mom. She has lived with me for more than half my life. She’s like the authority figure. I got to ask her if I want to go somewhere.” Her power in decision making also surfaced when Sasha, Marco’s 19-year-old sister, broke the rules concerning curfew. His aunt made the decision that Sasha had to move out of the house. Marco and his father did not fully agree but decided not to openly challenge the decision.</p>
<p>In Kylee’s case, the head of household was less apparent, in part because Angela worked two fulltime jobs and was rarely home during the evenings. Lucy took responsibility for resolving arguments between the children; her roommate, Angela, supported the disciplinary decisions. However, Kylee’s mother was clear to note that Angela made decisions for the residence. Disputes between the two mothers occurred rarely and were resolved quickly. Angela served as the decision maker when an issue needed to be resolved. When Lucy was asked to describe her relationship to Angela, she paused, “Well, she is the man of the family.”</p>

<sec id="section12-0013124510392778">
<title>Division of labor</title>
<p>Merged households allowed for the specialization of tasks. One parent took responsibility for school attendance, homework completion, and encouraging educational participation of all children in the residence. The other parent focused on managing the financial aspects of the home. The adult in the residence who took responsibility for school attendance and completion of homework was not always the biological parent. Kylee’s mother was responsible for ensuring that all of the children—her biological children and those of her roommate—were fed and attended school. Marco’s aunt monitored the educational participation of her children as well as her niece and nephew. In both residences, the biological parents were aware of their children’s educational participation, but the daily supervision was delegated to one person within the residence.</p>
<p>Contributions to the residence were broadly considered in merged households. For example, Lucy contributed US$350, and her roommate paid the remaining US$900 as well as the majority of the bills. “Angela puts her money into the house and I provide the childcare,” Lucy explained. Lucy’s management of household responsibilities (e.g., childcare, cleaning, and cooking) compensated for a lower financial contribution. The two households distributed space evenly and the mothers purchased a car together 6 months before the study began. “I get a place to live and she don’t worry about her kids,” Lucy smiled and nodded, “It works out good.”</p>

<sec id="section13-0013124510392778">
<title>Educational participation</title>
<p>Marco had the most stable schooling environment of the youth who participated in the study; he attended one middle and high school. Marco’s oldest cousin, Aaron, assisted in monitoring the school attendance and success of the entire residence. He graduated from a state university and moved back into the house when Marco was beginning 10th grade. Aaron provided academic advice as well as guidance concerning the college application and financial aid processes. In addition, he collaborated with Marco’s aunt to enforce consequences for missing school, poor grades, or any other behavior that negatively influenced educational progress. Marco looked up to his cousin and considered him “like my brother. He is a role model.” Marco’s aunt also encouraged her brother’s children, as well as her own, to attend school regularly. Marco occasionally skipped school to play video games or sleep through the day. He explained that his behavior was closely scrutinized, “My aunt and cousin say, ‘Why didn’t you go to school? You better go to school tomorrow.’” As punishment, after receiving a lecture, he would lose his video games or cell phone for a couple of days. “School matters. You get more money and you will not have to work so hard,” Marco grinned, “and you’re smarter too.” He had not decided on a career, but was considering nursing, computer programming, or criminal justice. Marco applied and was accepted to four state universities. He submitted financial aid and CalGrant forms with the assistance of his cousin.</p>
<p>Kylee also attended school regularly. “I want to become everything,” Kylee brushed her bangs to the side, “Like a pediatric nurse, I want to help the homeless, and I want to become a cop or something.” When asked to explain what she needed to do to reach her goals, she sighed, “I think it’s going to college. I really want to go to college.” She assumed that if she passed her high school classes she could go to college. Although Kylee rarely missed school, she had little educational guidance concerning the college application process. Admittedly, Lucy was unfamiliar with the educational process and had difficulty assisting her children with homework. However, she took responsibility for ensuring that all of the children attended school. Each morning, Lucy loaded up all five of the children into her semi-reliable four-door sedan at 7:10 a.m. and drove to three different schools.</p>

<title>Separate Households</title>
<p>In separate households, each household within the residence maintained responsibility for childrearing and managing the home. This formation allowed individual households to benefit from shared financial responsibility without losing autonomy. Isaac and Juan resided in separate households where families shared responsibility for paying rent and utility bills; however, the households lived alongside each other without collaborating. These youth did not have the same level of supervision as those in merged residences. The primary caregiver was unable to devote as much attention to monitoring educational participation because she spent additional time making sure basic needs were met.</p>
<sec id="section15-0013124510392778">
<title>Residential history</title>
<p>Isaac’s experience living doubled-up began soon after his mother and stepfather decided to end their relationship. In fifth grade Isaac moved with his mother and sister into a two-bedroom apartment with his aunt and grandmother. His residential stability further deteriorated soon after he started middle school; his mother was sent to prison for robbery. “Me and my grandma wasn’t really get along,” Isaac took a deep breath and shook his head, “so she ended up getting me in [foster care] placement.” His social worker tried to reunite him with either his grandmother or aunt; however, both attempts failed. The only family member remaining was his 18-year-old cousin who lived with his girlfriend and her mother, Faith. After a trial period, Faith was given guardianship since Isaac’s cousin was too young. “I think of Faith like a mom,” Isaac explained.</p>
<p>The residence was comprised of four different households: Faith, her children, and Isaac; an adult male roommate; another adult male roommate and his son; and Faith’s oldest daughter, her boyfriend (Isaac’s cousin), and their two children. The three bedrooms were unable to hold all of the residents; therefore, the living room was converted into a bedroom. The US$1,500 rent was divided among households; however, rental contributions were never certain. One roommate moved out in January, and Faith’s oldest daughter disappeared for weeks at a time leaving her with two grandchildren, US$450 short of the rental payment, and a landlord who charged US$50 each day rent was late. The uncertainty concerning who was going to live in the residence each month made space and financial distributions difficult to manage.</p>
<p>Juan was born in El Salvador where he lived in a four-bedroom house with his parents and two siblings. His grandmother moved from El Salvador to Los Angeles when he was in elementary school. She earned residency and slowly saved money to help bring her family members to the United States. His experiences living doubled-up began in a two-bedroom apartment near downtown Los Angeles, which served as the shared residence of his extended family. His father stayed in El Salvador; securing residency was difficult because his parents were not legally married.</p>
<p>The two-bedroom apartment was home to three households: Juan, his mother, and two siblings; his grandparents and uncle; and his aunt and cousin. Juan’s residence split the US$900 rent and space evenly among the households. Juan, being the oldest sibling, was given private space—a bedroom closet. A mattress filled the majority of the space, and Juan rigged a small lamp in his closet that enabled him to close the door and not be interrupted while doing homework. The living room had a foldout bed that his grandparents used and his uncle slept on the couch. Unlike Isaac’s residence, the households did not fluctuate month to month; however, rental contributions were equally uncertain. Juan’s mother worked two jobs to cover expenses, but during the study she lost one job and his grandfather became unemployed. Juan began working at a fast food restaurant approximately 22 hr a week to help pay the bills.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-0013124510392778">
<title>Head of household</title>
<p>The head of household’s role was more complicated in Isaac’s and Juan’s residences. Instead of making decisions for the entire residence, the head of household had to manage conflict between individuals and families. Accusations of favoritism arose since the person in charge was a member of one of the households. In Isaac’s case, Faith was reluctant to take an authoritative role but served as the de facto head of household. She collected money for rent and utility bills and served as the point of contact for social service workers. However, the residence did not have a clear set of rules that individuals were expected to follow. During the month of January, Isaac spent nearly 2 weeks with his friends in a Skid Row hotel without asking Faith’s permission. She was annoyed that he disappeared, but he did not face consequences when he returned after a week of drug and alcohol use.</p>
<p>For all intents and purposes, each person in the household had equal footing when a conflict arose, but a system of resolving disagreements did not exist. Seemingly minor decisions, such as doing the dishes, resulted in heated arguments. Isaac’s stepbrother broke a bone in his hand when he punched a wall during an argument with his sister about her children messing up his room. Avoidance and abuse were employed more often than conflict resolution. When a disagreement could not be resolved between residents, it often escalated because no authority figure or arbitrator existed to manage disputes. “Everyone always be fighting here,” Isaac explained, “that’s why I leave.” Unlike the merged residences, the head of household did not take an active role in preventing and managing conflict. Communication frequently broke down either to fighting or avoidance. Faith was responsible for childcare but rarely monitored behavior. The unsanitary conditions served as further evidence of the lack of collaboration. Isaac was frustrated that an attempt to bring order to the home failed, “We used to have [a cleaning schedule], but it didn’t work out. People wasn’t doing it when they was supposed to.”</p>
<p>Juan’s residence functioned somewhere in between the authoritarian households of Kylee and Marco and the weak head of household in Isaac’s home. Juan’s grandmother was the central figure in the home and made major decisions, such as ensuring bills were paid and determining who lived in the apartment. Her role was muted by her limited presence in the home. She spent the majority of each week living in a Beverly Hills home where she worked as a housekeeper. She attempted to rein in conflict on the weekends, but Juan felt this led to strategic engagement in conflict and manipulation because his grandmother had to make decisions based on information given to her after the fact. Although his grandmother attempted to resolve conflict, animosity built up in her absence. Juan tried to keep his siblings in the bedroom and avoided contact with the other residents.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-0013124510392778">
<title>Division of labor</title>
<p>Parents in shared residences were solely responsible for their children’s discipline and education in addition to managing other aspects of the home. Unlike the homes of Kylee and Marco, daily management of the house was handled independently within each household. The four households within Isaac’s residence were each responsible for purchasing and preparing food, washing laundry, and cleaning the house. Childrearing was similarly divided. Each parent took responsibility for childcare, educational needs, and discipline for their children independent of the other households. Isaac’s stepmother did not work, but she devoted her energy to meeting the basic needs of the residence. The two other households with children in the residence had similar situations—only the single roommate without children worked. Managing the minimal resources received from welfare and dealing with a disgruntled landlord consumed Faith’s time.</p>
<p>In Juan’s situation, his mother worked two jobs and had little energy to devote to her children; therefore, he took responsibility for his younger siblings’ behavior and educational participation. His mother had a general sense of Juan’s schooling, but did not assist with homework or the process of applying to college. Typically, she came home from work exhausted. The households in Juan’s residence collaborated infrequently. Preparing meals illustrated the separation between households. His mother and aunt had a cooking schedule: his aunt cooked between 5:00 p.m. and 6:00 p.m. each night; his mother had the kitchen after 6:00 p.m. Two refrigerators stood in the kitchen, one for each woman to use. “It is crazy, my aunt would rather let food go bad and throw it away than let us eat it,” Juan shook his head. His mother did not want to live with extended family, and Juan frequently encouraged her to find a new apartment. “I don’t really like [living here],” Juan confessed, “cause it creates a lot of problems.” He explained that his family did not move “cause my mom don’t have the facilities to move to another place yet.” In both of these residences, parents wanted their children to achieve educational success; however, meeting basic needs took precedence.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-0013124510392778">
<title>Educational participation</title>
<p>Isaac’s social network included few high school or college graduates. Faith did not complete middle school and only her 7-year-old son attended school—although he was frequently absent or tardy. School was not an expectation. Faith’s 15-year-old daughter dropped out in 9th grade because, as Faith explained, her daughter was “famous with the boys.” Her oldest son dropped out in 8th grade. After missing school for nearly 3 years, Isaac enrolled in an independent study program in the fall of 2007, which required attendance twice a week for an hour to turn in packets and take tests. Motivated students completed 2 years of coursework in 1 year. Since space was limited, he used his mattress that lay on the floor in the corner of the shared bedroom to do homework. A month before the study began, his residence moved to a new house, and Isaac dropped out of school because Faith did not have time to take him to the school for the annual reenrollment.</p>
<p>“School don’t really fit in,” Isaac’s voice lowered, “the only reason is because I get to stay home, but when I think about it, I do need to be in school. I don’t want to be 20 when I graduate.” He aspired to be a professional basketball player; working for the fire department was his backup. Isaac worried that he would not achieve his dreams:
<disp-quote>
<p>There is a good chance that I could get distracted, but I am going to try and not let it happen, like a girl could come and I could say that I am going to do my work later and I keep saying I will do it later and it never gets done, or going to jail.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>At the end of the study he was 6 months from turning 18, had sophomore-level credits, was not enrolled in school, and did not understand the educational process.</p>
<p>Juan attended the same high school all 4 years and only missed school when he or his younger sister was sick. During the first interview he estimated that he was late to school 7 out of the previous 10 school days. He shrugged, “Sometimes because of my sister, I got to take her to school.” Juan monitored the educational needs of his younger sister and brother, but no one in the residence took responsibility for guiding his educational progress. At the end of the study his mother was unaware that he had been accepted to college. She focused on meeting the basic needs of her family, but had little energy or time remaining to monitor the daily educational needs of her children. Whereas school attendance was not an expectation for Isaac, Juan’s family expected the children to complete high school; however, the adults assumed the children would get support from their teachers and counselors at school.</p>
<p>Balancing school, family responsibilities, and work proved to be difficult. “It is really hard,” Juan confessed, “but every successful person needs to struggle first.” He viewed education as an opportunity to avoid negative behaviors and secure a stable future. “I want to become a doctor,” he said with confidence, “I know that if I want to do that I need to go to school and do a lot of things, so it keeps me apart from doing bad things.” Although his residence did not support his education ambitions, he enrolled in a college mentoring program. Juan’s connection to educational mentors outside the home shaped his perception of the educational process and provided support in ways that Isaac did not experience. Juan was accepted to eight universities. After speaking with his college mentor, he decided to attend a highly selective state school.</p>

<title>Influence on Educational Participation</title>
<p>The choices, both intentional and unconscious, concerning the residence’s structure influenced how the residents managed childrearing and daily responsibilities. In particular, the role of the head of household and division of labor framed the residential context. In merged residences, one person made decisions for the residence and managed conflicts that could not be easily resolved. Household tasks were viewed collectively. Daily tasks were performed as a single unit, including meals, cleaning, and laundry. One parent took the lead on providing childcare for all of the youth in the residence and managed educational issues (e.g., homework, school uniforms, and transportation to school.) In separate households, one person served as the decision maker when conflicts arose; however, other residents were suspicious of his or her loyalty to one of the households. Daily tasks were the responsibility of each household. Parents individually took responsibility for childcare and meeting the educational needs of his or her children.</p>
<p>Living doubled-up had both risk and protective qualities. Space was limited. Families relied on the financial stability of other households, which meant the entire residence faced loss of shelter if one of the households fell into crisis or a conflict disrupted the ability of households to live together. However, sharing economic responsibilities with multiple households enabled families to achieve a higher standard of living than they may have been able to afford independently. Although this residential formation was crowded, the youth had more space and privacy than they may have had living in a shelter, hotel, single-room occupancy, or vehicle. These qualities were shared by all participants; however, aspects of protection and risk differed depending on the structure of the residence.</p>
<sec id="section20-0013124510392778">
<title>Separate Households Inhibited Educational Participation</title>
<p>Living with multiple households in a single residence posed risks to the educational participation of youth in separate households. The structure of relationships between households increased conflict, which created more overall work. Living adjacent without collaboration meant that each parent had to take responsibility for childrearing individually. In addition to dealing with the stress of making ends meet, parents had to make choices about how much time to devote to meeting his or her children’s basic needs, supporting their educational participation, and managing their behavior. For both Isaac and Juan, meeting basic needs drained the majority of their parents’ time and money. Both of their parents expressed the desire for their children to be successful in school, but they had little time or energy to dedicate to the educational needs of their children. Youth were more likely in these residences to help with household management, which influenced their participation in the educational process. At times they had to prioritize taking care of younger siblings over attending school.</p>
<p>These residences benefited from shared financial responsibilities, but limited collaboration resulted in conflict between households. Disagreements arose concerning the allocation of space and distribution of resources between families. Since households did not function as a single unit, often the assumption was that one household benefited and the other lost. Mounting tension built between households because conflict was not resolved. Economic necessity kept households in the same residence; however, each family was willing to consider alternative living arrangements. The number of households and their composition changed, at times with little notice. Isaac’s residence exemplified this. The number of people in the residence ranged from 5 to 13. At the beginning of the study, four households lived together, but dwindled down to two during the final month and created an economic crisis for the remaining households. Juan’s family remained in the same apartment, but his mother was interested in finding an alternative living arrangement. Space and financial responsibilities were renegotiated each time individuals entered or exited the residence. The bond between households was not strong; therefore, a household may leave with little notice if a more appealing opportunity arose and the remaining households would then struggle to make up for the economic loss. The social environment of the shared residences was less stable than the merged households.</p>
<p>Parents in separate households were overwhelmed by the responsibility of meeting the basic needs of their children and managing the increased level of conflict between households. This is not to suggest that these parents did not care about their children’s educational success, but rather other aspects of caring for their children took the majority of their time and energy. Monitoring how youth participated in the educational process was, at times, secondary to meeting basic needs.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section21-0013124510392778">
<title>Merged Households Encouraged Educational Participation</title>
<p>Merging households into a unified residence had a protective influence on the youth’s educational participation. These residences reduced the level of conflict by functioning as a single unit with shared interests and assigning a head of household. The level of competition between households decreased as collaboration increased. Groceries, bills, entertainment, vehicles, clothes, and school supplies were purchased together. Families shared meals and had a clear system to complete household tasks. Merged residences pooled resources, which enabled them to have access to computers, Internet and space to complete homework. The competition between households decreased because resources and space were communal. When conflict arose that individuals were unable to resolve, the head of the household made a decision. In addition, educational participation was closely monitored and the head of the household enforced consequences when youth missed school.</p>
<p>Parents divided household responsibilities allowing each to specialize in the merged residences. Instead of each household preparing meals, assisting children with homework, working outside the home, and providing childcare, these responsibilities were divided between the parents. In Kylee’s case, Angela worked two full-time jobs while Lucy took responsibility for raising the children and managing the home. All three of the parents in Marco’s home worked; however, his aunt took the added responsibility of preparing meals and childrearing. The two men, his father and uncle, maintained the physical appearance of the home (e.g., yard work and home repairs). Through the specialization of responsibilities, tasks were completed more effectively and efficiently. The shared responsibility enabled youth to get more frequent supervision and educational support.</p>
<p>Families in merged residences were interconnected emotionally and financially. Through raising children together, the parents had a shared investment in the educational success of all children. Purchasing items together created long-term financial connections that were reinforced by contractual obligations. The car Lucy and Angela purchased together required the women to consider their relationship years in advance. Interconnectedness provided an added level of stability. The families had stronger financial and emotional bonds that made exiting the residence more difficult than those living in separate households. The structure of the residence positively influenced the youth’s educational participation.</p>

<sec id="section22-0013124510392778" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Living doubled-up had the potential to encourage or discourage participation in the educational process depending on the structure of the residence. Each youth had aspirations, including earning a college degree and acquiring residential stability in the future. Clearly, the different residential formations were not deterministic but rather one aspect of the context that framed how youth navigated the educational process. Assuming these individuals and their families fit easily into one category misses the differing experiences, resources, and risks of their residential formations. Merged residences encouraged participation in the educational process whereas separate households were less supportive. This is not meant to be an exhaustive list of all the possible residential arrangements but highlights how doubled-up residences differ. The lives of the youth in this study illustrate the complexity of doubled-up residences.</p>
