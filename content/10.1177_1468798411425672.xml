<p>In <italic>Multimodal Literacy</italic>, Maureen Walsh extrapolates a programme and framework for multimodal reading and writing in a nuanced and experienced way. With a foreword by Jackie Marsh, Walsh offers page after page of evidence that teachers and students can navigate, reconcile and indeed use to improve ‘school reading’ by incorporating multimodal approaches to meaning making. What I admire most about Walsh’s book is her focus on schooling <italic>and</italic> innovative ways of approaching traditional pedagogies such as science experiments and literature responses through multiple modes and new texts. That is, rather than rejecting schooled literacy altogether as obsolete and anachronistic, Walsh gently reminds the reader that there is a reason why literature has stood the test of time and why science experiments and their implications are still important for schoolchildren. In the book, literacy functions on two levels: on one level, literacy is tied to schooling and curriculum and, on the other, literacy is innovative, design based and fairly radical in its approach. For the most part, Walsh views multimodality through the digital, although programmes in each setting are not exclusively digital. Presenting five years of longitudinal work in primary schools in metropolitan Sydney, Walsh provides robust and compelling evidence of 40 teachers at various ages and stages applying multimodality to their literacy work across grade levels. Written in an accessible and friendly way, Walsh’s writing is not intimidating and is detailed in ways that help readers who may be familiar with but not fluent in new approaches to literacy education.</p>
<p>With seven chapters and an introduction and conclusion, the book is both thorough and informative for teachers who need concrete examples of multimodal ways of presenting school literacy, and literacy that is viewed as cross-curricular. Easy to read, Walsh peppers the book with helpful reflections, teachers' comments, vignettes, tables and visuals to illustrate the strength of her claims. The introduction and Chapter 1 are particularly helpful to orient the reader toward multimodal theory. The introduction presents information about her longitudinal research – its aims, theory and methodology are explained and framed within existing theory. To conduct the five-year empirical research study, Walsh adopted a mixed-method design with online questionnaires and multiple case studies. It is clear that Walsh worked closely with participant teachers and learners when planning the programme and worked with learners on various assignments. Structured and semi-structured observations helped to frame her data collection and push the quantitative data collection and analysis into a thicker description of context, participants and new text forms. Once again, Walsh acknowledges the role of curricular objectives and indicators in a respectful way, all the while acknowledging that there is a mismatch that needs far more balance to align with the kind of meaning making that these students are capable of.</p>
<p>The first chapter presents multimodality and orients the reader toward multimodal theory, but Walsh does not hide behind theorists. She sets the scene internationally, drawing on the work of Eve Bearne and her influential UKLA <italic>Reading on Screen Report.</italic> It would have been helpful to international readers to include a North American account of reports and research, though there is some mention of North American theory and research. Additionally, Walsh provides a summary of some of the quantitative research that convincingly illustrates a need for changed perspectives and new approaches to literacy. What stands out in her questionnaire data is the fading role of the book and the increasing role of immersive worlds such as video games and various digital environments. After establishing a need for change, Walsh then offers visuals that push the reader to conceptualize an ideological and substantive difference between reading and writing with print-based texts and reading and writing with multimodal and digital texts.</p>
<p>The second chapter examines new literacy practices that arose in the course of the research. Focusing on a Year 6 unit on Antarctica, Walsh shows a marked contrast between traditional print-based approaches and multimodal approaches by demonstrating the greater affordances of visual and sound modes to express meanings. Close observation of student practices demonstrated more of a contrast between book learning and digital learning. Screen-based reading involved scrolling, selecting, navigating, clicking and moving items on an interactive white board. Visuals, maps and charts were adopted to present information, but in a digital format that was interactive so that information could be easily changed and moved around. By using interactive white boards, collaboration increased. Students worked in teams at computers creating their maps and their visuals, using Google Earth, within visual spaces to illustrate points in their reports. Within the same chapter, Walsh moves into another Year 6 assignment wherein students crossed cultural boundaries by corresponding online with students in Asia to find out how their environments are different from their Sydney lives. Then, we move to younger children and a claymation project. Working with children in a kindergarten and Year 1, teachers involved in Walsh’s research study used a claymation project to teach students about the planting of seedlings. To begin with, students observed traditional pedagogy as the teacher demonstrated and talked about the planting process and the research team then observed multimodal approaches to the growth of seedlings by digitally recording students visually depicting and orally describing what happens when a seedling grows. Then, students made clay figures of vegetables at different stages of growth, staged these clay figures and then filmed them using a detailed process called stop-motion animation, which takes a series of still pictures of the photographed clay objects; replayed quickly, these create an illusion of movement. After the ‘Digivegi’ project, students produced similar short claymation films representing the cycle of chickens from the embryo in an egg to full growth. These film projects illustrate, yet again, Walsh’s multimodal programme over a long period of time proving that reading, viewing, writing, understanding, recording and interacting are simultaneous interchangeable processes that were made enjoyable because they combine innovation with schooling practices.</p>
<p>In Chapter 3, Walsh prompts readers to recognize new texts that can emerge from integrating digital and multimodal approaches to literacy. Storyboards, podcasts, short videos, digital stories and cartoons are profiled to demonstrate that students not only record but also construct, represent and reflect on their learning through the use of new communicational systems. Yet again, Walsh displays an array of new and old practices that can sit side by side, such as: reading – viewing; writing – composing/producing; talking – problem-solving; listening – blogging; enacting – spatializing. A principal difference between these text productions and others lies in the way that traditional aspects of literacy converge to create an interconnection and interdependence between the modes of written text, images and sounds.</p>
<p>Chapter 4 extends this analysis by looking at literature in multimodal contexts. Walsh and her team coupled a study of literature with digital technologies to extend students’ responses to literature beyond the confines of print. To engage with literature such as <italic>The Three Little Pigs</italic>, teachers built on the concept of positionality by watching films such as <italic>Hoodwinked</italic> and reading the book <italic>The Wolf’s Story: What Really Happened to Little Red Riding Hood.</italic> Then, students developed their own movies playing on the notion of positionality. Groups of students wrote drama scripts that were performed, filmed and edited using Windows Moviemaker. Their films were interactive in that students could click on different characters in the story and there was a hyperlink to videos of dramatizations of students in their roles. Using software such as Voicethread, students were able to respond to aspects of the story. In this way, reading and writing were closely linked. Rather than taking the place of print-based texts, incorporating software and digital technologies allowed students to add to the richness of the literature used in the programme.</p>
<p>Chapters 5 and 6 remind readers of the collaborative nature of multimodal and digital work. Social networking and online diaries were used in the research to: record student progress in learning; communicate learning in specific curriculum areas; respond to literature; improve writing in different forms; and comment on and critique other students’ work. To illustrate their effective use of blogs, Walsh profiles a unit on Picasso and cubism. Students used the blog to comment on students’ cubist artwork that had been photographed. This online communication established new social practices and participatory frameworks, including introducing themselves; an understanding of formal and informal registers; the ability to read and interpret other students’ texts, summarizing and selecting descriptive language that is appropriate to a particular audience. Also, Wikispaces allowed students to use an open participatory structure as an iterative text. Year 1 and 2 students were able to add to text, expand vocabulary and, ultimately, to respect other students’ opinions. Walsh demonstrates how deeper learning can occur via social media by having students record their learning, see other students’ work, write in different styles and build on the affordances of oral and visual modes.</p>
<p>As one of the most powerful chapters, Chapter 6 features learners who have English as an Additional Language. To illustrate, physics students applied concrete and digital multimodal tools to their learning of the basic principles of movement. At first, they experimented with marbles and pulleys to consolidate an understanding of movement. From there, students created short films on flip cameras that demanded that they choose fitting songs and sequences and voiceovers for their films. Students who previously struggled with literacy activities suddenly played an active part in the process – talking, listening and working collaboratively were major features that contributed to students’ learning.</p>
<p>The final chapter, Chapter 7, clarifies the larger implications of Walsh’s research on practice and, indeed, there are many. The children in Walsh’s research were clearly engaged, they were working together and apart, they were critical of their processes and products and, most of all, they seemed to enjoy and learn from the programme of study. The cyclical process of talking and listening, reading and writing, engaged students in critical and evaluative conversations. Walsh underlines how essential formative assessment is during the process of meaning making. Of course, Walsh reinforces the importance of design and design epistemologies in informing meaning making. Perhaps, most of all, Walsh shows us in a gentle respectful way that multimodality and digital technologies can coexist comfortably within classroom spaces. Reading Walsh’s many case studies would convince the most conservative teacher to maximize the potential of multimodality in pedagogic spaces.</p>
<p>As with all books, there are some gaps and areas that beg extenuation. I would have liked far more information about the specificities of teacher and student participants in the study. Although Walsh notes that social class, language, gender and culture all play roles in the research, she does not extend her analysis to include a deeper understanding of the role of subjectivities in the findings. By the end of the book, I found myself asking such questions as: Who were the learners? How did she differentiate schools, communities and learners? Did social class manifest itself in the data? For second language learners, did certain modes offer more affordances than others?</p>
<p><italic>Multimodal Literacy: Researching Classroom Practice</italic> is a book that teachers can pick up and read, and then implement a programme in the spirit of multimodality. The book shows us that we have turned a corner and can negotiate the more traditional notions of literacy with innovative ones.</p>
