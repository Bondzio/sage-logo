<sec id="sec1-2050640613498054"><title>Definition and range of actions</title>
<p>UEG ‘Public Affairs’ is still quite loosely defined: if you take it easy, you might call it relations between UEG and public structures (political, economic, beneficial or by other ‘stakeholders’); if you look at it practically, UEG PAC may come into touch with everything from global organizational structures to every single individual (health care professional or patient) in Europe. UEG has taken it quite practically in the recent years. It is a pleasure for me to exemplify the UEG PAC activities with some successes, but also touch upon still unmet needs. If you are interested in further reading, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.ueg.eu">www.ueg.eu</ext-link> is the place to follow us.</p>

<sec id="sec2-2050640613498054"><title>European Union (EU) affairs</title>
<p>For UEG, it was quite frustrating for many years that politicians of all levels (from European to local ones) did not really know what ‘Gastroenterology’ really means (‘What is the difference to Gastronomy?’). Five years ago, the PAC decided to take the bull by the horns and to enter into the spheres of the EU for explanation and subsequent action, choosing a topic of EU interest for at least ten years, namely cancer prevention by screening: obviously, we chose gastroenterology’s most expanding task, colorectal cancer screening (CRC SCR), as our carrier. With the help of a Brussels-based agency (EACON), we established many contacts with EU representatives in Parliament, Commission and Council and succeeded in autumn 2010 together with five very active EU Parliamentarians to have a Written Declaration on quality-controlled CRC SCR (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ueg.eu/fileadmin/user_upload/documents/News/WrittenDeclaratioon.68.2010.ENG.pdf">http://www.ueg.eu/fileadmin/user_upload/documents/News/WrittenDeclaratioon.68.2010.ENG.pdf</ext-link>) and Primary Prevention of CRC signed by the majority of the EU Parliament. This action made UEG known as a strong and reliable partner in EU healthcare matters and had the consequence that it is now represented in a rapidly increasing number of EU institutions, such as the European Platform for Action against Cancer (EPAAC), the European Alcohol and Health Forum (EAHF), the European Medicines Agency (EMA), the Alliance for Biomedical Resarch in Europe and many others.</p>
<p>The work of the UEG PAC has in the meantime become more diversified following the scientific and clinical interests of most of the 15 UEG ordinary member societies, supporting these by taking into account their special interests and needs at the EU levels, including their respective patient organizations. Actions addressed interventions from creating public awareness to improvement of healthcare structures and – not at least – to increase support for clinical and basic research.</p>

<sec id="sec3-2050640613498054"><title>Information outside and inside the UEG</title>
<p>Every public activity has to be prepared, paralleled and followed-up by target directed information policies. The close collaboration between UEG PAC, UEG Secretariat and the contracted international press agency IMPRESSUM (Hamburg/D) has been successful on many levels. Press-services, edited in collaboration with the single UEG associations are sent out worldwide in the major global languages (English, French, Spanish, German, Italian, Chinese and Japanese) including worldwide monitoring of their impact. The website <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.ueg.eu">www.ueg.eu</ext-link> is amply consulted and delivers amongst many features the bi-weekly EU News – especially featuring EU research grant opportunities - which are read by more than 30% of the recipients. The UEG information outreach encompasses also international press-conferences during UEG Week, attracting about 80 national and international journalists, resulting in a surprising reporting in the medical and lay press all over the globe.</p>
<p>Information to individual UEG members is mainly online and strongly supported by social media and web applications. Collaboration with the UEG Education Committee is close as well as with the 41 National Societies Member organisations that in a capillary way reach out to every gastroenterology and hepatology professional in the European and Mediterranean zone.</p>

<sec id="sec4-2050640613498054"><title>Reaching out to the single European patient (and non-patient!)</title>
<p>UEG does most of its work for the purpose of improving the care for a multi-million crowd of patients, and has recently started to also be engaged for ‘patients-to-be’, taking initiatives in the field of primary prevention of diseases, an effort much appreciated in European health policy. This is done in cooperation with patient organizations, the respective UEG associations and the national societies and focuses on overweight, smoking, alcohol overuse and low physical activities.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-2050640613498054"><title>Promoting ‘Global Gastroenterology’</title>
<p>In parallel to economic, political and social developments of the world, also Gastroenterology has to go global. In recent years – with the initiative of the UEG PAC – traditional ties to the American Gastroenterology have been strengthened, joint congress events with the Asian-Pacific area have been started, and – finally – the first moves have been done to co-operate with the Gastroenterology and Hepatology in the emerging countries of Sub-Saharan Africa, a region where only global collaboration can repair what in very long periods of negligence has got out of control.</p>
<p>Finally, that European Gastroenterology and Hepatology has become a ‘global player’ is clearly witnessed by the huge number of UEG Week participants from continents outside Europe, amounting to 32.8% in 2012.</p>
