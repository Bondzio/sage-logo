<p>In <italic>Pleasure Consuming Medicine: The Queer Politics of Drugs</italic>, Kane Race invites us into a more expansive understanding of contemporary discourses on proper drug use. As the title suggests, this invitation is animated by his intentionally disorienting and queerly informed consideration of pleasure. We are all, he reminds us, familiar with the notion of pleasure consuming medicine, through, for example, public health admonishments to avoid eating too much butter, salt, or sugar. There is, however, another kind of pleasure consuming medicine. ‘Lifestyle’ drugs – like Viagra and Prozac – point to the way subjects clearly take pleasure consuming medicine. When the pharmaceutical industry can have advertising budgets that exceed research budgets, questions about manufacturing illnesses necessarily emerge. Thus, on the heels of one mode of pleasure consuming medicine follows another, one in which medicine consumes the norms of pleasure as it produces a market. For Race, this complex connection between pleasure and medicine animates current discourses of proper drug use, girding entrenched distinctions between treatment and enhancement, between licit and illicit drugs. Rather than assess the veracity of these distinctions, Race uses their entrenchment to illustrate how these distinctions gloss over the way <italic>all</italic> medicine is, in effect, re-creational: drugs, he suggests, re-create the nature and capacities of ‘normal’ bodies.</p>
<p>A provocative question emerges: if all drugs are exercises in re-creation, then which forms of recreation do we want to follow? Race begins answering this question by pointing to the State’s investment in the use of drugs. Unlike the bulk of welfare services, which have declined in the face of globalization, the State has actually increased its investment in drug use. Race circles this square by proposing that drug talk and policy stand out as striking examples of how citizenship is produced in the face of globalizing flows that erode what the nation and citizenship mean. At the heart of Race’s argument is a critical evaluation of two discourses on proper drug use – one focusing on patient compliance, the other on drug abuse/misuse – that have been taken up as tools for evaluating citizenship and personhood in neoliberal societies. For example, in Chapter 2 Race points to how changes in prescribing practices brought into existence the more or less compliant patient, one whose capacity to self-administer medicine became a problem that now requires attention. In Chapter 3 he explores the emergence of a second discourse of proper drug use situated in law. Here, Race suggests that efforts organized around this discourse coach into existence a forward-looking, future oriented, and calculating subject.</p>
<p>Race illustrates the emergence of this subject in a number of ways, primarily in the context of gay men’s health. For example, Chapter 4 illustrates how drugs are used to rally notions of the family to privately manage fears emerging from the changes globalization has created for our social, political, economic, racial, and sexual points of reference. It is in this context that Race observes that discourses on proper drug use have little to do with the impact of drugs on bodies and more to do with illustrating sovereign authority. Chapter 5 traces how newly emerging medical technologies – for example the HIV viral load test and protease inhibitors – shaped gay men’s subjectivities in the late 1990s. With viral load tests one could appear healthy while also inhabiting a body teaming with a deadly virus. In conjunction with protease inhibitors, which provided a mechanism for stalling the replication of the virus, viral load tests shifted HIV treatment. It became less about a response to declining health and more about keeping the viral load undetectable. In the face of very demanding dosing regimens and significant side-effects, the HIV positive patient emerged as a subject who faced the future through a complex set of questions about self-administration. Thus while gay men’s initial response to HIV/AIDS involved a collective response to a future they wished to avoid, viral load tests and protease inhibitors helped to collapse this engagement into the acts of personal consumption and compliance. Similar arguments, detailing the privatizing effects of discourses on drug use, are at work in Chapter 6 (on gay men and HIV education) and Chapter 7 (on gay men’s use of crystal methamphetamine and harm reduction).</p>
<p>Central to these privatizing discourses is the way they employ a future-self under threat and a gentler past as motivations for action. Race uses these temporal dimensions of drug talk to transition into the book’s second theme. If discourses on proper drug use operate on the basis of a feared for future and nostalgia for an imaginary past, Race turns to embodied experiences of the present to illuminate how discourses on proper drug use are reworked in the name of well-being. Here, Race documents a wide range of local and embodied practices of self-care – rather than abstract and normative lessons articulated through public health efforts – as they produce concrete sites within which embodied decisions about well-being can be made. He points, for example, to the efficacy of the campy quality characterizing much of the HIV education coming from gay men’s communities as well as the use of sero-sorting, negotiated relationships, knowledge of viral load tests, and other harm reduction efforts that reduce the chance of HIV infection. Through these efforts, Race offers a ‘picture of gay men appropriating medical knowledge to craft a range of considered strategies that attempt to balance sex and the avoidance of risk’ (p. 147).</p>
<p>While such strategies are imperfect Race is not willing to reject them, primarily because they are effective. Indeed, a wry undercurrent to Race’s analysis is the observation that almost all forms of standard medical care are associated with inefficiencies (like iatrogenic side-effects). As a consequence, it is not difficult to argue that the reason gay men’s modes of self-care are read in terms of their inefficiencies has more to do with anxieties about those engaging in them rather than the mode of self-care itself. In light of their utility, Race advocates a careful engagement with them as a means of providing information about the cultural conditions in which the physical and social dangers of drugs take shape. To do otherwise risks misrecognizing, and paralyzing, already present and effective modes of self-care insofar as normative and abstract discourses of proper drug use undermine the concrete or embodied practices that are being developed by users in these contexts. To that end, Race characterizes these practices as <italic>counterpublic health</italic>, where subjects engage with and modify the social and political conditions in which dangers emerge.</p>
<p>For those approaching drug use, HIV, identity, or governance through cultural theory, Race’s work is an excellent resource. As Halperin’s back cover précis notes, Race’s assessment is both radical and responsible. In this sense, it is sorely needed; the ‘drug problem’ is old and intractable; something innovative is called for. I would add to this by noting that Race is also remarkably lucid. Indeed, several of the chapters could be used in a stand-alone fashion for teaching purposes and I can imagine sharing them with senior undergraduate students. My only caution, if it can be read as one, is related to this issue of readership. While Race’s assessment is clear and compelling, it introduces a mode of analysis (Foucauldian inspired queer critique) that, in my experience, may not have as much traction among the kinds of audiences – health practitioners of one kind or another, working ‘on the ground’ – who would benefit most from it. In this sense, while Race’s lessons strike all the right marks for this reader, those inside the citadels of medicine may be less inclined to work through the complexities associated with queer cultural theory. Fortunately, as Race amply illustrates, those marginal communities tasked with looking after their own health are remarkably successful in doing so, even in the face of narrowly informed health practitioners.</p>
