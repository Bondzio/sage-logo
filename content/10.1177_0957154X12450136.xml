<abstract>
<p>The concept of mental hygiene is historically intertwined with eugenics and what it meant both ideologically and for the care of the mentally ill. A closer investigation of the concept and of the historical context shows that different interpretations existed simultaneously. The aim of this essay is to highlight the literary and scientific works of a Swedish psychiatrist, Josef Lundahl, an advocate of the mental hygiene concept. A close reading of his texts is used to provide an example of how the concept of mental hygiene was understood by a psychiatrist and practitioner of mental hygiene. The practice of child-care and out-patient care that Lundahl founded in Visby is far from what we now associate with mental hygiene in the past.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Between the two World Wars, psychiatric science and psychiatric practice were highly influenced by divergent political and ideological interpretations of the concept of public health. In terms of the genetic quality of the population, public health was discussed through medical, political and humanitarian arguments in scientific articles and in government documents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0957154X12450136">Palmblad, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0957154X12450136">Piuva, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0957154X12450136">Weindling, 1989</xref>). The mental hygiene movement was the psychiatric answer to the ‘hygiene paradigm’ of the time, focusing on the mental environment and on social and psychological relations between individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0957154X12450136">Armstrong, 1983</xref>: 28). When historical periods are compressed into short summaries, we often simplify and categorize in order to understand the main themes and important concepts. Even the widely accepted periodization of institutionalization and deinstitutionalization are questioned through a closer examination. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0957154X12450136">Henckes (2011)</xref> claims, the history of psychiatry needs contextualization, although it is complicated and intertwined with social and economic changes.</p>
<p>In this article I will attempt a different kind of contextualization: not primarly by referring to the political and economic context, but by investigating the cultural and social context of a particular individual’s life. When the magnifying glass is focused on one person, in this case Josef Lundahl, the impression becomes kaleidoscopic; the homogeneity of ideas and the simplicity of individual ambitions become complicated. The main objective of this article is to discuss the general understanding of the mental hygiene concept and the development of modern psychiatry in Sweden, and Josef Lundahl’s publications are chosen as an illustrative example. Lundahl wrote both scientific articles and literary texts to describe his interpretation of the concept of mental hygiene. In this essay I will investigate how Lundahl combined originality with mental hygiene rationality. Why did his colleagues agree that Lundahl was an unusual psychiatrist? What was the meaning of mental hygiene as Lundahl understood it, and how did he comprehend the theoretical concepts of mental illness and mental health?</p>
<p>Sweden was not in the centre of the debate, though a handful of Swedish psychiatrists wanted to modernize psychiatric care and renew the in-patient care in the country. Josef Lundahl (1887–1930) was one of the pioneers who introduced the concept of mental hygiene in Sweden. Retrospectively, Lundahl is referred to as a reformer of Swedish child psychiatry and he was also one of the editors of the Swedish scientific periodical <italic>Socialmedicinsk tidskrift</italic> (Journal of Social Medicine) launched in 1924 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0957154X12450136">Engwall, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0957154X12450136">Piuva 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0957154X12450136">Qvarsell, 1986</xref>). The journal’s aim was to integrate social perspectives to mental health, and Lundahl contributed several reports from his journeys around Europe and the USA. The overall aim of his articles was to report on modern out-patient care and the international development of mental hygiene practices.</p>
<p>In posthumous notices and obituaries, Lundahl’s scientific work is evaluated as very unusual and with exceptional qualities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0957154X12450136">Billström, 1930</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0957154X12450136">Lyttkens, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0957154X12450136">Rutz 2007</xref>). When one reads all Lundahl’s works, there emerges a complex personality with huge ambitions to change contemporary Swedish psychiatric care.</p>
<sec id="section2-0957154X12450136">
<title>Publications</title>
<p>This investigation includes all published texts by and about Lundahl from 1912 to 1932, including two obituaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0957154X12450136">Billström, 1930</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0957154X12450136">1932</xref>) and two articles about his activity in the district of Gotland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0957154X12450136">Lyttkens, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0957154X12450136">Rutz, 2007</xref>). After a summary of Lundahl’s professional career and literary output, I will describe the mental hygiene movement in Sweden and, in particular, Lundahl’s engagement in the innovative movements of the time. The text then concentrates on three topics: first, Lundahl’s interpretation of the concept of mental hygiene and modern psychiatry; second, his theory of the genesis of mental illness; and third, a description of his literary works and how they were connected with his choice of professional career. The final part is an attempt to summarize and reflect on the complex picture of Lundahl as a pioneer of the Swedish mental hygiene movement.</p>

</disp-quote></p>
<p>There is a common theme in the biographic depictions of Lundahl: his devotion and commitment to his profession. Lundahl, born in 1887, grew up as the only child in a religious family. Both parents were Christian missionaries and lived in Africa for long periods. His parent’s mission in life meant that Josef spent much of his childhood staying with family friends.</p>
<p>Lundahl started his career as a psychiatrist at the Lund Hospital (1908–1911), then worked at Säter Hospital (1911–15) and was finally senior physician in Visby (1915–30); see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0957154X12450136">Fig. 1</xref>. Among his duties at Visby, he was in charge of school health, day nurseries, post-natal care, family care and prison health care throughout the island of Gotland. This influental position could easily have made him the patriarch of the island’s mental health and social life, but there is no evidence of this in his posthumous reputation. On the contrary, he is described as shy and reserved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0957154X12450136">Lyttkens, 2007</xref>). Lundahl died suddenly at the age of 47; the cause of death, as reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0957154X12450136">Billström (1930)</xref>, was <italic>mors subita</italic>, sudden unexpected death from nephritis.</p>

<p>Praise was muted in the contemporary obituaries. Lundahl did not belong to the category of ‘the ideal physician’ or a ‘good example to others’ (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0957154X12450136">Eklöf, 2000</xref>: 284), but instead his humanistic and musical interests and his concerns about his patients were featured. His publications included scientific topics, recollections of his travels to Europe and the USA, and literary novels and texts set to music. Early in his career, while he was at the Lund Hospital, he wrote an account of a clinical experiment on blood serum treatment,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0957154X12450136">2</xref></sup> ‘Wassermann’s reaction carried out on mentally ill and idiots’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0957154X12450136">Lundahl, 1912</xref>). This was his only medical/biological publication. His two literary works, which were published before his texts on mental hygiene, were a collection of short stories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0957154X12450136">Lundahl, 1917</xref>) and a novel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0957154X12450136">Lundahl, 1923</xref>).</p>
<p>Lundahl’s first publication on mental hygiene was a short article describing his impressions of a study tour in the USA in 1919 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0957154X12450136">Lundahl, 1920</xref>). A few years later his text on the role of home-based care for the insane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0957154X12450136">Lundahl, 1926</xref>) was included in an official report. Next followed a book, <italic>Studies in Psychic Hygiene and Prophylaxis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0957154X12450136">Lundahl, 1927a</xref>) which will be discussed below; then publications on how the care of the insane should be updated, on family care in a small community in Gotland, and on child health at Visby secondary grammar school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0957154X12450136">Lundahl, 1927b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0957154X12450136">1929a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0957154X12450136">1929b</xref>). The following year, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0957154X12450136">Lundahl (1930a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0957154X12450136">1930b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0957154X12450136">1930c</xref>) published his impressions of Mental Hygiene conferences in the USA and England and another short report. His last (posthumous) work, <italic>On Mental Hygiene</italic>, edited by his wife Karin and his friend and colleague Jakob Billström, was an attempt to formulate a coherent idea of the concept of mental hygiene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0957154X12450136">Lundahl, 1932</xref>).</p>
<p>Lundahl was also a musician, and his piano-playing skill and engagement in the cultural life of the island were mentioned in every obituary notice. He wrote the text for the mystery play <italic>Petrus Dárcia</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0957154X12450136">Lundahl, 1929c</xref>) which was first performed in 1929.</p>

<title>Psychiatry: a changing field of knowledge</title>
<p>This description was true of psychiatry in the early twentieth century – and it still true today. The constant demand for change seems to be partly because society and the contemporary view of mental health are constantly changing, and partly because psychiatric practice has always been criticized for not being sufficiently up to date.</p>
<p>The ‘mental hygiene movement’, which introduced fresh ideas and changes in psychiatric care during Lundahl’s lifetime, did not affect Swedish in-patient care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0957154X12450136">Piuva, 2005</xref>). However, the ideas about how human environment, heredity and social relations affected mental health got a foothold in social medicine and social work. In the early twentieth century, social medicine represented a multitude of diverse ideas, including racial hygiene and community-oriented psychiatry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0957154X12450136">Piuva, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0957154X12450136">Weindling, 1989</xref>). During the 1920s and 1930s, two main areas of focus emerged within the Swedish mental hygiene movement. The first can be described as a therapeutic-educational approach rooted in the philanthropic and humanistic tradition. Simultaneously, there was a medical and biological approach, which advocated sterilization of individuals with mental illness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0957154X12450136">Piuva, 2004</xref>). The latter view described racial hygiene as a modern and rational theory, while psychoanalysis was regarded as quackery. Debates about the social costs of mental health care, included opinions such as: ‘rising health care costs and other illnesses and disabilities of certain groups of citizens cause an increasing amount of unnecessary care’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0957154X12450136">Kinberg, 1930</xref>: 293). The humanistic branch of the movement advocated preventive social work, education, counselling and provision of information. Lundahl clearly belonged to the philanthropic and humanistic tradition.</p>
<p>In 1930 Lundahl travelled with Viktor Wigert, Olof Kinberg, Karl Jäderholm and Ruben Holmström to the first Mental Hygiene World Congress in Washington. However, he did not have an opportunity to influence the development of the movement in Sweden because, shortly after his return from the USA, Lundahl died at his home in Visby. Instead, it was Wigert who founded the Swedish Association for Mental Health Care, later the Swedish Association for Mental Health, together with Kerstin Hesselgren and Emilia Fogelclou.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0957154X12450136">3</xref></sup> The development of early sociological research in the USA was reported in the Association’s pamphlets, which included descriptions of the success of social work with young criminals and psychosocial work with children.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0957154X12450136">4</xref></sup> It was considered to be a good example for the new psychiatric care and the developing discipline of social work in Sweden (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0957154X12450136">Pettersson, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Mental hygiene was one of the branches of the dominant hygiene philosophies during the first decades of the twentieth century: social hygiene, school hygiene, racial hygiene and eugenics. The question of eugenic science was inevitably raised in Sweden. The country had a close cultural exchange with Germany, and eugenics was an issue being discussed across Europe. Today, the term ‘hygiene’ is remembered in connection with racial hygiene, and the term is loaded with discomfort. In his texts, Lundahl emphasized his support for a prophylactic and preventive approach; he opposed ‘negative’ eugenics, i.e. sterilization and even euthanasia of ‘mentally abnormal’ people. The integrity of eugenic science was questioned by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0957154X12450136">Lundahl (1927a</xref>: 14) in the introduction to his book on psychic hygiene: ‘With the breakthrough of eugenics (Mendel) one now has a scientific lumber room, where the causes and the differences of behaviour have been thrown … Only God knows how much that has been blamed on heredity. In this way, a fatalistic approach has received an improper place in the science of mental disorders.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0957154X12450136">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>In <italic>On Mental Hygiene</italic>, in a section about sterilization and euthanasia (mercy killing) in the care of patients with dementia praecox, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0957154X12450136">Lundahl (1932</xref>: 202) contrasted the two aims of psychiatric care: prevention on the one hand, and annihilation (destruction) on the other. According to Lundahl, prophylaxis meant prevention of mental illness through, for example, social work with children, education and information. Annihilation, on the contrary, represented the options of sterilization or euthanasia. Lundahl advocated prophylaxis, but also argued that there were cases when sterilization was justified. He gave examples of two case reports on mentally retarded women with several illegitimate children, some of them already placed in foster care. The argument was typical for that period, and the literature on sterilization in Sweden shows that generally sterilization was only appropriate for women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0957154X12450136">Runcis, 1998</xref>). <italic>On Mental Hygiene</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0957154X12450136">Lundahl, 1932</xref>) contains several examples of men arrested for repeated abuse and fathers of many illegitimate children, but sterilization was not suggested in these cases. Despite his criticism of the science of heredity, Lundahl promoted positive eugenics, e.g. encouraging natural ability and talent in accordance with social norms, and discouraging unhealthy tendencies. Referring to the views of Herbert Spencer,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0957154X12450136">6</xref></sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0957154X12450136">Lundahl (1932</xref>: 200) wrote that the choice of marriage partner was an expression of the power of nature and that man’s unconscious works in harmony with his desires, with the aim of preserving the human race.</p>

<title>Mental hygiene in theory and practice</title>
<p>Lundahl’s commitment to psychiatry covered the whole field of mental hygiene, although his name can only be found in descriptions of the history of modern child psychiatry in Sweden. He was a spokesman for new ideas and maintained that poor upbringing, rather than inherited or intrinsic factors, was the cause of mental illness and criminal behaviour in children. Lundahl quoted the Swedish philosopher and spiritualist Emanuel Swedenborg to sum up his opinion about how children should be treated:<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0957154X12450136">7</xref></sup> ‘Whatever the case may be, one thing is certain – that the children are not to blame.’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0957154X12450136">Lundahl, 1932</xref>: 245). His prophylactic and preventive attitude was perhaps most evident when he dealt with the subject of families. Agreeing with his friend and colleague Billström, Lundahl stated that ‘there are no nervous children, just nervous parents’, to illustrate his understanding of children with mental problems. Further, he wrote that ‘perhaps the majority of mental illnesses are caused by mistakes in fostering’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0957154X12450136">Lundahl, 1932</xref>: 245). According to Lundahl, the atmosphere in the home was crucial in the psychological and social development later in life. He described eight family types that could have a negative impact on a child’s development: ‘The greedy family, the open family, the circling family, the Bremer-family, the Ruskin family, the family where the mother is absent, the family that is burdened with hard work, the criminal family.’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0957154X12450136">Lundahl, 1932</xref>: 171).</p>
<p>The typology was Lundahl’s own, based on his experiences of families and school-children in Gotland. With the expression ‘Bremer-family’, he meant a family with a cold and restrained manner, as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0957154X12450136">Fredrica Bremer (1922)</xref> in her autobiographical stories. Lundahl gives an example of the ‘family that is burdened with hard work’, a family quarrelling about the husband’s attempt to expand his land-holding, and all money was spent on buying more land, which involved the family in hard work, while the house was neglected. Lundahl described the ideal family in terms of a beautiful symphony, a harmonized team where all play their instruments well. He used the same metaphor when he described school classses and other groups of children.</p>
<p>Lundahl’s activities on Gotland provide an example of his willingness to put mental hygiene ideals into practice. He personally met all the patients at Visby hospital and, after their discharge, visited them all at their homes in different villages on the island. Today this would be called ‘psychiatric aftercare’. He was also a member of the Child Welfare Committee in Visby. The pamphlet ‘Some Comments and Observations on a Child’s Environmental Conditions’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0957154X12450136">Lundahl, 1929b</xref>) included observations of children’s group behaviour. The first group consisted of siblings and parents, and a second group was formed at school: the peer group. In the latter, the child could benefit from positive experiences within the first group.</p>
<p>Lundahl also discussed how the social environment, including economic problems, affected mental health. He described patients admitted to in-patient care as a result of desperation or depression due to demands from the tax enforcement authority. In his comments on this, Lundahl quoted from <italic>Tom Jones</italic> by Henry Fielding: ‘The pitiable, ridiculous, contemptible, criminal and tragi-comic attitude of the law’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0957154X12450136">Lundahl, 1932</xref>: 70).</p>
<p>Lundahl’s many trips to the USA and Europe were also important for his writing. After his first trip to America in 1919, he described his experiences of the social services for the mentally ill as ‘the great development of social work’ and referred to psychiatric social work as the ‘the most important experience of the journey’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0957154X12450136">Lundahl, 1920</xref>: 8). The early development of psychiatric social work and psychiatric aftercare in the USA made a great impact on Lundahl, and he was eager to see this development in Sweden too.</p>
<p>The differences between mental health care in Sweden and the USA must have been a striking experience. After his American visits, he wrote about the professionally trained staff, the team conferences, the counselling with families, the aftercare and employment services for former patients, none of which was included in Swedish mental health care until the 1950s. Lundahl also met the founder of the mental hygiene movement in the USA, Clifford Beers, who made an unforgettable impression on him. Beers had personal experience of mental health care during three years as a patient in a mental hospital. This personal involvement, as well as the educated staff in American mental hospitals, strengthen the impression that the USA was ahead in modern mental health care.</p>
<p>When recalling the Washington conference in 1930, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0957154X12450136">Lundahl (1930a)</xref> described the vital force of the movement. He also referred to the fact that the famous author and psychologist William James encouraged Beers to publish his autobiography, <italic>A Mind That Found Itself</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0957154X12450136">Beers, 1908</xref>), in which he described the onset of his illness followed by years of treatment at various psychiatric hospitals. When Dagmar Enqvist, Lundahl’s personal secretary, describes Lundahl’s excitement over meeting Beers, one senses that Lundahl had met a soulmate, someone who shared in the tireless efforts to transform mental health care: ‘Beers evangelized during his manic periods and there was something similar with Joseph Lundahl.’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0957154X12450136">Lyttkens, 2007</xref>: 161).</p>

<title>Art and mental hygiene</title>
<p>Lundahl’s scientific theory is presented in two publications: his book <italic>Studies in Psychic Hygiene and Prophylaxis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0957154X12450136">1927a</xref>) and his university dissertation <italic>On Mental Hygiene</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0957154X12450136">1932</xref>). The latter consists of 207 case reports from his work on Gotland, interspersed with literary quotations and fragments of theoretical and philosophical reasoning. It contains numerous quotations from William James, Emanuel Swedenborg, Goethe, Nietzsche and Kirkegaard. Lundahl’s own ideas about the causes behind mental illness in <italic>Studies in Psychic Hygiene and Prophylaxis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0957154X12450136">1927a</xref>) – a sober title that hides the content well – were heavily influenced by Swedenborg’s thoughts about life and spirituality. Lundahl’s own interpretation of spiritual life seems strange today, but his scientific work in the field of psychiatry was an attempt to blend the various theories of biology, psychology and physics, and his thinking contained elements of religion, philosophy and existential psychology: ‘Sun and love is nature’s own preventive method.’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0957154X12450136">Lundahl, 1932</xref>: 39).</p>
<p>The unfinished and fragmentary format of <italic>On Mental Hygiene</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0957154X12450136">Lundahl, 1932</xref>) was due to the fact that the final text was assembled by friends and colleagues. The main content can best be described as religious pragmatism and natural romanticism influenced by ideas from early humanistic psychology. The case reports are arranged by the following themes: family, environment, mental trauma, and emotional life. These reports are told as dramas in which emotional conflicts, family history, external conditions and traumatic life events are presented as plausible explanations of mental illness. Lundahl also used the main characters in fiction and drama, as well as personal material from famous writers, as material for his case studies. For example, he describes August Strindberg as a man with ‘enlarged self-confidence’.</p>
<p>Lundahl had developed his argument about how mental illness could be understood, and even prevented by the power of art, in <italic>Studies in Psychic Hygiene and Prophylaxis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0957154X12450136">1927a</xref>). He classifies the causes of mental illness into four categories; ‘Immunity’, ‘Storing of sunlight’, ‘Gymnastics of the soul’, and ‘Curing nostalgia’. In order to explain how ‘immunity’ works, he draws a parallel with the production of vaccines: to practise art is similar to vaccination against metal illness. Furthermore, some clever people produce ‘vaccine’ (art) which other people consume and are thereby immunized against illness. As an example, he refers to Jesus Christ as a victim of sacrifice and, at the same time, a producer of ‘vaccine’. He also compares his own theory of immunity to Freud’s theory of psychic sublimation (although Freud is rarely mentioned in Lundahl’s texts).</p>
<p>In discussing immunity, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0957154X12450136">Lundahl (1932</xref>: 56) says: ‘Children need immunity to handle the trials of life’. With regard to school-work, he maintains that music can enhance self-confidence in children with unusually poor upbringing; music is a positive experience, and also a vaccine. However, ‘A boring environment is like bad music’. Immunization consists of a good upbringing, good relations with a small number of siblings, and realistic challenges in childhood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0957154X12450136">Lundahl, 1932</xref>: 38).</p>
<p>The next part of Lundahl’s theory, ‘Storing of sunlight’, did not have a medical parallel. Dutch tulip bulbs are his example of how energy is stored from sunlight, and his vivid description takes the reader from the Haarlem tulip fields to the van Gogh Museum. The tulip flowers become manure, but the bulbs store energy and sunlight, and all the colours are spread throughout the world. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0957154X12450136">Lundahl (1927a</xref>: 38–9) links this to the destiny of van Gogh: ‘Van Gogh’s life bore witness to an incredible and burning love of humanity which was ravaged to the ground. The world did not want him, as he mingled with the scum of society. But his paintings stored the health-giving light of the sun, the health-giving light that people rejected, when it came from van Gogh himself.’</p>
<p>Lundahl’s interpretation of ‘Gymnastics of the soul’ includes spiritual and cultural activities, and his explanation is also a complicated mechanical and neurological model; in this, he refers to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0957154X12450136">Claparede (1897)</xref>, a well-known scientist who presented the idea of the body as a large reservoir of energy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0957154X12450136">Lundahl, 1932</xref>: 52). The reservoir (the body) is equipped with taps belonging to different tubes, all of them connected to special reactions. The taps are shut with locks, and the keys to the locks are the ‘innervations’. Music, for example, is one of the ‘innervations’ and provokes reactions. To clarify this, Lundahl uses the example of a musical piece, a ‘fugue’. The fugue is a mental hygiene cleansing process which ‘innervates’ various centres of the soul. The act of listening opens the channels, and body movements trigger the mechanisms. Based on this idea, Lundahl practised movements to music with the patients at Visby hospital.</p>
<p>‘Curing nostalgia’ is about feelings of being an outcast or otherwise different from others. Lundahl gives an analogy with the immigrant, ‘the alien blood’. He describes the artist as a person able to cope with nostalgia. The poem or the painting is the space offered for those who feel alienated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0957154X12450136">Lundahl, 1927a</xref>: 42). As an example, Lundahl describes his amazement at a patient’s skill in expressing himself in words, and he quotes several pages of text, such as:
<disp-quote>
<p>‘In my still, gloomy, suicidal solitude I must write a few lines. Everything has seemed as a huge mistake, a denial of healthy nature. The only happiness I can find now is to flee from the grey, prosaic coldness of reality, and dream myself to peacefulness in an invisible world of imagination. No blessed intoxication of the perfume of flowers and the flush of dawn, of sunny happiness, no eternal summer of love and beauty, will ever be mine again … I am the fallen king in the dreamworld of poetry’. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0957154X12450136">Lundahl, 1932</xref>:72–3)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Another example of otherness and feelings of alienation is the child in foster care. Lundahl argues that foster care can be harmful to the child’s mental development if the child is too different from the foster parents: ‘A child from southern Europe with brown eyes should not live with a cool, blue-eyed Scandinavian family and vice versa.’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0957154X12450136">Lundahl, 1932</xref>: 31). He stresses the importance of matching the psychological characteristics of the child and the members of the foster family. Under the heading ‘nostalgia’, the homesickness, he also quotes from one of his early publications (Lundahl, pseud. Sven Falk, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0957154X12450136">1917</xref>). His short story ‘The Downfall of Arthur West’, which he uses as autobiographical material to illustrate religious problems, treats conflicts between the morale of the religious home and the outside world. ‘Arthur felt ashamed. He discovered something that he never thought of before. All his life he had been ashamed of his faith. The constant disrespect towards everything religious had gradually made him feel as if he belonged to a despised class, simply because he was a believer.’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0957154X12450136">Lundahl, 1932</xref>: 159). Lundahl wrote in the comments to the case that the child was exposed to a disparaging attitude from the outside world, which later, when the feelings of poor self-esteem occur together with erotic and religious needs, becomes a major conflict in a disastrous way. In ‘Curing nostalgia’, the distinctions between fiction and science become blurred.</p>

<title>A pondering mind – writing novels</title>
<p>The leading characters of Lundahl’s short stories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0957154X12450136">1917</xref>) are young men – a psychiatrist, a clerk and an artist – troubled by the task of fulfilling their duties and easing human suffering. The leading characters’ faltering self-esteem is a recurring theme; another is the feeling of alienation when in the company of others. The pious home, the period of studying, and the experience of the first years of medical practice can clearly be understood as reference points to Lundahl’s own life. The following extracts from Lundahl’s literary writing illustrate how his fiction merges with the ideas in <italic>Studies in Psychic Hygiene and Prophylaxis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0957154X12450136">1927a</xref>) and <italic>On Mental Hygiene</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0957154X12450136">1932</xref>). The quotations are selected in order to describe the main psychological conflicts, and they are, I believe, also comparable with the author’s own feelings about his career – priest, psychiatrist or musician?</p>
<p>In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0957154X12450136">Lundahl’s (1917)</xref> collection of short stories, <italic>Conflicts</italic>, published under the pseudonym Sven Falk, ‘The Downfall of Arthur West’ is about Arthur, a young man who became a priest. It starts with a quotation from <italic>The Prince</italic> by Machiavelli: ‘So great is the difference between the manner that you can, and the manner that you should, live that sticking to the latter drives you to ruin rather than salvation.’ (p. 75). This describes the onerous duty of the hero: the mission to help other humans. A plausible interpretation is that Lundahl was trying to express the moral legacy of his pious parents. The following lines show the distance between the father and the son; soon after the encounter, the father commits suicide: ‘He made Arthur give his word never to forget the people who live with constant anxiety, and Arthur had to promise to seek out the distressed people and try to give them a word of comfort … he could never escape the sad eyes of his father, and he wondered how he could fulfil his father’s will …’ (p. 75). To comfort distressed people was a task for both a psychiatrist and a priest. The spiritual and religious vocation was present in Lundahl’s professional life as a psychiatrist. Arthur is haunted by fear of death and the following describes an anxiety attack: ‘It was as if something had insidiously taken possession of his entire body, and the heavy feeling on his chest tormented him. He groaned loudly and walked slowly towards the classroom. He repeated again and again to himself: ‘death, death … holding hard into necessity and the pain in his chest increased.’ (p. 76). Voluntary social work could offer some relief, and Arthur reflects on his meeting with two retired military men who were engaged in charity work: ‘He suddenly understood that this primitive bond between people of very different classes was more important than anything else in life.’ (p. 8). This is an obvious parallel with Lundahl’s parents’ missionary work in Africa. The short story ends with a very detailed description of Arthur’s suicide.</p>
<p><italic>The Inescapable</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0957154X12450136">1923</xref>), Lundahl’s last fictional story, was published under his real name, not a pseudonym. The novel was structured as a case study of how a young man, Gösta, fell ill and finally killed himself. Each family member has a chapter. Their personal stories are woven together into one ‘inescapable’ process. The book partly reflects Lundahl’s own life. The main character is a young trainee who expresses his thoughts about his work in a mental hospital.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The internal world of the hospital begins to form a special world of its own. You become attached to the insane in a special way. The variety of different forms and the captivating freshness of pure mania take away the artificial; the human crystallizes as in a Shakespeare drama, the mix of fear, compassion and the redemption of a gentle smile. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0957154X12450136">Lundahl, 1923</xref>: 104)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This can be rendered either as a romanticization of mental affliction or a sincere fascination with the authenticity of the patients. The following is about a meeting with a patient for whom Gösta felt much sympathy. ‘His strangely empty eyes caught Gösta and in a moment he understood, it was his own formula, the reduction of the equation of life, the circle of eternal time, and outside the emptiness.’ (p. 108). This understanding was probably the impetus in his tireless work with the mentally ill and desperate people. In a final example, Lundahl voices his criticism of the standard clinical work at mental hospitals and asylums: ‘He took his notes, as he had done every day before while his colleague explored the case. It was downright ridiculous to see the failures of the officious practice of psychiatric work.’ (p. 123). Gösta, the main character in the novel, lacks an existential and human perspective on the patient’s problems – a perspective that became the overall theme of Lundahl’s career as a psychiatrist.</p>

<title>The clergyman’s gown or the doctor’s white coat</title>
<p>Lundahl’s writings and his ideas about the causes behind mental illness may seem strange to the reader of today. Nevertheless, he was a respected and trusted member of the Swedish Medical Society. His ambivalence about his choice of career cannot just be understood as general doubts; rather, it was an expression of a genuine Renaissance ideal, a sign of good breeding and manners. The romanticism of nature and science that became obvious when he outlined his theories was also permissible for a person who was both educated and trained. Perhaps this kind of professional space has diminished today, when the ideals of specialization, evidence-based research, quality control and peer professional ethics dominate the culture of medicine.</p>
<p>Another plausible conclusion about Lundahl’s ideas is that the once new and radical mental hygiene movement could accommodate many opponents to traditional mental health care. In his role as a hospital physician, he fought against the mainstream. The psychiatrists of the humanistic branch of the mental hygiene movement in Sweden were generally engaged in out-patient care, community-based care and cooperation with social counselling work. The big expansion of institutional care during the development of the Swedish welfare state dominated our understanding of the history of psychiatry in this country. Psychiatrists in mental hospitals had great influence in official investigations that developed expansion of institutional care and sterilization of the mentally ill (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0957154X12450136">Piuva, 2010</xref>). It is also possible that Lundahl’s service in Visby allowed him a more independent attitude towards mainstream psychiatry.</p>
<p>Lundahl’s untimely and unexpected death thwarted his ambition to have an impact on the Swedish mental hygiene movement. Later, the theories of psychoanalysis had a great influence on mental health practice and child psychiatry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0957154X12450136">Luttenberger, 1989</xref>). Lundahl was a forerunner in emphasizing the importance of social environment, upbringing and family relations. One can speculate that the main reason for the acceptance of this strange character within the Medical Society was that he did not advocate psychoanalytic theories. Christian morality and philanthropic ideals were allowed in the Medical Society in Sweden at that time. Psychoanalysis, on the contrary, was deemed to be the devil’s mission, immoral and irresponsible. This is the strong impression given by the <italic>Socialmedicinsk tidskrift</italic> (The Sociomedical Journal) between 1920 and 1930 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0957154X12450136">Piuva, 2004</xref>). Also historical research has revealed the difficulties encountered by spokesmen for psychoanalysis in Sweden, such as Poul Bjerre (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0957154X12450136">Johansson, 1999</xref>). The fact that Lundahl did not advocate psychoanalytical thinking might explain the absence of references to him in contemporary historical writings about early work in child psychiatry, psychoanalysis and psychosocial work. Occasionally, his name is mentioned, perhaps just to indicate that child psychiatry in Sweden has an early history of radicals.</p>
<p>As already noted, Josef Lundahl has been described as an unusual and exceptional physician and psychiatrist. The unusual quality was shown in his great ambition to unite nature, spirituality and science. His speculations involved much fantasy, though the parallels he drew with music and poetry should be understood as serious efforts to explain the functions of the human soul. His book containing his theories of immunity, storing of sunlight, gymnastics of the soul and curing nostalgia was produced by an acknowledged publisher. The thesis <italic>On Mental Hygiene</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0957154X12450136">Lundahl, 1932</xref>) is a very strange publication in the medical series <italic>Acta psychiatrica et neurologica</italic>. In the preface his colleague Billström wrote that Lundahl did not have the opportunity to complete this thesis. However, the published text <italic>Studies in Psychic Hygiene and Prophylaxis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0957154X12450136">Lundahl, 1927a</xref>) has the same aphoristic style regarding references to philosophy and literature.</p>
<p>When Lundahl dealt with the subject ‘Curing nostalgia’, he presented some vivid descriptions about feelings of alienation. In both the above texts, he merged a literary approach with a scientific one. The texts also refer to each other. Parts of the short story ‘The conflict’ were treated as real-life examples in <italic>On Mental Hygiene</italic>. Likewise, Lundahl used his pseudonym Sven Falk as an example from his psychiatric practice. In his section on ‘Curing nostalgia’ it is difficult to discern what came from Lundahl himself and what from his clinical experience.</p>
<p>After reading Lundahl’s two fictional works, one naturally wonders whether Lundahl’s sudden and unexpected death could have been a suicide. This idea is contradicted by the fact that death notices and obituaries for doctors in the latter half of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries did not conceal suicide as the cause of death. Rather, suicide would contribute to the creation of a heroic ethos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0957154X12450136">Eklöf, 2000</xref>: 293–4). In reading Lundahl’s texts one learns that contemporary understanding about what is acceptable has a great impact on our understanding of history. The concept of mental hygiene, as Lundahl understood it, does not fit into the present-day view of what mental hygiene represented at that time. However, his idea of out-patient care and his understanding of mental illness through family and social contexts later became the hallmarks of social psychiatry (in the 1970s). Mental hygiene was the term for socially oriented ideas in the early twentieth century, whereas today we talk about psychosocial factors.</p>
<p>The illusion of psychiatry as a changing field of knowledge – obviously a never-ending change – and our need to show contemporary ideas of development and change in a good light, inevitably distort our picture of previous periods in psychiatry. The ‘great narrative of progress’ demands simplification of the history. Lundahl, and the texts he wrote, challenge the idea of making statements about what was ‘typical of that time’.</p>

<p>The question of the influence of ‘heredity vis-à-vis environment’ in relation to mental health was a topic of discussion in medical journals in Sweden between the two World Wars. The idea that the environment (social and psychological) was the most crucial factor for the development of the child became important in the 1950s and 1960s and had a great impact on the development of child welfare in Sweden.</p>
