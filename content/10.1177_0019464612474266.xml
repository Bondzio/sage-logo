<p>Despite the enormous roles they have played in shaping the histories of Oman and East Africa, the merchants of Kachchh have not been considered historical subjects worthy of study. That is, until now. Chhaya Goswami’s <italic>The Call of the Sea</italic> is the first take on the subject in any detail. The result is comprehensive—indeed, almost encyclopaedic—though of varying degrees of analytic depth.</p>
<p>Goswami’s book consists of five substantive chapters, along with a short introduction and conclusion. The first chapter explores the contours of Kachchh’s history and society, outlining the possible reasons behind Kachchhi mercantile emigration during the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. From there, the author takes the reader to the Gulf of Oman, detailing the customs and changing fortunes of Muscat’s Kachchhi community during the second half of the nineteenth century. In the third chapter, the author moves from Muscat to Zanzibar, treating readers to a thorough overview of the history of East Africa’s Kachchhis: their commerce, their moneylending activities and their relationship with European and American merchants residing in Zanzibar.</p>
<p>In both the Muscat and Zanzibar chapters, the author provides biographical sketches of famous merchants, detailing their rise and their decline. Following on this, and in what is perhaps the book’s most original and compelling chapter, she delves into the history of the firm of Jairam Shivji, who was arguably East Africa’s most successful Kachchhi trader. In it, she explores Shivji’s life history, his relations with his agents (particularly Ladha Dhamji, his longest-serving agent) and his connections to the families of the sultans of Muscat and Zanzibar are all explored with exacting detail. In the last substantive chapter, Goswami discusses Kachchhi involvement in the slave trade, both in Muscat and in Zanzibar, and the political, commercial and legal issues that it raised.</p>
<p>There is much to commend in Goswami’s book; both the uninitiated and the expert will find something to satisfy themselves with. The author has seemingly managed to consult just about every record on Muscat and Zanzibar in the Maharashtra State Archives and the National Archives of India, and has painstakingly combed through all of the relevant published primary sources (mostly travel narratives) for references to Kachchhi traders in those ports. Her hard work is clearly reflected in the book, which is a veritable gold mine of details on the history of Indian trade in South Arabia and East Africa. This is perhaps best showcased in the chapter highlighting the trajectory of Jairam Shivji’s firm, in which the author manages to piece together scraps from different archives and primary sources into a compelling and rather exhaustive narrative. Her chapter on Muscat, too, includes information that one would be hard-pressed to find in other publications.</p>
<p>The book does, however, suffer from some shortcomings. Although the book itself is based on the premise that Kachchh, Muscat and Zanzibar share a common history, the author’s discussion does not convey that sense of connectedness. Rather, the reader is given atomised, static histories of each port city and of the Kachchhi communities therein. The author only gestures towards the relationship between the Kachchhis of Zanzibar and those of Muscat, and their shared trading fortunes and histories, leaving most of the work to the reader’s imagination. More frustrating is the near-complete absence of Kachchh itself from the histories of Muscat and Zanzibar in the book. Save for the first chapter, in which she discusses Kachchh’s geography, history and society, the home ports of the book’s protagonists rarely appear in the book. This is particularly disappointing when considering how she could have looked at how the merchants, many of whom returned to Kachchh after long careers abroad, made use of their wealth at home.</p>
<p>This, however, is rather emblematic of the work as a whole, which bombards the reader with page after page of fascinating detail but does less to analyse and interpret it. The author often fails to provide any context for Kachchhi activities in Muscat or Zanzibar. While she points to increasing demand for commodities like ivory, dates or cloves, this information is often buried underneath mountains of more gratuitous detail. One does not, for example, have any sense of where Kachchhi merchant-financiers were situated in the broader world of trade finance; the author explains the <italic>hundi</italic> system, but does not explain the position of the financiers vis-à-vis more formal financial institutions, like banks. The omission is all the more egregious when considering that historians, such as, Rajat Kanta Ray and Sugata Bose, have tackled these very issues in some detail.</p>
<p>Moreover, one cannot help but notice that the author did not consult either Arabic materials from Oman or records in the Zanzibar National Archives (ZNA), preferring instead to delve into material in India. The ZNA in particular contains a wealth of information on the island’s Kachchhi community, including political correspondence, deed registers and thousands of court cases. If one can ascribe the lack of engagement with Arabic materials to linguistic barriers, the same cannot be said of the ZNA, the overwhelming majority of which is either in English or Gujarati. Consulting material at the ZNA would have likely also expanded her study’s timeline beyond 1880, which is roughly around the time the Government of India was relieved of its responsibility to administer Zanzibar, bringing all official correspondence surrounding the island to a halt.</p>
<p>These limitations, however, do not overshadow the book’s strengths. Goswami is the first to pull together Kachchh, Muscat and Zanzibar into a comprehensive history, and she has done a marvelous job of tracking down and weaving together materials that would have otherwise been confined to archival storerooms. The biographical sketches that she provides, and particularly her case study of Jairam Shivji’s firm, are a testament to her attention to detail. The book will surely appeal to Indian Ocean historians, but should also find an eager audience among historians of South Asia and East Africa.</p>
