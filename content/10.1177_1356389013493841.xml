<p>Partnerships between companies and non-governmental organizations that aim to incorporate smallholder farmers into value chains are increasingly being promoted as a way of pursuing development goals. This article investigates two case studies of such partnerships and the outcomes they achieved in order to refine the rationale underlying such interventions. In two case studies in Uganda and Rwanda, we documented the sequences of events within such partnership interventions, their context, and the intermediate outcomes, identified as the new rules and practices that generate institutional change. By portraying both the configuration of events within a partnership intervention and the contextual factors, these case studies reveal how the interventions produced outcomes that were situated in changing contexts, such as changes in market demand, government policy or business strategy. The research approach made it possible to disentangle partnership interventions and contextual processes, and to give participants a firmer idea of the potential and limitations of value chain partnerships to achieve developmental targets.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In many parts of the global South, companies and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) are teaming up to incorporate smallholder farmers into value chains with the aim of achieving developmental outcomes, such as increased food security, predictable incomes and better health services. The actors involved in such partnerships vary from multinational companies sourcing tropical commodities such as coffee and cocoa, to companies seeking new low-income markets for their products, to international NGOs engaged with environmentalism or social justice, or local NGOs involved in arranging better market access for small farmers. Cross-sector partnerships between companies and NGOs vary. They include the philanthropically motivated activities of companies working with local communities, platforms that promote sector-level collaboration to influence policy, or collaborations between companies, NGOs and producer groups to arrange compliance with standards used in marketing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1356389013493841">Van Tulder and Kostwinder, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>This article focuses on case studies of a specific type of partnership between companies, NGOs and producers, which we term ‘value chain partnerships’ (VCPs). VCPs complement traditional approaches that encourage collective action by smallholder producers to achieve economies of scale, enhance their bargaining power or manage common pool resources. VCPs link the resources and market intelligence of companies to the resources and networks of other organizations, such as NGOs or producers’ organizations. The goals of the different partners in a VCP must be at least partially aligned; this means that they must agree to work on development outcomes beyond their individual agendas.</p>
<p>Both of the value chain partnerships examined in this study are aimed at domestic food markets. We investigate a platform in Uganda working in oilseed value chains, which seeks to enhance competiveness and equity within a sector that includes large numbers of smallholder farmers. In Rwanda, we examine a partnership between financial institutes, companies and cooperatives to implement a credit scheme that aims to improve trade terms for smallholder maize farmers. Both partnerships receive public support or donor funding as they are expected to realize developmental goals. In this article we explore the extent to which such partnerships contribute to achieving such goals, seeking to identify the precise contributions of the partnership, the value chain and the local context.</p>
<p>VCPs coordinate the actions and combine the capacities of actors with different positions within and outside the value chain. On the one hand, these partnerships operate within the vertically coordinated transactions and information flows that exist within the boundaries of their respective value chains. In value chains, a lead firm plays the main role in defining the barriers to entry and in installing forms of control, and this shapes the mode of vertical governance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1356389013493841">Gereffi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1356389013493841">Gibbon and Ponte, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1356389013493841">Kaplinsky and Morris, 2001</xref>). Yet VCPs are also embedded in the local socio-economic setting of the suppliers in the value chain. Thus VCPs construct an interface between the logic of the actors at the top of the chain and the local institutional contexts that guide primary producers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1356389013493841">Helmsing and Vellema, 2011a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1356389013493841">2011b</xref>). We consider case studies to be a useful tool for assessing the extent to which the processes of partnering create an interface that successfully contributes to beneficial developmental outcomes for the participating smallholder farmers.</p>
<p>Case studies of these partnering processes can help to refine the theoretical underpinning of the anticipated developmental impact of VCPs and the rationale for adopting them. This research is situated within Rohlfing’s typology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1356389013493841">2012</xref>) of the goals of theory-centred research, and we see it as a first step in building theory for subsequent research. Our focus on partnering is a first step towards developing a more refined ‘programme theory’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1356389013493841">Pawson, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1356389013493841">Rogers, 2008</xref>) about how partnerships help to stimulate developmental goals. Our focus is on how VCPs create institutional changes – new practices and rules – that dovetail the chain’s vertical governance mechanisms with local institutional dynamics. We consider the changes in practices, rules and regulations that govern economic transactions in the value chain to be potentially important intermediate mechanisms in achieving the VCP’s broader development goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1356389013493841">Vellema and Van Wijk, forthcoming</xref>). Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1356389013493841">Lawrence et al. (2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1356389013493841">2009</xref>) we label these changes ‘proto-institutions’: new practices, rules and technologies that emerge from within, transcend the boundaries of inter-organizational collaboration and are later adopted by other organizations in the field. If proto-institutions become sufficiently diffused they may become a systemic part of the institutional environment that determines or influences smallholders’ access to markets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1356389013493841">Zietsma and McKnight, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>This article employs two <italic>action research</italic> projects, anchored in local food chains in Rwanda and Uganda, to present an initial intervention theory to describe why and how a value chain partnership is likely to enhance development opportunities for smallholders involved in markets and value chains. The case studies help us build a two-stage argument that enables us to construct a ‘middle-range theory’ on partnering mechanisms. The first centres on detailed accounts of events and practices that occurred within the boundaries of the partnership, which are used to detect plausible mechanisms at work within the VCPs. The second stage involves a form of counterfactual reasoning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1356389013493841">Cowan and Foray, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1356389013493841">Ferraro, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1356389013493841">Sayer, 2000</xref>) based on the notion of multiple causality. This line of argumentation examines plausible alternative explanations in order to unravel the interactions between processes triggered by partnerships and processes fired by other changes within the value chains and by local contexts. Exploring alternative explanations for the observed institutional changes enables us to specify the contribution the partnership made to the emergent configuration and any subsequent developmental outcomes.</p>
<p>The article first outlines the research approach used. It then presents the two case studies, describing the initial ideas motivating the partnerships, documenting the events and outcomes of the partnerships, and trying to refine the original rationale underlying the partnership by showing how the effect and success of a partnership is partly shaped by other exogenous processes. We end with a discussion on how to use case studies to map the outcomes of value chain partnerships.</p>

<title>Case-study design</title>
<p>Case studies, understood as an intensive, in-depth study of a relatively bounded phenomenon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1356389013493841">Gerring, 2004</xref>) lend themselves to making cautious causal inferences about the mechanisms of change triggered by the intervention, in this instance, value chain collaboration. Our two case studies allowed us to investigate partnering as ‘situated action’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1356389013493841">Suchman, 1987</xref>). This individual case research provides a basis for a cross-case analysis that aims to distil more generic causal inferences about partnering activities. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1356389013493841">Table 1</xref> presents the steps involved in using case studies to evaluate the impact(s) of value chain partnerships. The first step, that of descriptive inference, involved constructing a time path of key events and critical moments of choice-making within the partnerships (following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1356389013493841">Westhorp et al., 2011</xref>). In addition, we designed a way to trace how processes in the value chain and the local context could contribute to the emergence of new rules and practices. The next step in the use of case studies (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1356389013493841">Table 1</xref>) would be to anchor this evaluative research in scholarly theorizations of institutional change in order to investigate multiple causal pathways.</p>

<p><italic>Note</italic>: Based on the authors’ reading of the methodological literature on realist evaluation and causal process tracing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1356389013493841">Bennett and Elman, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1356389013493841">Blatter and Blume, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1356389013493841">Boudon, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1356389013493841">Gerring, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1356389013493841">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1356389013493841">Pawson, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1356389013493841">Ragin and Sonnet, 2004</xref>). This article describes the first descriptive step in the within-case analysis. The second step is oriented towards triangulating different theorizations of the underlying processes detected in step 1, which is close to the idea of causal process tracing.

<p>We selected two case studies of VCPs that were intended to improve the livelihoods of smallholder farmers, helping them to better handle the uncertainties related to commodity production and market dynamics. The value chain companies included in the VCPs had a strong focus on bulking and processing agricultural products in two east African countries: Uganda and Rwanda. In Uganda, the companies introduced various contractual arrangements with individual farmers or groups of farmers as a way of establishing a reliable source of oilseed for processing for the local market. In Rwanda, a financial institute and a trading company teamed up to arrange credit provision that was intended to modify the conditions under which farmers were previously forced to sell their crop before the harvest. Both partnerships aimed to achieve both public and private goals, in particular increasing and stabilizing the incomes of smallholder farmers and enhancing food security in regions suffering from social and ecological vulnerability and a history of violent conflict.</p>
<p>In the research, we searched for rival explanations in the structure and governance of the value chain and in the broader context. We used a different analytical lens for each analysis. The first involved exploring if the observed patterns and outcomes could be solely explained by the mechanisms that emerged from developments in the value chain. In other words, it addressed whether or not it is plausible to assume that the lead firm and other private sector actors in the value chain would have achieved similar changes without the partnership. The second concerned the influence of the collective actions of the supplying farmers: could the observed changes in the rules and practices of the value chain be solely attributed to the behaviour and/or organizational strength of local farmer organizations, even in the absence of any partnership? In the end, these rival explanations were not useful for testing counterfactual explanations but they did help to further delineate what was achieved by partnering and what could be attributed to other processes in the value chain and the local contexts. This was an important step in refining and contextualizing the theories of change underlying the partnering processes.</p>

<title>Data collection in action research</title>
<p>In the Ugandan case study, the Ugandan Oilseed Subsector Platform (OSSUP) was established with the aim of improving the connection between smallholder farmers and the oil-processing industry, in an effort to reduce imports of edible oils and to improve quality and efficiency along the value chain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1356389013493841">Vellema, 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1356389013493841">2012</xref>). The platform emerged and received support from different development organizations as part of a multi-stakeholder VCP. We have documented different phases in building this partnership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1356389013493841">Ton and Vellema, 2010</xref>) and were involved in co-organizing several events, such as a strategic policy dialogue and an R&amp;D market place (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1356389013493841">Vellema et al., 2011</xref>). The preparation of the Strategic Policy Dialogue in 2008–09 led members of the platform to make shared choices and set common priorities. Data about these processes was collected through two rounds of interviews (held in 2010 and 2011) with ten key informants in each round. In addition we analysed the minutes of the platform’s meetings (a total of 32 meetings at the national level, and 10 meetings held by three different regional platforms) between 2007 and 2009.</p>
<p>The Rwanda case study is based on less intensive research. In Rwanda, the partnership between a finance institute and a trading company implemented an innovation in financing trade capital: the Warehouse Receipt System. Interviews with participating partners and members of an international support programme were used to make a first sketch of the rationale for lending support to this innovation. The field work involved collecting data through individual interviews, focus group interviews and several field visits. In total 24 interviews were conducted with different value chain actors (farmers, cooperatives, middlemen, traders, chain supporters, supporting NGOs, the World Food Program [WFP], the trade company Nyamig Ltd, and the micro-finance institute Duterimbere IMF). We also attended an annual stakeholder meeting of the WFP in Rwanda and a field day for Rwandan district agronomists, which involved a field visit to the inventory credit scheme in the Nyagatare district and a maize storage facility. We then triangulated these findings through cross-checking our interpretations of the facts with key informants.</p>
<p>The findings of the two case studies are presented in the two sections below, in which we describe (i) the background of the partnership, (ii) the initial theory about the mechanisms triggered by the partnership, (iii) the events and outcomes of each partnership and (iv) the modified theory.</p>

<title>Case study 1: A commodity-based platform in Uganda</title>
<sec id="section6-1356389013493841">
<title>Background</title>
<p>The ‘booming’ growth of the oilseed and edible oil sector in Uganda, linked to the possibility to substitute locally sourced oilseed for imported palm oil (as a result of rising international commodity prices) played an important role in creating a conducive environment for collective action and collaboration in the sector. Sectoral stakeholders recognized that there was a clear mismatch between the demand and supply for sunflower seeds for crushing. At the farm level, producers were uncertain about inputs, the climate, buyers and prices for their produce and thus about the viability of entering into such operations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1356389013493841">IFAD, 2008</xref>). Most farmers sold their produce immediately after harvesting to either brokers at the farm gate, agents of traders in the village, or small-scale millers in the local area. Larger national processors and smaller local millers were also uncertain about obtaining enough raw materials to operate at their capacity, which led them to provide traders and their networks of agents with additional finance to enhance procurement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1356389013493841">Ton et al., 2010</xref>). In general, there was clearly a domestic market for edible oil (and for feed cake, a by-product of oilseed processing) but the sector’s expansion was constrained by an absence of effective links between the leading companies and the primary producers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1356389013493841">Luseesa, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The Uganda Oilseed Subsector Platform (OSSUP) was founded out of the need to find strategic solutions to these persistent and complex economic problems in a sector where both trade and production were unpredictable. The platform initially provided a space for processing companies, producers’ organizations and NGOs to interact, but it also encouraged millers, traders’ associations, chain facilitators and service providers to come together, share their knowledge, negotiate on providing services to each other, develop a policy advocacy strategy and carry out joint actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1356389013493841">Devaux et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1356389013493841">Roduner and Gerrits, 2006</xref>). Companies and non-profit organizations in the oilseed sector were also receiving support from the national government and IFAD (International Fund for Agricultural Development) through the Vegetable Oil Development Project (1997–2012) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1356389013493841">IFAD, 2011</xref>) at that time. Similar initiatives with value chain platforms and ‘mutual agreements for competitiveness’ are common in Latin America (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1356389013493841">Porter et al., 2002</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1356389013493841">
<title>Initial theory</title>
<p>The platform was expected to create favourable conditions for connecting the supply and demand sides of the oilseed sector; a value chain perspective was developed in order to get leading food manufacturing firms and major processors on board. The platform members realized that the challenges facing the sector were too complex to be addressed by individual companies or organizations. Collaboration within OSSUP was grounded in recognition of the need to campaign for sector-wide policies and to increase mutual trust and coordination between platform members.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1356389013493841">
<title>Partnering: Events and outcomes</title>
<p>UOSPA (the Uganda Oilseed Producers and Processors Association) was one of the main players that helped create the OSSUP platform. In 2006, UOSPA took the initiative to ‘weave the oil seed web’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1356389013493841">Otimodoch, 2008</xref>), an action that coincided with the multi-stakeholder platform orientation of the Netherlands Development Organisation SNV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1356389013493841">Mwesige, 2008</xref>). UOSPA considered the platform to be an institutional and political experiment and did not know precisely what would come of it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1356389013493841">Bindraban et al., 2006</xref>). The national platform was linked to two regional platforms. One was supported and facilitated by UOSPA, with donor funding, and the other was supported and facilitated by the development organisation SNV.</p>
<p>Although members of OSSUP recognized the potential value of joint and coordinated action, meetings in the first years (2006–08) were characterized by recurrent polarized arguments about the relative merits of planting open-pollinated seeds or hybrid ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1356389013493841">Bindraban et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1356389013493841">Vellema et al., 2011</xref>). UOSPA controlled the multiplication and distribution of an open-pollinated variety that farmers can reproduce themselves, while the major oilseed processing company, Mukwano, distributed hybrid sunflower seed from South Africa to their contracted farmers. Different views on the benefits of both varieties for farmers figured frequently in discussions both in and outside platform meetings, and were a source of controversy within the sector. This polarization was further fuelled by Mukwano’s strategy of expanding its contract farming scheme and controlling side-selling to competing millers and processors. The company’s dominant position in the market made the firm vulnerable to charges of exploiting poor farmers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1356389013493841">Johnston, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite these divisions, a more collaborative atmosphere gradually developed and resulted in a strategic policy dialogue in 2009. Organizing this dialogue brought about a process of change in which platform partners had to set shared priorities and compose common key policy messages for different audiences in government and public support programmes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1356389013493841">Boselie and Vellema, 2011</xref>). The platform facilitated joint and bilateral actions among members, including a petition in which the partners requested the responsible governmental authority to release improved planting material more quickly and advocated introducing the next phase of a public programme supporting the vegetable oil sector. Processors started to contact existing farmer groups that they had met at regional platform meetings. Companies began to install different institutional arrangements to connect farmers to their operations. These increased levels of coordination in the sector did not go unnoticed; bank and local government officials increasingly expressed their willingness to engage with the sector.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1356389013493841">
<title>Refined theory</title>
<p>On the basis of the above we can hypothesize that the VCP can transform tactical behaviour undertaken by individual members into joint strategic behaviour; make tensions manageable through personal interactions and achieve a consensus on the priorities presented to actors outside the value chain. The platform induced a series of new rules and practices, shown as ‘proto-institutions’ in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1356389013493841">Table 2</xref>. These new practices gradually spread not only among actors within the value chain, but also among those outside it. Banks began to offer new financial products and services, and the government decided to start the second phase of a public support programme to the oilseed sector, which was largely based on the agenda proposed by OSSUP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1356389013493841">IFAD, 2011</xref>). The changes set in motion by OSSUP’s activities may also explain the observed increase in investment in processing capacity by leading food manufacturing companies, the growing volumes of oilseed available for processing and the gradual shift of farmers from growing food crops to concentrating on the production of marketable oilseed. The platform acted within the context of competitive pressures from international markets, fluctuating prices and relatively low levels of market coordination and producer organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1356389013493841">Ton and Vellema, 2008</xref>).</p>

<p>However, the platform was clearly not the only factor behind these outcomes. The observed trends also resulted from the marketing and sourcing strategies of different lead firms involved in the platform who were competing for market share and access to crushing material. During this period several large companies invested in processing capacity in northern Uganda, anticipating growing demand for cooking oil in the country. Many small and medium processors were under-capitalized and found it difficult to source raw materials for their operations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1356389013493841">Vellema et al., 2007</xref>). There was strong competition when it came to sourcing raw materials, especially in high-potential and/or accessible areas. A mutual dependency emerged between companies who needed a stable supply of crushing material, and farmers shifting to the commercial production of oilseed, who needed buyers. This created new spaces for negotiation and coordination.</p>
<p>In addition, a growing number of groups of organized farmers developed skills in organizing bulking. This made them attractive partners for processing companies. These groups developed their bulking skills from their experience in collective action on a wide range of issues, such as managing saving and credit groups, managing a collective seed-multiplication field, functioning as farmer field school, being a cooperative that had survived the collapse of the cotton sector in the 1980s, or through trust-building in the same church or gospel choir (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1356389013493841">Ton, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1356389013493841">Ton et al., 2010</xref>). Not all producers were included in the major companies’ market coordination arrangements, as some lacked infrastructure or adequate organizational capacity or were located in areas with poor agro-ecological or climatic conditions or security problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1356389013493841">Poulton et al., 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>In sum, besides the platform’s activities, several other factors may have influenced the observed increased level of coordination and strategic alignment, creating conditions more favourable for development. We identified the most important factors in this configuration as being: (1) public and political support for an agricultural development strategy that favoured substituting imported vegetable oil with locally sourced oilseed; (2) corporate strategies to source oilseed locally to supply the growing domestic and regional markets for cooking oil and feed cake, and (3) the willingness of farmer groups to use their existing social capital and organizational capacity to help build bulking nodes.</p>
<p>Partnering in the OSSUP platform was not the only process that contributed to better connections between the suppliers and buyers of oilseed. However, we think that the platform improved the interactions and trust between producers and buyers within the same value chain and encouraged a more strategic orientation in on-going dialogues and policy advocacy. This was important for ensuring and directing public investments in the oilseed sector and for initiating joint strategizing between actors with convergent interests or who were competing in the same markets for oilseed. Through this process, the platform generated new practices and rules for coordination (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1356389013493841">Table 2</xref>) that were instrumental for development, but only in parallel with other processes that occurred within the oilseed sector.</p>

<title>Case study 2: Warehouse receipt system in Rwanda</title>
<sec id="section11-1356389013493841">
<title>Background</title>
<p>The partnership presented in this second case study worked with maize farmers in North-East Rwanda who were facing extreme land scarcity – the average family in Nyagatare district cultivated just 0.51 ha (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1356389013493841">NIS, 2010</xref>) – and struggling to redevelop agriculture after a long period of conflict had left much land abandoned. The area had long been unpopulated, and it was only after the 1994 genocide that former refugees returned from Uganda. Until 2006, maize production in Rwanda was lower than, or just equal to national demand and demand for maize was increasing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1356389013493841">USAID, 2010</xref>). Farmers in North-East Rwanda usually sold their produce before or at harvest time, at low prices, mainly because of their urgent cash needs. Access to rural finance was very limited: only 3–4 percent of the banking portfolio went to agricultural loans in 2009. In particular, small-scale farmers had difficulty in accessing loans, as they lacked the necessary collateral and were prone to risks.</p>
<p>The market position of smallholder farmers was particularly undermined by the practice of selling maize to an intermediary prior to the harvest in exchange for credit for expenditures during the lean season. This practice is called <italic>Kotsa Imyaka</italic> in the local language, Kinyarwanda. It linked farmers to private traders, who worked via rural aggregators or intermediaries in the villages. These intermediaries formed the main contact between farmers and the end-market. The practice of <italic>Kotsa Imyaka</italic> resulted in farmers receiving low prices for the harvest sold before harvest. The need for cash also stimulated farmers to sell their produce right after the harvest, also receiving low prices. The partnership between a finance institute and a company, which was also supported by an international micro-finance programme and a network of development organizations, tried to make selling practices and credit provision more favourable for these vulnerable smallholder maize farmers.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1356389013493841">
<title>Initial theory</title>
<p>The Rwandan value chain partnership, consisting of a micro-finance institute (MFI) and an investment/trading company, created and managed a system for inventory credit labelled as Warehouse Receipt Systems (WRS), which has been used elsewhere in Africa since the 1990s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1356389013493841">Coulter, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1356389013493841">Coulter and Onumah, 2002</xref>). Such schemes differ from other micro-financing efforts in that they 1) make use of collateral in the form of goods stored in warehouses, and 2) they are directed specifically at farmers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1356389013493841">Coleman and Malaguzzi-Valeri, 2006</xref>). The inventory credit system creates an institutional context whereby the farmer is offered formal credit without having to sell his or her product at low prices before or directly after the harvest. Farmers receive a contract that gives them access to credit for the period between harvesting and selling, reducing their dependence on informal lenders and dubious weighing techniques. This gives farmers the opportunity to start saving money and stabilizes their cash flows, which should make them less prone to future shocks and more flexible about when they sell their produce (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1356389013493841">Lacroix and Varangis, 1996</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1356389013493841">
<title>Partnering: Events and outcomes</title>
<p>The micro-finance institute (MFI) and trading company started the VCP by implementing the inventory credit scheme. The MFI saw the collaboration with the trading company as an opportunity to expand its services in this sector. It received financial and strategic support from an international programme, Terrafina Microfinance, which has promoted inventory credit schemes in Rwanda since 2008. The scheme received support from a ‘maize value chain network’, which was established by NGOs, development organizations, cooperatives, traders and input suppliers to provide access to finance and inputs.</p>
<p>In the inventory credit scheme, farmers offered their maize harvest as collateral to obtain credit. Farmers received a voucher, up to a maximum of 60 percent of the current market value of their maize, which they could exchange for credit at the micro-finance organization. The trading company and the micro-finance organization collaborated in marketing the stored maize. When sold, the farmers received the remaining proceeds, minus storage costs and interest on the credit.</p>
<p>The MFI’s main responsibility in the partnership was to manage the provision of credit; the trading company handled selling the maize. Written contracts stipulated the various agreements underlying the credit inventory scheme. These stipulated that:</p>
<list id="list1-1356389013493841" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>both partners and the buyer should agree on the price before any sales contract was signed;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>both partners were jointly responsible for proper storage management with two padlocks for the storage facility; one padlock was controlled by the MFI and the other by the company;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>the storage facility was insured against theft, fire and diseases to make sure that no value was lost during the storage period;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>the MFI channelled its credit directly to farmers.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The partnership aimed to build strong and sustainable relationships between institutional buyers and organized farmers. It also initially acted as an intermediary between small farmers and large traders or institutional buyers, although the plan was for it to hand over this brokering role to farmer cooperatives in due course. In 2009, the partnership reached an agreement with a large institutional buyer of maize: the World Food Programme (WFP). WFP introduced a policy to source maize locally, and looked for partners that could guarantee volumes, quality and consistent supply. This deal made it possible for the inventory credit scheme to take off (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1356389013493841">Bouquet et al., 2007</xref>). The first harvest went well, but during the second season poor growing conditions reduced yields and this hampered efforts to source the volume necessary for the deal with WFP. During this second season, farmers were unwilling to store their produce because market prices were high and they were able to sell maize on the spot to passing traders. These traders also approached the partnerships’ company and offered a better price than the WFP. This presented the partnership with a dilemma: should it maintain the contract with the WFP or sell to the traders at a higher price? The partners had different views on how to respond to this situation. In the end the company responsible for marketing decided to sell part of the stock for a higher price to third buyers. This led the WFP to lose confidence in the partnership and it did not offer it any new contracts. The MFI did not approve the breach of contract. This brought to light the tension in the partnership between ensuring short-term benefits for farmers and sustaining its long-term position as a broker in the competitive maize market.</p>
<p>Interviewed farmers said that their participation in the credit scheme generated higher incomes, which they mainly spent on education, healthcare, housing and other family-related expenses, such as clothes or school fees. For participating farmers, access to other types of credit became easier, and the scheme established a more predictable way for them to sell their agricultural produce. However, the short-term benefit of selling directly after harvesting remained tempting. A local buyer of maize said that farmers continued to come to his house, even during the night, to ask for a loan. These farmers accepted a lower price for their produce in return. An intermediary confirmed that some farmers still tried to sell their maize just after harvest. It sometimes got really busy in front of his house as all farmers wanted to be the first to sell their maize. According to the intermediary, good quality maize was easy to find in that period, at prices that were favourable for traders.</p>

<title>Refined theory</title>
<p>The partnership between the MFI and the trading company created the necessary conditions for implementing an inventory credit scheme. The events evolved around solving the practical issues related to linking credit provision and marketing maize, such as assuring good quality storage facilities and organizing the collective marketing of the stored maize for participating maize farmers. The inventory credit scheme’s tangible solutions convinced the MFI, the trading company, and the organized farmers to risk sustaining the inventory credit system. The partnership created new rules and practices that made it possible to experiment and implement practical solutions to the complicated interactions between providing credit and selling agricultural produce (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1356389013493841">Table 3</xref>). Farmers were offered a real alternative to overcome their cash constrained period, and the partnership learnt to handle difficulties in managing cash flows and stocks of maize. This new situation convinced other banks to become more active in agriculture. The trading company started consultations with other banks (Banque Populaire, Ecobank and the Bank of Kigali), which had expressed interest in working with inventory credit. This put pressure on the partnership, because the trading company was no longer fully reliant on one MFI. The MFI lowered its interest rates from 2.5 percent to 1.5 percent per month, possibly as a result of competition from the other banks and MFIs.</p>

<p>The partnership’s achievements became publicly visible and encouraged a network of supporting programmes and organizations promoting inventory credit as an alternative to <italic>Kotsa Imyaka</italic>. But the higher demand for maize and rising prices also played a role in this. Between 2006 and 2011, large maize trading companies (e.g. Minimex, Grand Lacs Supply) and organizations such as the World Food Programme put more emphasis on the local sourcing of maize, while public organizations, such as schools, began to purchase maize directly from local farmers.</p>
<p>While rising market prices put pressure on the partnership’s efforts to effect long-term change because farmers often decided to sell to the highest bidder, governmental policies were generally supportive. In 2008, the Rwandan government implemented a regulatory measure to abolish the use of traditional weighing scales and the practice of <italic>Kotsa Imyaka</italic>. District-level authorities could bring traders using the traditional practice or weighing scales to court. One local buyer said that he used to provide credit to farmers, but that this was a high risk business since many farmers were unable to repay their loans. Now that the government also disapproved of this informal business, it became too risky for him. The inventory credit scheme gradually took over the role of credit provider, but under different terms.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding these positive institutional changes, it seems the people who benefitted most from the intervention that changed conditions for trade were relatively small groups of well-networked farmers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1356389013493841">Ansoms, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1356389013493841">Platteau, 2004</xref>). Many more farmers were hesitant to join the inventory credit scheme and continued to rely on reciprocal relations with community-based intermediaries or traders. In the inventory credit scheme, the MFI and trading company mostly worked with organized farmers, who had already received considerable support from development agencies and the government and had developed some organizational capacities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1356389013493841">Develtere et al., 2008</xref>). An established cooperative, one of the first shareholders of the company, gradually developed its role as intermediary, buying maize from farmers within its constituency and beyond community boundaries. Its leaders collaborated with governmental agencies in providing inputs such as bulls to work the land or improved maize seed. Observations in villages and interviews with private traders suggested a divide between a group of relatively wealthy farmers managing the cooperative, who were well connected to government and donor initiatives, and a second (much larger) group of farmers and traders who did not seem to have access to these initiatives. The second group continued to rely on <italic>Kotsa Imyaka</italic> practices.</p>
<p>In sum, contextual factors appear to have had a significant influence on the partnership’s outcomes. Governmental regulation against <italic>Kotsa Imyaka</italic> and the rise in demand for maize pressured both farmers and chain actors to find new ways to secure finance for production, harvesting and trade. Yet, the VCP made an important contribution to this configuration by establishing a tangible alternative arrangement for providing the necessary link between production, trading and access to finance. The new practices and rules developed within the partnership matched the new rules and regulations imposed by the government. Moreover, the partnership made an effect through its collaboration with an exclusive group of farmers in control of cooperatives that took over the role of intermediary. However, it seems that only a select group of farmers felt confident enough to abandon the practice of <italic>Kotsa Imyaka</italic>, which continued to be common for other farmers. The partnership between the MFI and the trading company may have been temporary, but it provided an arena for experimenting with alternative practices and rules. The alignment of the inventory credit scheme with public regulations and the growing interest of banks and MFIs in agriculture may well trigger the spread of new rules and practices that modify the terms of trade for a larger group of small-scale maize farmers. However, the partnership’s strong focus on making the inventory credit scheme work, and on resolving tensions within the collaboration, may also constrain the possible spread of new rules and practices to actors and organizations outside the boundaries of the partnership.</p>

<title>Conclusion and discussion</title>
<p>Increasingly, partnerships are seen as providing organizational fixes for complicated problems. Both case studies in this article sought to achieve ambitious goals through the formation of partnerships. These goals included increasing the competitiveness of the oil seed sector in Uganda, that would make farmers less vulnerable and installing a mechanism to provide credit that would radically modify the terms of trade of small-scale maize farmers in Rwanda. By making case studies of these value chain partnerships we have been able to trace the events and to detect the processes of change, increasing understanding of what partnering actually is. In both case studies there were plausible, but often invisible, processes that emerged from the collaboration, which we labelled proto-institutions. As a subsequent step, we critically examined the assumed contributions that partnering makes to development outcomes, based on a form of counterfactual reasoning tailored to value chain partnership. We investigated both vertically driven forms of coordination in value chains and horizontally embedded networks of producers and non-chain actors as alternative explanations of the observed changes and outcomes. This exercise revealed the difficulty in judging whether the partnerships are necessary for the change process to occur. It shifted attention to multiple-causality. Rather than attributing all the changes to the partnerships and its activities, we underlined that partnerships are (at most) a contributory factor in a wider constellation of factors that generate change. This article shows the value of case studies for contextualizing and delimiting the specific contribution that partnerships make to promoting change. We consider this to be an important step towards developing more refined theories of partnering.</p>
<p>The commodity-based platform in the Ugandan oilseed sector built a multi-stakeholder network, aligned around joint activities and strategies, with the aim of making the sector more competitive. The case study suggests that the platform’s main impact may have been the intangible outcomes, such as finding a common language to discuss strategic problems, and using joint activities and dialogues to recognize that they could resolve issues more effectively by working together. But it was the contextual factors that had a significant influence on the tangible development outcomes that the partnership aimed to achieve. The demand for oil seed grew largely because of increased prioritizing of local sourcing; processors began to invest in their suppliers to secure volumes and regular flows for their supply chains; and farmers’ organizations developed a growing capacity with regard to collecting and bulking oilseeds. Though it is not possible to directly attribute these development outcomes to the partnership’s activities, it is plausible to assume that the intangible outcomes of the partnership played a contributory role in the wider configuration of factors.</p>
<p>In Rwanda, the value chain partnership implemented a credit inventory scheme with the intention of altering the conditions under which farmers sell maize and obtain cash when needed. The partnership’s activities aligned well with public regulations against traditional, informal practices that induced pre-harvest sales at low prices. An unintended consequence was that the partnership’s activities consolidated the position of an exclusive group of farmers, who used a cooperative to act as intermediary in trade and attracted support from governments and NGOs. The convergence of growing demand and new public regulations may be contextual factors that stimulate the further spread of new rules and practices piloted by the partnership. This key outcome of the partnership – workable alternatives for the link between production, trading and access to finance – appears to be attributable to the partnering activities. However, this may have changed the terms of trade for just a select group of farmers, which raises the question if the intended development outcomes were indeed reached, especially since this may turn out to be a temporary organizational form.</p>
<p>These two case studies have enabled us to unravel how the interactions between partnerships and the broader socio-economic context can generate different mixes of development outcomes. This is an important first step towards developing a better understanding of the mechanisms that are triggered by partnering and how these mechanisms may contribute to achieving development outcomes. The use of case studies enabled us to identify how underlying dynamics and processes can be either conducive or obstructive to achieving desired developmental outcomes. Distinguishing between the achievements of partnering and the ways in which they interact with contextual processes can provide a basis for developing more refined programme rationales that can be further tested in cross-case analysis.</p>
