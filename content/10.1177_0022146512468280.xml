<abstract>
<p>A legacy of research finds that marriage is associated with good health. Yet same-sex cohabitors cannot marry in most states in the United States and therefore may not receive the health benefits associated with marriage. We use pooled data from the 1997 to 2009 National Health Interview Surveys to compare the self-rated health of same-sex cohabiting men (<italic>n</italic> = 1,659) and same-sex cohabiting women (<italic>n</italic> = 1,634) with that of their different-sex married, different-sex cohabiting, and unpartnered divorced, widowed, and never-married counterparts. Results from logistic regression models show that same-sex cohabitors report poorer health than their different-sex married counterparts at the same levels of socioeconomic status. Additionally, same-sex cohabitors report better health than their different-sex cohabiting and single counterparts, but these differences are fully explained by socioeconomic status. Without their socioeconomic advantages, same-sex cohabitors would report similar health to nonmarried groups. Analyses further reveal important racial-ethnic and gender variations.</p>

<p>Marriage has long been shown to promote mental and physical well-being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0022146512468280">Waite and Gallagher 2000</xref>). Yet most of the roughly 646,000 same-sex cohabitors in the United States do not have the option of legally marrying their partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0022146512468280">U.S. Census Bureau 2011</xref>). A recent report from the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022146512468280">Institute of Medicine (2011)</xref> suggests that a lack of access to legal marriage may facilitate poorer health among same-sex cohabitors compared with their different-sex married counterparts because of reduced socioeconomic, psychosocial, and institutional resources.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0022146512468280">1</xref></sup> Despite the plausibility of this claim, little empirical research has examined whether same-sex cohabitors have worse health relative to different-sex married people. Moreover, if same-sex cohabitors have worse health than different-sex married individuals, it is unclear whether same-sex cohabitors experience diminished health outcomes analogous to different-sex cohabitors whose relationships also lack the socioeconomic, psychosocial, and institutional benefits that coincide with marriage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022146512468280">Carr and Springer 2010</xref>). Alternatively, same-sex cohabitors may report health that is more similar to other single groups, such as the divorced, widowed, and never married, who each have relatively worse health than the married as a result of greater stress and fewer resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0022146512468280">Waite and Gallagher 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>The main objective of the present study is to comprehensively compare the self-rated health of same-sex cohabitors with that of individuals in other union statuses, including the different-sex married, different-sex cohabiting, and the unpartnered divorced, widowed, and never-married single.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0022146512468280">2</xref></sup> Because research posits that socioeconomic status (SES) is a key factor that links union status and health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0022146512468280">Waite and Gallagher 2000</xref>), our second objective is to assess how SES contributes to self-rated health differences between same-sex cohabitors and those in other union statuses. Finally, given substantial racial-ethnic and gender differences in family processes and health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022146512468280">Brown, Van Hook, and Glick 2008</xref>), our third objective is to explore gender and racial-ethnic variations in these associations.</p>
<sec id="section1-0022146512468280">
<title>Background</title>
<p>Previous research on same-sex cohabitation and well-being has been predominantly qualitative in nature or based on small, community-based, nonrepresentative surveys with primarily white and high-SES samples; thus, it is difficult to generalize conclusions from this body of research to the population as a whole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0022146512468280">Patterson 2000</xref>). A number of these studies have found no discernible differences when comparing gay, lesbian, and heterosexual populations (typically defined by sexual identity) on a variety of outcomes (e.g., relationship quality, psychological adjustment, child well-being) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0022146512468280">Kurdek 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0022146512468280">Patterson 2000</xref>). Although data limitations remain a major obstacle to population-based research in this area, recent developments provide an opportunity to identify same-sex cohabitors in large survey data sets. For example, by merging three data sets, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0022146512468280">Wienke and Hill (2009)</xref> found that same-sex cohabitors, different-sex married persons, and different-sex cohabitors reported similar levels of self-rated health. Although informative, this work is limited by inconsistencies in measurements and ambiguity of representative populations because of the combination of three different surveys, each with its own survey design and sampling method. In contrast to Wienke and Hill’s research, other population-based studies have revealed that in comparison with their different-sex married counterparts, individuals in same-sex cohabiting relationships tend to have more physical health problems, such as human immunodeficiency virus infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022146512468280">Campsmith et al. 2010</xref>), asthma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022146512468280">Heck and Jacobson 2006</xref>), activity limitations, and cardiovascular diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022146512468280">Conron, Mimiaga, and Landers 2010</xref>). Taken together, previous research provides few consistent population-based findings on the general health of same-sex cohabitors relative to their different-sex married or cohabiting counterparts.</p>
<p>Recent research emphasizes the need to incorporate the complete range of nonmarried individuals, including the divorced, widowed, and never-married single, to fully understand the relationship between union status and health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022146512468280">Liu and Reczek 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022146512468280">Liu and Umberson 2008</xref>), yet few studies have compared the health of same-sex cohabitors with that of individuals in these single groups. Additionally, previous empirical research on same-sex cohabitation and health has tended to either ignore socioeconomic, racial-ethnic, and gender dynamics or has simply included these factors as control covariates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022146512468280">Institute of Medicine 2011</xref>). Consequently, previous research has not fully addressed how these factors work together to influence health differences between same-sex cohabitors and other union status groups. To address these issues, we draw on theoretical and empirical research concerning SES, racial-ethnic, and gender differences in health to compare the health status of same-sex cohabitors with that of other union status groups.</p>

<title>Same-Sex Cohabiting versus Different-Sex Married: SES, Gender, and Race-Ethnicity Hypotheses</title>
<p>SES is a “fundamental cause” of health disparities; higher levels of SES, most often measured by income and education, uniquely promote access to valued material (e.g., economic goods) and nonmaterial (e.g., sense of control) resources that enhance mental and physical well-being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0022146512468280">Link and Phelan 1995</xref>). Previous population-based research suggests that same-sex cohabitors are more educated than their different-sex married counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022146512468280">Black et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022146512468280">Gates and Ost 2004</xref>), possibly because of selection processes in which only the most educated gays and lesbians are able or willing to cross social boundaries and publically enter into same-sex cohabiting relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0022146512468280">Ohlander, Batalova, and Treas 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0022146512468280">Rosenfeld 2007</xref>). However, same-sex cohabitors earn less than different-sex married persons, possibly because of workforce discrimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022146512468280">Badgett 2001</xref>). Income differentials between same-sex cohabitors and different-sex married persons are further exacerbated because same-sex cohabitors are restricted from marrying and are thus unable to access financial benefits accrued with marriage (e.g., state and federal tax breaks). Therefore, even same-sex cohabitors whose gross incomes are identical to those of different-sex married persons may have less disposable income (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022146512468280">Institute of Medicine 2011</xref>). Additionally, because of their inability to legally marry, same-sex cohabitors may experience barriers to obtaining insurance benefits via an employed spouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022146512468280">Heck, Sell, and Gorin 2006</xref>). This in turn increases out-of-pocket costs associated with the receipt of health care services, creating a financial barrier to timely, high-quality health care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022146512468280">Heck et al. 2006</xref>). Taken together, we propose the following hypotheses:</p>
<list id="list1-0022146512468280" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 1</italic>: Same-sex cohabitors will have worse health than their different-sex married counterparts.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 1a</italic>: These differences are due partially to same-sex cohabitors’ lower levels of SES.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Importantly, however, the mechanisms linking different-sex marriage and health are gendered. Women are more likely than men to experience health benefits from increased economic resources via their spouses’ earnings in different-sex marriage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0022146512468280">Waite and Gallagher 2000</xref>). Because men on average earn more than women, it may be that two men in a same-sex relationship experience even greater economic resources, and thus better health, than different-sex married men, whereas two women in a same-sex relationship experience relatively fewer economic resources, and thus worse health, than women in different-sex marriages. However, studies have shown that men in same-sex relationships earn significantly less than men in different-sex marriages with the same levels of education, whereas women in same-sex relationships are not significantly disadvantaged in terms of income compared with women in different-sex marriages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022146512468280">Black, Sanders, and Taylor 2007</xref>; for contrary evidence, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022146512468280">Badgett 2001</xref>). Moreover, married men receive psychosocial benefits from marriage because their wives tend to maintain social networks, provide emotional support, and regulate health behaviors, while men provide fewer such resources to their spouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0022146512468280">Reczek and Umberson 2012</xref>). The gendered norms found in different-sex marriages suggest that men in same-sex cohabiting relationships would obtain relatively fewer, and women in same-sex relationships relatively more, psychosocial resources from their partner. Thus, we hypothesize that:</p>
<list id="list2-0022146512468280" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 1b</italic>: If same-sex cohabitors report worse health than different-sex married persons, the gap will be larger among men than women.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Race-ethnicity may further complicate these dynamics. Because married non-Hispanic black (hereafter “black”) or Hispanic men earn less than married non-Hispanic white (hereafter “white”) men, black and Hispanic women in racially homogamous marriages may not receive the same financial boost from marriage as their white female counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0022146512468280">Cohen 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022146512468280">Edin and Kefalas 2005</xref>). Therefore, the socioeconomic, and thus health, dividends of marriage may be less pronounced among blacks and Hispanics than whites, perhaps especially among women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022146512468280">Liu and Reczek 2012</xref>). Moreover, recent research suggests that black and Hispanic men and women are less likely than white men and women to participate in a same-sex cohabiting relationship (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022146512468280">Herek et al. 2010</xref>), possibly because of higher levels of homophobia in the black and Hispanic communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022146512468280">Bonilla and Porter 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022146512468280">Herek et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022146512468280">Institute of Medicine 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022146512468280">Lewis 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022146512468280">Loftus 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0022146512468280">Ramirez-Valles et al. 2010</xref>). This suggests that only the most socioeconomically advantaged black and Hispanic individuals are able to openly live in same-sex relationships. Thus, the selection process of individuals with higher SES into same-sex cohabitation may be more pronounced among blacks and Hispanics than whites, which could reduce the potential health disadvantage of black and Hispanic same-sex cohabitors in comparison with their different-sex married counterparts. Taken together, we expect that:</p>

<title>Same-Sex versus Different-Sex Cohabiting: SES, Gender, and Race-Ethnicity Hypotheses</title>
<p>Same-sex and different-sex cohabitors alike lack the socioeconomic, psychosocial, and institutional protections for their relationships reportedly found in marriage—these protections are argued to be a key factor explaining the health benefits of marriage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0022146512468280">Waite and Gallagher 2000</xref>). Such analogous contexts suggest that same-sex and different-sex cohabitors may in turn have similar health outcomes. Yet despite this commonality, same-sex cohabitors are distinguished from different-sex cohabitors in significant ways. Different-sex cohabitors are more likely to be in short-term relationships with less commitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0022146512468280">Waite and Gallagher 2000</xref>), whereas same-sex cohabitors as a group are more likely to include longer term cohabitors with higher levels of commitment because of the illegality of same-sex marriage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0022146512468280">Reczek, Elliott, and Umberson 2009</xref>; but also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022146512468280">Lau 2012</xref>). Therefore, same-sex cohabitors as a whole may be more likely to share socioeconomic and psychosocial resources than different-sex cohabitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0022146512468280">Reczek and Umberson 2012</xref>). Resource pooling and relationship commitment are important because they increase relationship stability; persons in stable, high-quality relationships have better mental and physical health than those in unstable, lower quality relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0022146512468280">Umberson and Montez 2010</xref>). Moreover, same-sex cohabitors generally have higher SES than different-sex cohabitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022146512468280">Black et al. 2007</xref>), possibly because of the considerable socioeconomic, psychosocial, and institutional resources that may be necessary to transverse social boundaries to publically enter into a same-sex cohabiting relationship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022146512468280">Meyer 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0022146512468280">Rosenfeld 2007</xref>). Taken together, we propose the following hypotheses:</p>
<list id="list4-0022146512468280" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 2</italic>: Same-sex cohabitors will have better health than different-sex cohabitors.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 2a</italic>: These differences are due partially to same-sex cohabitors’ higher levels of SES.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Once again, these dynamics likely vary by gender and race-ethnicity. In comparison with same-sex cohabiting women, same-sex cohabiting men tend to have longer relationship durations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022146512468280">Andersson et al. 2006</xref>; but also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022146512468280">Lau 2012</xref>). This could indicate that same-sex cohabiting men on average may be more committed to their partners and more likely to share socioeconomic and psychosocial resources that promote health than same-sex cohabiting women. Moreover, studies suggest that men’s economic circumstances are more influential than women’s in union formation decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0022146512468280">Oppenheimer 1988</xref>; also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0022146512468280">Sweeney 2002</xref>). Cohabitation is more common among lower SES heterosexual men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0022146512468280">Smock 2000</xref>), whereas gay men with higher SES are more likely to cohabit rather than remain single (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0022146512468280">Rosenfeld 2007</xref>). These socioeconomic differentials may contribute to health differences between same-sex and different-sex cohabiting men. Both lesbian and heterosexual women’s SES appears to be less important for union formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0022146512468280">Oppenheimer 1988</xref>; also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0022146512468280">Sweeney 2002</xref>), which may level off health differences between same-sex and different-sex cohabiting women. Taken together, we expect that:</p>
<list id="list5-0022146512468280" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 2b</italic>: If same-sex cohabitors report better health than different-sex cohabitors, the gap will be larger among men than women.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Additionally, blacks and Hispanics are more likely than whites to live in different-sex cohabiting unions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022146512468280">Brown et al. 2008</xref>), suggesting that cohabitation (either same-sex or different-sex) may have different meanings and dynamics that are linked to health across racial-ethnic groups. Whites are the most likely to marry their different-sex cohabiting partners, and therefore different-sex cohabitation for this group may be more of a trial marriage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0022146512468280">Thornton, Axinn, and Xie 2007</xref>). In contrast, different-sex cohabitations, and perhaps also same-sex cohabitations, tend to be an alternative to marriage and perhaps more “marriage-like” for blacks and Hispanics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022146512468280">Brown et al. 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0022146512468280">Thornton et al. 2007</xref>). Therefore, same-sex and different-sex cohabitation may be more similar to different-sex marriage for blacks and Hispanics and thus mirror the process of different-sex marriage in promoting health. This suggests that:</p>

<title>Same-Sex Cohabiting versus Unpartnered Single<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0022146512468280">3</xref></sup>: SES, Gender, and Race-Ethnicity Hypotheses</title>
<p>Researchers have yet to investigate how the health status of same-sex cohabitors compares with that of other unpartnered singles, including the never married, divorced, and widowed. The transition out of marriage via divorce or widowhood is a stressful life event, and stress is a risk factor for unhealthy behaviors, depression, poor physical health, and mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022146512468280">Liu 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0022146512468280">Williams and Umberson 2004</xref>). The emotional strain that divorced and widowed individuals experience often is compounded by a significant loss in socioeconomic resources with the dissolution of a marriage, especially among women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0022146512468280">Williams and Umberson 2004</xref>). Although the never married do not experience the stress that accompanies divorce or widowhood, they have only partial access to socioeconomic resources because they do not share resources (e.g., rent) with a partner. Although same-sex cohabitors experience high levels of stress due to discrimination and homophobia, which may in turn promote poor health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022146512468280">Meyer 2003</xref>), same-sex cohabitors are hypothesized to accumulate at least some socioeconomic and psychosocial benefits by virtue of sharing resources and having a close companion. Indeed, recent studies with nationally representative data have found that same-sex cohabitors have higher levels of SES than unpartnered single individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022146512468280">Black et al. 2007</xref>).

<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 3a</italic>: These differences are due partially to same-sex cohabitors’ higher levels of SES.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Previous research on gender and race-ethnicity shapes expectations of comparisons between same-sex cohabitors and single groups. In terms of gender, research suggests that although divorce, widowhood, and never marrying are more likely to lead to economic hardship for women, these union statuses more significantly diminish the health of men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0022146512468280">Williams and Umberson 2004</xref>). This is in part because divorced, widowed, and never-married women are more likely to maintain social network connections, whereas men in similar union statuses are more likely to be socially isolated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022146512468280">Liu and Umberson 2008</xref>). Additionally, because the socioeconomic characteristics of men, but not women, drive union status transitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0022146512468280">Oppenheimer 1988</xref>; also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0022146512468280">Sweeney 2002</xref>), it may be that heterosexual men with the lowest levels of SES are more likely to experience marital dissolution and remain single. Yet gay men with the highest levels of SES are more likely to cohabit with their partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0022146512468280">Rosenfeld 2007</xref>). Such SES differences are likely associated with significant health disparities between same-sex cohabiting and unpartnered single men. In contrast, women’s SES may be less important when entering or dissolving a relationship, and therefore the health differences between same-sex cohabiting and unpartnered single women may be diminished. Thus, we expect that:</p>

<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 3b</italic>: If same-sex cohabitors report better health than divorced, widowed, and never-married singles, the gap will be larger among men than women.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Moreover, in comparison with whites, blacks have a higher risk for divorce, widowhood, and never marrying (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022146512468280">Bulanda and Brown 2007</xref>), suggesting that such unpartnered statuses may be more normative in black communities and thus carry less stress and negative health consequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022146512468280">Liu and Umberson 2008</xref>). Research also suggests that blacks in different-sex married and cohabiting unions, and perhaps also in same-sex unions, report higher levels of relationship strain than whites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022146512468280">Bulanda and Brown 2007</xref>); such strain is shown to reduce the benefit of intimate relationships for health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0022146512468280">Umberson and Montez 2010</xref>). Although behaviors surrounding different-sex union transitions appear to be more similar for Hispanics and whites, divorced, widowed, and never-married Hispanics are more likely to receive support from family and friends than whites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022146512468280">Bulanda and Brown 2007</xref>), which may alleviate some of the negative consequences of an unpartnered status for Hispanics. Additionally, both Hispanic and black same-sex cohabitors are more likely to suffer higher levels of homophobia than white same-sex cohabitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022146512468280">Herek et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022146512468280">Lewis 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022146512468280">Loftus 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0022146512468280">Ramirez-Valles et al. 2010</xref>), which may reduce the health benefits of blacks and Hispanics in a same-sex intimate relationship relative to singlehood. Taken together, this body of work suggests that:</p>

<title>Data and Methods</title>
<sec id="section6-0022146512468280">
<title>Data</title>
<p>We use pooled data from the 1997 to 2009 Integrated National Health Interview Surveys (NHIS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022146512468280">Minnesota Population Center and State Health Access Data Assistance Center 2010</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0022146512468280">4</xref></sup> The NHIS is a cross-sectional household survey conducted annually by the National Center for Health Statistics. The NHIS is representative of the U.S. civilian noninstitutionalized population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0022146512468280">National Center for Health Statistics 2000</xref>). We limit our analyses to respondents aged 18 to 65 years identified as non-Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic blacks, and Hispanics. We exclude respondents aged 66 and older because research suggests that both cohabitation and same-sex relationships have very different meanings among older adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022146512468280">Chevan 1996</xref>). We also exclude a minority (&lt;2 percent) of observations with missing values on union status or self-rated health. Our final analytic sample (<italic>N</italic> = 686,846) contains 1,659 men and 1,634 women identified as same-sex cohabitors. All analyses are weighted to account for the inverse probability of selection into the sample and poststratification on the basis of age, race-ethnicity, and gender. The “svy” commands in Stata were used to account for the complex nature of the NHIS sample design (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0022146512468280">StataCorp LP 2007</xref>).</p>

<title>Measures</title>
<sec id="section8-0022146512468280">
<title>Same-sex cohabitors and other union statuses</title>
<p>We use the household survey nature of the NHIS data that provide sociodemographic information of each household member. Within each household, one person was identified as the reference person, and interviewers recorded the relationship of each household member to the reference person. We identify individuals in a same-sex cohabiting relationship if a household member with the same gender as the reference person is listed as a “spouse” or “unmarried partner” of the reference person. Notably, this approach increases the potential risk for misclassification bias because of miscoded gender. However, because the NHIS is collected via face-to-face interviews, the potential for gender miscodes should be lower in the NHIS than in other national data sources that identify same-sex cohabitors (e.g., the U.S. Census).</p>
<p><italic>Union status</italic> is categorized into six categories: same-sex cohabiting (the reference), different-sex married, different-sex cohabiting, divorced, widowed, and never married. Although we are able to identify respondents in same-sex marriages, our analyses combine same-sex married and cohabiting respondents for two primary reasons. First, the number of same-sex married individuals in the sample is relatively small. Second, the social and legal meanings, and therefore the health implications, of marriage for these individuals are unclear because same-sex marriage is allowed only in a minority of states and is not legally recognized at the federal level. For example, it may be that cohabitors in this sample define themselves as married as a symbolic act (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0022146512468280">Reczek et al. 2009</xref>) or were legally married in a state that allows same-sex marriage (e.g., Massachusetts) but live in another state and receive no institutional benefits from this marriage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0022146512468280">Rosenfeld 2007</xref>). Notably, the NHIS did not collect data on sexual orientation during the study period, so we are unable to identify gay and lesbian respondents who are not in cohabiting relationships.</p>

<sec id="section9-0022146512468280">
<title>Self-rated health</title>
<p>Our dependent variable is self-rated health. Respondents rated their overall health as excellent, very good, good, fair, or poor. We recode self-rated health into a dichotomous variable indicating poor or fair health (coded 1) or excellent, very good, or good health (coded 0). Prior research indicates that self-rated health is an irreplaceable dimension of health status and a robust predictor of subsequent disability and mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0022146512468280">Idler and Benyamini 1997</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0022146512468280">
<title>SES</title>
<p>We examine three measures of SES<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0022146512468280">5</xref></sup>: education, poverty status, and insurance coverage. Education is measured as a categorical variable: no high school diploma (the reference), high school graduate or General Educational Development certificate, some college education, college graduate, or missing report (2.34 percent). Poverty status is based on poverty thresholds published annually by the U.S. Census Bureau. The measure takes into account self-reported total family income, family size, and the ages and number of children present. Persons who have a total family income below the poverty threshold for families of a given size and age composition are considered “in poverty.” Poverty status is missing for almost a quarter (23.21 percent) of the respondents in the total analyzed sample. We flag respondents with missing values for poverty status in the analyses; the reference category contains persons deemed “not in poverty.” The variable representing health insurance coverage has three categories: covered by at least one public or private health care insurance program during the past 12 months (the reference), no health insurance coverage during the past 12 months, and a flag for respondents with missing health insurance information (0.91 percent of the total sample).</p>
<p>Other demographic covariates include race-ethnicity (white, black, and Hispanic, with white as the reference), age in years, nativity status (native born, foreign born, and unknown, with native born as the reference), and survey year (centered at 1997).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0022146512468280">6</xref></sup> These covariates are related to both self-rated health and union status and are controlled as potential confounders in the models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022146512468280">Liu and Umberson 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0022146512468280">Rosenfeld 2007</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section11-0022146512468280">
<title>Analytic Strategy</title>
<p>To evaluate our hypotheses, we estimate three nested binary logistic regression models separately for men and women. The first model regresses poor or fair self-rated health on union status, age, race-ethnicity, nativity status, and survey year. This model establishes whether differences in self-rated health exist between same-sex cohabitors and other union status groups net of the effects of basic demographic controls. In the second model, we add additional controls for education, poverty status, and health insurance coverage to examine the extent to which SES contributes to differences in self-rated health between same-sex cohabitors and other union status groups. We conduct post hoc tests (Wald <italic>F</italic> tests) to compare coefficients from Models 1 and 2 to evaluate whether controlling for SES significantly alters the association between union status and self-rated health. These analyses indicated that all of the changes observed in the union status coefficients between Models 1 and 2 were statistically significant (<italic>p</italic> ≤ .001). Finally, our third model introduces a series of interaction terms for race-ethnicity by union status to explore whether significant racial-ethnic variations exist in the association between union status and self-rated health.</p>

<title>The Role of SES</title>
<p>To assess how SES contributes to the general differences in self-rated health between same-sex cohabitors and other union status groups, we add education, poverty status, and insurance coverage in Model 2 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0022146512468280">Tables 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0022146512468280">4</xref> as additional covariates. A comparison of results from Models 1 and 2 suggests that, after controlling for SES in Model 2, different-sex married men and women tend to have lower odds of reporting poor or fair health in comparison with their same-sex cohabiting counterparts. Moreover, after controlling for SES, the higher odds of reporting poor or fair health of different-sex cohabitors, the divorced, widowed, and never married in comparison with same-sex cohabitors all become nonsignificant for both men and women.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0022146512468280">
<title>Race-Ethnicity and Gender Variations</title>
<p>To further examine whether the relationship between union status and self-rated health varies by race-ethnicity and gender, we include race-ethnicity interactions by union status in Model 3 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0022146512468280">Tables 3</xref> (men) and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0022146512468280">4</xref> (women). The nonsignificant union status and race-ethnicity interaction terms for men displayed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0022146512468280">Table 3</xref> (Model 3) suggest that self-rated health differences documented in the previous model between same-sex cohabitors and other union status groups do not differ across race-ethnic groups. The results for women (Model 3 of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0022146512468280">Table 4</xref>) suggest that although the difference in self-rated health between different-sex married women and same-sex cohabiting women is not significantly different across racial-ethnic groups, there are significant racial-ethnic variations when comparing same-sex cohabiting women with other nonmarried women. The significant interaction effects of the nonmarried statuses by race-ethnicity for women in Model 3 of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0022146512468280">Table 4</xref> suggest that the health advantage of same-sex cohabitors relative to these nonmarried groups exists only among white women and does not exist among black or Hispanic women. To better illustrate these racial-ethnic interaction results for women, we calculate odds ratios of reporting poor or fair health by union status for white women, black women, and Hispanic women on the basis of results from Model 3 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0022146512468280">Table 4</xref>. We report these calculated odds ratios in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0022146512468280">Table 5</xref>. These results suggest that different-sex cohabiting and divorced white women have higher odds of reporting poor or fair health than same-sex cohabiting white women, although widowed and never-married white women have similar odds of reporting poor or fair health as same-sex cohabiting white women. In contrast, the odds of reporting poor or fair health are significantly lower for different-sex cohabiting, divorced, widowed, and never-married black women, respectively, in comparison with same-sex cohabiting black women. Never-married Hispanic women also have lower odds of reporting poor or fair health than their same-sex cohabiting Hispanic women counterparts, although different-sex cohabiting, divorced, or widowed Hispanic women are not significantly different from same-sex cohabiting Hispanic women in terms of self-rated health.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The implications of same-sex relationships for population well-being are a continued concern, as underscored by a recent report by the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022146512468280">Institute of Medicine (2011)</xref>. Despite theoretical development highlighting the potential importance of same-sex relationships for health, very little is known about the health of this population, because empirical evidence from population-based national data is rare. The present study is among the first to examine the association between same-sex cohabitation and self-rated health with a large nationally representative sample. On the basis of pooled data from the 1997 to 2009 NHIS, we find significant differences in self-rated health between same-sex cohabitors and other union status groups. We discuss these significant results in relation to the role of SES, gender, and race-ethnicity below.</p>
<sec id="section17-0022146512468280">
<title>Health Differences between Same-Sex Cohabitors and Other Union Statuses: General Findings and the Role of SES</title>
<p>Given previous research on union status and health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022146512468280">Liu and Reczek 2012</xref>), we hypothesized that same-sex cohabitors overall would have worse health than their different-sex married counterparts (Hypothesis 1), and we indeed find this to be the case. This finding is inconsistent with a previous study that found no difference in self-reports of health status when comparing same-sex cohabitors with different-sex married persons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0022146512468280">Wienke and Hill 2009</xref>). This inconsistency is perhaps due to the small number of identified same-sex cohabitors in the previous study, which reduced the statistical power to make inferences on group differences. It is noteworthy that socioeconomically disadvantaged gay and lesbian individuals may choose not to disclose their involvement in a same-sex cohabiting relationship because of fear of social and economic discrimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0022146512468280">Ohlander et al. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0022146512468280">Rosenfeld 2007</xref>). Therefore, our sample may be selective of individuals in same-sex cohabiting relationships who are the most advantaged and healthiest. If this were true, the estimated health disadvantages of same-sex cohabitors relative to different-sex married persons are conservative.</p>
<p>We also hypothesized that the poorer health of same-sex cohabitors in comparison with different-sex married persons would be due to their lower levels of SES (Hypothesis 1a), but this hypothesis was not supported. Indeed, without considering SES differences, we would have observed similar health between same-sex cohabitors and different-sex married individuals. However, at the same levels of SES, same-sex cohabitors report worse health than their different-sex married counterparts. The question therefore remains: What factors other than SES might explain the poorer health of same-sex cohabitors relative to different-sex married persons? It may be that same-sex cohabitors experience higher levels of discrimination via homophobia than individuals who do not identify as sexual minorities by virtue of living together and disclosing their relationship status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022146512468280">Meyer 2003</xref>). Research consistently suggests that “out” sexual minorities experience heightened levels of stress and higher levels of discrimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022146512468280">Institute of Medicine 2011</xref>), and these experiences may in turn significantly influence the health of this population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022146512468280">Institute of Medicine 2011</xref>). The additional stress associated with having disclosed a same-sex relationship, therefore, may contribute to their worse health compared with different-sex married persons.</p>
<p>It may also be that same-sex cohabitation does not provide the same psychosocial, socioeconomic, and institutional resources that come with legal marriage, factors that are theorized to be responsible for many of the health benefits of marriage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0022146512468280">Waite and Gallagher 2000</xref>). Access to legal marriage may provide same-sex cohabitors health benefits similar to those found in different-sex married persons, reducing this health disparity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022146512468280">Lau and Strohm 2011</xref>). Because same-sex marriage is not legal at the federal level and is legal in only a minority of states in the United States, few same-sex cohabitors are able to self-select into legal marriage; thus, it is likely that same-sex cohabitors identified in this study are a particularly heterogeneous group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0022146512468280">Rosenfeld 2007</xref>). In this vein, as feminist and queer theories suggest, marriage and cohabitation may have different symbolic and political meanings for same-sex and different-sex couples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022146512468280">Lannutti 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0022146512468280">Reczek and Rothblum 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0022146512468280">Rothblum 2005</xref>), further suggesting that our sample captures a wide range of same-sex cohabiting individuals. For example, it is likely that a portion of the same-sex cohabitors in our sample would marry if they could (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0022146512468280">Reczek et al. 2009</xref>), whereas others in similarly committed long-term cohabiting relationships would not marry, because they oppose the institution of marriage. These committed cohabitors, even without legal marriage, may receive the same health benefits as different-sex married individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0022146512468280">Reczek and Umberson 2012</xref>). In this way, even if same-sex couples were able to legally marry at the federal level, these individuals may not experience a marital health boost, because they have already experienced enhanced health via their cohabiting ties. Future research should consider the heterogeneity of same-sex cohabitors when studying health disparities among this population.</p>
<p>We also hypothesized that same-sex cohabitors would have better health than other nonmarried groups, including different-sex cohabitors (Hypo-thesis 2) as well as the divorced, widowed and never-married singles (Hypothesis 3). Consistent with these hypotheses, we find that same-sex cohabitors have lower odds of reporting poor or fair health than different-sex cohabiting, divorced, widowed, and never-married individuals. Moreover, consistent with Hypotheses 2a and 3a, our results further suggest that the better health of same-sex cohabitors in comparison with other nonmarried groups is fully explained by socio-economic characteristics. Same-sex cohabitors have greater socioeconomic resources than both different-sex cohabitors and single individuals, which may contribute to better health by, for example, the purchasing of healthy food and residence in safer neighborhood with more access to exercise facilitates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022146512468280">Mirowsky and Ross 2003</xref>). Yet without their socioeconomic premium, we find little health benefit accrued from being involved in a same-sex cohabiting relationship compared with other nonmarried statuses. As discussed above, it is possible that same-sex cohabitors are more likely on average to be in long-term, “marriage-like” committed relationships in which they accrue at least some health promoting socioeconomic resources, inaccessible for other nonmarried groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0022146512468280">Reczek et al. 2009</xref>). Yet with socioeconomic advantages held constant, same-sex cohabitors lose their health advantage, possibly because of experiences with higher levels of stress due to homophobic and heteronormative institutional, legal, and social contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022146512468280">Institute of Medicine 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0022146512468280">Reczek 2012</xref>). Another possibility is that these health differences are a result of a selection process due to gay and lesbian individuals who have lower income and education and are also less likely to participate in or disclose their cohabiting status in the survey because of fear of homophobia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022146512468280">Gates and Ost 2004</xref>).</p>

<title>Race-Ethnicity and Gender Variations</title>
<p>Given the long-standing literature on the linkages between gender, race-ethnicity, and union status and health, we expected that the health differences between same-sex cohabitors and other union statuses would be more pronounced for men than women (Hypotheses 1b, 2b, and 3b) and for whites than blacks and Hispanics (Hypotheses 1c, 2c, and 3c). We find mixed evidence for these gender and racial-ethnic patterns. First, our results suggest that the pattern of poorer self-rated health of same-sex cohabitors in comparison with different-sex married persons is quite robust and does not vary by gender and race-ethnicity. This suggests that in comparison with different-sex married persons, the health disadvantage of same-sex cohabitors is prevalent in the general population and is not specific to one racial-ethnic or gender group. Although marriage provides a stronger health boost for men than women and for whites than racial-ethnic minorities, research consistently shows that men and women in all racial-ethnic groups benefit at least partially from marriage because of increased social, psychological, and economic resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022146512468280">Carr and Springer 2010</xref>). Therefore, it is likely that an inability to participate in marriage, regardless of gender or race-ethnicity, reduces access to resources and in turn diminishes the health of same-sex cohabitors.</p>
<p>In contrast, our results comparing same-sex cohabitors with different-sex cohabiting and single women, but not men, revealed important racial-ethnic patterns. We find that same-sex cohabiting white women report better health than both different-sex cohabiting white women and divorced white women net of the effects of SES, while same-sex cohabiting black women report worse health than their different-sex cohabiting, divorced, widowed and never-married black female counterparts. Still, same-sex cohabiting Hispanic women report similar health as their different-sex cohabiting, divorced, and widowed Hispanic female counterparts but worse health than their never-married Hispanic female counterparts. Several explanations may account for this racial-ethnic difference among women. White women in same-sex relationships are more likely than their black and Hispanic counterparts to define themselves as feminists, have egalitarian household divisions of labor, have both partners in full-time employment, and adhere to general ideals of equality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0022146512468280">Moore 2011</xref>), factors that may in turn boost same-sex cohabiting white women’s health status. Moreover, previous studies suggest that gays and lesbians are more likely to experience stress due to social discrimination and public malice compared with the general heterosexual population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022146512468280">Meyer 2003</xref>). This social stress may particularly shape the social context of racial-ethnic minorities, who may experience more stigma, discrimination, and economic disadvantages than their white counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022146512468280">Herek et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022146512468280">Institute of Medicine 2011</xref>). For example, black and Hispanic women may face more overt employment discrimination or may have less social support outlets to help cope with discrimination, compared with white women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022146512468280">Black et al. 2007</xref>). Together, these factors may produce a type of “triple jeopardy” wherein socioeconomically disadvantagedracial-ethnic and sexual minorities—especially black women and to a lesser degree Hispanic women in same-sex relationships—face multiple stressors that undermine health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022146512468280">Institute of Medicine 2011</xref>). This could lead to lower levels of psychological well-being and promote unhealthy behaviors, which may be in turn detrimental to the physical health of black and Hispanic women in same-sex relationships. Future research should examine the extent to which psychological and behavioral mechanisms explain the self-rated health disadvantage of racial-ethnic minority women, especially black women, in same-sex relationships.</p>
<p>We emphasize that our results concerning racial-ethnic variations in the association between same-sex cohabitation and self-rated health are tentative in many respects given that our sample contains relatively small numbers of black and Hispanic same-sex cohabitors. This limitation is compounded when one considers that the models we present are gender specific and that reports of poor or fair self-rated health are relatively uncommon. Moreover, given research suggesting that blacks and Hispanics express higher levels of disapproval toward homosexuality than their white counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022146512468280">Bonilla and Porter 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0022146512468280">Herek et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022146512468280">Lewis 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022146512468280">Loftus 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0022146512468280">Ramirez-Valles et al. 2010</xref>), it is possible that our sample is more selective of black and Hispanic same-sex cohabitors with higher levels of education who are able or willing to cross social boundaries and publically enter into same-sex cohabiting relationships. If this scenario holds, the health disadvantages we document among black and Hispanic same-sex cohabitors, especially black women, are conservative.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This study is among the first to use nationally representative data to compare the self-rated health of same-sex cohabitors with that of different-sex married, different-sex cohabiting, divorced, widowed, and never-married individuals. Our results suggest that same-sex cohabitors report poorer health than different-sex married individuals if they have similar levels of SES. However, SES protects same-sex cohabitors from reporting poorer health in comparison with other nonmarried groups. Without their SES advantages, same-sex cohabitors would generally report similar levels of health as their different-sex cohabiting, divorced, widowed, and never-married counterparts. We also note that some individuals in same-sex cohabitating relationships, particularly black women, may experience significant social discrimination and homophobia, and such stressors may shape their health in especially detrimental ways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022146512468280">Institute of Medicine 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Although our analyses provide compelling evidence that same-sex cohabitors report poorer health than individuals in different-sex marriages, we do not and cannot directly assess the potential health consequences of legalizing same-sex marriage. Yet it is plausible that legalizing same-sex marriage would provide a viable alternative to cohabitation for same-sex couples and increase public support for same-sex relationships. Therefore, it may be that providing same-sex cohabitors the option to marry at the state and/or federal level will boost measures of self-rated health across sexual minority populations because of higher levels of acceptance and lower levels of stigma in general (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022146512468280">Lau and Strohm 2011</xref>). Moreover, legalizing same-sex marriage could provide other important socioeconomic and psychological benefits often associated with different-sex marriage—such as partner health insurance benefits, joint tax returns, and increased relationship support—that may directly and indirectly influence the health of individuals in same-sex unions. In this sense, with such legalization, individuals who choose to enter into same-sex marriages may experience a “marriage benefit” in self-rated health similar to their different-sex married counterparts. However, recent research suggests that married and cohabiting individuals are becoming more similar in their benefit for health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0022146512468280">Musick and Bumpass 2012</xref>), so it may be that even if provided access to legal marriage, same-sex married individuals may not experience a marital boost in self-rated health relative to their same-sex cohabiting counterparts. Although only a minority of states have legalized same-sex marriage, a critical next step in research in this area is to move beyond our descriptive examination of same-sex cohabitors to explore how the health of individuals in same-sex marriages and cohabiting unions, as well as single gays and lesbians, is shaped by the legalization of same-sex marriage.</p>
<p>Additionally, a growing body of evidence suggests that the relationship between union status and health varies across racial-ethnic groups, wherein black and Hispanic individuals do not receive as high a “marital boost” as their white counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022146512468280">Liu and Reczek 2012</xref>). Therefore, access to legalized same-sex marriage at the state and/or federal level may have different health consequences across racial-ethnic groups. This possibility should be explored in future research to fully parse the relationship between union status and health disparities in same-sex populations. The present study suggests that some racial-ethnic sexual minorities may be at an increased risk for poor health; determining why these groups are at risk for health should be the focus of increased research attention. Future research should also pay particular attention to developing new approaches and policy recommendations to alleviate health disparities among same-sex racial-ethnic minority populations who may be at a particular disadvantage.</p>
<p>This study reveals additional novel and exciting areas for future research. First, because of our cross-sectional data, we are unable to determine whether our findings regarding SES are a result of selection into union status groups or if SES is acting as a mediator in this association. Future research should use longitudinal data to address this limitation. Moreover, we do not examine individuals in same-sex relationships who are over the age of 65 years. It is likely that there are critical cohort and age differences in the relationship between same-sex relationships and self-rated health, perhaps strongly related to minority stress experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022146512468280">Meyer 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0022146512468280">Reczek et al. 2009</xref>). Future research should work toward elucidating the health outcomes of older adults in same-sex relationships and examining age and cohort differences in these measures. Finally, although this study is among the first to examine general health from a population-based sample, future research should look beyond self-rated health to examine how other more specific health measures—such as substance use, body weight, and mental health (e.g., psychological distress)—relate to union status for same-sex populations. This line of research, building on the present study, will broaden our understanding of the relationship between same-sex union status and health so that we can more completely address disadvantage and disparities found among this minority population.</p>

<p>Previous literature is mixed concerning the role SES plays in the relationship between union status and health. Given that persons who are healthier and have higher levels of education and family income (and thus greater likelihood of having insurance) are also more likely to select into marriage and remain married (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0022146512468280">Sweeney 2002</xref>), it is possible that SES would operate as a precursor or confounder in the relationship between union status and health. In contrast, some scholars regard SES as a potential mediator linking union status and health, as they argue that marriage (and to a less extent cohabitation) may promote socioeconomic resources (especially higher levels of family income and insurance coverage) that in turn lead to better health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0022146512468280">Waite and Gallagher 2000</xref>). In this study, we examine SES as one potential factor that may explain the association between union status and health. Our analyses are descriptive, and the cross-sectional data limit our ability to tease out the casual or selection processes related to SES that links union status and health. However, this issue warrants further examination in future research.</p>

<p>In additional analyses (not shown but available on request), we estimated models with interaction terms of union status by survey year. The results suggested that the self-rated health gap between same-sex cohabitors and any other union status group examined remained relatively stable over the study period. It may be that our same-sex cohabiting sample within individual survey year is relatively small, which may reduce the statistical power of detecting significant trends over time. Future research should explore these trends using other data sets.</p>
