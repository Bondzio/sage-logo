<abstract>
<p>Agazarian’s (1997, 2001) systems-centered therapy and training (SCT)1 extends Foulkes’ (1964) concept of inseparable, interacting personal and group matrices to a three-level hierarchical matrix. SCT presents the group member nesting in a subgroup, in turn nesting in the group-as-a-whole. The SCT group member works by joining other members exploring a similar experience in the here-and-now, thus forming a ‘functional subgroup’ of the group-as-a-whole. In this study, two large groups (ns=76 and 91) used functional subgrouping during experiential SCT training. As hypothesized, more functional subgrouping predicts better member mood, more learning, and more goal achievement post-training. To our knowledge this is the first empirical demonstration of factors predicting outcome in large training groups.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0533316412448287">Foulkes (1975a)</xref> expanded the intrapsychic model of traditional psychoanalytic theory by reconceptualizing the mind as reflecting the social communications of its interpersonal network. His conceptual shift required modification of individual psychoanalysis in order to establish group analysis, replacing free association with ‘Free-floating Discussion’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0533316412448287">1975a</xref>: 181).</p>
<p>He emphasizes that interpersonal communication, not individual interpretation, is the mechanism of therapeutic change. The group analyst guides group members in developing a new interpersonal matrix of supportive, exploratory inter-relationships through open discussion of human experiences.</p>
<p>Foulkes’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0533316412448287">1975a</xref>) model is transformative, yet largely consistent with traditional psychoanalysis. However, some 30 years later, he describes liabilities that psychoanalytic theory and training create for the group analyst when implementing his theoretical and technical modifications. These liabilities predispose the analyst to see individual psychodynamics as ‘ . . . isolated processes instead of interacting, transpersonal ones,’ that result in an ‘ . . . underestimation of the group context . . .’ which in turn hinders conceptualizing and intervening with individual and group dynamics simultaneously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0533316412448287">1975a</xref>: 182).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0533316412448287">de Maré (1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0533316412448287">1991</xref>) finds these conceptual and technical difficulties compounded in larger groups, where in addition to the family transferences in small groups, socio-cultural influences manifest themselves. de Maré pithily summarizes: ‘To apply a psychoanalytic or small-group model . . . to the large group is like trying to play <italic>Ludo</italic> on a chessboard’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0533316412448287">1985</xref>: 81, italics ours; viz. Parcheesi). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0533316412448287">Foulkes (1975b)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0533316412448287">de Maré (1985)</xref> agree that the larger group generates additional anxiety for members and that additional structuring from the group analyst is needed to manage anxiety. But, without a theoretical and technical model that overcomes the psychoanalytic liabilities, and that adequately bridges individual and group dynamics, the question as to how the group analyst can guide the members’ therapeutic interpersonal communication remains, perhaps especially in large groups.</p>
<p>More recently, theoretical models have been developed to facilitate conceptualizing and intervening at the group-as-a-whole and member levels simultaneously, no matter what the group size. These models are termed ‘multi-level’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0533316412448287">Bryson and Anderson, 2000</xref>) or ‘hierarchic and isomorphic system’ models (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0533316412448287">Agazarian, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0533316412448287">2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0533316412448287">Agazarian and Carter, 1993</xref>); they aim to integrate theory, practice, and research, and to facilitate more powerful, parsimonious group intervention methods.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0533316412448287">Agazarian (1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0533316412448287">2001)</xref> developed her ‘theory of living human systems’ (TLHS) based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0533316412448287">von Bertalanffy’s (1968)</xref> General System Theory concepts of hierarchy and isomorphy.</p>
<p>In TLHS, the group-as-a-whole, irrespective of size, is seen as a three-tiered hierarchy of the member level nesting in the subgroup level nesting in the group-as-a-whole, like three concentric circles. <italic>Hierarchy</italic> states that all living human systems exist in the context of the system above and are the context for the system below; <italic>isomorphy</italic> proposes that the functioning and structure of the systems above (i.e., the group-as-a-whole or the subgroup) are essentially replicated in the functioning and structure of the system(s) below. Thus, these two concepts are central to Agazarian’s delineation of how personal and interpersonal matrices are interconnected. They also bridge group-as-a-whole and individual members’ dynamics, and facilitate interventions connecting the member and group-as-a-whole simultaneously via the subgroup level.</p>
<p>Specifically, and based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0533316412448287">Agazarian’s (1997)</xref> hypothesis that the communication between group members determines their experience and the group’s success, SCT groups and their members have a ‘free-floating discussion’ to explore and understand their experience. Whenever significant conflict arises, the group uses the structured, supportive, goal-focused communication method of <italic>functional subgrouping</italic> (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0533316412448287">O’Neill, Smyth, and MacKenzie, 2011</xref>). Members who are functionally subgrouping join on here-and-now experience they have in common, holding significant differences aside for later discussion by members of that ‘different subgroup’. SCT leaders train members to communicate this way from the start, whether the group is small, median, or large.</p>
<p>Agazarian hypothesized:
<disp-quote><p>The conditions of functional subgrouping include several group dynamic variables that are directly connected to successful goal achievement . . . Thus, the probability of positive outcomes for members who join and work within functional subgrouping norms is high. A member’s subjective experience of subgrouping includes, on the one hand, the comfort of attunement and mirroring and, on the other, the intensity of involvement in a self-reinforcing activity. Work in a subgroup is a process that gradually increases the depth of the actual experience members have joined the subgroup to explore. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0533316412448287">1997</xref>: 46)</p></disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Research on groups in general has shown that a positive group climate may be essential to a positive emotional experience for the group’s members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0533316412448287">Repetti, 1987</xref>), and emotional distress has been shown to predict poor outcome in groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0533316412448287">Turner et al., 1992</xref>). In a quasi-experimental study of small to median SCT training groups using functional subgrouping compared with American Group Psychotherapy Association Institute groups led by expert leaders of different theoretical orientations, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0533316412448287">O’Neill and Constantino (2008)</xref> had mixed results regarding SCT hypotheses. SCT group members were less avoidant but less engaged initially, while less avoidant and highly engaged later, more active, and more self-confident. SCT group members also experienced less conflict and reported better relationship quality. In addition, SCT members reported comparatively less learning about self-peer relations and authority/leadership but reported high global learning, and there was a trend for SCT group members to be less anxious over the course of the workshop.</p>
<p>In another study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0533316412448287">O’Neill, Smyth, and Mackenzie (2011)</xref> found that functional subgrouping among members of small to median SCT training groups generated a positive intra-member experience, and that those members who reported more functional subgrouping during training reported significantly less anxious and depressive experience post-training. Finally, in a pilot study of individual psychotherapy, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0533316412448287">Ladden, Gantt, Rude, and Agazarian (2007)</xref> found that SCT was associated with less anxiety post-treatment in patients diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder, and that this treatment success was maintained over a year.</p>
<p>Although functional subgrouping is theoretically related to outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0533316412448287">Agazarian, 1997</xref>), there has been little direct empirical examination of the association between functional subgrouping and group or member performance. Further, as mentioned, despite the popularity of large group training experiences in group psychotherapy conferences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0533316412448287">Shields, 2001</xref>) and organizational contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0533316412448287">Bunker and Albans, 2006</xref>), to our knowledge there has been no empirical research on any <italic>large</italic> training groups.</p>
<p>Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0533316412448287">Agazarian (1997)</xref>, we predicted that functional subgrouping would be positively related to member mood, learning, and goal attainment in large SCT training groups.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section3-0533316412448287">
<title>Subjects</title>
<p>Subjects were attendees at the 2004 or 2005 Systems-Centered Training and Research Institute Annual Conferences who elected to participate in the respective conference-as-a-whole Large Group Practica.</p>
<p>There was a mean of 76 conference attendees across the four practica sessions from Monday to Friday of the 2004 large group and a mean of 91 attendees across the four sessions from Monday to Friday of the 2005 large group. Because of missing data, there were only 35 and 61 completed packets available for analysis from 2004 and 2005 groups, respectively. The individuals whose data were analysed did not differ significantly from those whose data were not analysed in terms of age (<italic>p</italic>=.29), gender (<italic>p</italic>=.12), education level (<italic>p</italic>=.80), or SCT training level (<italic>p</italic>=.11).</p>
<p>Of the 96 subjects in the current sample, 49 (51%) were men and 44 (46%) were women, while three (3%) were unidentified. The mean age of the men was 49.45 years (<italic>SD</italic> =8.08 years), while the mean age of the women was 50.70 years (<italic>SD</italic> =9.27 years). Regarding education level, one subject (1%) had a high school degree only, two (2%) had a four-year bachelor’s degree, 47 (49%) had a master’s degree, 27 (28%) had a Ph.D., 12 (13%) had a M.D., two (2%) had other unspecified degrees, and five (5%) had an unidentified education level.</p>
<p>Subjects ranged from having no prior SCT experience to those having completed the most advanced level of SCT training and being licensed SCT consultants. Specifically, 21 (22%) identified themselves as in the Systems-Centered Training and Research Institute’s (SCTRI) Foundation Training Level (coded as 1 in the analyses below), 15 (16%) as Intermediate Level (coded as 2 in the analyses below), 32 (33%) as Authority Issue Group Level (coded as 3 in the analyses below), 20 (21%) as Advanced Level (coded as 4 in the analyses below), and eight (8%) as SCTRI Licensed Members authorized to provide SCT training independently (coded as 5 in the analyses below).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0533316412448287">
<title>Large Group Practica and Functional Subgrouping Method</title>
<p>The Large Group Practica had the goal of exploring the Conference attendees’ experience using the SCT method of functional subgrouping. These 90-minute events opened the conference on Sunday evening, and occurred at the end of the day on Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday, and closed the Conference on Friday evening; our research began on the Monday session. Agazarian led these large group experiences, with minor co-leader roles played by three other highly-trained SCT leaders.</p>
<p>The group members sat in one room in an oval, facing each other. Following the functional subgrouping method, a speaking member was directed to make eye contact with the other group members, initially with the subgroup member who spoke just prior, and with the other subgroup members he/she was ‘joining’ and building on. The joining member would finish their contribution by saying ‘Anyone else?’ to indicate completion and to invite other members having a similar experience to join and build. Group members with a different experience, that is, in a different subgroup, were instructed to hold their contribution until the first subgroup finished, then launch the exploration of the new subgroup, and function in the same fashion, by joining on similarities, adding an additional bit to deepen the exploration of the new ‘subgroup voice’ if possible.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0533316412448287">
<title>Measures</title>
<p>The <italic>SCT Functional Subgrouping Questionnaire</italic> (SCT FSQ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0533316412448287">O’Neill, Agazarian, Ladden and Carter, 1997</xref>) defines functional subgrouping as ‘joining others with a similarity <italic>instead of</italic> responding with a difference’. It is a five-item self-report questionnaire that assesses the perception and experience of the functional subgrouping process in an SCT group. The items are answered on a five-point Likert scale from 1 (‘not at all’) to 5 (‘a great deal’) The five items are:</p>
<list id="list1-0533316412448287" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>How often did you feel functional subgrouping occurred in today’s group?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>How often did you feel others were on the same wavelength as you?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>How much did you feel others joined you?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>How often did you feel the impulse to join others?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>How often did you join a subgroup?</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>This fifth item has sub-item responses regarding motivation for subgrouping that were not a focus of this investigation. Thus, for the current study, scores could range from 5 to 25, with higher scores reflecting a greater experience of subgrouping. Although the psychometric properties of the SCT FSQ have yet to be extensively examined, the measure’s total score demonstrates reasonable internal consistency in the present sample (Chronbach’s alpha=.78). Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0533316412448287">O’Neill, Smyth, and MacKenzie (2011)</xref> report Chronbach’s alpha’s of 0.61 and 0.69, and 0.77 and 0.84, for two separate groups evaluated twice in SCT training workshops in which the scale was shown to have theoretically relevant predictive validity.</p>
<p>The <italic>Learning Evaluation Form</italic> (LEF; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0533316412448287">Piper, Connelly and Salvendy, 1984</xref>) is a 16-item questionnaire, rated on a six-point Likert scale that measures global learning (Factor 3), as well as two specific elements (Factor 1: learning about self-peer relations; Factor 2: learning how to become an effective leader with professional skills). Cronbach’s alpha in the current sample is .93.</p>
<p>Goal achievement was assessed with participants’ response to one item of the <italic>Goal Achievement Scale</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0533316412448287">O’Neill, 2004</xref>), i.e., ‘Thinking back to your main goal for these experiential large group meetings, what percentage of the time did you reach your goal?’</p>
<p>The <italic>Profile of Mood States-Short Form</italic> (POMS-SF; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0533316412448287">Shacham, 1983</xref>) is a widely used, 30-item self-report questionnaire that assesses mood state during the past week. The POMS-SF has psychometrically acceptable reliability and validity (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0533316412448287">Curran, Andrykowski and Studts, 1995</xref>). Although the POMS-SF has several subscales, the total score (with a possible range of -20 to 100, indicative of overall psychological distress, is the only index used in this investigation. The POMS is administered twice and the total score Cronbach’s alphas for these administrations are .86 and .83, respectively.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0533316412448287">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>At the beginning of the Monday Large Group Practicum, all participants were invited to participate voluntarily, confidentially, anonymously, and without compensation in research being conducted to evaluate the relationship of SCT methods to training outcomes. If they agreed to participate, subjects read and signed the Institutional Review Board-approved informed consent form, and were asked to complete the POMS-SF without discussion with any other group members. Subjects completed the SCT FSQ at the end of the Tuesday Large Group. They completed the GAS and LEF at the end of their last day of participation in the Large Group Practicum, either Thursday or Friday. Order of presentation of the outcome questionnaires was counterbalanced.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0533316412448287" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>Based on SCT theory and the previous SCT research, we hypothesized that higher levels of self-reported functional subgrouping (as indexed using the SCT FSQ) would be significantly and positively related to member learning (LEF), goal achievement (GAS) and member distress (POMS-SF).</p>
<p>Descriptive statistics and correlations among the primary variables of interest appear in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0533316412448287">Table 1</xref>. As expected based on previous research, the subscales of the LEF are significantly correlated and the learning subscale scores are significantly, positively related to goal achievement ratings. Pre- and post-training distress scores on the POMS-SF are strongly, though not perfectly correlated, suggesting it would be sensitive to changes in mood throughout the SCT training.</p>

<p>Before addressing the primary hypotheses, we conducted <italic>t</italic>-tests to determine whether the two training groups differed on any of the predictors or outcomes of interest in the current study. The training group from 2005 scored significantly higher on the three LEF factors; however, there were no other significant differences between the two training groups (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0533316412448287">Table 2</xref>). Because of these group differences, training group (2004 and 2005) and its interaction with the primary predictor of functional subgrouping were included in the regression models discussed below.</p>

<p>To address the primary hypotheses of the current study we conducted a series of hierarchical linear regression analyses on the following outcome variables: learning about self-peer relations (LEF Factor 1), learning how to become an effective leader with professional skills (LEF Factor 2), global learning (LEF Factor 3), goal attainment (GAS), and mood state following training (POMS-SF total distress score). For each analysis, pre-training mood state, prior SCT training experience level and training group (2004 or 2005) were entered as covariates in Step 1, to control for pre-training mood, differences due to SCT training experience and the differences in group scores noted above. For each analysis, functional subgrouping (SCT FSQ total score) and the training group X functional subgrouping interaction were entered as predictors in Step 2. Effect sizes for each model were reported using adjusted <italic>R</italic><sup><italic>2</italic></sup>.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0533316412448287">Table 3</xref> presents the results from the three analyses predicting the learning domains from training group, functional subgrouping and their interaction. In predicting learning about self-peer relations (LEF1), the overall regression model is significant (<italic>F</italic>[5, 90]=6.4, <italic>p</italic>&lt;.001) and explains 22% of the variance (medium effect size). Regarding specific effects, training group is significant as expected, given the group differences on all three of the LEF subscales described earlier. Previous experience level is also significantly related to learning about self-peer relations, with higher experience predicting greater learning. Importantly, functional subgrouping scores are not significantly related to this learning subscale.</p>

<p>In predicting goal attainment, the overall regression model was significant (<italic>F</italic>[5, 90]=3.57, <italic>p</italic>&lt;.01) and explained 12% of the variance (small effect size). For this model, pre-training distress was significantly related to goal attainment; lower pre-training distress predicted higher goal attainment scores. In addition, higher levels of functional subgrouping were significantly related to higher goal attainment ratings (<italic>p</italic>&lt;.01).</p>
<p>It is important to note that for all of the models discussed above, the interactions between functional subgrouping and training group were not significant (all <italic>p</italic>’s&gt;.22), indicating that differences in training group scores did not impact the relationship between functional subgrouping and the outcomes analysed. Consistent with the hypotheses in the current study, higher levels of functional subgrouping were significantly related to greater learning how to become a better leader, and significantly related to higher goal attainment ratings and less psychological distress. Additionally, higher levels of subgrouping were related to marginally more reported global learning.</p>
<p>The effect of functional subgrouping on these outcomes is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0533316412448287">Figure 1</xref>. The graphs here display the estimated mean on the outcome scores for individuals scoring 1 standard deviation below the average on the functional subgrouping measure compared to those scoring 1 standard deviation above the average.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0533316412448287">Agazarian’s (1997)</xref> theory of living human systems delineates the inter-relationship between individual and group dynamics using the concepts of hierarchy and isomorphy, no matter what the group size. Her SCT intervention model proposes the theoretically-derived, unique method of functional subgrouping for establishing supportive, exploratory interpersonal communication about all human experiences in the group.</p>
<p>She hypothesizes that functional subgrouping would be a comforting, energizing group experience facilitating goal achievement, whether the goals are professional training, clinical, or organizational. We find, as predicted, more functional subgrouping is related to more learning, more self-reported goal achievement, and less emotional distress in these large training groups. Importantly, member mood before training does not affect learning and participating in functional subgrouping. In addition, more functional subgrouping, regardless of mood before training, is related to better mood at outcome.</p>
<p>Our results taken together with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0533316412448287">O’Neill and Constantino’s (2008)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0533316412448287">O’Neill et al.’s (2011)</xref> with small to median SCT training groups suggest functional subgrouping is a positively experienced method that provides some advantage in establishing a positive interpersonal communication climate and in achieving learning and emotional goals, no matter what the group size.</p>
<p>As mentioned, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0533316412448287">Foulkes (1975b)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0533316412448287">de Maré (1985)</xref> both hypothesize that large groups evoke increased distress in their members and that additional structuring will reduce this. Our results confirm significant distress impairing learning in these large groups and suggest that all leaders would do well to attend more to this distress to enhance learning. In SCT training groups this might mean leaders legitimizing the experience of distress, and encouraging distressed members to identify themselves and actively join the ‘distressed’ subgroup with eye contact. Then, even if they do not subsequently choose to work in the group by speaking, at least they would have the comfort of knowing they are not alone, that they have a subgroup of members with a similar experience of distress in which they can nest themselves and work along silently towards their goals. In non-SCT groups, leaders might consider working similarly and using functional subgrouping.</p>
<p>Several limitations characterize our study. First, missing data reduces our sample size significantly, which might have impaired our ability to detect accurately significant influences on group functioning, especially any potential interaction effects. Second, statistically combining the two samples may have skewed the results unpredictably. Third, our measures are self-report and the results may reflect the members’ views of themselves more than their actual behaviour, or have been affected by other factors such as social desirability or demand characteristics (which are themselves social context effects). Finally, the measures of functional subgrouping and goal attainment, although face valid, lack extensive psychometric validation, and the GAS is a single item scale.</p>
<p>Future research might: 1) relate the amount of spontaneous functional subgrouping (i.e., joining on similarities and integrating differences) to outcome in groups of differing theoretical orientations, and 2) actively manipulate the amount of functional subgrouping and evaluate the relationship to performance at the group-as-a-whole and member levels.</p>
