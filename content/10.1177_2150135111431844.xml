<p><italic>Background</italic>: The study evaluates the long-term results of surgery for anomalous left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery (ALCAPA) with special attention on the left ventricular (LV) function and mitral regurgitation. <italic>Methods</italic>: Twenty-one children underwent surgery for ALCAPA over 23 years (1987-2010). All patients underwent establishment of a two-coronary system, by direct reimplantation (n = 13) or by intrapulmonary tunnel technique (n = 8), with concomitant mitral valve repair in one. The follow-up echocardiograms were evaluated to assess LV function and mitral regurgitation. <italic>Results</italic>: Five patients died. The age of the nonsurvivors was lower, 4.2 ± 1.3 versus 22.7 ± 29.4 months, <italic>P</italic> = .04.

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Anomalous left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery (ALCAPA) typically presents with severe congestive heart failure, a dilated left ventricle with extremely impaired systolic function, and significant mitral regurgitation. After establishment of the diagnosis, operative treatment should be performed without delay. Although different surgical modalities have been proposed in the past, the current standard is the establishment of dual coronary circulation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2150135111431844">1</xref></sup> This can be achieved with transfer and direct reimplantation of the anomalous coronary artery to the aorta. The creation of a tension-free anastomosis can be a challenging procedure when the ostium of the left coronary artery lies remote from the aorta. Various operative techniques have been developed for such cases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2150135111431844">2</xref></sup> The oldest is the intrapulmonary tunnel operation described by Takeuchi<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2150135111431844">3</xref></sup> and the more recent ones are different methods for coronary artery elongation using part of the pulmonary artery wall or pericardium.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2150135111431844">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2150135111431844">4</xref></sup> There has been a discussion whether to perform mitral valve repair at the time of ALCAPA correction. Some advise against routine repair of the mitral valve as the regurgitation tends to decline after reperfusion of the left ventricle occurs. The present study was undertaken to investigate the potential for recovery of the left ventricular (LV) and mitral valve function after establishment of dual coronary circulation without concomitant mitral valve repair in patients with ALCAPA.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-2150135111431844" sec-type="materials|methods">
<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<p>The medical files of all patients that underwent surgical correction of ALCAPA between 1987 and 2010 in our institution were studied. Preoperative data, intraoperative details, early postoperative course, and follow-up data were collected. The hospital ethics committee reviewed and approved the study protocol. Informed consent had been obtained for surgery, but the specific need for additional informed consent for use of de-identified data was waived.</p>
<p>Preoperative and follow-up data included initial clinical condition and echocardiographic characteristics of the patients. Standard echocardiographic measurements that were used during the whole duration of follow-up were studied. The left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (LVEDD) was measured in M-mode in the parasternal long axis view at the level of the papillary muscles. Because the patients were heterogeneous in age and weight, the <italic>z</italic> scores of the LVEDD were calculated using published normal values.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2150135111431844">5</xref></sup> The systolic function of the left ventricle was measured in four-chamber view with the Simpson method. Mitral regurgitation was classified as none, mild, moderate, or severe. For the purpose of statistical analysis, mitral regurgitation which was moderate or severe was labeled as significant. Details from the operative records and the ischemic (aortic cross clamp) times for each patient were collected.</p>
<p>In order to evaluate potential risk factors for early death, the preoperative and intraoperative characteristics of the patients who died and those of the survivors were compared. All survivors were included in the follow-up study. Changes of the LV and mitral valve performance at hospital discharge, on the third postoperative month, on the first postoperative year, and at most recent follow-up were obtained. Additionally, early morbidity, mortality, and late results were compared between groups based on the two operative techniques used—direct coronary transfer or intrapulmonary tunnel.</p>
<sec id="section3-2150135111431844">
<title>Patients’ Characteristics</title>
<p>The study comprised 21 patients. Age at operation ranged between one month and nine years (median eight months) and weight between 3 and 35 kg (median 9 kg). Ten patients were female. Eighteen (86%) had congestive heart failure preoperatively. The median ejection fraction at initial presentation was 38% (range 16%-70%), the LVEDD was 41 (range 25-50) mm with corresponding <italic>z</italic> scores 7 (range 1.9-14.6). The mitral regurgitation was mild in 3 (14.3%) patients, moderate in 4 (19%) patients, and severe in 11 (52.4%) patients. Three patients (14.3%) had normal function of the mitral valve with no insufficiency. One patient had associated multiple ventricular septal defects.</p>
<p>Ten patients were younger than six months. They had higher LVEDD <italic>z</italic> score of 11 ± 3 versus 4.4 ± 1.9 (<italic>P</italic> = .00) and lower ejection fraction of 32 ± 12 versus 50 ± 15%, <italic>P</italic> = .01, than the patients older than six months. Seven (70%) of them had significant mitral regurgitation compared to 8 (72%) of the older patients, <italic>P</italic> = .63.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-2150135111431844">
<title>Surgical Treatment</title>
<p>Transfer and direct reimplantation of the ALCAPA to the aorta could be performed in 12 patients. The anomalous coronary artery was excised along with a button from the pulmonary artery wall and a tension-free anastomosis to the aorta was created. In one patient, in whom the left coronary artery ostium lay distant to the aorta and direct reimplantation seemed problematic, a modified technique as described by Wu and Xu<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2150135111431844">4</xref></sup> was used. The coronary artery was elongated with a tube constructed from part of the pulmonary artery wall and this tube was implanted in the aorta. The intrapulmonary tunnel operation was performed in another eight patients whose anatomy was considered unfavorable for direct coronary transfer. An aortopulmonary fenestration was made. Using native pulmonary artery wall, a flap inside the pulmonary artery was created and sutured in a fashion that directed the flow from the aorta through a surgically created tunnel to the left coronary artery. The main pulmonary artery was augmented with a patch. Mitral valve repair was performed in only one patient. Preoperatively, he had severe mitral regurgitation with a dilated annulus of the mitral valve. Intraoperatively the anterolateral papillary muscle appeared to be infarcted and the anterior commissure was wide open, so a decision to perform annuloplasty was made. Autologous pericardium was used for repair of the defect in the pulmonary artery wall with all techniques. Median aortic cross clamp time was 64 (range 32-126) minutes. In 12 (57%) patients, the sternum was left open and was closed after hemodynamic stabilization. The ventilation time was 6 (range 1-35) days and intensive care unit stay was 11 (range 3-35) days.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-2150135111431844">
<title>Statistics</title>
<p>All data were presented as medians with range or as means ± standard deviation. Categorical data were presented as number of patients and relative frequencies. The comparison of data between two different groups of patients was performed using the nonparametric Mann-Whitney test. Longitudinal changes of patients’ characteristics were analyzed using the paired samples <italic>t</italic> test. Categorical variables were compared with the χ<sup>2</sup> test. Statistical analysis was performed using the SPSS v16.0 software. A <italic>P</italic> ≤ .05 was considered significant.</p>

<title>Surgery and Mortality</title>
<p>Five patients died—four of them within 35 days after the operation. They all were less than six months of age at surgery. One of them (a five-month-old infant) was in extremely poor condition preoperatively, requiring mechanical ventilation and massive inotropic support. He was very unstable in the operating room before initiation of cardiopulmonary bypass support and had several episodes of ventricular tachycardia. This patient could not be weaned from cardiopulmonary bypass and died in the operating room. Three additional patients had complicated and prolonged postoperative intensive care unit stay with severe heart failure, renal failure and peritoneal dialysis, episodes of ventricular tachycardia, and inability to be weaned from mechanical ventilation. Postoperative echocardiography showed ongoing dilatation and dysfunction of the left ventricle. The proximal left coronary artery appeared patent with unobstructed antegrade flow. The mitral regurgitation regressed from severe to moderate after surgery in all the nonsurvivors (one of them being the patient who underwent mitral valve annuloplasty). These three patients died of congestive heart failure resulting in multiorgan failure between 30 and 35 days after the operation. Another patient died two months after surgery. That was a three-month-old infant with preoperative congestive heart failure and an echocardiographic diagnosis of multiple ventricular septal defects and unexplained depression of the systolic function of the left ventricle. Cardiac catheterization showed ALCAPA passing close to the aorta. Direct reimplantation to the aorta and closure of the ventricular septal defects was performed. The postoperative course was complicated with severe heart failure and persisting LV dilatation and hypocontractility. After a long period of mechanical ventilation and inotropic therapy, the patient was able to be extubated and was discharged in relatively poor condition. He died two months later in another institution with severe congestive heart failure and sepsis.

<title>Comment</title>
<p>Although it is a rare malformation, ALCAPA represents a significant challenge for the whole team dealing with patients with congenital heart disease. The disease is asymptomatic in the fetus and early after birth. The pulmonary vascular resistance and pulmonary arterial pressure physiologically decrease after the first weeks of life, which leads to myocardial hypoperfusion in the absence of significant collateral circulation between the two major coronary arteries. The result is severe dilatation and dysfunction of the left ventricle. Our study shows that the left ventricle tends to return to its normal size and function in surviving patients after establishment of dual coronary circulation. The LVEDD decreased significantly early postoperatively and the first significant changes in the systolic function were observed three months after discharge from the hospital. One year after the operation, all survivors had normal LVEDD and ejection fraction, and these findings persisted until the last follow-up. Our results are consistent with those from other studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2150135111431844">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2150135111431844">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2150135111431844"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2150135111431844"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2150135111431844"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2150135111431844">10</xref></sup> on the LV function after ALCAPA repair. This is a quite an astonishing observation bearing in mind the report of Shivalkar et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2150135111431844">11</xref></sup> In intraoperative biopsy specimens, it was found that parts of the myocardium supplied by the anomalous coronary artery had abnormal structure, not only reduced contractile elements but also extensive fibrosis indicating myocardial necrosis. The improvement of the LV echocardiographic characteristics in this setting represents amazing recovery possibilities. It was proposed that this was an example of hibernating myocardium.</p>
<p>There has been a discussion in the literature about the need for mitral valve repair during the ALCAPA corrective surgery. Significant mitral regurgitation is present almost uniformly in infants with this disease (in 10 of 13 infants in our series); it can also be the only presentation in older children. Some authors would not perform concomitant mitral valve plasty in any infant with ALCAPA,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2150135111431844">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2150135111431844">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2150135111431844">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-2150135111431844"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-2150135111431844"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-2150135111431844"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-2150135111431844"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-2150135111431844">17</xref></sup> while others recommend it for selected patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2150135111431844">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2150135111431844">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2150135111431844">8</xref></sup> There are also published series with annuloplasty in all patients with incompetent mitral valves.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-2150135111431844">18</xref></sup> In most cases, the mitral valve has normal primary structure and the insufficiency is explained by the dilatation of the annulus and dysfunction or even infarction of the hypoxemic papillary muscles. Our institution has adopted the strategy of leaving the mitral valve untouched during the initial operation unless there is evidence of frank papillary muscle infarction. The survivors showed slow but constant improvement of the mitral valve function during follow-up. Seven of them had mitral regurgitation at the last follow-up and it was mild in all. In contrast to other series,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2150135111431844">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2150135111431844">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-2150135111431844">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-2150135111431844">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-2150135111431844">17</xref></sup> we have not observed patients with severe mitral regurgitation after primary correction of ALCAPA and there was no requirement for additional surgery. In cases with persisting mitral incompetence, cardiac catheterization should be performed. In some of these patients, obstruction of the redirected flow from the aorta to the left coronary artery causing persisting myocardial ischemia may be demonstrated and further interventions must be considered.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2150135111431844">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2150135111431844">12</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Previous studies have shown that risk factors for early mortality can be early age, bad preoperative status of the left ventricle, and degree of mitral regurgitation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2150135111431844">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-2150135111431844">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-2150135111431844">16</xref></sup> We observed only early postoperative deaths, and the only significant differences in the preoperative characteristics between the survivors and the nonsurvivors were age and LVEDD <italic>z</italic> score. It is also obvious that all nonsurvivors had mitral regurgitation compared to 63% of the survivors. Moreover, when comparing the characteristics of the surviving and the nonsurviving patients younger than six months, the difference in mitral regurgitation incidence almost reached statistical significance. Two important questions arise. First, would performing mitral valve repair in the nonsurvivors have led to a different outcome? The main and most significant postoperative finding in all nonsurvivors was severe LV dilatation and systolic dysfunction. The mitral regurgitation tended to regress in all of them and was not considered to be the main hemodynamic disturbance. We did not consider additional mitral valve repair in order to improve the hemodynamic status. Given the different incidence of preoperative mitral regurgitation in the survivors and the nonsurvivors and the observational character of our study, we are unable to suggest whether or not initial repair of the mitral valve would have led to a better outcome for some of the nonsurvivors. There are two explanations for the persisting ventricular dysfunction causing the postoperative complications in such patients. First, it is possible that the preoperative ischemic myocardial injury had reached a limit beyond which a recovery of the global function of the left ventricle was not possible. Second, it is very probable that in spite of the myocardial protection measures, it was the additional insult associated with cardiopulmonary bypass and cardioplegic arrest that had a crucial negative influence on myocardial performance. One could speculate that temporary mechanical circulatory support could be beneficial in these patients and indeed its role after correction of ALCAPA is well recognized.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-2150135111431844">19</xref></sup> Based on the review of published series<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2150135111431844">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2150135111431844">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2150135111431844">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2150135111431844">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2150135111431844">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-2150135111431844"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-2150135111431844">14</xref></sup> reporting the use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation or left ventricle assist device, we estimate a mean incidence of mechanical circulatory support after ALCAPA repair of 12.6% with a hospital survival rate of 75%. A “prophylactic” use of intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation in five infants has also been reported with excellent results.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-2150135111431844">20</xref></sup> During the study period, we had no opportunity to utilize extended mechanical circulatory support but it is probable that this could have resulted in improvement of our operative results.</p>
<p>The second important question: did death lead to a “selection” of the patients with the worst status of the left ventricle and what would have happened to these ventricles if the nonsurvivors had survived—would they recover like those of the survivors? In an attempt to address this question, we analyzed the differences between the patients younger and those older than six months—this age limit was chosen because all nonsurvivors were younger than six months. Not surprisingly, the younger patients had significantly more dilated and dysfunctional left ventricles, perhaps simply because the patients that present early have less intercoronary collaterals and more severe hypoperfusion of the left ventricle. We then looked for risk factors for mortality in the group of patients younger than six months. There were no significant differences in the size and function of the left ventricle between the surviving and nonsurviving patients younger than six months. The nonsurvivors tended to be more likely to have significant mitral regurgitation. Based on analysis of our small group of patients, we infer that the principal risk factor for mortality is age less than six months at presentation, which is associated with higher degree of LV dilatation. The trend toward higher degrees of mitral regurgitation in nonsurvivors of surgery earlier than six months of age might have reached statistical significance in a larger cohort. As they were not different preoperatively we have no reason to believe that the ventricles of the nonsurvivors (if they had survived) would have recovered in the long term differently from those of the survivors.</p>
<p>The possibility for direct anastomosis of the anomalous coronary artery to the aorta depends on the exact location of its ostium in the pulmonary artery. Different options have been developed when it lies distant from the aorta—intrapulmonary tunnel or various techniques for elongation of the coronary artery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2150135111431844">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2150135111431844">4</xref></sup> Many advise against the intrapulmonary tunnel operation because of possible complications—baffle leaks resulting in a left-to-right shunt, suprapulmonary obstruction, and aortic regurgitation. The reported rate of reoperations for these complications is as high as 30% in some series.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2150135111431844">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-2150135111431844">18</xref></sup> This operation has been performed relatively often in our institution and the results in terms of early morbidity, mortality, and long-term ventricular recovery are comparable to those achieved with direct reimplantation. Based on that we still consider this an acceptable option in the difficult cases.</p>
<p>This study has some important limitations. Probably, the most important is that it lacks a control group of patients, which were prospectively randomly chosen to undergo mitral valve repair. Anomalous left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery is a quite rare disease and performing such a study seems an extremely difficult task. Our results should be interpreted cautiously because of the observational nature of the study. It is possible that the small size of the sample limits the significance of the results. It is a problem often encountered when dealing with such rare diseases. We have used standard echocardiographic measurements of the left ventricle which are not so exact in severely dilated ventricles with altered geometry. Nevertheless, the changes in the parameters are quite significant and measurement errors would lead to relatively small changes in the overall results. And finally, it is the global LV systolic function that is assessed with the Simpson ejection fraction method. It is quite likely that hypoperfusion of the left coronary artery results in regions with different degrees of ischemia in different portions of the left ventricle and hence regional dysfunction. It is also possible that the function of these regions is compensated with enhanced contractility in other regions and thus the global function is preserved. It has been shown that patients long after establishment of dual coronary circulation had impaired myocardial flow reserve<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-2150135111431844">21</xref></sup> which could result in reduced myocardial contractility potential and regional dysfunction. Studies with more sophisticated methods for estimation of the LV function including its regional and diastolic function at rest and at exercise after ALCAPA repair are warranted.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In conclusion, this study shows that establishment of dual coronary circulation without mitral valve repair leads to recovery of LV size and function and of the mitral valve function in the surviving patients. Early mortality is related to age less than six months and to the associated higher degree of preoperative LV dilatation. The technique of intrapulmonary tunnel repair remains a reasonable option for some patients.</p>
