<abstract>
<p>This article considers the underlying dynamics of the elite-oriented urban transformation that Managua, the capital city of Nicaragua, has undergone during the past decade and a half. It begins by drawing a cross-historical comparison between Managua’s metropolitan makeover and a paradigmatic case of planned urban change, that of 19th-century Parisian Haussmannization, in order to highlight the systemic and purposeful nature of the former’s transformation from a top-down perspective. It then focuses ethnographically on the grassroots consequences of specific instances of infrastructural development that have affected two poor neighbourhoods in the city, providing a bottom-up view on the way that these have constituted the poor communities as ‘pacified spaces’, to the extent that their inhabitants can be said to have internalized a form of ‘abject urbanism’ that actively contributes to sustaining the unequal spatial order of the city. When seen from this perspective, the planned urban transformation of Managua emerges as a systemic form of violence mediated by the workings of infrastructure, a process that I suggest can be termed ‘infrastructural violence’.</p>

<p>The … city is one of the major forms in which we become conscious of … the crises of our society. (Raymond <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1466138111435740">Williams, 1973</xref>: 289)</p></disp-quote>
<sec id="sec1-1466138111435740" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Cities are frequently associated with the production and reproduction of powerful forms of social control, and concomitantly the constitution of regimes of injustice. Indeed, urban contexts are widely seen to inherently have the potential to embody a pernicious ‘dialectical formulation’, one that articulates ‘the spatiality of injustice [with] the injustice of spatiality’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1466138111435740">Dikeç, 2001</xref>: 1792). Cities generate regimes of governance not only as a function of the broader social and economic relationships that condition particular configurations of power, but also the specific material forms that these can take, insofar as they can fundamentally negate the possibilities for contestation. This is especially apparent when cityscapes are considered from the perspective of their infrastructural development. Certainly, as Stephen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1466138111435740">Graham (2010)</xref> has pointed out, infrastructure is a critical element underpinning urban everyday life, to the extent that it can be seen as primarily constitutive of the nature of metropolitan social relations. At the same time, however, although the last decade or so has seen a profusion of studies exploring ‘the construction of difference and inequality between social groups through the discursive and/or material shaping of urban infrastructure’, there still remains a need to open up the ‘black box’ of infrastructure, and more specifically to explore the way that the phenomenon can be linked to the broader machinery of urban oppression, both instrumentally as well as more intrinsically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1466138111435740">McFarlane and Rutherford, 2008</xref>: 366, 364).</p>
<p>This article seeks to unpack the dynamics of the extensive infrastructural transformation that Managua, the capital city of Nicaragua, has undergone during the past decade and a half, in order to better understand the role played by infrastructure, and how this has led to particular outcomes. It begins by drawing a cross-historical comparison between Managua’s recent metropolitan makeover and 19th-century Parisian Haussmannization, to capture the highly purposeful and elite-oriented nature of Managua’s transformation, focusing in particular on their similar patterns of public–private partnership, analogous financial architectures, and comparable infrastructural development. The article then offers an ethnographically grounded analysis of the grassroots consequences of a specific type of transformation that has affected two poor neighbourhoods in the city, to explore how these have been actively constituted as ‘pacified spaces’, and show how local inhabitants have internalized a form of ‘abject urbanism’ that actively contributes to sustaining the unequal spatial order of the city. A case is then made for considering Managua’s particular pattern of urban transformation as a form of ‘infrastructural violence’, as a means to highlight how the city’s contemporary development has articulated a specific configuration of power with certain forms of urban change in a way that subjugates and affects the everyday life of the majority of the city’s population in a highly deleterious manner.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1466138111435740"><title>Paris, Managua, what’s the difference?</title>
<p>Managua has undergone numerous metamorphoses during the course of the past half century (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1466138111435740">Rodgers, 2008a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1466138111435740">Wall, 1996</xref>). The reasons underlying its multiple transformations are various, from a devastating earthquake that destroyed 75 percent of the city’s housing, 90 percent of its commercial buildings, and killed 20,000 people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1466138111435740">Black, 1981</xref>), to the utopian urban planning of the world-famous leftist Sandinista revolution that came to power in 1979 following a bitter struggle against the Somoza dictatorship that itself caused significant material damage to the city (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1466138111435740">Chavez, 1987</xref>), or the repeated attempts by right-wing post-revolutionary governments following the 1990 defeat of the Sandinistas to erase the material and symbolic traces of <italic>Sandinismo</italic> inscribed in the cityscape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1466138111435740">Freeman, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1466138111435740">O’Shea, 2008</xref>), among others. Since 1998, however, Managua has undergone a remarkable and wide-ranging makeover, which has fundamentally changed the metropolis’s morphology in an unprecedented manner. From a ramshackle, sprawled out, and generally impoverished city widely nicknamed ‘<italic>la ciudad caótica</italic>’ (‘the chaotic city’) – a metropolis with ‘no centre, no skyline and no logic’, to quote a popular guidebook (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1466138111435740">Leonardi, 2001</xref>: 57) – its transport network has been completely re-organized, new buildings erected, and in stark contrast to the past, it now has numerous expensive restaurants, bars, night clubs, hotels, casinos, designer stores and malls.</p>
<p>Global franchises such as Subway, Pizza Hut, the Hard Rock Café, TGI Friday’s or McDonald’s have all set up shop, with the latter particularly symbolic, insofar as a McDonald’s restaurant was first opened in the city in 1975, but had had its franchise annulled after the triumph of the Sandinista revolution, and the company’s return was widely seen as a sign of the ultimate triumph of capitalist modernization. Indeed, the first McDonald’s to be re-established in Managua in 1998 – four more have opened subsequently – was jointly opened in grand fanfare by Ronald McDonald (<italic>sic</italic>) and Enrique Bolaños, then vice-president, who ludicrously – and racistly – proclaimed that McDonald’s was helping Nicaragua to ‘take off its loincloth’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1466138111435740">Babb, 1999</xref>: 38). Similarly, international hotel chains such as Inter-Continental, Crowne Plaza and Hilton have all opened new establishments in Managua, and there has also been a proliferation of quirky boutique hotels such as the Hostal Real del General Pancho Cabuya y su Papalota Marilla in the exclusive Los Robles neighbourhood, ‘with its distinguished touch and unique ambiance’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1466138111435740">1</xref></sup> Four US-style malls have furthermore been built, the Plaza Inter, the Centro Comercial Metrocentro, the Galerias Santo Domingo and the Multicentro Las Americas, which all include brand-name stores, both international (such as Tommy Hilfiger, Nike or Nine West) and regional (such as Siman or Copasa), as well as multiplex cinemas and large fast-food courts.</p>
<p>The last of these malls was built in 2006 at a cost of US$25 million by a private real estate development company called Desarrollos Sooner, also one of the biggest players in the booming condominium and gated community construction market that emerged in post-revolutionary Managua from the end of the 1990s onwards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1466138111435740"><italic>Confidencial</italic>, 2006</xref>). One of their flagship developments is the Portal San Cayetano gated community, for example, ‘located in Managua’s most exclusive living area of Las Colinas’, and which offered two-storey, 230 m<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1466138111435740">2</xref></sup> houses providing ‘an enchanting union between the elegance of the façade and the comfort of the interiors in a global refined neo-colonial mood’ for an initial price of US$160,000 each.<sup>2</sup> Another is the Parque del Club condominiums, ‘the first vertical development project in Nicaragua’, which offered 40 luxury apartments in two five-level towers with 24/7 manned entrance security for an average price of US$230,000.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1466138111435740">3</xref></sup> Overall, some 60 different private residential real estate developments, big and small, have sprung up in and around Managua over the past decade. Fifteen of these were built in 2002 alone, comprising 665 housing units (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1466138111435740">BCN, 2003</xref>), which according to an Inter-American Development Bank report corresponded to just 2 percent of the demand for housing in Nicaragua in that year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1466138111435740">IADB, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>The 98 percent shortfall was clearly not being catered for commercially, however, considering that 90 percent of the economically active population of Nicaragua earns less than US$160 a month (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1466138111435740">Gobierno de Nicaragua, 2005</xref>). At the same time, despite the fact that 58 percent of urban households in Nicaragua were estimated to be overcrowded in 2002, and some 40 percent ‘constructed with scrap or other impermanent materials’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1466138111435740">IADB, 2002</xref>: 1), state-sponsored housing projects have been few and far between in the post-revolutionary period, and the vast majority of the country’s population continues to live in poverty. Having said this, although the dramatic transformation of Managua can to a certain extent be seen as the undirected consequence of the unleashing of market forces suppressed during the Sandinista period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1466138111435740">Babb, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1466138111435740">Whisnant, 1995</xref>), the city’s makeover has also been the result of more than just anarchic consumerist desires, and a very purposeful and iniquitous process of state-led planned infrastructural transformation has also contributed to the rise of what has widely become known as ‘<italic>Nueva Managua</italic>’ (New Managua).</p>
<p>This is especially obvious when considering the overhauling of Managua’s legendarily abysmal road network over the past decade and a half. As late as 1997, potholes were a chronic driving hazard, traffic was chaotic, car-jackings frequent and there was no discernable logic to the city’s byzantine road infrastructure. By 2000, the Managua municipality had carried out a large-scale programme to fill in the potholes, resurfaced and widened the major arteries of the metropolis, built a suburban bypass road in the south-west of the city and replaced traffic lights with roundabouts (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1466138111435740">Rodgers, 2004</xref>, for more details). These works were ostensibly to speed up traffic and reduce congestion, but when considered on a map, a definite pattern emerges whereby the new roads clearly predominantly connect solely locations associated with the lives of the urban elite, for example linking the (newly re-modelled) international airport to the presidential palace to the Plaza Inter mall to the Metrocentro mall to the ‘Zona Rosa’ of restaurants, bars and nightclubs to the exclusive Las Colinas and Santo Domingo neighbourhoods, and so on. As such, this particular road network clearly enables the Managua urban elite to move safely between the different points of their lives, no longer impeded by potholes, congestion, traffic lights or crime (roundabouts considerably reducing the risk of being car-jacked).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1466138111435740">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>As Colin McFarlane and Jonathan Rutherford (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1466138111435740">2008</xref>: 367) point out, it is often useful to ‘historiciz[e] seemingly ‘‘new’’ practices and us[e] historical conditions to theorize the contemporary moment’. In this respect, interesting parallels can be made between the dynamics of Managua’s makeover and an older process of urban transformation, that which affected mid-19th-century Paris – arguably <italic>the</italic> paradigmatic example of planned urban change.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1466138111435740">5</xref></sup> Although planned cities existed before Paris’s mutation – Washington, DC, or Jaipur in India, for example, or even Mohenjo-Daro in (modern) Pakistan over 4000 years ago – never had so ambitious a process of purposeful transformation of a pre-existing city been attempted before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1466138111435740">Pinkney, 1958</xref>). Certainly, the face of Paris was completely changed in the space of just 17 years, between 1853 and 1870, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1466138111435740">Brian Chapman (1953: 177)</xref> summarizes very well:<disp-quote>
<p>Imagine Paris, the city of light, without air, sewers, drains, or pure water; take away the great arteries of communication – the boulevards St. Germain, Sébastopol, St. Michel, Malesherbes and Haussmann, the great crossing places of the Etoile, the République, the Trocadero and the Opéra, together with the radial avenues of which they are the centres. … Remove nearly all the squares, and from the streets and squares and quais of Paris chop down fifty thousand trees. And after that abolish the churches of St. Agustin, the Trinité, St. François Xavier, half a dozen hospitals, many schools and barracks, the Théâtres of the Chatelet, Gaîté and Sarah Bernhardt, the bridges of Alma, Solferino, National and Auteuil, entire residential quarters, offices, public buildings and museums, and part of the Louvre. And then you are left with some idea of Paris [as] … a picturesque mediaeval city, in which dens of thieves, escaped convicts and arrogant prostitutes held court, mockingly at ease … in … tortuous and labyrinthine slums.</p></disp-quote>This unprecedented process of urban transformation is indelibly associated with one man, Baron George-Eugène Haussmann. Indeed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1466138111435740">David Jordan (1995: 7)</xref> contends that ‘no name is so attached to a city as is Haussmann’s to Paris’ – even if Napoleon III was also a major driving force – as the city was metamorphosed from a ‘dirty, crowded, and unhealthy’ settlement, ‘covered with mud and makeshift shanties, damp and fetid, filled with the signs of poverty as well as the garbage and waste left there by the inadequate and faulty sewer system’, to the ‘City of Light’ that it is still today (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1466138111435740">Rice, 1997</xref>: 9). Although there had been previous attempts to tackle Paris’s congestion, over-crowding, and deficient sanitation before Haussmann’s endeavours, these had tended to approach the issue of urban planning in a piecemeal manner. What distinguished Haussmann’s plans was his ‘ability to grasp the enormous complexity of [the] city and treat it as a whole, integrating all the parts, great and small, into a single organism’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1466138111435740">Jordan, 1995</xref>: 11). To this extent, the process known as the ‘Haussmannization’ of Paris involved a series of different, inter-linked initiatives, which ranged from building the city’s famous boulevards, promoting a distinctive architectural style, erecting numerous grand monuments, developing parks, squares, and green spaces in the city, putting in street lamps, kiosks, benches, and even public urinals, as well as completely re-hauling the city’s water supply and sewage system.</p>
<p>It is obviously beyond the scope of this article to explore Paris’s transformation in any detail,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1466138111435740">6</xref></sup> but certain aspects are extremely revealing when considered in relation to Managua’s makeover, highlighting in particular how the seemingly arbitrary mix of private and public action shaping the latter can actually be seen as a very purposeful and systemic process biased in favour of the urban elite. Certainly, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1466138111435740">Andrew Merrifield (2002: 146)</xref> remarks, the transformation of Paris was achieved through a symbiotic ‘combination of finance and rentier capital in cahoots with Baron Haussmann … who sought to orchestrate the private and the public spaces of Paris in mutually supportive ways’. While the Haussmannization of Paris is of course associated with the building of monumental public architecture, including for example the Opéra Garnier, the most costly building erected in France during the Second Empire, which took 14 years to build, cost 33 million francs, and occupied the talents of 90 artists, Haussmann also gave land to private developers, including in particular ‘a haute bourgeoisie of landlords and commercial interests who could afford to look upon the buying and selling of property as a speculative activity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1466138111435740">Jordan, 1995</xref>: 208, 232). The funding of both public and private works was organized through debt financing, and by restructuring France’s financial system through a process of consolidation that brought together ‘the little streamlets of capital into a massive circulation that could undertake projects at the requisite scale’. This rationalization and expansion of the credit system however also came ‘at the expense of often uncontrolled speculation and the growing absorption of all savings into a centralized and hierarchically organized system that left those at the bottom even more vulnerable to the arbitrary and capricious whims of those who had some money power’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1466138111435740">Harvey, 2003</xref>: 119–120).</p>
<p>There are clear parallels here with Managua, both with respect to the way that many urban initiatives either directly responded to, or were determined by, particular elite economic interests, as well as the broader financial architecture of urban development. The first of these issues became clear during the course of my investigations into the logic of the land use provisions stipulated in the Managua Master Plan (<italic>Plan Regulador de Managua</italic>). This document – which was originally drawn up in 1982 – establishes the framework for land use in the city, categorizing its territory into different types of zones (residential, commercial, industrial, parkland, mixed, etc.), as well as stipulating rules and restrictions concerning construction, population density and right of way, for example. These are determined on the basis of criteria relating to environmental risk factors, as well as notions of rational city organization, including in particular with regards to its transport network. The 1982 Master Plan constituted the organizing basis for a General Urban Development Scheme (<italic>Esquema de Desarrollo Urbano de Managua, 1987–2020</italic>), which was drawn up in 1987 with technical assistance from the Cuban Central Planning Board’s Institute of Physical Planning, although it was not implemented due to lack of funds. Little further planning occurred until 1998, when the Managua Master Plan was modified by a series of Partial Urban Organization Plans (<italic>Planes Parciales de Ordenamiento Urbano</italic>), which re-classified land in certain zones of the city.</p>
<p>In theory the idea was to update obsolete categorizations contained in the 1982 Master Plan to prepare for the elaboration of a new General Municipal Development Plan (<italic>Plan General de Desarrollo Municipal</italic>), but as Gerald Penske, director of the Managua Municipality’s Department of Urban Development, admitted frankly in an interview in July 2007, in practice the Partial Plans ‘simply legalized what had happened on the ground’ and, as such, reflected ‘the limited urban control exercised by the municipality over the city’s territory’. Penske illustrated the municipality’s incapacity to regulate Managua’s urban development by referring to the evolution of the affluent neighbourhood of Los Robles. The 1982 Master Plan had originally designated this area as exclusively residential, but in the late 1990s and early 2000s it became very much mixed in terms of land use, as large embassies, expensive art galleries, exclusive bars, clubs, casinos and fine restaurants all opened there, creating a nightlife area popularly known as the ‘Zona Rosa’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1466138111435740">7</xref></sup> Although in theory the municipality had the right to challenge and fine new developments contravening existing land use regulations, Penske contended that the municipality lacked the resources to monitor these. ‘Thirty years ago’, he told me, ‘the Vice-Ministry for Urban Planning had 40 inspectors and 40 Volkswagens that went all over the city to make sure that regulations were respected. Now I have just three inspectors, who only have motorbikes to cover a city that’s three times the size it was in the 1970s.’ As a result, the city had little choice other than accepting new developments as <italic>fait accompli</italic>, according to Penske.</p>
<p>Although this makes (depressing) sense, it was also obvious that infringements to planning rules and regulations were less tolerated when they occurred in poorer neighbourhoods. On 1 February 2006, for example, a group of 43 families that had occupied vacant land between the Roberto Huembes market and the Isaías Gómez neighbourhood was violently expelled by riot police at the behest of the Managua Municipality, on the – rather contradictory – grounds that ‘this land was not adequate for the construction of housing because it is near a source of potential contamination, being near an open sewage channel’, but also that it was ‘classified as part of Managua’s parkland’ (<italic>La Prensa</italic>, 2 February 2006). Penske contended rather disingenuously that this differential treatment was the consequence of the variable economic power of businesses in Los Robles and squatters such as those who attempted to settle on the land next to <italic>barrio</italic> Isaías Gómez. He argued that if the Municipality attempted to impose fines on businesses in Los Robles that did not respect land use regulations, these would be able to absorb them as part of their operating costs and so nothing would happen, but that illegal squatters could be dealt with effectively because they did not have the means to buy their way out of respecting the rules.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1466138111435740">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>In both Paris and Managua the financial architectures of transformation saw a partnership between the state and private capital. However, while Haussmann sought to encourage this by means of what one could plausibly call a form of Keynesianism <italic>avant la lettre</italic>, through credit and debt financing, in Nicaragua the process has arguably been more Friedmanite in nature. Certainly, successive governments in post-revolutionary Nicaragua have all blatantly facilitated private real estate development initiatives through the granting of highly advantageous tax breaks. In 1999–2000, for example, the Pellas group, Nicaragua’s most important economic conglomerate, spent US$20 million to build the highest structure to be erected in Managua since the 1972 earthquake, a 14-storey, ultra-modern, futuristic glass and metal office tower known as the Edificio Pellas, for which they obtained a US$3 million tax exemption on the grounds that it was ‘a tourist attraction’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1466138111435740">Chamorro, 2002</xref>). The US$23 million private Vivian Pellas Metropolitan Hospital inaugurated in 2004 also received a similar tax rebate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1466138111435740">Arróliga, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1466138111435740">Mayorga, 2007</xref>). Julio Francisco <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1466138111435740">Báez Cortés (2006)</xref>, Nicaragua’s foremost fiscal expert, has gone so far as to qualify such financial arrangements as forms of ‘legalized pillage’,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1466138111435740">9</xref></sup> but they are also highly reminiscent of the publicly sanctioned ‘orgy of speculation’ that characterized the Haussmannization of Paris, which was similarly decried at the time as a form of looting benefitting only a small elite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1466138111435740">Harvey, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>A more material aspect of Paris’s urban transformation that also bears thinking about comparatively in relation to Managua is Haussmann’s preoccupation with road-building, and in particular his construction of the famous Parisian boulevards which, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1466138111435740">Marshall Berman (1982: 150)</xref>, were ‘the most spectacular urban innovation of the nineteenth century, and the decisive breakthrough in the modernization of the traditional city’. Paris prior to Haussmannization was still largely a medieval city, a labyrinth of narrow, dirty and twisting cobbled streets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1466138111435740">Rice, 1997</xref>). Haussmann began a vast project of eliminating many of the medieval streets in favour of new wider, cleaner, straighter, tarmacked avenues. This was ostensibly to facilitate the ever-increasing flow of traffic in the city, but <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1466138111435740">Haussmann (2000: 174)</xref> himself wrote in his memoirs that the underlying logic for the straight boulevards was first and foremost ‘security’, and only afterwards ‘circulation’. Paris had undergone three successful revolutions since 1789, while barricades had gone up nine times in the 25 years before Haussmann’s accession to power, and his boulevards were thus designed to order and control the unruly city (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1466138111435740">Scott, 1998</xref>). Not only did they link army barracks to the heart of the city, but the fact that they were straight also provided unencumbered lines of fire – as Ernest Picard, a liberal politician during Haussmann’s reign famously remarked, ‘bullets don’t know how to take the first turn to the right’ (cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1466138111435740">Jordan, 1995</xref>: 304) – while the widening of roads made the construction of barricades more difficult, and their tarmacking meant that cobblestones could no longer be pulled out and used as building material.</p>
<p>Managua’s new highways are obviously visually comparable to Paris’s boulevards: both are wide, straight, well-lit avenues. More substantively, however, the new roads in Managua were also responses to security concerns, to a fear of ‘popular’ violence and a concomitant desire to ‘securitize’ the city. In the case of Managua, however, it was criminal rather than revolutionary violence that was feared, and the new roads were explicitly built to ensure the safety of those using them. The replacement of traffic lights by roundabouts, for example, meant that car drivers rarely had to stop and risk being carjacked, while the new surfacing allows them to cruise rapidly without fear of breaking down after hitting a pothole. Indeed, in a frankly uncanny echo of Parisian Haussmannization, the resurfacing of roads in Managua has involved replacing <italic>adoquines</italic> – the stone blocks that urban roads are made of in Nicaragua – with asphalt, explicitly in order to make it less easy for protestors to use them in barricade-construction, just as occurred in Paris.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1466138111435740">10</xref></sup> The only element of Haussmann’s strategic intent that is lacking in relation to Managua’s new roads is that they do not try to facilitate access to – in order to control – potentially violent (i.e. poor) areas of the city. Instead, they seek to bypass such areas; as mentioned previously, the distribution of Managua’s new highways displays a definite pattern, whereby they predominantly connect the living, playing, and working spaces of the wealthy, joining them together into a ‘fortified network’, which the elite can cruise at breakneck speeds in their expensive 4 x 4 cars, no longer impeded by potholes, traffic lights or crime.</p>
<p>Seen in this light – and as was also the case in Paris – road-building in Managua clearly concerns more than just security, insofar as it also relates to the remaking of the metropolis in the image of its urban elite. As I have described in more detail elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1466138111435740">Rodgers, 2004</xref>), Managua’s particular pattern of infrastructural development has arguably been the keystone of a process of socio-spatial ‘disembedding’ in the city, whereby a whole layer of the urban fabric has been purposefully ‘ripped out’ from the general patchwork quilt of the metropolis and constituted as a <italic>Nueva Managua</italic> that is exclusively for the rich, who now live in what might be termed ‘splendid segregation’. The highways are the means through which the spaces of <italic>Nueva Managua</italic> are viably interconnected, allowing the city’s urban elite to safely ‘preen, posture, and dally’ in the city’s new malls, restaurants, bars and nightclubs. This is very similar to the way the Parisian boulevards created ‘spaces for the display of bourgeois affluence, conspicuous consumption, and … the fetish of the commodity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1466138111435740">Harvey, 2003</xref>: 212).</p>
<p>No theorist has encapsulated the zeitgeist of Paris’s transformation better than Walter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1466138111435740">Benjamin (1999: 11, 145)</xref>, who contended that ‘the institutions of the bourgeoisie’s worldly and spiritual dominance were to find their apotheosis within the framework of the boulevards’. Haussmannization, he argued, constituted a form of ‘lavish self-glorification by the bourgeoisie’, that inscribed their emergent political, social and economic mores into the built environment of Paris, and so it can also be argued about Managua’s makeover. At the same time, however, ‘the segregation that set in during the Second Empire was felt by many to have a deleterious political effect because the bourgeoisie no longer had contact with, and therefore lost its sense of obligation to and moral influence over the lower classes’, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1466138111435740">David Harvey (2006: 22)</xref>. In particular, the drive to create Paris as an exclusively bourgeois prerogative ‘could not help but create its ‘‘other’’ … in the form of an increasingly homogeneous working class’ area within the city where a quite different symbiotic relationship was set up between private and public spaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1466138111435740">Harvey, 2006</xref>: 28). The still extant division of Paris into a respectable west and a less fortunate and largely neglected east was a direct consequence of Haussmann’s policies, for example. Seen in this light, an obvious question that has long been considered rather vexing about Paris’s transformation – considering that it displaced a third of the city’s population, more often than not without adequate compensation – is why did it not generate any significant social protest?</p>
<p>Although scholars such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1466138111435740">Harvey (2003)</xref> have sought to project the working-class uprising of the 1871 Paris Commune as an act of protest against urban exclusion, the reality is that Haussmannization had been winding down for several years previously, and the Commune was in many ways more of a response to classic class-based socio-economic imperatives, as well as the French defeat at the hands of the Prussians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1466138111435740">Christiansen, 1994</xref>). Partly for this reason, other scholars such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1466138111435740">Marshall Berman (1982: 151)</xref> have sought to explain the paradoxical lack of reaction by (somewhat disingenuously) suggesting that ‘the ravages to which the old central neighborhoods in the pre-Haussmann decades were subjected: demographic bombardment, … [reduced] housing stock; recurrent mass unemployment[;] … starvation; [and] dreadful epidemics of typhus and cholera’ explain ‘why the Parisian poor, who fought so bravely on so many fronts in the nineteenth century, put up no resistance to the destruction of their neighborhoods: they may well have been willing to go … anywhere out of their world’.</p>
<p>There exist surprisingly few studies focusing specifically on the lived experiences of Haussmannization by the Parisian poor,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1466138111435740">11</xref></sup> so it is difficult to tell to what extent this is true, but a different answer can be found in the work of Emile Zola, and more specifically his two novels <italic>La Curée</italic> (1871) and <italic>L’Assommoir</italic> (1877). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1466138111435740">Larry Duffy (2005: 105)</xref> describes, these are ‘<italic>the</italic> novel[s] of Haussmannization[,] … contain[ing] much information about urban life, and about an individualistic yet regimented society whose structures are very much informed by … spatial relations’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1466138111435740">12</xref></sup> In particular, Zola shows how the notion of space and its appropriation for the constitution of the individual self changed critically as a result of Haussmannization, and more specifically how those who were dispossessed internalized new ways of being that were more egocentric and fragmentary, preventing any form of collective protest action. There are clear parallels here with Managua, which arguably go a long way towards explaining the similar lack of grassroots protest in response to this city’s spatial transformation. The next section illustrates these through a view ‘from below’ of the alteration of Managua’s cityscape and its consequences for poor communities. It focuses on two specific instances of road-building in the poor Managua neighbourhoods of <italic>barrio</italic> Carlos Fonseca and <italic>barrio</italic> Luis Fanor Hernández.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1466138111435740">13</xref></sup> The former was recently transformed by the construction of a new boulevard right through it, while the latter has been ‘encircled’ by new roads. I draw principally on ethnographic research carried out in both neighbourhoods in October and November 2009, although I have been carrying out longitudinal fieldwork on other themes in <italic>barrio</italic> Luis Fanor Hernández since 1996, and I have also been investigating the politics of urban planning in Managua more broadly since 2003.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-1466138111435740">14</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="sec3-1466138111435740"><title>‘You can’t stop progress . . .’</title>
<p><italic>Barrio</italic> Carlos Fonseca is a small settlement of approximately 1500 inhabitants and about 180 households located in south-east Managua. It was originally founded as an informal squatter settlement in the early 1980s, mainly by demographic overflow from surrounding neighbourhoods. Although initially illegally settled, most households became legal deed-holders as a result of the controversial law no. 86 passed by the Sandinista government in 1990, one of many that they pushed through during a two-month period after losing the elections, and which legalized land tenure in many urban slums and informal settlements (as well as possession of property and economic assets by the Sandinista party leadership). While many instances of the regularization deriving from this hastily-passed law have subsequently been challenged – both in Managua as well as Nicaragua more generally – there were few challenges in <italic>barrio</italic> Carlos Fonseca, partly because the land it was founded on had been expropriated by the revolutionary regime from the overthrown dictator Somoza, and was moreover of little interest to his descendants due to its small size and the trouble that expelling the existing settlement would have generated. The neighbourhood is otherwise rather un-notable, one of an agglomeration of several poor neighbourhoods, with little to distinguish it except the fact that it is near the Roberto Huembes market, where many of those who work in the neighbourhood – around 50 percent of the economically active population – are employed.</p>
<p>In April 2008, however, the Managua Municipality began work to extend the <italic>pista</italic> Cardenal Miguel Obando y Bravo<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-1466138111435740">15</xref></sup> – sometimes also known Haussmannically as the <italic>Bulevar</italic> Miguel Obando – through the neighbourhood (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1466138111435740">Figure 1</xref>). The <italic>pista</italic> is a four-lane highway that cuts east–west across south-central Managua, and was built in three stages, for a total cost of US$5.6 million, or about 10 percent of the Managua Municipality’s budget. It was formally inaugurated by the then mayor of Managua, the Sandinista Dionisio Marenco, on 11 December 2008. Officially, it is supposed to play a major role in reducing traffic congestion in the district, despite the fact that it is flanked by two parallel east–west boulevards that more or less connect the same points in the city. At the same time, it clearly also allows drivers to avoid the northern east–west boulevard that runs through the Jorge Dimitrov and El Riguero <italic>barrios</italic>, both of which are notoriously insecure, and to miss the congestion that is caused by the Roberto Huembes bus station on the southern east–west boulevard. Furthermore, the new <italic>pista</italic> better links the affluent neighbourhood of Los Robles both to the international airport to the northeast of the city as well as to the southwest of the metropolis, where several gated communities have sprung up in recent years.

<p>The first two stages of the <italic>pista</italic> simply involved the widening and improvement of pre-existing roads, and were carried out in 2006 and 2007. The third stage involved piercing through an established settlement, <italic>barrio</italic> Carlos Fonseca (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1466138111435740">Figure 2</xref>). This latter phase of work affected 40 households in the neighbourhood: 16 houses were completely destroyed, and 24 were partially destroyed – including several that were literally halved in size. The details concerning the process that emerge from interviews with those affected are a rather classic picture of very little consultation, differential compensation – ranging from US$3000 to US$32,000<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-1466138111435740">16</xref></sup> – and also likely instances of corruption. While the Municipality declared that it paid out a total of C$8 million (US$400,000) in compensation,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-1466138111435740">17</xref></sup> by all accounts much less than this was distributed to local neighbourhood inhabitants. None of this is very surprising, however – political clientelism is a well-established practice in Nicaragua, as is corruption, and the undermining of the possibility for organized resistance to the piercing of the <italic>pista</italic> through ‘divide and rule’ tactics also makes eminent sense. The consequences of the <italic>pista</italic>’s construction for local <italic>barrio</italic> life have been devastating, however, both directly and indirectly.

<p>Many of those whose houses were affected but not completely destroyed found themselves living in cramped conditions, for example. In one case 19 people were now living in three rooms instead of the six they had previously occupied.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-1466138111435740">18</xref></sup> Only three of the 16 families whose houses were completely destroyed accepted to be re-located outside the <italic>barrio</italic>, and the Municipality re-settled the rest in a baseball field in the neighbourhood, providing them with materials to build houses that were generally not as spacious or solid as their previous ones. Furthermore, the baseball field had until then constituted a primary focal point of neighbourhood socialization, and the re-settlement effectively eliminated one of the <italic>barrio</italic>’s sole areas of public space. As a local inhabitant called Don Victor told me:<disp-quote>
<p>Where are the youth supposed to meet and play ball now? They used to get together in the park all the time, and we’d all gather to watch them, and you would be able to chat to other inhabitants of the <italic>barrio</italic>. Now you just talk to your neighbour, and even then, hardly ever, because everybody stays locked up in their homes due to the crime and insecurity, so it’s just hello and goodbye whenever you’re coming or going…</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Perhaps most dramatically of all, however, the <italic>pista</italic> had literally cut the <italic>barrio</italic> in half (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1466138111435740">Figure 3</xref>), and many of my interviewees complained how it was as if the two halves were becoming separate neighbourhoods. As one interviewee called Doña Angelina put it:<disp-quote>
<p>This has changed the <italic>barrio</italic>, as it means that you go less to the other side, you don’t see people anymore, there’s no exchange anymore, if you go to the other side, they say to you, ‘but you’re from the other side’, which never happened before, we were all from <italic>barrio</italic> Carlos Fonseca, now it’s like you have Carlos Fonseca 1 and Carlos Fonseca 2.
<fig id="fig3-1466138111435740" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>The pista Cardenal Miguel Obando y Bravo dividing barrio Carlos Fonseca into two.</p>
<p><italic>Source</italic>: Photo by the author (2009).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1466138111435740-fig3.tif"/></fig></p></disp-quote>Crossing the road was widely seen to be a major hazard, with Doña Angelina’s neighbour, Don Manolo, complaining that:<disp-quote>
<p>Everybody who lives by the side of the road has had to put a gate on their houses, to keep the children inside – you can’t let them out, there’s almost no pavement, and the traffic comes so fast … You’ve got to keep kids locked up, there haven’t been any accidents yet, but that’s only thanks to God’s will, and who knows how long that will last …</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Although such negative commentary about the new road was widespread, the attribution of blame was very ambiguous. The road was often referred to as Nicho’s road (<italic>la calle de Nicho</italic>), after the nickname of Dionisio Marenco, the mayor during whose term in office it was built,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-1466138111435740">19</xref></sup> but local politicians were mainly criticized for their corruption rather than the road-building itself, and generally there seemed to be a certain acceptance of the road, and even something of a positive attitude towards it. Doña Angelina, for example, told me, ‘you know, I don’t mind living next to the <italic>pista</italic>. It’s beautiful at night, when it’s all lit up. There are no street lights in the <italic>barrio</italic>, but here yes, and so you feel that here you have progress, you know.’ A local youth called Mungo went even further than this, responding to my discourse critiquing the road and its effect on the neighbourhood by telling me, ‘hey <italic>maje</italic>, this road, it’s progress, and you can’t stop progress, we’ve gotta keep on moving forward to improve things in the city …’. There were some, such as Doña Olga, who did actively blame somebody, however:<disp-quote>
<p>They said this was progress, that the <italic>pista</italic> was part of a process of development of the city, but what they’re doing is taking the city apart. These roads, they’re only for the rich, not for the poor. What’s Nicho doing for us? How are we supposed to find work, to be able to buy a pair of shoes for Christmas, to be able to eat? He doesn’t care about us, we can go through the rubbish to find something to eat for all he cares … All he does is spend millions to build these roads and nothing on us …</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>At the same time, however, Doña Olga paradoxically combined this diatribe with a more positive discourse. In particular, she noted how delinquency levels had completely collapsed as a result of the road, and that this had led to her son leaving the local gang, partly because the new road was not the kind of street the gang could occupy easily, but also because contrarily to the past, when the police hardly ever came into the neighbourhood, they now constantly patrolled the new <italic>pista</italic>. On the one hand, Doña Olga’s discourse reflected the fact that the new road had led to a practical process of ‘pacification’ through new forms of police patrolling. On the other hand, however, it was also indicative of a broader form of ‘pacification’ in the sense developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1466138111435740">Norbert Elias (2000)</xref> in his classic work on <italic>The Civilizing Process</italic>, where he traces how the assimilation of a particular discourse conditions the world view of individual social agents in a way that leads them to conform to a dominating order. Individuals became ‘psychologized’ into certain mindsets and value systems, based on an all-encompassing notion of ‘rationalization’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1466138111435740">Elias, 2000</xref>: 399, 402). Certainly, the discourses of Doña Angelina and Mungo, but also Doña Olga’s, suggest that they had internalized a specific worldview and experience of Managua’s infrastructural development, accepting the inevitability of transformation, and indeed of its necessity as an unstoppable form of progress.</p>
<p>There are obvious analogies here with the new forms of socio-spatial being that Zola described in his novels as developing among the urban poor in mid-19th-century Paris as a result of Haussmannization. At the same time, however, the emergence of this fatalistic worldview in <italic>barrio</italic> Carlos Fonseca was clearly also facilitated by the widespread political disillusion that characterizes contemporary Nicaragua – due to the dashed utopian dreams of the Sandinista revolution, and the subsequent discrepancy that has existed between the rhetoric and the action of Sandinista politicians (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1466138111435740">Rodgers, 2008b</xref>) – as well as the generalized lack of opportunities and the insecurity of everyday life in poor neighbourhoods such as <italic>barrio</italic> Carlos Fonseca. These broader factors were more contextual than causal, however, and the locus of blame for the materialization of the particular worldview described above can primarily be associated with the iniquitous regime of urban governance that has emerged in 21st-century Managua which, as Mungo suggested, ‘can’t [be] stop[ped]’. Road-building emerges as one of its central elements, a critical medium for oppression and domination that actively contributes to the propagation of a process of pacification. This was also obvious in relation to another instance of the phenomenon as it played out in a somewhat different manner in the poor neighbourhood <italic>barrio</italic> Luis Fanor Hernández.</p>
<p><italic>Barrio</italic> Luis Fanor Hernández is situated in the same district as <italic>barrio</italic> Carlos Fonseca, and has approximately 3000 inhabitants and some 370 households. It is older than <italic>barrio</italic> Carlos Fonseca, and was founded in the early 1960s as a squatter settlement on what was then the outskirts of the city. Although the neighbourhood is now unambiguously urban in its location, as the city grew beyond it, like many other poor neighbourhoods in Managua, it was never very well connected to the city’s road network – until recently there was effectively just one way in, and one way out, and it was necessary to pass through several other neighbourhoods in order to reach a main road with bus services. This changed radically in April 2009, however, when the Managua Municipality decided to re-haul the roads running around <italic>barrio</italic> Luis Fanor Hernández, and connect these to a major north–south bypass on the other side of a large drainage canal running near the neighbourhood by means of a bridge for motor vehicles, in lieu of a pedestrian bridge built in the 1980s. The roads surrounding the neighbourhood were also widened and improved, and traffic increased massively, with buses, in particular, now frequently passing by (although not stopping as there are no bus stops in the neighbourhood).</p>
<p>The testimonies of the inhabitants of <italic>barrio</italic> Luis Fanor Hernández very clearly indicated a sense of being ‘penned in’ and ‘cut off’ from the rest of the city as a result of these developments. People talked about being ‘surrounded’ (‘<italic>rodeado</italic>’) or ‘isolated’ (‘<italic>aislado</italic>’), something that was also starkly reflected in the declining mobility of inhabitants compared to even a few years previously. This was especially true of women, who often expressed fears about crossing the new roads (which of course had no pedestrian crossings, traffic lights, or walkways). In many ways, a parallel can be made here with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1466138111435740">James Ferguson’s (1999)</xref> notion of ‘disconnection’, which he develops in the context of his study of the experience of economic decline in the historically booming but now depressed urban areas of the Zambian Copperbelt. Exploring the discourses of a new generation of Zambians that came of age in an era when the modernist promises of the past had been turned upside down by processes of ‘de-industrialization’, ‘de-proletarianization’, and ‘counter-urbanization’, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1466138111435740">Ferguson (1999: 238)</xref> highlights how they did ‘not simply lament … a lack of connection but articulate[d] a specific experience of <italic>disconnection</italic> … Just as being hung up on is not the same thing as never having had a phone, … disconnection … is quite distinct from a simple lack of connection’. This sense of ‘disconnection’ was also exacerbated by new patterns of police patrolling in <italic>barrio</italic> Luis Fanor Hernández, which were contributing to the emergence of a distinct sense of territorial separateness. On 12 November 2009, for example, although two police patrols entered the neighbourhood during daytime – albeit very much in a superficial ‘in and out’ manner – 27 patrolled the roads around it during the same period. Perhaps not surprisingly, intra-neighbourhood crime and delinquency had risen sharply compared to previous visits – and this in a neighbourhood that was notorious for its violence and high crime levels.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-1466138111435740">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>Contrarily to <italic>barrio</italic> Carlos Fonseca, there existed a quite unambiguous sense of who was to blame for these developments. As a youth called Lencho put it, when I asked him whether he saw anything positive about the new roads:<disp-quote>
<p>They didn’t do anything for the streets in the neighbourhood – they continue to be a load of shit … The new roads are for the rich (<italic>los ricos</italic>), for those who govern (<italic>los que mandan</italic>), they don’t need to come into the <italic>barrio</italic>, they just want to pass by, to go to <italic>Metrocentro</italic>. It’s much closer now, for everybody, I suppose, but it’s only for the rich, us poor never go there … That’s how things are now, some places for the rich, some places for the poor – we don’t mix anymore like in the past, when we’d all go to the same nightclubs, or the same parts of the city …</p></disp-quote>Although squarely laying the blame for the new roads on the rich, Lencho’s discourse – just like those of Doña Angelina, Mungo, or Doña Olga in <italic>barrio</italic> Carlos Fonseca – also suggests an internalization of the normality of social hierarchy and spatial segregation, as well as the assimilation of a geographical vision whereby there exist certain areas of the city where the poor are not to go, and areas where they are supposed to stay.</p>
<p>Once again a parallel can be made with the forms of socio-spatial being that emerged among the urban poor in Haussmann’s Paris, as described by Zola. At the same time, however, it can also be argued that these discourses reflect a particular form of urbanism. The notion of ‘urbanism’ was first put forward by the Chicago sociologist <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1466138111435740">Louis Wirth (1938: 3)</xref>, and broadly corresponds to a sense of ‘the urban mode of living’. At its most basic, Wirth’s contention was that the material environments of cities fundamentally determined both the attitudes and actions of individual social agents inhabiting them. He was explicitly attempting to make a general theoretical statement, warning that ‘it is necessary to exercise caution in order to avoid identifying urbanism as a way of life with any specific locally or historically conditioned cultural influences which, while they may significantly affect the specific character of the community, are not the essential determinants of its character as a city’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1466138111435740">Wirth, 1938</xref>: 7). In particular, he wanted to understand how those ‘essential characteristics which all cities … have in common’ were ‘molding [of] the character of social life in its specifically urban form’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1466138111435740">Wirth, 1938</xref>: 6). Proposing a minimal definition of cities that circumscribed them as ‘relatively large, dense, and permanent settlement[s] of socially heterogeneous individuals’, Wirth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1466138111435740">1938</xref>: 8, 12) suggested that these characteristics led to urban life being ‘impersonal, superficial, transitory’, as ‘the close living together and working together of individuals who have no sentimental and emotional ties foster a spirit of competition, aggrandizement, and mutual exploitation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1466138111435740">Wirth, 1938</xref>: 15).</p>
<p>As Ulf <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1466138111435740">Hannerz (1980)</xref> has pointed out, a fundamental problem with Wirth’s analysis is that it lacks any consideration of power. Indeed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1466138111435740">Cindi Katz (2007: 352)</xref> even goes so far as to suggest that it constitutes a form of ‘spatial fetishism’ that promotes a partial ‘understanding … of space as producing effects; as causal of particular conditions and material social practice rather than the outcome of specific social relations and practices’. To this extent, I suggest that the particular form of urbanism emergent in the discourses of the inhabitants of <italic>barrios</italic> Carlos Fonseca and Luis Fanor Hernández can be qualified more specifically as a form of ‘abject urbanism’. I derive this qualifier from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1466138111435740">James Ferguson’s (1999: 236)</xref> concept of ‘abjection’, a social state of being that is the consequence of ‘being thrown aside, expelled, or discarded … [I]ts literal meaning also implies not just being thrown out but thrown <italic>down</italic>.’ As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1466138111435740">Ferguson (1999: 238)</xref> points out, ‘abjection implies an active relation’, and must ‘be understood as the product of specific <italic>structures and processes</italic>’. As such, the notion of ‘abject urbanism’ inherently raises critical questions concerning power, domination, and the urban environment that are generally ignored or overlooked. At the same time, however, the notion of ‘abject urbanism’ remains quite generic, and the next section proposes the concept of ‘infrastructural violence’ as a more precise analytical lens through which to understand the underlying nature of Managua’s makeover and its consequent production of abject urbanism in a manner that responds squarely to Colin McFarlane and Jonathan Rutherford’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1466138111435740">2008</xref>: 364) critique that ‘traditional accounts of urban politics have too often relegated infrastructures to an apolitical context or backdrop’.</p>

<sec id="sec4-1466138111435740"><title>Infrastructural violence</title>
<p>As Nancy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1466138111435740">Scheper-Hughes and Philippe Bourgois (2004)</xref> point out, violence exists as a ‘continuum’, which includes overlapping categories ranging from structural to symbolic to physical violence that can often interact with and reinforce each other. Seen from this perspective, Managua’s infrastructural transformation can be said to bring together several different kinds of violence, including the physical in the form of violent expulsions to the socio-psychological in the emergence of an ‘abject urbanism’. It is tempting to simply conceive of infrastructure as the instrumental medium for this violence, but the argument I want to develop here is that we need to go further and think about Managua’s makeover as a very particular instance of violence that I propose we label ‘infrastructural violence’. The notion is partly inspired by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1466138111435740">Stephen Graham’s (2006: 245–246)</xref> concept of ‘infrastructural warfare’, which he uses to describe the deliberate targeting of urban infrastructure that ‘is emerging as a central component of contemporary military strategy’, and which aims ‘to destroy, or disrupt, the multiple, networked infrastructures that together facilitate the continuous circulations and metabolisms necessary to sustain modern urban life’ (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1466138111435740">Graham, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>At the same time, however, Graham’s expression is in many ways little more than descriptive (although highly evocatively so). It ultimately sees infrastructure as a passive medium through which the violent disruption of warfare is inflicted on society. In this respect, it arguably parallels much recent writing belonging to the so-called ‘infrastructural turn’ within the social sciences, which has often tended to adopt a view – largely inspired by Bruno Latour and actor-network theory – of ‘urban infrastructures as complex assemblages that bring all manner of human, non-human, and natural agents into a multitude of continuous liaisons across geographic space’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1466138111435740">Graham, 2010</xref>: 10–11). From this perspective, infrastructure is effectively seen as an ad hoc, contingent material configuration that reflects the constant and generally contested interaction of social forces as these coalesce together temporarily before inevitably fragmenting and subsequently reassembling anew in an alternative manner. Such a vision of infrastructure obscures its power, and more specifically the way that it can constitute the basis for oppressive forms of domination in cities. Or put another way, even if the idea of ‘assemblage’ does not necessarily preclude identifying the harmful consequences of infrastructural configurations, such ‘a distributive notion of agency does interfere with the project of blaming’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1466138111435740">Bennett, 2005</xref>: 463).</p>
<p>Part of the issue relates to the fact that much writing about infrastructure fails to take into account the fact that it is inherently ‘both relational and ecological’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1466138111435740">Star, 1999</xref>: 377). Indeed, it is specifically in the articulation of these two dimensions that we can best conceive of the real significance of particular forms of infrastructural development. This was perhaps best explained by Michael <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1466138111435740">Mann (1984)</xref> in his work on the power of the state, where he famously argues that we need to think of ‘infrastructural power’ as one of the major organizing forces in society, insofar as it fundamentally reflects the institutional capacity of a central state to penetrate its territories and logistically implement decisions. Although Mann’s conceptualization of infrastructural power has been criticized as ‘blur[ring] the line between control and provision by including a wide range of policy implementation under the rubric’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1466138111435740">Soifer and vom Hau, 2008</xref>: 227), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1466138111435740">Mann (2008: 355)</xref> in fact argues that understanding the reach of the state requires understanding the <italic>articulation</italic> of two distinct types of power: ‘first, despotic power, the range of actions that the state elite is empowered to make without consultation with civil society groups; and second, infrastructural power, the capacity of the state to actually penetrate civil society and implement its actions across its territories’. This distinction between elite power and the infrastructural capacity to exercise this power is an important one, and points to the two elements that can be said to most critically underpin the dynamics of any instance of planned and purposeful urban transformation.</p>
<p>The notion of ‘infrastructural violence’ that I am proposing here attempts to provide a label for a particularly pernicious manifestation of this specific articulation. Although it has been widely noted that infrastructure can be oppressive (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1466138111435740">Holston, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1466138111435740">Sharan, 2006</xref>), and even that particular regimes of injustice often rest on the infrastructural power of the state (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1466138111435740">Herbst, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1466138111435740">Rabinow, 1995</xref>), the two are rarely related systematically, and even less considered systemically. The issue is not so much that political economy and infrastructure are inevitably interrelated – a point that has been made many times in the past, including for example in Walter Benjamin’s work on the Haussmannization of Paris – but rather the way in which a particular articulation of the two can come together to purposefully produce outcomes such as ‘pacification’ and the ‘abject urbanism’ observable in <italic>barrios</italic> Carlos Fonseca and Luis Fanor Hernández. This goes beyond seeing infrastructure simply as instrumental to instances of oppression and domination, but rather requires considering it intrinsic to the broader regime of injustice.</p>
<p>In other words, the concept of ‘infrastructural violence’ is put forward as a lens through which to capture the systematicity underlying both the politics behind contemporary Managua’s spatial transformation, the nature of the transformations themselves, as well as their consequences, particularly for everyday life in the city. It points to the existence of a systemic and purposeful articulation of a particular political configuration and a deliberate pattern of infrastructural development, to the extent that the city’s makeover consequently emerges as a deliberate re-engineering of metropolitan topography by the urban elite that aims at both segregating and managing the unwanted population living in the city’s slums and poor neighbourhoods in a repressive manner.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-1466138111435740">21</xref></sup> As such, both from the perspective of intent and consequence, this process clearly warrants being described as ‘violent’ – hence my contention that Managua can be characterized as suffering a widespread ‘infrastructural violence’ that inherently and materially embodies the exclusive political economy of contemporary Nicaragua. Labelling it as such squarely situates blame and responsibility, and is perhaps the first step towards trying to transform this profoundly unjust socio-spatial reality.</p>

<fn id="fn4-1466138111435740"><label>4</label><p>The distinctly biased nature of road-building in Managua also emerges clearly from a consideration of the city’s municipal budget. In 2007, for example, US$3.3 million out of the entire city’s US$8.6 million municipal roadwork budget – or in other words, almost 40 percent – were spent on two road-improvement projects involving just 1.7 km of works in Las Colinas, one of the richest neighbourhoods in Managua, when the rest of the city’s road network amounts to 1157 km.</p></fn>
<fn id="fn5-1466138111435740"><label>5</label><p>It is important to note that although Paris’s extensive makeover influenced the development of many Latin American cities during the latter half of the 19th century, including Buenos Aires, Caracas, Mexico City, Montevideo, Rio de Janeiro and San José, among others, Managua’s urban planning owes little to Paris, at least directly. To this extent, the comparison made here between the two cities does not attempt to trace instances of architectural or ideological transfer or emulation – as is the case of many of the contributions to the excellent volume edited by Arturo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1466138111435740">Almandoz (2002)</xref>, for example – but rather uses the Parisian experience as a conceptual framework through which to think about contemporary Managua’s urban development.</p></fn>
<fn id="fn6-1466138111435740"><label>6</label><p>For English-language overviews, see Berman (1982), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1466138111435740">Chapman and Chapman (1957)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1466138111435740">Harvey (2003)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1466138111435740">Jordan (1995)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1466138111435740">Pinkney (1958)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1466138111435740">Saalman (1971)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1466138111435740">Scott (1998)</xref>. There obviously also exists an extensive literature in French.</p></fn>
<fn id="fn7-1466138111435740"><label>7</label><p>Much of the investment for creating the ‘Zona Rosa’ originated from returning Miami-based Nicaraguan exiles, although it should be noted that such areas are by no means new to Managua. During the late 1970s and 1980s, there existed a more modest and less luxurious equivalent known as the ‘Ciudad Plástica’ elsewhere in the city.</p></fn>
<fn id="fn8-1466138111435740"><label>8</label><p>Generally, the Managua municipality did not act systematically against spontaneous squatter settlements, but seemed to respond principally to those that got in the way of particular development projects, as for example occurred in April 1999 when a number of households on the edge of the 22 de Enero settlement were evicted due to the Municipality’s plans to widen the road to Masaya (<italic>Carretera a Masaya</italic>) running next to the community (<italic>El Nuevo Diario</italic>, 11 April 1999). The Municipality further simultaneously modified the regulations regarding land use along the road to Masaya, changing the classification from agricultural land to a low density residential zone, and openly called on private developers to take advantage of this re-categorization. Numerous luxurious gated communities and large hacienda-style homes consequently rapidly proliferated in what had previously been a peacefully bucolic zone on the edge of the city. Other such areas on the periphery of the city, including Jardines de Veracruz, for example, have also developed more straightforwardly, as agricultural land has been bought from poor farmers for up to 200 times the original purchase price (personal communication, José Luis Rocha, 19 July 2011).</p></fn>
<fn id="fn9-1466138111435740"><label>9</label><p>This is perhaps even more blatantly epitomized in the fact that the country’s tax regime actually causes the country’s Gini coefficient – which measures inequality on a logarithmic scale of 0 to 1, with 0 being total equality and 1 being complete inequality – to rise from 0.51 before taxation to 0.69 afterwards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1466138111435740">Fuentes, 2006</xref>). One contributing factor to this somewhat surreal and regressive state of affairs is that – like many other developing countries – the Nicaraguan state collects over 80 percent of its tax revenue through indirect taxes such as value added tax (VAT), but also important is the fact that during the past decade it has on average only collected the equivalent of 2 percent of its GDP in direct taxes per year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1466138111435740">Gómez Sabaini, 2005</xref>). Most of the latter in fact comes from big businesses – in 2001 exactly 9511 individuals paid income tax in Nicaragua (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1466138111435740">Gómez Sabaini, 2005</xref>) – which clearly pay up in order to be able to simultaneously claim wide-ranging tax exemptions that have been estimated to amount to the equivalent of over 10 percent of the country’s GDP, i.e. US$530 million in 2006 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1466138111435740">Núñez, 2006</xref>). A notorious example of such exemptions is the Law 306 on Incentives for the Tourist Industry (<italic>Ley de Incentivos para la Industria Turística</italic>) passed in June 1999, which offers tax benefits to tourism-related businesses that invest a minimum of US$50,000, including for instance a 90 percent exemption on all income tax for up to 10 years, as well as a 100 percent exemption on property tax, VAT, and import duties for the same period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1466138111435740">Gobierno de Nicaragua, 1999</xref>). A complementary law, known as the Law on Tourist Investment Bonds (<italic>Ley de Bonos de Inversión Turista</italic>), was unanimously approved by the Nicaraguan parliament in December 2004, allowing companies involved in tourism to keep any VAT that they collect on the goods and services they provide until they have recouped 70 percent of their investment costs, not only an extraordinarily generous subsidy but also effectively a rather unique privatization of taxation (<italic>El Nuevo Diario</italic>, 8 August 2006; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1466138111435740">Olivares, 2006</xref>). It should be noted that these laws were not just passed by right-wing parliamentarians, but also by Sandinistas, who are far from the revolutionary force they used to be, and fully signed up members of the contemporary Nicaraguan oligarchy (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1466138111435740">Rodgers, 2008a</xref>). Indeed, one of the most active promoters of these two laws was Tómas Borge, the last living founding member of the Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN), who was at the time President of the Parliamentary Tourism Commission, and also owner of a hotel that stood to benefit from the law (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1466138111435740">Babb, 2004</xref>).</p></fn>
<fn id="fn10-1466138111435740"><label>10</label><p><italic>Adoquines</italic> were a particular popular material for building roadblocks in Managua during the revolutionary struggle of the 1970s, as well as the social turmoil of the early 1990s.</p></fn>
<fn id="fn11-1466138111435740"><label>11</label><p>Many of the multiple studies of Haussmannization touch on the issue, but generally do so quite superficially, as their focus is on the process of Haussmannization itself, or its generally socio-political consequences.</p></fn>
<fn id="fn12-1466138111435740"><label>12</label><p>The recourse to fiction for insights into the grassroots consequences of Haussmannization should by no means be seen as invalid, both intrinsically – see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1466138111435740">Lewis et al. (2008)</xref> – but also because naturalist fiction such as that written by Emile Zola ‘is an ideal vehicle for the representation of such phenomena, not only because of its interaction with the real world and meticulous documentation of the modern, but also because . . . the naturalist conception of the profession of writer was engagement in that world’ (Duffy, 2005: 15–16). Just as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1466138111435740">Pierre Bourdieu (1992)</xref> suggested that Gustave Flaubert’s novel <italic>L’Éducation Sentimentale</italic> (1869) could be read as a window onto a particular (middle class) social reality through its carefully constructed ‘literary field’, the elements of which are articulated together systematically in order to provide realistic social description, so Zola’s novels arguably offer graphic descriptions of the ways in which Parisian Haussmannization was internalized in the lived experience of the city’s impoverished masses through powerful descriptions of the alienation that different characters feel living in a changing Paris. See <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1466138111435740">Nash (1993)</xref> for a similar approach.</p></fn>
