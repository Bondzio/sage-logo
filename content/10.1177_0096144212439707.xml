<abstract>
<p>Focusing on the city of Atlanta from the mid-1970s to the 2000s, this article examines the response of middle- and upper-middle-class white families to the court-ordered desegregation of public schools and growing fears over metropolitan busing. While the majority of white families fled the city and its public schools as part of the growing suburbanization across the Sunbelt, a small number of liberal activists remained committed to integrated public education and formed neighborhood-based organizations to stop white flight. By historicizing this activism, we suggest that the grassroots political response to white flight in the 1970s and the circuits of schooling it produced paved the way for the “return” of white middle- and upper-middle-class families to Atlanta’s public schools by the 2000s.</p>

<p>On March 15, 2010, the lead story on the front page of the South’s major newspaper, the <italic>Atlanta Journal-Constitution</italic>, announced “More Kids Stick with Buckhead Schools.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0096144212439707">1</xref></sup> The return of white, upper-middle-class families from the historically affluent and tony neighborhoods north of the downtown to the public school system made headlines because it marked a reversal of a trend that had been underway for decades. From 1955 to 1975, white enrollment in the city’s public school system plummeted from 66 percent to 15 percent and continued to decline into the 1990s, reaching a low of 6 percent (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0096144212439707">Figure 1</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0096144212439707">2</xref></sup> During these years, parents on the north side of the city who did not flee to suburbs beyond the city limits increasingly relied on an emerging “circuit of schooling” that was developing around the city’s most exclusive private schools. However, in the past decade, growing numbers of white, middle-class and upper-middle-class families have begun returning to the city’s public schools.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0096144212439707">3</xref></sup> Given these changes, the front-page news about Buckhead signals a potential reversal of white flight, which had devastated the public school system in the decades following court-ordered school desegregation. In this article, we suggest that the origins of this white, middle-class return to the city’s public schools are located not just in the gentrification and the “rediscovery” of the city in the 1990s and early 2000s, but in the neighborhood-based activism of the late 1970s.</p>

<p>In historicizing the activism of white, middle-class parents in Atlanta, this article merges together recent work on the rise of the New Right in suburban history and gentrification in urban geography. A growing body of literature in suburban history has traced the origins of the modern conservative movement back to the suburbanization of the Sunbelt in the 1970s and 1980s.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0096144212439707">4</xref></sup> This article builds on three case studies of the colorblind, suburban ideology of the New Right: Kruse’s history of white flight in Atlanta following the desegregation of public space and schools; Lassiter’s research on white, middle-class families’ response to court-ordered school integration and busing in the 1960s and 1970s in Atlanta and Charlotte; and Crespino’s study of massive resistance and segregationist schools in Mississippi.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0096144212439707">5</xref></sup> We argue that this historiography has ignored a small number of white, middle-class liberals who were committed to integration. Identified by Lassiter as “a dedicated group of white families [that] remains committed to public education” and the “white liberals [who] openly justify the choice of private education through a color-blind vocabulary of class privilege,” we seek to contribute to the historiography by including the activism of those white middle- and upper-middle-class parents who have been missing from the white flight narrative.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0096144212439707">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the field of urban geography, the relationship between white, middle-class parents and school choice has been a topic of scholarly debate in recent decades. Out of this literature, we draw on the “circuits of schooling” concept, which was first developed by Ball et al. and expanded upon by British geographers Butler and Robson in their case studies of London’s gentrifying neighborhoods.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0096144212439707">7</xref></sup> Ball et al. articulated “circuits of schooling” to indicate the school selection process made by parents in these neighborhoods may include all public schools, all private schools, or a combination of both. Butler and Robson’s mapping of London’s gentrifying neighborhoods finds that school choice reflects middle-class parents’ efforts to reproduce their class identity; they argue that the resulting circuits of schooling, which include abandoning public schools in favor of exclusive prep schools or utilizing local primary schools or nonlocal but selective public schools during the early elementary years, correspond to the neighborhood’s stage of gentrification. They note that in the British context, housing markets do not map on to “education markets” in that some middle-class parents with low-performing local schools consider the <italic>citywide</italic> education market, sending their children to other neighborhoods with what they perceive to be a high-quality circuit of schooling. Other urban geographers have uncovered a similar relationship in the United States, where magnet schools, charter schools, and the school choice movement have increasingly offered white, middle-class parents an alternative to their local public school.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0096144212439707">8</xref></sup> In this article, we focus on mapping the parent activism that created a “new” circuit of schooling and pushed against the tide of public school abandonment by white, middle-class parents who instead chose to develop their public neighborhood elementary schools in the city of Atlanta, which, we suggest, provides a much needed historicism to the “circuit of schooling” concept. We argue that neighborhood-based parent activism of contemporary circuits of schooling originated not with “neoliberal” gentrification of the 1990s<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0096144212439707">9</xref></sup> but in the 1970s as a small number of white, middle-class liberals, committed to integrated, neighborhood public schools, fought white flight through their grassroots activism.</p>
<p>This article’s methodology also contributes to the growing literature on the history of postwar Atlanta, which has largely ignored the origins and motivations of the grassroots neighborhood movement and instead focused on tracing the development of the city’s community power structure or providing a top-down analysis of desegregation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0096144212439707">10</xref></sup> Drawing on interviews with parent activists, which include the North Atlanta Parents for Public Schools (NAPPS) and the Council of Intown Schools (CINS), articles from <italic>The Atlanta Journal-Constitution</italic> and neighborhood association newspapers, and census and enrollment data, we map Atlanta’s white, middle-class, and upper-middle-class circuits of schooling that emerged in the Buckhead neighborhoods on the northside and in the gentrifying, intown neighborhoods on the eastside in the 1970s and coalesced by the 1990s (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0096144212439707">Figure 2</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0096144212439707">11</xref></sup></p>

<title>Atlanta’s Moderate Coalition</title>
<p>During the late 1950s, following the Supreme Court’s landmark <italic>Brown vs. Board of Education</italic> decision in 1954, the state of Georgia, like the rest of the segregated South, experienced a period of massive resistance.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0096144212439707">12</xref></sup> Governors Herman Talmadge and Marvin Griffin developed a detailed plan that prepared to privatize the public school system in response to court-ordered desegregation, and in 1959, the state elected Governor Ernst Vandiver on a segregationist platform of “No, not one.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0096144212439707">13</xref></sup> However, in the midst of escalating fears over pending court-ordered desegregation, the state capital of Georgia, Atlanta, provided the nation with an image of a southern city “too busy to hate.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0096144212439707">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>Through their lobbying efforts, a “moderate” coalition of ministers and rabbis; white, upper-middle-class mothers; businessmen; and politicians successfully negotiated the peaceful integration of Atlanta’s schools. In late 1958, following the bombing of the Temple, the city’s oldest synagogue, 312 of Atlanta’s religious leaders issued a second “ministers’ Manifesto” supporting desegregation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0096144212439707">15</xref></sup> Meanwhile, upper-middle-class, college-educated women, many of whom lived in the recently annexed Buckhead neighborhoods on the northside or the intown neighborhoods of Ansley Park, Morningside, and Virginia-Highland, formed Help Our Public Education (HOPE). Their husbands were members of the Atlanta Chamber of Commerce and constituted a community power structure that under the leadership of Mayor Hartsfield proposed a local option plan, which allowed the city’s schools to remain open despite continued statewide support for massive resistance.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0096144212439707">16</xref></sup> Through these efforts in 1961, nine children began the token desegregation of Atlanta’s public schools. The media’s coverage of the peaceful desegregation, which was carefully orchestrated by the white business and political community, contrasted with a series of highly contested statewide hearings under the Sibley Commission in 1960 and the violent desegregation of the University of Georgia a few months earlier.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0096144212439707">17</xref></sup> However, despite these efforts on the part of the city’s white business and political leadership, white flight followed the voluntary transfer program that met the court-ordered Fifth District ruling in the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund’s class action suit <italic>Calhoun vs. Latimer</italic>.</p>
<p>To understand the complexity of Atlanta’s unique response to school desegregation, the social geography of the city’s neighborhoods must first be explored. Since the turn of the century, with the growth of the streetcar and later the automobile and the use of zoning ordinances, Atlanta’s neighborhoods were increasingly sorted out along lines of race and class. Spreading north from the downtown business district, along Peachtree Street, could be found the wealthy and upper-middle-class suburbs. After the Atlanta race riot in 1906, the city’s black population clustered its business district east of the downtown along Auburn Avenue and in neighborhoods surrounding Morehouse, Spellman, and Atlanta University on the west side of the city. Working-class whites could be found concentrated near the textile mills or in the southside’s bungalow suburbs.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0096144212439707">18</xref></sup> However, facing a severe housing shortage in the postwar period and the desegregation of busing, public parks, and municipal pools, the white, working- and middle-class neighborhoods, including the West End, Mozley Park, Adamsville, Kirkwood, Adair Park, Collier Heights, Grove Park, and Center Hill, experienced violent and overnight racial transition.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0096144212439707">19</xref></sup> It is estimated that approximately sixty thousand whites fled the city in the 1960s, leading to the transition of twenty-seven elementary schools from white to black by 1971. During the 1970s, another hundred thousand whites abandoned the more middle-class intown neighborhoods.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0096144212439707">20</xref></sup> While working-class and middle-class whites believed that their neighborhoods bore the greatest burden of court-ordered desegregation, by the 1970s the upper-middle-class and affluent whites on the northside were fleeing the city for the suburbs north of the city limits or they were taking their children out of public schools and enrolling them in the growing number of private schools in Buckhead.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0096144212439707">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>This second wave of white flight followed the controversial “second” Atlanta Compromise, which in 1973 agreed to limited busing in exchange for the hiring of African Americans in administrative positions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0096144212439707">22</xref></sup> White flight to the surrounding suburbs and newly opened private schools continued despite the compromise. According to Gary Orfield and Carole Ashkinaze, whose research was the first to criticize the “successful” desegregation of the Atlanta Public School System,</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Black and white negotiators had accepted the premise that if “white flight” was caused by busing, a system of neighborhood schools would hold white students. In fact, however, Atlanta’s decline in white enrollment was among the most rapid of all large school districts. Between 1967 and 1986 the total Atlanta enrollment dropped by 41 percent. The school district was 38 percent white in 1968 but was only 15 percent white by 1974 and was down to 7 percent white in 1986 (Orfield and Monfort 1988, 11, 16). Clearly, the compromise didn’t hold whites and reinforced continued high levels of segregation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0096144212439707">23</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The majority of Atlanta’s white families turned to a suburban circuit north of the city limits or circuits that relied on neighborhood private schools: The Westminster Schools, Lovett School, Pace Academy, Trinity Schools, Paideia School, The Galloway School, and Woodward Academy. However, as this article documents, a small number of the city’s middle-class white families, self-identified liberals, remained committed to integrated public schools. As the city’s white population abandoned Atlanta for the northern suburbs or exclusive private schools, it was the activism of these men and women and the circuits of schooling they invested in that we believe is missing from the white flight narrative.</p>

<title>Parent Activism and the (Re) Shaping of Atlanta’s “Circuits of Schooling”</title>
<p>The organizations the white, middle-class parents formed, which grew out of meetings over coffee and in living rooms, reshaped the public school system’s image, and in so doing, created two new circuits of schooling that halted and ultimately reversed white flight. In 1975 white, upper- to middle-class parents in the historically affluent Buckhead neighborhoods north of the downtown formed Northside Atlanta Parents for Public Schools, and three years later white, middle-class parents organized the Council for In-Town Neighborhoods and Schools to tie their declining public schools to the revitalization of the intown neighborhoods of Ansley Park, Morningside, and Virginia-Highland (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0096144212439707">Figure 2</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0096144212439707">24</xref></sup></p>
<p>Though both organizations were interracial, their leadership remained almost entirely white and middle-class between the 1970s and the 2000s. While the catalyst of these parent activists was halting white flight, the white, middle-class women who became the presidents of NAPPS and CINS were, according to our interviews with them, committed to integration and sought to include the African American parents in the organizations. Anne Harper, who joined NAPPS in the mid-1980s and become president in 1990, elaborates on the organization’s commitment, yet why it was unsuccessful in reaching out to African American parents, whose children were enrolled in the NAPPS elementary schools.</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>I remember we would come to meetings and the first thing that happened would be a school report from every school. It was a brag time. Let me tell you what is going on at Margaret Mitchell. Let me tell you what is going on at Sarah Smith. And each representative would give probably about three highlights of their fun run, their school carnivals, and of course academic achievement . . . the other major topic of conversation was how to involve our African American families. After all, many of us who stayed in the public schools or came into them as we did in the eighties were there because we . . . embraced integration. We wanted Atlanta’s M-to-M, or majority to minority, transfer system for integrating the schools, to work, and we were very concerned about how accessible our schools were to the African American families, because they obviously did have transportation issues for coming back to the school in the evening for meetings. We wrung our hands quite a bit over African American participation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0096144212439707">25</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Driven by the attitude that integration “was good for our kids,” CINS also withstood the “white flight mentality” and sought to include African American parents by involving them through the CW Hill-Morningside elementary school pairing or as school representatives for CW Hill, Fowler Street, John Hope, or Walden Middle School, which following the end of the pairing in 1985 drew its enrollment almost entirely from public housing located in the predominately African American Old Fourth Ward and Bedford Pines neighborhood.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0096144212439707">26</xref></sup></p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Because you had white parents involved at CW Hill, they immediately organized CW Hill and obviously tried to bring in black parents. But black parents out of that community, unless they were a very strong personality, were overwhelmed. But you tried to find those parents while the kids were in the first three grades so that you could then pull them into the organization at Morningside because you had time to find them before the fourth, fifth and sixth grades.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0096144212439707">27</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The NAPPS circuit of public schools that emerged consisted of five elementary schools: E. Rivers, Garden Hills, Morris Brandon, Sarah R. Smith, and Warren T. Jackson. From the late 1970s to the late 1990s, Buckhead parents often shifted their children from one of these public elementary schools to one of the neighborhood private schools between fourth and sixth grade, although some followed the public school circuit through middle and high school to Sutton and the magnet programs at North Atlanta or, prior to 1991, Northside and North Fulton High Schools. In contrast, the parents that founded CINS organized around the one intown elementary school that remained open, Morningside Elementary School, which as part of the Atlanta Compromise was paired with the black C.W. Hill Elementary School.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0096144212439707">28</xref></sup> This pairing combined the declining white and black enrollments of both intown elementary schools and bused the newly integrated population to C.W. Hill Elementary School for grades one through three and Morningside Elementary School for grades four through six.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0096144212439707">29</xref></sup> Like NAPPS, many CINS parents used a combination of public and private schooling, though some followed the circuit of public schools through to Inman Middle School and the magnet program at Grady High School. What is critical to understand about how these circuits emerged is the parent-led activism that shaped them. As early as 1983, the school system’s first African American superintendent, Alonzo Crim, described the impact of the parent-led, neighborhood-based organizations on the school system:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Parent organizations have worked tirelessly to halt the egress of white families from the city, and even to retrieve families from the suburbs. The Northside Atlanta Parents for Public Schools (NAPPS) has led the campaign, along with the midtown Committee of Intown Neighborhoods and Schools (CINS) . . . selling the concept that quality education is alive and well in the city schools. They have produced educational fairs in shopping malls and schools, held community suppers, school open houses, and conducted media campaigns.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0096144212439707">30</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In what follows, we detail the ways in which these organizations transformed their schools and, in the end, the neighborhoods they serve.</p>

<title>Buckhead and the Northside Atlanta Parents for Public Schools</title>
<p>During the 1960s, unlike the white working- and middle-class bungalow suburbs southeast and east of the downtown, the city’s affluent northside neighborhoods remained largely protected from the early voluntary transfer plan, but with the implementation of the 1973 Compromise and the pending metropolitan busing lawsuit (<italic>Armour vs. Nix</italic>), white, middle-class families’ fear over integration escalated.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0096144212439707">31</xref></sup> Whether they lived in Ridgedale Park, Buckhead’s affordable, “middle-class” neighborhood near Lenox Square Mall, or along Peachtree Battle, with its Philip Shutze and Neel Reid designed mansions and rolling estates, the majority of northside families came to rely on a circuit of schooling centered around the city’s most reputable <italic>private</italic> schools, whose enrollment rose to twelve thousand students.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0096144212439707">32</xref></sup> Despite the growing hysteria and continued abandonment of the public schools, a second, smaller, public school circuit emerged.</p>
<p>On February 11, 1976, a group of Buckhead women, including Margaret Miller, Clare Richardson, Betsey Stone, Betty Whittier, Marilyn Holmes, and Brenda Griffin, brought together their friends to discuss how to halt white flight from their neighborhood elementary schools. Many of the young, middle-class mothers knew one another from their membership in the League of Women Voters and their school’s parent-teacher associations (PTAs), which for the past year had been meeting to discuss parents’ growing concerns.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0096144212439707">33</xref></sup> It was out of these meetings that the Northside Atlanta Parents for Public Schools emerged. Founder and NAPPS president from 1979 to 1981, Clare Richardson, describes what brought the women together:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>We were parents who were involved in the PTA, tutoring and field trips. It was very much a shoestring, grassroots group around the neighborhood. We knew we couldn’t take on the world or address the state of public education. We just wanted to discuss how to alter the perceptions in our own community and reach other parents who were getting the wrong picture of what was going on in our neighborhood schools.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0096144212439707">34</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The early leaders of NAPPS<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0096144212439707">35</xref></sup> found one another during those tumultuous years because they “were looking for people like themselves.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0096144212439707">36</xref></sup> With the exception of NAPPS first president Margaret Miller, they had all moved to the city from outside the region when one of the local firms or major corporations relocating to Atlanta had hired their husbands.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0096144212439707">37</xref></sup></p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Betsey was from Oklahoma. Brenda was from Minnesota. We were from the UK. There were some Atlantans, definitely, but Atlanta in the seventies and eighties was in a period of huge growth. People were coming from everywhere. They met at universities. Married their husbands at university and now coming as lawyers, businesspeople, developers, or architects . . . it was a very exciting time in many ways.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0096144212439707">38</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote>
<p>They had purchased their homes in Buckhead because the northside neighborhoods offered residents convenience to shopping malls, proximity to offices on Peachtree Street, and a sense of community. Unlike most of their neighbors, the women who founded NAPPS were committed to integration.</p>
<p>At first their effort to recruit friends, coworkers, and neighbors back to the public schools was personal, grassroots, and modeled after the work they had done through their individual school’s parent-teacher associations. Through social gatherings and open houses they tried to counter the widespread and rampant misinformation about the public schools within their neighborhoods. In the first year, NAPPS was responsible for the return of 476 students from the private schools and another 754 students during the 1978-1979 school year. By 1979, these efforts had grown into the first annual, weeklong public school exhibit at Lenox Square.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0096144212439707">39</xref></sup></p>
<p>During the early 1980s as NAPPS membership grew, presidents Clare Richardson, Pat McGuone, and Carroll Lindseth focused on developing a marketing campaign that targeted families moving to Atlanta.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0096144212439707">40</xref></sup> They worked with local real estate offices and banks to supply “Education for the Eighties” brochures to new homeowners and improved the publicity surrounding the annual open houses and Lenox Week by distributing “Support Public Schools—Put Your Child in One” bumper stickers, “Public Schools—A Good Choice” yard signs, and invitations to parents of private school and preschool-aged children. They also met with business executives and emphasized the quality of the public schools and the neighborhoods on the northside. When Georgia-Pacific decided to relocate to Atlanta in 1982, Atlanta school superintendent Alonzo Crim and NAPPS past-president Clare Richardson traveled to Oregon.</p>

<p>We wanted them to rely on the public school system because we saw that unless the schools were involved in the growth, were a part of the growth [Buckhead would not have taken off the way it did] . . . when Alonzo Crim was school superintendent, he and I went to Portland, Oregon, to talk to the Georgia-Pacific Company employees because Georgia-Pacific was moving its headquarters from Portland, Oregon to Atlanta, Georgia. They had been bombarded with queries from their employees, who were moving, about the schools because they were hearing all of the stereotypes . . . and so it was going out and telling personal stories. Basically explaining that we were in the system and that our children were in the system.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-0096144212439707">41</xref></sup></p>

<p>By the mid-eighties, these efforts had attracted a second generation of Buckhead women to NAPPS. Anne Harper moved to Atlanta in 1983 after her husband, Greg Nobles, accepted a position at the Georgia Institute of Technology’s History Department. Friends at Central Presbyterian Church provided them with a NAPPS brochure, which they in turn provided to their real estate agent. While most families moving into the city invested in the northside’s exclusive private schools, at NAPPS meetings Anne Harper met other women like herself who were committed to the public schools, including Atlanta native and Northside High School graduate, Pamela Brown. Committed to public schools, they had made their housing and school decisions based on the information they received from NAPPS. Pamela Brown explains:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>I was a very young parent with my first child starting school, and we were really committed to public schools. So when we started looking at our local public school, we were immediately drawn to the NAPPS folks. That is how I got involved, and that was how we got our information. My husband and I are both public school graduates from Northside. I just remember these were the people who really were putting a line in the sand. White flight was hemorrhaging the schools, even more so in north Atlanta than they were in the CINS and the Midtown community at that point because all the private schools were neighborhood schools. Most of the private schools were located right there . . . there was this quiet hysteria among the Buckhead group.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-0096144212439707">42</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Despite the involvement of this new generation of Atlantans, the situation remained uncertain. Sutton Middle School Principal David York explains the lasting effect of white flight:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>I really feel the business community abandoned [the public schools] . . . it became fashionable, in the late 1970s and in the early 1980s, to knock the Atlanta public school system. Many of the big law firms pressured their people to send their kids to Westminster, Lovett, Pace, Trinity. Spouses heard about these private schools at parties. Nobody came right out and said, “The private schools are better because they are a lot whiter,” but the message got across.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-0096144212439707">43</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote>
<p>The turning point for the campaign came in the mid-eighties when several prominent figures within the business community and members of the Junior League of Atlanta made the decision to put their children in the public schools. “When you write an article in the Junior League newspaper about your kids going through middle and high school in the public schools and make that commitment,” the impact on the community is tremendous.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-0096144212439707">44</xref></sup> By the late eighties, it appeared that community support for the public schools was growing, when the <italic>Atlanta Business Magazine</italic> declared that Sutton Middle School, whose enrollment was 50 percent white and 50 percent black, proved change was possible.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-0096144212439707">45</xref></sup> However, in 1990 it was announced that North Fulton High School, whose enrollment had fallen to 593 students, would be merged with Northside High School, whose enrollment was holding at 970 students.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-0096144212439707">46</xref></sup> Having invested so much of their time and energy into supporting their neighborhood schools, the consolidation of the two high schools devastated parents and consumed former NAPPS president Anne Harper’s two terms on the Atlanta School Board. Elected to the Board of Education in 1993, Anne Harper’s campaign on the northside was part of a political movement that swept the city and signaled the shift in the business community’s commitment to public education.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-0096144212439707">47</xref></sup></p>
<p>By the late 1990s, the neighborhood elementary schools that early NAPPS leaders had desperately sought to keep open began to be referred to as “public private schools.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-0096144212439707">48</xref></sup> As increasing numbers of parents enrolled their children in public schools, they brought larger budgets to the parent-teacher associations, which enabled the hiring of more elective teachers, more elaborate field trips, better facilities, and in turn attracted more northside families to the public schools.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-0096144212439707">49</xref></sup> At Buckhead cocktail parties and churches, parents’ discussions of their school choice options included their public school, though for many the educational circuit that developed included enrolling their children in one of the northside private schools by fourth, fifth, or sixth grade. NAPPS parents saw Sarah Smith Elementary School double its enrollment from 413 students in 1988 to 889 students in 2008.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50-0096144212439707">50</xref></sup> The transformation of the Buckhead circuit of schooling is further demonstrated when the capacity and demographics from 2008 are compared to that from twenty-five years earlier. In 2008, 71 percent of the 889 students enrolled at Sarah Smith Elementary School were white in contrast to the 405 students in 1984, 58 percent of whom were white. At Morris Brandon, 82 percent of the 810 students were white in 2008 in comparison to the 408 students in 1984, 54 percent of whom were white, while at Warren T. Jackson Elementary school 74 percent of the 921 students were white in comparison to the 235 students in 1984, 48 percent of whom were white.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn51-0096144212439707">51</xref></sup> This trend continued and by the end of the decade, kindergarten annexes were opened at Sarah R. Smith, Morris Brandon, and Warren T. Jackson Elementary Schools in conjunction with the first inaugural neighborhood education celebration.</p>
<p>By tracing the neighborhood-based activism of NAPPS from social gatherings to a massive public relations campaign, we see that the success of their efforts to bring neighborhood families back to the public schools shaped a growing alternative circuit of schooling on the northside as early as the late 1970s. Two decades later, white, upper-middle-class families moving to the city increasingly were buying not just the exclusive and tony Buckhead address but also a “public-private” school option at the elementary school level.</p>

<title>Intown Neighborhoods and Council of Intown Neighborhoods and Schools</title>
<p>Unlike the Buckhead neighborhoods on the northside, in the 1960s the middle-class intown suburbs of Ansley Park, Morningside-Lenox Park, and Virginia-Highland experienced waves of massive white flight to the outlying suburbs. Fearing court-ordered desegregation of the schools and the proposed Interstate-485, which was to cut through the neighborhoods, residents fled the city.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn52-0096144212439707">52</xref></sup> Even as white families moved to the suburbs north of the city and homes in the “decaying” intown neighborhoods were subdivided, the declining property values made the historic bungalows affordable to young couples that were moving to Atlanta. A small number of urban pioneers, who were attracted to the neighborhoods’ proximity to the downtown and the affordable real estate, began purchasing the historic bungalows and joined those families that were determined to remain in their intown neighborhoods. These early gentrifiers introduced a new type of liberal activism to the southern city. Many of the young couples had been active in the civil rights and anti-war movements, and as new stay-at-home mothers, the college-educated women frequently joined the League of Women Voters. Nancy Hamilton, who moved to Atlanta in 1968 when her husband John was hired to teach at Georgia Tech after leaving the Peace Corps., remembers how she and her neighbors were inspired by the movements of the sixties and seventies:<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn53-0096144212439707">53</xref></sup></p>
<disp-quote>
<p>We had been through Vietnam, we’d been through civil rights, and we’d been through the assassination of Kennedy . . . there was this group of people that came into the urban area and looked around and said what do you mean you can’t fight the expressway, what do you mean you can’t lobby for rapid transit, what do you mean you can’t change the schools, why can’t I live here in the urban area and change the circumstances of the environment?<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn54-0096144212439707">54</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote>
<p>Drawing on their experiences as “a product of the sixties,”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn55-0096144212439707">55</xref></sup> residents began mobilizing around opposition to the proposed I-485: the Ansley Park Civic Association (APCA) was founded in 1964, the Morningside-Lenox Park Neighborhood Association (MLPA) in 1965, and the Virginia-Highland Civic Association (VHCA) in 1971. With over one thousand properties along proposed route condemned and three hundred homes already torn down, in 1971 Morningside residents organized a petition drive, distributed bumper stickers, and formed the Political Action Committee (PAC) that successful defeated the interstate in 1973.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn56-0096144212439707">56</xref></sup></p>
<p>With the implementation of the Atlanta Compromise, which paired the black C.W. Hill and white Morningside schools in 1974, Morningside Elementary School’s enrollment fell to 148 students by 1976.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn57-0096144212439707">57</xref></sup> The young parents who first met through the I-485 fight and the newly formed neighborhood associations turned the attention of their growing and successful neighborhood movement to winning Atlanta City Council and school board elections. Joe Martin was elected to the school board in 1978 as part of this transformation:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>A lot of people were going to private schools, or more frequently just leaving. We said we were going to stick it out and make it work, about that time the neighborhood political movement was beginning, growing out of I-485, and we said if that can happen it terms of city government then it can happen with schools. I became the candidate and was running against the incumbent whose children were in private schools.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn58-0096144212439707">58</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In the late 1970s, a complex circuit of schooling developed in which white, middle-class parents depended on private schools, public elementary schools, or a combination of both. Sallie Weddell, whose husband was president of the Ansley Park Civic Association while she served on the neighborhood’s education committee, describes these overlapping circuits:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>There was a lot of fear of the public schools. Most of the families at that time in this neighborhood used the private schools . . . Westminster, Lovett, Galloway, Woodward, Paideia, and Trinity at the elementary level. . . . Less than half of my friends used public schools, and I did some of both.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn59-0096144212439707">59</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote>
<p>However, many of the neighborhood activists were as much committed to the revitalization of their community as they were to integrated public education. These liberal-minded homeowners and parents gathered in Nancy Hamilton’s living room in 1978 to discuss how to improve their neighborhood public schools. In 1979 the group of parents who had organized themselves around the educational committees of the civic and neighborhood associations of Ansley Park, Home Park, Midtown, Morningside, and Virginia-Highland merged their coalition, the Close-in Reviving Communities Linked for Education (CIRCLE), with area superintendent Dr. Elizabeth Feely’s proposal for an organization modeled after NAPPS. They renamed themselves the Council of Intown Neighborhoods and Schools.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn60-0096144212439707">60</xref></sup></p>
<p>Despite the founding members’ energy and optimism, over the next six years CINS faced the heartbreaking closure of six neighborhood schools due to declining enrollment. Presidents Charlotte Hale and Trisha Senterfitt, like their counterparts on the northside, focused on recruiting families back to the neighborhood and the public school system by distributing the brochures to new families in “welcome packets” (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0096144212439707">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0096144212439707">Figure 4</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn61-0096144212439707">61</xref></sup> Because its early leaders had emerged out of the neighborhood movement, CINS’ grassroots campaign, unlike NAPPS, linked the revitalization of the intown neighborhoods to the community’s commitment to its public schools. Mary Anne Gaunt, whose husband was president of the Morningside-Lenox Park Civic Association while she served as Morningside Elementary School PTA president in 1985, explains that by purchasing a home in the reviving, intown neighborhoods and enrolling their children in the struggling public schools, intown parents were making an overtly political statement: “My kids went in at a time when there were middle-class families that we considered pioneers in that they clearly, deliberately chose to move intown and put their kids in [public] schools.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn62-0096144212439707">62</xref></sup></p>

<p>By the mid-1980s, a second wave of gentrifiers was moving into the intown neighborhoods. Attracted to the historic intown neighborhoods and the growing reputation of the public schools, these families purchased bungalows for $150,000, which ten years earlier had been on the market for $60,000.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn63-0096144212439707">63</xref></sup> CINS focused on expanding its membership within the community, and members began distinguishing their organization’s efforts from NAPPS. Instead of relying on social functions,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn64-0096144212439707">64</xref></sup> Presidents Nancy Hamilton and Chris Carlsten sought to recruit these families and increase support from local businesses that were opening stores and restaurants along the reviving commercial strips of North Highland Avenue and Little Five Points and the Midtown Business Association through several new CINS programs, which demonstrated that excellence in teaching and a commitment to integration could be found in the intown schools. They started a mini-grants program for teachers in 1984, organized an annual open house held in conjunction with the Grady School of Communication’s Dionysia festival in 1986, and distributed a magnet school brochure to all seventh- and eighth-grade students.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn65-0096144212439707">65</xref></sup> The “Fund for Excellence in Teaching” awarded $4,000 in 1984, $5,000 in 1985, and provided a model for a citywide “Grants to Teachers.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn66-0096144212439707">66</xref></sup> In 1984, the first annual CINS Open house, “Our Intown Schools: A Commitment to Quality,” was met with great success and two years later was combined with the Grady High School Humanities Festival “Dionysia” to strengthen the community’s ties to the school cluster of Morningside Elementary, Inman Middle, and Grady High School.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn67-0096144212439707">67</xref></sup> After realizing in 1983 that parents needed greater access to information on the magnet schools, CINS created a brochure that was paid for by the Midtown Business Association (MBA) and Southern Bell and first printed in 1985.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn68-0096144212439707">68</xref></sup> As the number of young, middle-class families moving into the intown neighborhoods and choosing to enroll their children in the public schools rose, so did the support made possible by CINS and the PTAs. “Just the ability to know what to do, how to organize, how to raise money . . . it is raising kids in all the support that middle-class families [can] give. You just cannot replace that.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn69-0096144212439707">69</xref></sup> Between 1983 and 1988, Morningside Elementary School’s fundraising campaign increased from $5,000 to $39,000.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn70-0096144212439707">70</xref></sup> The effect was monumental. The CINS cluster added 190 students in 1984 and 241 students in 1985. Morningside Elementary School’s enrollment doubled between 1985 and 1990: 320 students in 1985, 452 students in 1986, 503 students in 1987, 527 students in 1988, 560 students in 1989, and 635 students in 1990.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn71-0096144212439707">71</xref></sup> The activism of CINS parents had successfully halted white flight and reshaped the circuit of schooling to include a public, neighborhood school option for middle-class residents.</p>
<p>During the nineties, the women that Nancy Hamilton and Chris Carlsten had recruited to CINS took up the reigns of the organization. Judith Gott, who has helped organize the Candler Park Neighborhood Organization’s annual tour of homes, served as the Mary Lin Elementary School PTA president in 1987 before taking on the CINS presidency from 1992 to 1994, while Syd Janney, who was an active Morningside-Lenox Park Neighborhood Association’s historic preservation committee member, moved to the neighborhood in 1988 with her family and became active in the Morningside Elementary School PTA before becoming CINS president in 1997. These neighborhood activists and parent volunteers expanded the teacher grants program from $9,000 to $18,000 after the Coca-Cola foundation donated $10,000 and a study group concluded that the program was essential in that it helped bring together the teachers, administrators, and parents and helped the community see the “wonderful things” that were happening in the CINS schools.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn72-0096144212439707">72</xref></sup></p>
<p>On November 3, 1993, the organization’s efforts to broaden the community’s support for the intown schools played an integral role in the passage of the city’s first bond referendum in twenty-four years. Morningside Elementary School PTA and CINS members had lobbied the city’s voters through newspaper articles and press conferences with the mayor.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn73-0096144212439707">73</xref></sup> Parents argued that the $94 million was needed for repairs and renovations to the city’s school buildings. The renovations coincided with increasing enrollment in the CINS public school circuit and became part of the perceived ability of the elementary schools to compete with neighborhood private schools.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn74-0096144212439707">74</xref></sup></p>
<p>By the late nineties, the revitalization of the intown neighborhoods of Ansley Park, Morningside-Lenox Park, and Virginia-Highland and the efforts of CINS parents to create a “good” public school circuit that attracted middle-class parents back to the neighborhood and the public schools in the 1970s and 1980s had put Morningside Elementary School above capacity. For many mothers new to the neighborhood, concerns over overcrowding were discussed at the American Roadhouse breakfast group, which continues to meet monthly. Barbara Feinberg, the co-president of CINS from 1999 to 2001, having grown up in Ansley Park, describes the role of these CINS women within the community:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>One reason I got involved was because a group of women, though the composition has changed, which has been meeting for over twenty years at the American Roadhouse every Wednesday morning. It’s a quite an interesting group of women . . . I realized this is where you get all your news.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn75-0096144212439707">75</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote>
<p>A source of news was needed, especially during the pivotal year of 1999-2000, which signaled the beginning of an annual tradition, the organizations’ co-presidents met with the school superintendent to discuss the CINS schools’ growing enrollment. The largest issue discussed was the Atlanta Public School’s program “BuildSmart,” or the five-year master plan around which CINS hosted a series of community forums to provide input on facilities assessment and attendance zones.</p>
<p>The intown Morningside Elementary School began the 2008-2009 school year with an enrollment of 968 students, which far exceeded the building’s capacity and signaled that parents in the intown neighborhoods east of the downtown had transformed their circuit of schooling.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn76-0096144212439707">76</xref></sup> In 2009 a new elementary school, Springdale Park Elementary School, became the first new public school built by Atlanta Public Schools since desegregation to relieve overcrowding in increasingly white, middle-class neighborhoods. Barbara Feinberg explains that, like on the northside, white, middle-class parents were buying “good” schools,</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Because people that move into the neighborhood now pay a lot for the houses, they are investing in their homes, and they want to be in this neighborhood because of the schools. I think they feel like, I bought my house, I’m spending my money, and this is my good school and this is owed me and my family. I think that the income and these attitudes . . . the people who move to the neighborhood now are different; it’s an expensive, affluent area.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn77-0096144212439707">77</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote>
<p>In effect, the parent activism not only shaped the “education market” of the eastside neighborhoods, but it effectively connected the housing market to a local, public, high-quality circuit of schooling.</p>
<p>While the activism of parents in the more middle-class intown neighborhoods also began as part of a grassroots political response to reverse white flight, CINS leaders moved away from the NAPPS-style social functions. While both organizations confronted issues of overcrowding by the late 1990s and early 2000s, the intown neighborhoods of Ansley Park, Morningside-Lenox Park, and Virginia-Highland had clearly revitalized and had tied that revival to a public circuit of schooling that contrasted with the complex circuit of schooling of the late 1970s and early 1980s, in which white, middle-class and upper-middle-class parents in Buckhead and NAPPS had depended on private schools, public elementary schools, or a combination of both.</p>

<sec id="section5-0096144212439707">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In the 1970s, the majority of middle-class white families responded to the court-ordered desegregation of public schools and growing fears over metropolitan busing by fleeing the city of Atlanta as part of the growing suburbanization of the Sunbelt. Those white families who did not turn to the suburban circuits north of the city limits instead relied on an emerging circuit of exclusive private schools. While the growing field of suburban history has explored the role of white flight in Atlanta, the small number of liberal activists who, in their commitment to public schools, organized a neighborhood-based, grassroots political response to white flight has been missing from the white flight narrative. By historicizing the circuits of schooling that developed around the North Atlanta Parents for Public Schools and the Council of Intown Schools, we suggest that the neighborhood-based activism of the late 1970s laid the groundwork for this white, middle-class return to the city’s public schools in the 1990s and beyond. As the liberal and class-based activism of NAPPS and CINS halted white flight, parents were able to recreate their neighborhood public schools and transform the circuits of schooling in the affluent and tony Buckhead neighborhoods on the northside and the intown neighborhoods of Ansley Park, Morningside-Lenox Park, and Virginia-Highland east of the downtown. This activism is, we argue, missing from contemporary work on circuits of schooling, which in the case of the NAPPS and CINS neighborhoods, restitched the housing market to the educational market and in effect reproduced majority white, middle- and upper-middle-class enclaves in urban neighborhoods in a post-desegregation city.</p>
<p>What this detailed examination of NAPPS and CINS has demonstrated more broadly is the ways in which parents activists can affect the circuits of schooling. While this has clearly become the case with the emergence of the charter school movement, where private organizations—including parent groups—can form their own publicly funded schools, here we can see the role that well-organized and well-resourced parents can take in shaping the public school system for middle-class interests, which in turn affects the social and material character of the neighborhoods of which the schools are a part.</p>

<p>We conducted thirteen oral history interviews with organizational leaders. Of these interviewees twelve are white, middle-class women and one is a white male from the business community. Four are from Atlanta, while nine relocated to the city as part of their spouse’s professional career. All attended college, and many have graduate degrees. Only one interviewee currently holds political office. We also examined organizational documents, including monthly agendas and minutes from North Atlanta Parents for Public Schools (NAPPS), the Council of Intown Schools (CINS), and the citywide coalition that both had founded, the Atlanta Parents and Public Linked for Education, Inc (APPLE Corps), meetings between 1978 and 2008, organizational brochures prepared for new neighborhood residents, and neighborhood association and school newsletters saved by past presidents.</p>

Final Report</italic> (Washington, DC: George Washington University, Institute for Education Leadership, 1980). Black, middle-class parents formed similar organizations, including the ad hoc education committee that emerged out of Southwest Atlantans for Progress (SWAP), which sought to maintain an integrated community in the neighborhoods surrounding Southwest and Therrell High Schools; Southwest Parents for Public Education (SPPE), which was a coalition of the Southwest High School cluster’s PTA presidents; Parents for Action, which confronted the inequalities of the voluntary, minority-to-majority transfer program and overcrowding in the Therrell Cluster; and the recently formed Southwest and Northwest Atlanta Parent and Partners for Schools (SNAPPS), which attempts to tie strong schools to the growth of vibrant communities. However, less publicized “black flight” decimated the once vibrant, black middle-class neighborhoods of the city, and only recently did these neighborhoods begin to experience gentrification, though the current economic downtown has slowed this trend. “Crowding Is Issue in SW.

<p>By the early eighties, the school system had closed six northside schools, including Birney Elementary, Bolton Elementary, McClatchey Elementary, R.L.

<p>CINS membership originally drew from a coalition of the neighborhood associations’ education committees that were zoned for Morningside, or the Close-In Reviving Communities Linked for Education (CIRCLE). When Area III superintendent, Dr. Elizabeth Feely, encouraged them to form an organization modeled after NAPPS, they reached out to the schools that fed into the Grady High School cluster: Fowler Street Elementary School (now Centennial) and Home Park Elementary School. With the continued closing of intown schools due to declining enrollment and the implementation of the middle school concept, the Grady cluster added Inman Middle School in 1979, Mary Lin Elementary in 1982, John Hope Elementary and Walden Middle School in 1985, and the newly constructed Springdale Elementary in 2009.</p>
