<p>Harro von Senger was among the very first to make the Chinese stratagems (計) known to a Western readership. His book <italic>Supraplanung [moulüe] – Unbekannte Denkhorizonte aus dem Reich der Mitte</italic> explores the Chinese art of supraplanning which is relevant to our understanding of strategic thinking and planning in contemporary China. As can be seen from the subtitle <italic>Unbekannte Denkhorizonte aus dem Reich der Mitte</italic> (Unbeknownst mental horizons from the Middle Kingdom), this book deals not only with supraplanning but also with other significant mental horizons such as Sino-Marxism and ‘stratagemic thinking’.</p>
<p>Von Senger understands supraplanning to be a superior kind of planning, which often spans particularly long time frames and which – in most cases – also includes the use of stratagems. The example of King Zhaoxiang of Qin is a good illustration of supraplanning. In 268<sc>bc</sc>, King Zhaoxiang invited Fan Sui to court to devise a plan of action to defeat the state’s enemies. Fan Sui’s advice was to proceed according to stratagem no. 23 (as listed in the Ming-era treatise of the ‘36 stratagems’ [三十六計]), which counselled making friends with a faraway foe in order to defeat the enemy close by. The rulers of the kingdom of Qin followed this advice, and after 50 years they managed to defeat all the other kingdoms in China and thus succeeded in unifying the whole country into a single empire. The imperial system would last – albeit with intermittent interruptions – until the collapse of China’s last imperial dynasty, the Qing Dynasty, in 1912. While Fan Sui’s plan took some 50 years to be implemented, it ultimately led to the creation of an imperial system that would last for about 2,000 years (pp. 10ff.). However, the expression ‘<italic>moulüe</italic>’ (謀略) itself seems to be slightly newer than the example cited, as its earliest use can be traced back to the second half of the 3rd century <sc>ad</sc> (p. 12). As is often the case with Chinese expressions, there is a whole range of meanings attributed to supraplanning: the two sinograms combined in the word <italic>moulüe</italic> cover an entire field of possible meanings from plan to cleverness, art of warfare, and stratagem to dynamic supraplanning. According to von Senger, dynamic supraplanning is to be understood as follows (p. 17 f., my translation):</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>With the word ‘supraplanning’ I would like to point out three characteristics of wholesome planning known as ‘<italic>moulüe</italic>’ in the People’s Republic of China. First of all, in its highest form, ‘<italic>moulüe</italic>’ goes far beyond what is commonly known as a strategic tactical calculation. In the highest sphere one is mainly concerned with the definition of the aim and not with a detailed and fixed way of accomplishing this aim. Secondly, ‘<italic>moulüe</italic>’ does at any rate and at every level encompass strategemic components that are not necessarily disclosed apart from what is transparent and predictable…. Thirdly, supraplanning entails a dynamic procedure in order to achieve an aim that does not adhere strictly to a fixed sequence of steps planned in advance. Rather, in order to achieve the aim within the chartered main direction of supraplanning (in Chinese <italic>fangxiang</italic> 方向) it is possible due to a sudden change of the constellation to take paths very different from those initially planned.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>As far as the scope of duration is concerned, von Senger differentiates three levels of supraplanning, namely, a low level of supraplanning that corresponds more or less to tactical planning known in the West; an intermediate level of supraplanning which can be compared to strategic planning in the West; and, finally, a high level of supraplanning which comprises both the low and middle levels and which shows their real, and ultimately intended, purpose. High-level supraplanning (which is practically unknown outside of China) is, thanks to its farsightedness, dynamic character, and astuteness, a most powerful and efficient instrument for attaining a particular goal.</p>
<p>The other two special mental horizons discussed in <italic>Supraplanung</italic> are stratagemic thinking (pp. 157–88) – which is closely interrelated with <italic>moulüe</italic> – and the Chinese variant of Marxism–Leninism (so-called ‘Sino-Marxism’, pp. 57–156). Von Senger provides many new examples of the Chinese approach to stratagemic thinking. In his discussion of Sino-Marxism, he contends that – contrary to many assertions in Western publications – the ideology of Sino-Marxism still plays a crucial role in China. In particular, its theory about the principal contradiction (pp. 110ff.) affects the lives of all the people in China. In fact, every Chinese is supposed to contribute his/her utmost for China to achieve the principal task so as to resolve the principal contradiction (which since December 1978 has been identified as ‘the low level of production forces and the ever-growing material and cultural needs of the people’ (p. 103). It also bears striking similarities with dynamic supraplanning because of its long-term nature of planning. An example of long-term planning within the context of Sino-Marxism is to be seen in the twin goals of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP): to achieve a moderately prosperous level of welfare (小康) by 2021 (which is the 100th anniversary of the founding of the CCP) and to modernize the country by 2049 (which is the 100th anniversary of the establishment of the People’s Republic of China) (pp. 115–18).</p>
<p>Following the footsteps of von Senger, Christopher Detweiler takes up a similar quest but focuses on a more specific aspect of supraplanning. In his recent and very interesting doctoral thesis on the topic ‘An introduction to the modern Chinese science of military supraplanning’, Detweiler deals with the military aspect of supraplanning, which was ‘formally incorporated into the system of disciplines of Chinese military science’ by the Central Military Commission of the CCP in 2001 (p. 19). Because one of the main proponents of this discipline is Major General Li Bingyan, who has popularized military supraplanning (軍事謀略學) since the start of the 1980s, Detweiler’s approach in his thesis is to translate, annotate, and comment on a large part of Li Bingyan’s first major work in this domain (<italic>The Adaptive Supraplanning of Military Experts</italic> [兵家權謀], Beijing: Publishing House of the People’s Liberation Army, 1983). In his book, Li discusses 73 maxims drawn from ancient Chinese military treatises such as the <italic>Sun Zi bingfa</italic> (孫子兵法), ‘The Methods of Sima’, ‘Straw Hut Planning’, and ‘Wuzi’s Art of War’ (p. 395). As the majority of the maxims in Li Bingyan’s work is derived from the <italic>Sun Zi bingfa</italic>, this ancient, more than 2,000-year-old work has laid the fundament of a new branch of (military) science at the start of the 21st century.</p>
<p>Both of these works (i.e. von Senger’s book on supraplanning as well as Detweiler’s thesis on Chinese military supraplanning) derived their insights from the ancient Chinese classic <italic>Sun Zi bingfa</italic> – in most instances translated as ‘Sun Tzu’s Art of War’. This work is widely used to this day, in China as well as abroad. In China, it heavily influences the science of military supraplanning, while in the West it is sometimes included in standard military literature; for example, it is recommended reading for staff sergeants of the US Marine Corps.</p>
<p>In spite of the fame of this work, it is regrettable that accurate translations are scarce. This is certainly attributable to the age of the text and its shortness and largely to the ambivalence and multiplicity of meanings. Therefore, the volume by Harro von Senger is a welcome addition because it provides readers with a new and scientifically well-researched German translation and it includes the latest research and literature by Chinese and Japanese experts on this subject. In many instances, von Senger not only alerts the reader about different possibilities of translation but also explains why he has chosen a specific version. As a matter of fact, half of this German edition of the <italic>Sun Zi bingfa</italic> consists of a detailed annex (pp. 73–143), which itself is made up of five pages of introduction to the book, which deals, among other things, with several technical aspects regarding this translation, followed by 23 pages of often lengthy but very important endnotes, a four-page-long bibliography, and finally by a 37-page-long afterword which – after dealing with questions about the authorship of this work – explains several typical features of the <italic>Sun Zi bingfa</italic>, such as its unlimited temporal scope, its this-worldliness, and its cunningness. It is especially its cunning nature that explains why the importance of this text is in no way limited to the time of its creation. In fact, this text is also a major source for what is called supraplanning.</p>
<p>While these special mental horizons of China (i.e. supraplanning, strategemic thinking, and Sino-Marxism) are by no means restricted to the military field – within which they have regularly proved their efficacy – they are also of much value in the civilian field – in the simplest and most trivial private matters as well as in the highest domains of politics.</p>
