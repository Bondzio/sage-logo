<p>Patients in the intensive care unit are often critically ill with inadequate tissue perfusion and oxygenation. This inadequate delivery of substrates at the cellular level is a common definition of shock. Hemodynamic monitoring is the observation of cardiovascular physiology. The purpose of hemodynamic monitoring is to identify abnormal physiology and intervene before complications, including organ failure and death, occur. The most common types of invasive hemodynamic monitors are central venous catheters, pulmonary artery catheters, and arterial pulse-wave analysis. Ultrasonography is a noninvasive alternative being used in intensive care units for hemodynamic measurements and assessments.</p>

<body>
<p>Hemodynamic monitoring is the observation of physiologic parameters of the cardiovascular system. The purpose of the cardiovascular system is to transport substrates and oxygen to the cells throughout the body and to ensure adequate cellular function. Inadequate tissue perfusion and oxygenation is a common definition of shock. Eventually, without resuscitation, the shock state leads to multiple-organ dysfunction syndrome and death. The purpose of hemodynamic monitoring is to observe that adequate mean arterial pressure, tissue perfusion, and oxygen delivery remain adequate. Traditionally, hemodynamic monitoring information has been derived from invasive catheters.</p>
<p>The purpose of this article is to review how, in the current intensive care unit (ICU), hemodynamic monitoring is commonly performed. A basic understanding of how monitoring is accomplished, how the data are interpreted, and how that interpretation leads to changes in clinical care should be of interest to the nutrition support professional because one of the basic tenets of care of the critically ill or injured is the basic priority scheme. The priorities are always airway, breathing, and circulation. Usually, by the time the nutrition support professional gets involved, airway and breathing have been addressed. The patient is commonly intubated and on the ventilator in the ICU. However, circulation is often a work in progress. The difficulty for the nutrition support professional is that his or her recommendations for nutrition will depend on how the patient is doing physiologically. Although there is a wide spectrum as to how aggressively enteral nutrition (EN) vs parenteral nutrition (PN) will be pursued, there are limits to the patient’s ability in shock states to respond to either. To understand how well or poorly resuscitated the patient is depends on the data from hemodynamic monitors and the clinician’s judgment. The key question that the nutrition support professional needs to ask is, “Is this patient in a state of shock?” As with most diagnoses, identifying the problem is the first step. The next step in resuscitation is to develop a treatment plan to improve the patient’s condition. The last step is to monitor and verify that the shock state has resolved and the patient’s condition continues to improve.</p>
<p>The problem with this model is that no hemodynamic monitoring system currently available can directly measure tissue hypoxia at the cellular level. Rather, monitored physiologic variables are an estimate of the physiology. These estimates are then used clinically to provide and direct therapeutic decisions, thereby benefiting the patient. However, monitoring in and of itself does not improve patient outcomes. The monitoring of hemodynamic data combined with the clinician’s bedside assessment of the patient can generate interventions that improve clinical outcomes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0884533612443562">1</xref></sup> The corollary is also true as failure in interpreting the data can lead to poor outcomes as well. Therefore, the clinician must be familiar with the strengths and weaknesses of each hemodynamic monitor under a variety of pathologic conditions so as to interpret the data correctly and reliably. Failure in interpretation of the hemodynamic data can lead to poor outcomes, just as correct interventions can lead to improved outcomes.</p>
<p>The principal hemodynamic monitors used in clinical practice today are central venous catheters, pulmonary artery catheters, and arterial pulse-wave analysis. A central venous catheter is an invasive catheter placed in a central vein of the neck or shoulder with its tip lying at the superior vena cava/right atrium junction. A pulmonary artery catheter is a longer central venous catheter with multiple ports and extends from the central vein through the superior vena cava, right atrium, right ventricle, and into the pulmonary artery. Arterial pulse-wave analysis refers to an arterial catheter hooked up to a computer running an algorithm to assess beat-to-beat pulse variability in arterial resistance and compliance. Ultrasound at the bedside in the ICU evaluates the hemodynamics at one time point, thereby better directing the use of more invasive monitors. This noninvasive evaluation is limited by technique and patient anatomy.</p>
<sec id="section1-0884533612443562">
<title>Central Venous Pressure</title>
<p>A common invasive line used in the ICU is a central venous catheter. There are many uses for such a line: blood draws, medication administration, PN, and monitoring of central venous pressure. The trending of pressure readings can be used to determine different physiological variables that are occurring in the circulatory system just proximal to the heart.</p>
<p>Central venous pressure (CVP) is defined as the back pressure to systemic venous return. It is measured at the level of the right atrium with the help of a central line placed in the vena cava. As the heart is continuously beating, a CVP waveform will be present, which can lead to different values of CVP depending on which point of the waveform is analyzed (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0884533612443562">Figure 1</xref>). This leads to 3 different “waves” (a, c, and v) and 2 different “descents” (x and y). The “a” wave represents atrial contraction that occurs after the p wave of the standard cardiac electrocardiogram (ECG) tracing. The “c” wave represents buckling of the tricuspid valve as it closes due to ventricular systole. The slow-rising “v” wave represents filling of the atrium during diastole. The correct CVP equals the right- ventricular end-diastolic pressure (RVEDP). The RVEDP occurs when the tricuspid valve is open and the right ventricle is filled just prior to contraction. In the waveform (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0884533612443562">Figure 1</xref>), this occurs between the “a” wave and the “c” wave, at the valley in between the 2 letters. In addition, these values should be measured at the end of an expiratory cycle, as intrathoracic pressures from ventilation affect the CVP (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0884533612443562">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<p>In the late 19th century, Otto Frank investigated the relationship between the stretched length of a muscle and its contractile strength. He was able to determine that the contractile strength of heart muscle was increased when the muscle was stretched. In the early 20th century, Ernest Starling and his group published their studies that increasing the venous return to the heart of dogs subsequently increased the stroke volume. Their combined work is now called the Frank-Starling mechanism, which states that under normal physiologic conditions, the stroke volume of the heart increases in response to an increase in the volume of blood filling the heart (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0884533612443562">Figure 2</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0884533612443562">2</xref></sup></p>

</fig>
<p>Because the filling pressure of the left heart is dependent on the output of the right heart through the pulmonary circulation, the filling pressure of the left ventricle is dependent on CVP as a factor in determining its preload. Therefore, CVP has been (and often still is) used as a marker to determine the preload or filling pressure of the heart.</p>
<p>CVP can be measured by a bedside evaluation and looking at the level of distention (or lack thereof) of a patient’s jugular veins. Commonly, CVP is obtained with transducers through the distal port of a central line lying at the junction of the superior vena cava (SVC) and the right atrium. The midaxillary line of the chest at the fifth intercostal space is commonly used as an anatomical landmark to determine the level of the right atrium, where the transducer is zeroed. Ideally, the patient should be supine for the measurement. If clinically necessary, the head of the bed can be elevated as long as the transducer is positioned in the same place each time and the angle of the bed remains the same.</p>
<p>For better or worse, CVP is used as a marker of preload and adequate resuscitation. Normal CVP has a large range but is typically valued at 0–8 mm Hg. In certain clinical conditions, CVP can help guide fluid management and interventions to attempt to maximize preload. In the Frank-Starling mechanism outlined above, it is important to realize that there is a plateau in the graph. As preload continues to increase above a certain point, there is no improvement in stroke volume. This transition point varies with disease processes, patients, and even the same individual at different time points.</p>
<p>Several studies in the literature give a target value of CVP depending on certain clinical conditions. For instance, in the Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0884533612443562">3</xref></sup> rapid resuscitation to a target CVP of 8–12 mm Hg is recommended for patients in severe sepsis and septic shock. This stems from the landmark article by Rivers et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0884533612443562">1</xref></sup> which showed a significant reduction in mortality in these patients if they were resuscitated to this level. During liver surgery, it is common practice to lower the CVP below 5 mm Hg to minimize intraoperative blood loss.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0884533612443562">4</xref></sup> Studies have also shown that a CVP of 4–9 mm Hg reduces air embolization during neurosurgical procedures in the semi-sitting position.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0884533612443562">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>A CVP measurement can be viewed in 2 basic ways: static measurements and dynamic monitoring. Looking at a single measurement at a point in time is a “static” measurement. Little clinical information can be gained from a static measurement of CVP because there is no context. A better way is to incorporate CVP monitoring as a “dynamic” monitor—for example, trending the CVP measurements over time and evaluating how the CVP and other hemodynamic values change in response to a stimulus, most often a fluid challenge. A fluid challenge is not the same as volume resuscitation. It is merely a marker for those who are preload responsive and may benefit from continued fluid resuscitation to help improve hemodynamic indices.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0884533612443562">6</xref></sup> Finally, only 50% of all hemodynamically unstable patients will be preload responsive.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0884533612443562">7</xref></sup> Although a fluid challenge is a common first step in resuscitation, other interventions (pressors, inotropes, steroids, blood, etc) are often needed to effectively resuscitate a critically ill patient.</p>
<p>For all the information that can be gathered by CVP monitoring, there are flaws inherent within the system. First, CVP requires an invasive line to be placed in the central venous system, which carries with it complications. Up to 15% of patients experience 1 or more complications from central line insertion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0884533612443562">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0884533612443562">9</xref></sup> Some common mechanical complications that arise after the attempted placement of central venous catheters include arterial puncture, pneumothorax, hemothorax, and cardiac arrhythmias. More serious complications that can arise after placement include venous or cardiac perforation, cardiac tamponade, venous air embolism, and even death. More commonly, infectious complications arise with indwelling vascular catheters, which can also be life-threatening.</p>
<p>Second, a CVP measurement is typically a small number, and very small inaccuracies in measurement can influence further treatment strategies. Figg and Nemergut<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0884533612443562">10</xref></sup> demonstrated that when different practitioners who were experienced in dealing with central lines were left to zero a transducer to the level of the right atrium and then measure a CVP, their measurements differed by as much as 17 cm H<sub>2</sub>O with a standard deviation of 4 cm H<sub>2</sub>O. This, according to the ICU protocols and guidelines, could mean the difference between aggressive fluid resuscitation and giving a diuretic. Even when the transducer is set and an electronic monitoring device prints out a CVP waveform recording for a board-certified ICU doctor to analyze, interphysician disagreements of more than 2 mm Hg occur 24% of the time, and 7% of the time the difference is over 5 mm Hg.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0884533612443562">11</xref></sup> When these results were theoretically tied into goal-directed therapy, therapy would have been altered in over 20% of the patients depending on which CVP measurement was used.</p>
<p>Finally, it is important to realize that using CVP as a marker of left ventricular preload depends on several assumptions. It assumes that pulmonary resistance and right heart function are normal and unimpaired and that intrathoracic pressures do not vary significantly. The body does many different things to maintain homeostasis when critically ill, individually affecting the CVP required for optimal cardiac function.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0884533612443562">12</xref></sup> Variability of cardiac pump function and vascular resistance directly affect the optimal CVP for maximal cardiac output. For instance, there can be changes in arterial blood pressure, vascular resistance, and venous capacity simply by inducing the carotid body reflex, which is a homeostatic feedback mechanism caused by the stretch of the baroceptors in the carotid body, without any significant changes in the CVP.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0884533612443562">13</xref></sup> Magder<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0884533612443562">14</xref></sup> points out that it is impossible to take into consideration CVP alone without also assessing cardiac output and tissue perfusion.</p>
<p>CVP monitoring has long been available for management of critically ill and injured patients as a rough marker for cardiac preload. Despite its limitations, it is readily measureable from a central venous catheter as long as proper measurement techniques are undertaken. It is best used as a dynamic, rather than a static, measurement. These values should be taken in context with other physiologic parameters for the patient to help guide clinical fluid management. It can be a helpful marker in discriminating the different types of shock.</p>

<title>The Pulmonary Artery Catheter</title>
<p>Swan and Ganz<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0884533612443562">15</xref></sup> first described the pulmonary artery catheter (PAC) in 1970. Since that time, the medical literature has heralded the PAC as both life-saving as well as life-threatening, and the popularity of the technology has followed suit and vacillated over the ensuing years.</p>
<p>After the PAC introduction, it soared in popularity through the 1980s. An observational study of PAC use in the setting of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) mirrored the growing trend across the nation. During the 4 years studied (1975, 1978, 1981, and 1984), incidence in the setting of AMI in which PACs were thought to be indicated grew: 7.2% initially, then 13.8%, then 14.8%, and eventually 19.9%, respectively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0884533612443562">16</xref></sup> A 1984 prospective study of 142 consecutive autopsies revealed that 55 patients (39%) died with a PAC in place.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0884533612443562">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>As PAC popularity grew, the need for evidence of its efficacy through prospective, randomized trials was demanded.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0884533612443562">18</xref></sup> Connors et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0884533612443562">19</xref></sup> answered this call in 1996. Their study found increased cost, length of stay, and, most important, mortality (odds ratio, 1.24) among 5735 case-matched and prospectively analyzed critically ill patients. As a result of the findings in the Connors et al study, the PAC became the focal point of a number of randomized trials spanning different critically ill patient populations (medical, surgical, shock, adult respiratory distress syndrome [ARDS]). Ultimately, the studies concluded that the PAC did not improve outcomes, while placing patients at risk for catheter-related complications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0884533612443562">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0884533612443562"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0884533612443562"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0884533612443562"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0884533612443562"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0884533612443562"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0884533612443562">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>As evidence amassed against its benefit, PAC use decreased by 65% between 1993 and 2004 (5.66 to 1.99 per 1000 medical admissions in 1993 and 2004, respectively).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0884533612443562">26</xref></sup> The studies reevaluating the PAC, however, were themselves criticized due to design flaws, selection biases, and ethical considerations. Ethically, the question of whether a physician believing someone could benefit from a PAC could randomize that person to a study arm disallowing that technology was raised. This was felt to have led to the exclusion of those patients in which the PAC would have been most beneficial in many studies.</p>
<p>The studies were also criticized for a near-universal lack of inclusion of the PAC in a treatment algorithm.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0884533612443562">27</xref></sup> This changed in 2006 with a study published courtesy of ARDSnet. The Fluid and Catheter Treatment Trial (FACTT) compared mortality, ventilator-free days, and ICU stay among patients diagnosed with acute lung injury (ALI). A total of 1000 randomized patients received either central venous catheter (CVC)–directed resuscitation (measuring CVP) or PAC-directed resuscitation (measuring cardiac index [CI] and pulmonary artery occlusion pressure [PAOP]). The study found no significant benefit to PAC in PAC-directed resuscitation (mortality: 27.4% [CVC] vs 26.3% [PAC], <italic>P</italic> = .69; ventilator-free days: 13.2 [CVC] vs 13.5 [PAC], <italic>P</italic> = .58; days not spent in the ICU: 12.0 [CVC] vs 12.5 [PAC], <italic>P</italic> = .40).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0884533612443562">28</xref></sup> The widespread use of the PAC decreased markedly after the FACTT publication.</p>
<p>Currently, consensus guidelines are largely based on expert opinion because randomized data supporting pulmonary artery catheter usage are lacking. The consensus statements available are from the 1997 Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM) Pulmonary Artery Catheter Consensus Conference as well as the 2003 American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Practice Guidelines for Pulmonary Artery Catheterization.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0884533612443562">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0884533612443562">30</xref></sup> The clinical settings indicating PAC use are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0884533612443562">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<p>Beyond the medical indications for PAC use and nursing familiarity with the PAC, its setup and methodology for obtaining hemodynamic data remain a critical aspect of its use. Nursing scores on basic PAC fund of knowledge assessment tools among critical care nurses remain consistently low around the world (42.5%–56.8% correct answers).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0884533612443562">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0884533612443562"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0884533612443562">33</xref></sup> This is a result of their infrequent use. Further, ASA guidelines state that perioperative indications for PACs should be based on whether nursing in that facility is familiar with PAC monitoring.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0884533612443562">30</xref></sup></p>
<p>Similarly, physician competence necessary for PAC use has been disappointing. In 1997 Trottier and Taylor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0884533612443562">34</xref></sup> published the results of a survey of SCCM members, revealing that 33% of responders could not properly identify PAOP on a clearly marked tracing. A physician lacking detailed knowledge of PAC use, insertion techniques, troubleshooting, and waveform interpretation should not endeavor to insert this device.</p>
<p>Insertion of a PAC begins by inserting a 9-French introducer sheath into a central vein. The PAC is then inserted through the introducer sheath into the central vein. A 1.5-mL balloon tip at the end of the PAC is used to direct the catheter from the central vein through the SVC, right atrium, right ventricle, and into an occlusive “wedge” position in the pulmonary artery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0884533612443562">Figure 3</xref>). The PAOP can then be carefully measured (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0884533612443562">Table 2</xref>). PAOP tracings vary with respiration. It is for this reason that interpretation of the PAOP is a learned skill. End expiration is used as the point of measurement because at this point in the respiratory cycle, intrathoracic pressure approximates atmospheric pressure. This holds true for both mechanically ventilated and spontaneously breathing patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0884533612443562">Figure 4</xref>).</p>

<caption><p>Schematic pulmonary artery occlusion pressure (PAOP) tracing. PAOP measurement should be taken at end expiration, which is represented by point A in an intubated patient and point B in a spontaneously breathing patient.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0884533612443562-fig4.tif"/>
</fig>
<p>In the wedge position, PAOP is correlative with a number of hemodynamic measurements aligned in series: the pulmonary artery (PA) pressure distal to the occlusive “wedge” position, pulmonary capillary (PC) pressure, pulmonary vein (PV) pressure, left atrial (LA) pressure, and the left ventricular end- diastolic pressure (LVEDP). Taking the example of a river, downstream obstruction by the construction of a dam has the consequence of upstream flooding. In vivo, acute left heart failure produced by pathologies such as AMI can serve as a surrogate for the dam. Upstream flooding becomes realized as flow backs up (hence, pressures rise) throughout the upstream circuit from the left ventricle to the elevated PAOP. A normal PAOP suggests that there is no obstruction or resistance to normal flow and effectively rules out a cardiac cause of pulmonary edema. It is for this reason that a normal PAOP &lt;18 is necessary to rule out a cardiogenic cause of lung disease prior to making the diagnosis of ARDS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0884533612443562">35</xref></sup></p>
<p>LVEDP is correlative with left ventricular end-diastolic volume (LVEDV), assuming normal cardiac compliance. Therefore, if a patient has increased preload (eg, by giving a 0.9% normal saline bolus), it will be reflected as an increased LVEDP and LVEDV. As myocardial fibers stretch (LVEDV increases) at the microscopic level, contractility (stroke volume) improves up to a point in a relationship known as the Frank-Starling curve (which was previously discussed). Increasing preload, then, is a surrogate marker for improved stroke volume, cardiac output (CO), and cardiac index (CI). An accurate assessment of preload is integral to the establishment of a critically ill patient’s volume status. The PAOP is therefore viewed as a tool to assist the critical care physician in this assessment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0884533612443562">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0884533612443562">37</xref></sup></p>
<p>A patient’s progression along the Frank-Starling curve can be assessed by PAOP. Pulmonary artery catheters provide CO and CI data using the principle of thermal dilution. Branthwaite and Bradley<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0884533612443562">38</xref></sup> first directly measured CO in human participants using thermal dilution in 1968. The mathematical equation applied to calculate CO by thermal dilution (the Stewart-Hamilton equation) is complex,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0884533612443562">39</xref></sup> but its concept is quite eloquent. Thermal dilution relies on temperature change after an injection of cold normal saline into one of the PAC ports at the SVC/right atrial junction. As saline injection warms in the body, the change in temperature is then measured downstream by a thermistor. If the blood is constantly moving through the heart, then the faster the blood moves (ie, the higher the CO), the less the temperature will have decreased by the time the blood passes by the thermistor and vice versa.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0884533612443562">38</xref></sup> The Stewart-Hamilton equation equates the temperature change (or lack thereof) to CO. Today’s PAC uses a heated coil and the same principles of thermal dilution to continuously monitor CO in real time rather than rely on an operator to inject saline.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0884533612443562">40</xref></sup> This automation of the CO measurement reduces the chance of operator error.</p>
<p>Another important advancement came from Martyn and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0884533612443562">41</xref></sup> in 1981, with the introduction of a “volumetric” PAC capable of providing information pertaining to the right heart (right ventricular ejection fraction [RVEF], right ventricular end-diastolic volume [RVEDV], and right ventricular end-diastolic volume index [RVEDVI]). The principles of thermal dilution remained but were now measured at the level of the right heart only. These variables were found to be superior to the PAOP in the determination of fluid responsiveness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0884533612443562">41</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0884533612443562"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0884533612443562"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0884533612443562">44</xref></sup> Nearly all catheters in place today are volumetric.</p>
<p>Mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO<sub>2</sub>) is yet another parameter available to the clinician using a PAC. The fiber-optic spectrophotometric assessment of SvO<sub>2</sub> in real time became available on the PAC in the 1980s.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0884533612443562">45</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0884533612443562"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0884533612443562">47</xref></sup> This is a measure of tissue oxygen extraction as blood transits the arteriovenous circuit. In states of impaired oxygen delivery (ie, shock, sepsis, acidosis), tissues extract a higher percentage of oxygen than in normal states, and the SvO<sub>2</sub> downtrends. EN in the setting of impaired oxygen delivery increases hepatosplanchic blood flow and intestinal energy demands. This phenomenon can lead to oxygen supply/demand mismatch. In extreme cases, this can lead to bowel necrosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0884533612443562">48</xref></sup> Conversely, a trickle amount of EN may induce some diversion of blood flow to the splanchic circulation and therefore provide a degree of protection to the intestine. Where the tipping point between protection and necrosis occurs is usually not clear in critically ill patients. It also cannot be absolutely determined by hemodynamic monitoring, laboratory assessments, or clinical exam. This is the main reason why some practitioners avoid EN in acute critical illness.</p>
<p>Although its popularity has waned in recent times, the information gleaned from the use of the PAC remains an important concept and tool for the critical care physician. The advent of less invasive means of hemodynamic monitoring such as arterial pulse-wave analysis and ultrasonography has shifted clinical ICU care away from the PAC. However, until prospective randomized trials have validated these newer technologies, the PAC remains the gold standard for the assessment of hemodynamics in the critically ill patient.</p>

<title>Arterial Pulse-Wave Analysis in Hemodynamic Monitoring</title>
<p>For years now, the PAC has been the gold standard<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0884533612443562">49</xref></sup> in acquiring dynamic cardiovascular performance parameters. Nonetheless, data on justifying the risk-to-benefit ratio while using this catheter have been variable, with meta-analyses sometimes suggesting measureable benefit<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0884533612443562">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0884533612443562">51</xref></sup> and sometimes not.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0884533612443562">52</xref></sup> The question still remains in those who did not show a benefit as to whether appropriate and timely interventions were pursued in response to the acquired data.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0884533612443562">52</xref></sup> Ideally, the clinician should have access to a completely accurate, minute-to-minute assessment of preload, afterload, and cardiac output from which to make decisions on the role and degree of fluid resuscitation, diuresis, inotropic support, and other interventions. Among the list of proposed and implemented answers to the search for ideal hemodynamic monitoring modalities has been the development of arterial pulse-wave analysis (APWA).</p>
<p>APWA is used to estimate intravascular volume status through the use of stroke volume variation and an estimate of cardiac output. The technique is limited to patients who are on the ventilator.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0884533612443562">53</xref></sup> Because the data are obtained through an existing peripheral arterial line that routinely exists in ventilated ICU patients, it has the appeal of little or no additional morbidity to the patient. For the nutrition support practitioner, the key variables of interest with APWA technology are CI and stroke volume variability. Favorable physiology is suggested by a CI of at least 2.8 L/min/m<sup>2</sup> coupled with a trend showing improvement or stability at this output level. Stroke volume variability (SVV) correlates with the predicted response to volume resuscitation. Therefore, a low SVV (ie, &lt;13 for Vigileo and &lt;10 for LiDCO) suggests that additional fluid administration will unlikely result in significant improvement in perfusion. In our opinion, the combination of an adequate CI and a low SVV often suggests that resuscitation has progressed to a point where nutrition support might be initiated or advanced.</p>
<p>Similar objective hemodynamic monitoring studies assessing this technology are lacking, including studies looking at the limited utility in cases of arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation, the inability to correct for factors affecting arterial compliance such as advanced atherosclerosis, and loss of accuracy following administration of vasoactive medications such as pressors and anesthetics. In addition, stroke volume variation has only been validated as a reliable predictor of fluid responsiveness in patients with a tidal volume between 8 and 15 mL/kg. Extremes of tidal volume, such as high-frequency oscillating ventilation or severely reduced chest compliance from prone positioning, remain unproven.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0884533612443562">54</xref></sup></p>
<p>Typically, cardiac output is calculated from the product of heart rate and stroke volume of the heart. APWA substitutes pulse rate for heart rate in an effort to account for only heartbeats that actually contribute to flow away from the heart. Stroke volume, for the purposes of calculating a cardiac output, is then calculated from a computer algorithm partially derived from the arterial pressure waveform. In theory, however, this can only be achieved if both the systemic vascular resistance (SVR) and the systemic arterial compliance are either known or able to be closely estimated.</p>
<p>Historically, there have been 3 manufacturers of commercially available arterial waveform analysis devices. These include Pulsion (Munich, Germany), which makes the PiCCO monitoring system; Edwards Lifesciences (Irvine, CA), which makes the FloTrac sensor for use with the Vigileo monitor; and LiDCO (Cambridge, UK), which makes the LiDCO system. Each company has established and propagated a somewhat unique application of the existing theories and clinical applications of APWA. Specifically, these differences have been related to the method of determining estimated systemic vascular resistance and arterial compliance to approximate the stroke volume necessary to calculate cardiac output. As a result, the products of each company have been shown to have characteristic advantages and disadvantages under different clinical circumstances. Most recently, each of the 3 companies has developed additional products that make use of concepts advanced by the other companies to compensate for their specific product’s historical shortcomings.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0884533612443562">55</xref></sup></p>
<p>The PiCCO system measures cardiac output using pulse contour analysis and transpulmonary thermodilution. The thermodilution is necessary for calibration. It requires a relatively central arterial access (femoral, axillary, or brachial artery) as well as central venous access. The necessity for this level of additional invasiveness has been its greatest drawback. However, there may be a reliability and accuracy advantage over uncalibrated pulse-wave analysis in terms of following CI trends in septic patients undergoing active volume expansion and/or titration of norepinephrine,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0884533612443562">56</xref></sup> which are common in the ICU patient population.</p>
<p>The FloTrac/Vigileo system is an uncalibrated system that requires only peripheral arterial access. Because peripheral arterial lines are nearly ubiquitous in many ventilated patients, the lack of necessity for any further invasive catheter placement, the lack of any calibration even during setup, and the ease of setup are its major advantages. Precision under circumstances of high-dose vasopressor therapy, however, likely remains an issue despite multiple revisions to the software algorithm designed to improve this.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0884533612443562">57</xref></sup></p>
<p>In addition, because the FloTrac is uncalibrated, the computer algorithm alone must provide the necessary data by calculating a standard deviation of the measured arterial pulse pressure around the calculated mean arterial pressure over 20 seconds at 100 times per minute, generating 2000 data points from which to make the calculation. First, the computer compensates for previously determined characteristics of large arterial vessel compliance in humans,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0884533612443562">58</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0884533612443562"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0884533612443562">60</xref></sup> assesses 2 waveform features known as skewness and kurtosis, and then incorporates the mean arterial pressure, the pulse rate, and demographic data, including, height, weight, age, and gender, into its calculation. The computer then continuously assesses the impact of predicted vascular tone effects on the pressure waveform every 60 seconds and arrives at a conversion factor known as “khi.” This factor is then multiplied by the standard deviation of the pulse pressure, converting its units from mm Hg into mL/heartbeat, which effectively represents the stroke volume.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0884533612443562">61</xref></sup> The new calculated stroke volume is then recompared to the pulse waveform over the last 60 seconds to arrive at a stroke volume variation. This calculated variation has been shown to correlate with ventricular preload and volume.</p>
<p>The LiDCO system, like the PiCCO system, is calibrated and uses intravenous (IV) lithium reported to be in doses associated with irrelevant pharmacologic effects. Lithium indicator dilution is used by injecting lithium into a peripheral vein to calibrate the system, indirectly acquire continuous stroke volume and stroke volume variation values using a root mean square mathematical model, and then finally calculate cardiac output. From an access standpoint, a peripheral arterial catheter and IV are all that is necessary. Recalibration is recommended every 8 hours and should be done after each major hemodynamic change, which can be frequent and labor intensive in the hemodynamically unstable patient.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0884533612443562">62</xref></sup></p>
<p>In assessing efficacy of APWA, most reviewed studies make comparisons to transesophageal echocardiography or transpulmonary thermodilution with a pulmonary artery catheter. Evidence suggests that these techniques are comparable, as demonstrated by a strong correlation in measuring cardiac indices.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0884533612443562">63</xref></sup> Some evidence suggests, however, that transpulmonary thermodilution can generate clinically important time delays in the response of the PAC during rapid alterations in hemodynamic status.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0884533612443562">64</xref></sup> Such delays are not usually seen with pulse-wave technology, and so a discrepancy may be the result of the PAC time delay rather than inaccuracy of the APWA.</p>
<p>It should be noted that a number of the validation studies have been performed using one form of APWA or another. It is unclear as to whether the same conclusion might or might not be drawn about the other 2 waveform devices. Further studies involving head-to-head comparisons of the different devices would be necessary to draw such conclusions definitively.</p>
<p>The manufacturer of the FloTrac/Vigileo system has recognized certain limitations and recommends usage only in adults without ventricular assist devices or intra-aortic balloon pumps. In addition, aortic insufficiency and severe peripheral constriction during shock states or hypothermia may negatively affect numeric results, particularly if the arterial waveform is measured at the radial artery in the wrist, where these effects can be most profound.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0884533612443562">61</xref></sup></p>
<p>Liu et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0884533612443562">65</xref></sup> prospectively evaluated cardiac surgery patients using PACs, echocardiography, and uncalibrated APWA. Exclusion criteria included atrial fibrillation, severe arrhythmias, ejection fractions &lt;35%, a permanent pacemaker, and the need for any type of mechanical cardiac support. Ultimately, 100 patients were included. PACs measured continuous cardiac output (continuous cardiac output via a thermodilutional method) and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP). The FloTrac sensor and Vigileo uncalibrated APWA equipment measured arterial pulse-wave generated cardiac output (APCO) and SVV. Transesophageal echocardiography (Sonos 5500, Philips. Andover, MA) measured left ventricular end-diastolic area and volume (LVEDA and LVEDV). APWA measurements were also separately made from peripheral arterial lines and central arterial lines to see if there was a difference. The authors found a tight correlation between central and peripheral APWA measurements, concluding central arterial access to be unnecessary. SVV was found to correlate well with LVEDA and LVEDV and was thus determined to be a good indicator of cardiac preload. Finally, the arterial pulse-wave estimated cardiac output was tightly correlated with continuous cardiac output from the PAC.</p>
<p>Cannesson et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0884533612443562">66</xref></sup> prospectively compared the FloTrac device with standard cardiac output measurements using the bolus thermodilution technique with a PAC in 11 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft (CABG). They performed iatrogenic volume expansion and looked for correlation between the PAC CO and FloTrac CO measurements. They found a good relationship between percent changes of CO after volume expansion but did not give any vasoactive medications. They validated the uncalibrated APWA model in this setting.</p>
<p>Lorsomradee et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0884533612443562">67</xref></sup> compared uncalibrated arterial pulse contour analysis versus continuous thermodilution cardiac output monitoring with a PAC. This was a prospective study with 52 patients undergoing elective heart surgery. The authors found an acceptably low bias in patients without significant valve pathology. However, they recognized an unacceptable discordance during the presence of an intra-aortic balloon pump and after experimentally induced changes in arterial pressure waveform morphology seen right after the intraoperative sympathetic response associated with the median sternotomy and also following phenylephrine administration. They concluded that good waveform fidelity is mandatory in obtaining accurate values from arterial pulse contour analysis. The use of an intra-aortic balloon pump in this study caused severe problems with measurements.</p>
<p>In multiple places in the literature, one finds evidence that there have been shortcomings in the software program that performs the waveform analysis in the uncalibrated model. Sequential improvements have been made to the software and its algorithms, but whether we have reached the ceiling of maximal accuracy and precision remains to be seen. Meng et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0884533612443562">68</xref></sup> monitored 33 patients with the third-generation uncalibrated software and used esophageal Doppler as a control. They concluded that the Vigileo accurately tracks changes in CO when preload changes, but this accuracy is lost when the patients are exposed to vasopressors.</p>
<p>Other conclusions reached by various authors regarding uncalibrated pulse-wave technology have been varied. Biais et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0884533612443562">69</xref></sup> determined that the Vigileo system may be used as a predictor of fluid responsiveness in patients with circulatory failure after liver transplantation. Benes et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0884533612443562">70</xref></sup> determined that fluid optimization guided by SVV during major abdominal surgery is associated with better intraoperative hemodynamic stability, a decrease in serum lactate at the end of surgery, and a lower incidence of postoperative organ complications. In another study, Biais et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0884533612443562">71</xref></sup> looked at liver transplant patients with acute lung injury and ARDS on higher levels of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) using the FloTrac system. They concluded that SVV is useful to predict a drop in stroke volume induced by PEEP and that the device was able to track changes in stroke volume induced by PEEP.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0884533612443562">72</xref></sup></p>
<p>Looking at the calibrated forms of APWA, some validation in the clinical scenario of reduced cardiac function exists for the Pulsion PiCCO system. Reuter et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0884533612443562">73</xref></sup> prospectively evaluated 15 mechanically ventilated patients with ejection fractions under 35% after CABG surgery. Volume loading was performed with serial measurements of stroke volume index (SVI) until there was &lt;5% rise in SVI with subsequent volume administration. The results enabled them to conclude that stroke volume variation with APWA using the PiCCO can predict volume responsiveness, and it can do so even in cases of reduced left ventricular function. Rodig et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0884533612443562">74</xref></sup> compared both the PiCCO system and continuous thermodilution with the traditional intermittent transpulmonary thermodilution technique in 26 patients with CABG. They found that intraoperatively, the PiCCO generated comparable data to the continuous cardiac output catheter and that both correlated well to the intermittent thermodilution values. However, under circumstances of marked changes in SVR, an increase in the rate of recalibration became necessary to maintain accuracy. On the basis of their findings, they concluded that the PiCCO needs to be recalibrated at least once an hour and after any fluid challenges or alterations in vasoactive medication dosing.</p>
<p>One study comparing calibrated with uncalibrated APWA using the FloTrac and the PiCCO system should be noted. Monnet et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0884533612443562">56</xref></sup> prospectively administered fluid or gave norepinephrine strategically in 80 ICU patients with sepsis and measured cardiac indices using both systems, comparing them with transpulmonary thermodilution as a control. They concluded from their data that the calibrated PiCCO device was accurate but that the uncalibrated Vigileo poorly tracked the trends in CI induced by the changes in fluid administration and vasoconstrictor medication. It seemed that the more the SVR changed, the less accurate the uncalibrated data became.</p>
<p>Evidence exists for the benefit in obtaining dynamic data such as CO and SVV as opposed to static physiologic parameters such as CVP, pulmonary arterial occlusion pressure, heart rate, and blood pressure for purposes of predicting fluid responsiveness and cardiac preload, as well as directing appropriate therapy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0884533612443562">75</xref></sup> Improved outcomes, at least in the case of cardiac and general surgery so far, have been demonstrated in the literature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0884533612443562">76</xref></sup> Although there remains a wide variety of circumstances under which arterial pulse-wave analysis data are problematic,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0884533612443562">77</xref></sup> there does appear to be a legitimate role for the technology in the care of the critically ill. As with many newer technologies, it is not uncommon to see favorable results initially that are tempered over time as clinical experience accumulates and more objective clinical trials are performed.</p>

<sec id="section4-0884533612443562">
<title>Ultrasonography</title>
<p>Ultrasonography is increasingly being used as a quick and noninvasive measurement tool in the ICU. In a critically ill patient, it can give immediate information on the cardiac function and volume status with minimal setup time and image optimization. It is an assessment tool rather than a continuous monitoring tool that is unlike the invasive catheter methods. It requires an ultrasonography/echocardiography skill set by trained intensivists.</p>
<p>The gold standard for ultrasonography of the heart and great vessels has been a formal transthoracic or transesophageal echocardiography performed by an experienced technician and interpreted by a cardiologist, but this service is often not available around the clock. The traditional model of consult, data acquisition, interpretation of the images, and reporting can take over 24 hours to complete the cycle, which is too long for critically ill patients to wait.</p>
<p>The standard views that are obtained are as follows: parasternal long axis, parasternal short axis, apical four-chamber, and subxiphoid views. The subxiphoid view also allows assessment of the inferior vena cava (IVC). The vena cava and its diameter change/decrease with respirations is the most reliable test for volume status. An IVC change/decrease &gt;80% is compatible with the need for preload volume expansion, and an IVC change/decrease &lt;20% suggests that volume expansion will likely not be necessary (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0884533612443562">Table 3</xref>). An intermediate change/decrease is indeterminate as to the need for volume expansion. This provides the role for a passive bolus, in which the legs of the patient are raised (equating to a 500-mL bolus) and the IVC collapsibility is remeasured. Decreased compressibility suggests that an additional fluid bolus would be beneficial.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0884533612443562">78</xref></sup> Feissel et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0884533612443562">79</xref></sup> used a distensibility index of the IVC ((IVC maximum diameter – IVC minimum diameter)/IVC mean diameter) with a cutoff value of 12%. A value &gt;12% showed that volume loading would increase cardiac output by ≥15%.</p>

<p>In a surgical ICU population, bedside ultrasonography has been used to assess the volume status of patients focusing on the correlations between IVC change/decrease and concurrent CVP measurements. In a study of 83 sequential patients with both the ability to obtain ultrasound measurements and CVP pressures, there was a statistically significant decrease in mean CVP as patients were in 3 ranges (change/decrease &gt;80%, 20%–80%, or &lt;20%).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0884533612443562">80</xref></sup> However, in the group with the least compressibility of the IVC (&lt;20%), only 5% of patients had a corresponding CVP &lt;7, and 40% of patients in this category had a CVP &gt;7. In the group with the most compressibility of the IVC (&gt;60%), 60% of patients had a CVP &lt;7, strongly suggesting the need for fluid expansion by both ultrasound and CVP measurement criteria. This study was unable to determine which method was more accurate or whether volume expansion administered for the ultrasound and/or the CVP findings improved the clinical status of the patient or outcome.</p>
<p>In a limited study of 30 trauma patients with hemorrhagic shock, ultrasound examination to evaluate IVC change/decrease was correlated with response to fluid resuscitation and recurrence of shock.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0884533612443562">81</xref></sup> In this study, the diameter of the IVC was a better predictor of recurrence of shock and a favorable response to volume expansion than the standard vital signs of blood pressure and heart rate or base deficit decrease. This study also found a statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .01) correlation between the ultrasound diameter measurement with a computed tomography (CT) scan in those patients undergoing abdominal CT. This study suggests that bedside ultrasound can be used to diagnose hypovolemia, and acting on this information and providing volume resuscitation to the patient improved clinical outcome.</p>
<p>In a study of 53 trauma ICU patients, bedside ultrasonography was performed to evaluate cardiac function and IVC diameter measurements, with 80% of patients having an ejection fraction and/or IVC change/decrease estimated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0884533612443562">82</xref></sup> Of those evaluated for cardiac function, 56% were diagnosed with left heart failure and 25% with right heart failure. Eighty percent showed respiratory variation of the IVC suggesting hypovolemia. In a survey of how the ultrasound results were used, 87% found the ultrasound findings helpful, and 54% led directly to a change in the management plan.</p>
<p>Ultrasonography at the bedside in the ICU is an operator-dependent hemodynamic assessment methodology that can answer key hemodynamic questions quickly and noninvasively in real time. It has not been shown to be an effective hemodynamic monitoring technology, nor has its effectiveness been assessed by randomized clinical trials. Ultrasonography does appear to work as a complementary technology to invasive continuous cardiac output catheter monitors. Ultrasonography can answer key questions intermittently, and the invasive catheters can be used to confirm the patient’s response to therapeutic interventions and to observe for future downturns in a patient’s hemodynamic status. ICU-performed ultrasonography results are often not directly recorded as an isolated study in the medical record. The result is more typically documented in the ICU note. Therefore, direct communication with the intensive care practitioner performing ultrasonography and directly caring for the ICU patient is necessary. In our opinion, if the results of ultrasonography show an acceptable cardiac output and a low degree of compressibility of the IVC, then adequate perfusion is usually present, and the recommendation to initiate or advance nutrition support can frequently be made.</p>

<title>Summary</title>
<p>A major challenge in critical care medicine remains the need to predict optimal resuscitation parameters for each patient given his or her unique physiology coupled with the dynamic effects of the patient’s illnesses. Hemodynamic monitoring and directing the resuscitation of the patient based on data collected from these devices remains a staple of critical care. Which devices, whether to use them individually or collectively, and how to best use them to optimize outcomes remain a major challenge in the evidence-based medicine approach to critical illness and shock.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0884533612443562">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0884533612443562">74</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0884533612443562">81</xref></sup> It is important to emphasize that despite the potential for guidance by collecting hemodynamic measurements as described above, the final judgment as to whether adequate perfusion exists to justify the initiation or advancement of nutrition support should be determined by the critical care team and should be primarily based on the patient’s response to therapeutic interventions over time.</p>
