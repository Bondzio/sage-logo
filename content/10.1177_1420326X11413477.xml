<abstract>
<p>The market has identified Qatar, in the Arabian Gulf, as one of the busiest construction areas in the world. In line with this, tall buildings have arisen in Doha city because of economic necessity. Accordingly, government officials have revealed that Qatar will see the rise of about 800 tall buildings by 2016.</p>
<p>A hypothesis-based study has been conducted using the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design – (LEED) as a reference, to measure the green performance of Qatari buildings including the variables: sustainable site, water efficiency, energy and atmosphere, materials and resources, indoor environmental quality, and innovation and design. These variables were analysed in accordance to the current needs of Qatar and its future plan. Using the LEED variables comparatively, this paper suggests adaptations to the weight assigned to these variables in the LEED scheme, to meet specific Qatari conditions for tall buildings in Qatar. The findings should encourage decision makers and local authorities who are interested in the subject to refine the knowledge related to the future development of the Qatari green scheme and contribute to the urgent need for research-based green criteria for Qatar by introducing knowledge and principles to be implemented in developing a green metric scheme for the tall buildings in Qatar.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1420326X11413477"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>In the last century, the branding of cities has become a very important factor for urban regeneration to attract more foreign investment in a competitive global environment. Key metropolitan areas evolving from their local mid- or low-rise patterns into high-rise office towers are often called the iconic architecture of capitalist globalism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1420326X11413477">1</xref>]<italic>.</italic> This iconic architecture is prevalent in the Arabian Gulf region, where competition for foreign investment is growing. For example, the landscape of the Gulf has been forever transformed by the Tornado Tower in Qatar, Burj Dubai in the United Arab Emirates, BFP Tower in Bahrain and Al Jawharah tower in Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>Qatar is one of the fastest growing economies in the world. According to Business Monitor International [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1420326X11413477">2</xref>], Qatar's construction sector is set to reach 33 billion Qatari riyals (US$9.06 billion) by 2012; the market has identified Qatar as one of the busiest construction areas in the world. The rate of vacancy in Qatar's offices is estimated at 1%, making it one of the lowest in the world and significantly lower than London (9%) and New York (7%). Therefore, tall buildings have arisen in Doha city because of the economic necessity with new developments being announced almost daily – of the 50 or so tall buildings in Doha's business downtown area, around half of them are still under construction, while to the North entire new cities and man-made islands are being developed. Government officials have revealed that Qatar will see the rise of about 800 tall buildings by 2016.</p>
<p>Accompanying the architectural transformation brought about by competitive global capital is a heightened international awareness of the deterioration of the world's natural environment. As a result, architectural planners must respond to both needs: economic development and environmental sustainability. Green architecture is an attempt to take environmental concerns into consideration by taking advantage of the efficient use of energy, water and materials. Green architecture also focuses on reducing the impact of buildings on the environment and human health during the building's life cycle. This is accomplished through better building settings, design, construction, operation, maintenance and, finally, removal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1420326X11413477">3</xref>].</p>
<p>In consideration of the concerns of green architecture, Qatar is set to become the newest member of the World Green Building Council with the formation of a non-profit organisation to promote sustainable development. The Qatar Green Building Council (QGBC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1420326X11413477">4</xref>], which is an independent non-profit organization committed to developing a sustainable approach to design and development of buildings for Qatar [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1420326X11413477">5</xref>], is being established by the Qatar Foundation. Awareness is being created that Qatar's green building practices will be different from other countries, climates and regions and aims to encourage the construction industry to adopt environmentally friendly building practices. It is also expected that QGBC will develop a green building model that will become the standard for all developers in Qatar.</p>
<p>Furthermore, two of the most important real-estate firms in Qatar are working to develop a Qatar Sustainability Assessment System (QSAS), a new “green building” rating system developed by BARWA Real Estate Company (BARWA) and QATARI DIAR Real Estate Investment Company (Qatari Diar). QSAS is a system for Qatar buildings, which its developers hope can be adopted by the whole industry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1420326X11413477">6</xref>]. BARWA and Qatari Diar Research Institute (BQDRI) developed QSAS in cooperation with T.C. Chan Center for Building Simulation and Energy Studies at the University of Pennsylvania (USA), to create sustainable urban environments that reduce environmental impacts and meet regional needs, as well as preserving the unique Qatari environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1420326X11413477">7</xref>]. It is anticipated that QSAS can help Qatari companies save money, reduce energy costs and protect the environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1420326X11413477">8</xref>].</p>
<p>Environmental sustainability is of primary importance to development planners in Qatar. Therefore, this paper contributes to this knowledge building, by suggesting and analysing the viability of green variables to be implemented in a green metric mechanism for tall buildings in Qatar. It is intended to open a discussion between decision makers and local authorities to refine the knowledge related to the future development of the Qatari green scheme.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1420326X11413477"><title>Research Aim and Objective</title>
<p>Green building assessment (GBA) has been recognised and explored internationally as the most effective means of encouraging green building development. As a result, a large variety of GBA tools have been applied in the marketplace, while a number of new tools emerge each year.</p>
<p>By far, the early-developed tools have provided general references and resources for developing new specific tools in different regions. On the other hand, the conditions and requirements of GBA in a specific region are multidimensional and complex. All these factors make it difficult for many regions that wish to develop new tools or customise existing tools to suit their specific conditions. The localization of global requirement has generated a certain amount of confusion surrounding existing tools [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1420326X11413477">9</xref>].</p>
<p>The objective of this paper is to ensure the performance of the developed green schemes for Qatar is set above the international level of acceptance throughout the entire life cycle of the system and requires that the Qatari adaptive knowledge base must be periodically updated and upgraded.</p>
<p>To this end, Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) (the prominent scheme used in the development of most green criteria schemes in the Middle East, in general, and Qatar, in particular) is taken as a reference in implementing the green metric mechanism for the tall buildings in Qatar.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-1420326X11413477"><title>GBA Tools</title>
<p>Green architecture is achieved by competently using the resources previously mentioned, and many green building rating tools have evolved due to the rising need to prompt developers and organizations to be more conscience oriented, in dealing with the building as a part of the environment. Three of the most prominently recognised GBA tools are Building Research Association of New Zealand (BRANZ), Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method (BREEAM) and LEED.</p>
<p>BRANZ was established as an incorporated society in 1969 and began operating in 1970, aiming to deliver new knowledge required by the industry. BRANZ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1420326X11413477">10</xref>] has developed “New Zealand's Green Home Scheme” and re-launched it in 2005 as an assessment tool for healthy, safe and sustainable housing. This scheme is based on the UK model, which has now been re-branded as eco-housing<italic>.</italic> BRANZ has extensive background research in the area of sustainability of new and existing houses and small buildings.</p>
<p>BREEAM, the second prominent GBA scheme, is an assessment process that was created in 1990 as a program of the BRE – based in the United Kingdom. According to the environmental assessment method for buildings around the world [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1420326X11413477">11</xref>], BREEAM is the leading and most widely used environmental assessment method for buildings. It sets the standard for best practice in sustainable design. BREEAM provides clients, developers, designers and others with a certified rating system for sustainable buildings; to enable market recognition for low environmental impact buildings and with an assurance that best environmental practice has been incorporated into a building and encourages inspiration to find innovative solutions to minimise environmental impacts. BREEAM is a recognised benchmark that is widely preferred in the construction industry to help reduce running costs and improve working and living environments.</p>
<p>BREEAM addresses wide-ranging environmental and sustainability issues and enables developers and designers to prove their environmental credentials of their buildings to planners and clients. It uses a straightforward scoring system that is transparent, easy to understand and supported by evidence-based research. This has a positive influence on the design, construction and management of buildings and sets and maintains a robust technical standard with rigorous quality assurance and certification.</p>
<p>LEED rating system is the third green metric scheme developed, in 1993, by the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC) as the national rating tool for commercial facilities. It is built on five categories in which a building can receive credits; site, water, energy, materials and indoor environmental quality; besides, the innovation and design category is considered as a bonus if satisfied. By earning a specified number of points within these credits, a building can become LEED-certified or receive a silver or gold rating by earning additional points.</p>
<p>In addition to the previous green assessment schemes, many Arabian Gulf countries started to implement their own schemes, using LEED as a guidance during the development process. For example, the Abu Dhabi Urban Planning Council (UPC) – in the United Arab Emirates – granted Estidama Excellence Awards to 12 major development projects in the Emirates, using the LEED scheme. The UPC is currently enhancing the review process to make it easier, faster and more effective for building environmental assessment and has been streamlining development review by clarifying review responsibilities for each agency. This has been done by creating clear, unified development regulations, implementing a web-based application, circulation and tracking system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1420326X11413477">12</xref>].</p>
<p>Likewise, the QSAS was developed by BQDRI in collaboration with T.C. Chan Centre at the University of Pennsylvania. QSAS aimed to encourage development of sustainable urban environment to reduce environmental impacts, while satisfying local community needs, in addition to addressing all locally relevant aspects of sustainability, ecological impact, and green building design criteria. QSAS also heavily relied on the LEED variables and methodology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1420326X11413477">13</xref>].</p>
<p>While the Saudi Green Building Council (SGBC) is promoting and facilitating the green building practice in the country through raising the public awareness, providing training and education and helping the construction industry to transform to the green building requirements. This would encourage building materials manufacturers and suppliers to produce and supply environmentally responsible products and promote green labelling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1420326X11413477">14</xref>].</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1420326X11413477"><title>Why LEED?</title>
<p>All previous schemes (LEED, BREEAM, and BRANZ) share common characteristics. All of the aforementioned schemes drive the market to improve building design. Early involvement of the assessor or accredited professionals (AP), at the design stage, is beneficial to the project and the final rating. The judging criteria of all schemes should keep pace with legislative developments and current best practice of the local country.</p>
<p>The advantage of applying LEED to the Qatari environment is that it allows for a process of accreditation without the presence of intensive local training in the GBA scheme. The LEED system is flexible because points toward LEED certification can be gained if the building design team is previously trained in LEED criteria. If it is not; which could be the case in a local Qatari market, an AP can be used. The role of the AP is to help gather the evidence and advise the client. The evidence is then submitted to the USGBC, which does the assessment and issues the certificate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1420326X11413477">15</xref>]. As previously discussed, LEED isan accepted and currently being used system in the Arabian Gulf, in general, and Qatar, in a specific way.</p>
<p>Furthermore, unlike BRANZ and BREEAM, which are mostly known for their excellence in the green home scheme, LEED mostly focuses on commercial, specifically tall buildings.</p>
<p>This study has selected LEED as the major green assessment scheme to be studied for developing the green metric mechanism for tall buildings in Qatar due to its flexibility, internationally renown, familiarity of the Gulf area in terms of specifications and its expertise in tall building criteria and urban development.</p>

<p>As a method of rating the environmental and economic performance of buildings, the LEED rating system along with the possible credit points for the considered green variables is shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1420326X11413477">Table 1</xref> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1420326X11413477">16</xref>].

<p>Further, the LEED rating system has four certification levels, as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1420326X11413477">Table 2</xref>. Owners and developers have come to expect (and in some cases demand), a certain level of green building rating for their facilities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1420326X11413477">17</xref>].
<table-wrap id="table2-1420326X11413477" position="float"><label>Table 2.</label><caption><p>LEED certification levels (National trends and prospects for high performance green buildings 2002)</p></caption>

</table-wrap>
</p>
<p>Of these two features, the considered variables only (not the certification levels) are considered in this study. The major focus of this study is to assess the applicability of the weight of different LEED variables that affect the green performance of tall buildings in Qatar – to develop the knowledge base required for the implementation of Qatar's green metric mechanism for evaluating tall buildings. According to LEED, the variables that are used to measure the green performance for buildings are sustainable site, water efficiency, energy and atmosphere, materials and resources, indoor environmental quality, and innovation and design. The variables are given a specific weight in the point system, demonstrated in percentages, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1420326X11413477">Figure 1</xref>.
<fig id="fig1-1420326X11413477" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>The percentage of credits that is to be given for each green variable in LEED [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1420326X11413477">16</xref>].</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1420326X11413477-fig1.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The discussion of each of the variables and how they can be related to Qatar is analysed as follows:</p>
<sec id="sec6-1420326X11413477"><title>Sustainable Site</title>
<p>According to the LEED rating system, the assessment of site sustainability is weighed as 14 points (20% of the total points “69 points”) and mainly depends on preserving the ecosystem areas and the type of transportation. In the case of Qatar, the ecosystem areas are distributed to contain about 69% sparse or barren areas, 26% suburb areas and 0.7 urban areas, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1420326X11413477">Figure 2</xref> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1420326X11413477">18</xref>].
<fig id="fig2-1420326X11413477" position="float"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Ecosystem areas by type in Qatar.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1420326X11413477-fig2.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>It is critical that this large mass of sparse and barren area, which is in fact a fragile desert ecosystem, be preserved and sustained as development is pursued and if tall buildings are developed in these areas. Currently, a significantly higher percentage of suburban areas is available compared to urban areas, and it can be expected that the frequency of tall buildings will increase in this suburban landscape. Therefore, it is also important that the social and environmental concerns of the suburbs are addressed to meet tall building construction.</p>
<p>As previously noted, LEED also considers transportation networks under the sustainable site variable. The major focus of transportation research is to reduce environmental and other problems caused by motor vehicles. Traffic congestion, accidents, air pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, noise and dependence on a volatile world oil market are all examples of social costs created by cars on the roads. Currently, the Qatar transportation network is highly dependent on private vehicles (378 motor vehicles per 100 persons) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1420326X11413477">19</xref>], though new transport networks are under construction. The government of Qatar is planning to encourage other methods of transportation like railways and bicycle lanes that are to be functional within 20 years and to further develop new public transport systems. Furthermore, considerations such as access to public transport and parking for tall buildings may be highly problematic in Qatar if current transport problems are not addressed in a timely manner. Therefore, these factors need to be kept in mind assessing the weight of transportation networks as a sub-variable.</p>
<p>Considering the previous points; given Qatar's particular circumstances in relationship to large suburban areas – a vast undeveloped and fragile desert ecosystem and a virtually non-developed public transport system – more weight should be given during the implementation and development of the Qatar green metric for tall buildings to consider the variable of sustainable site. Particular attention should be paid to site selection, urban redevelopment, suburban development, preservation of desert ecosystems and alternative transportation. For this reason, a higher percentage than 20% should be allocated for sustainable sites in Qatar's green metric system.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-1420326X11413477"><title>Water Efficiency</title>
<p>According to the LEED rating system, the assessment of water efficiency is five points (7% points of the total points 69 points). According to a recent report from “Population Action Plan,” the per capita annual share of a Qatari citizen of renewable fresh water resources has dropped from 1429 m<sup>3</sup> in 1955 to 103 m<sup>3</sup> in 1990 and could drop to as little as 59 m<sup>3</sup> in 2025 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1420326X11413477">20</xref>]. For this reason, water conservation in Qatar's desert climate is a priority, and the importance for accelerating water conservation and reuse efforts is obvious. Water desalination is necessary in Qatar to provide for the needs of the population; however, this requires significant amounts of fossil fuel or waste energy to produce and this in turn contributes to increasing levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Finally, there is also a need to find solutions to the large build up of mineralised salt generated during this process. Therefore, reducing overall water use and reusing potable water will provide a double benefit to the region. For this reason, the weight of water efficiency in dry countries, like Qatar, should be given higher consideration to achieve the following aims:
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>To ensure the project is meeting the minimum performance requirements for total water use reduction.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>To prevent water leaks and waste from building water systems and enable effective management of outdoor water uses.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>To enable the project team to make informed decisions about the options, implications and benefits of various water supply and conservation strategies.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>To reduce potable water consumption for interior and exterior uses through efficient building design, building systems, landscaping and substitution with reclaimed water.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>To minimise potable water use and select the most greenhouse-efficient water, wastewater and reclaimed water treatment systems, thereby reducing the energy use and greenhouse gas emissions associated with the production, treatment, storage and transport of water.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>To encourage building managers and designers to monitor, collect and report detailed information on water consumption models and actual usage to a central database.</p></list-item>
</list>
</p>
<p>Accordingly, the percentage of 7% for the water efficiency variable of the total points in LEED should be increased to meet Qatar's situation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-1420326X11413477"><title>Energy and Atmosphere</title>
<p>According to the LEED rating system, the assessment of the energy consumption and conservation is to have 17 points (25% of the total points of LEED 69 points). Energy and atmosphere are the highest variable weight in LEED related to other variables. Consumption of energy in Qatar is increasing year after year, and the oil and natural gas are the major sources of energy consumed, while the other renewable sources are not available, see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1420326X11413477">Table 3</xref>.

<p>Furthermore, in addition to the absence of other forms of energy, the consumption of natural gas in Qatar is steadily increasing, with the usage in 2004 rising from about 400 barrels a day to close to 600 barrels a day in 2008, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1420326X11413477">Figure 3</xref> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1420326X11413477">21</xref>].

<p>Qatar depends heavily on natural gas to meet more than 50% of its energy requirements: the share of natural gas in total energy consumption in 2008 was 87.2% in Qatar [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1420326X11413477">21</xref>].</p>
<p>Although Qatar has abundant oil reserves, its leaders recognise that fossil fuels are a finite resource that should be conserved to the greatest extent practicable. To achieve this vision, the country should embrace renewable energy sources in anticipation of a time when fossil fuel fed energy systems are no longer an option. Currently, research is in process in Qatar to assess the viability of solar energy, accordingly, with the high use of fossil fuels in Qatar and the absence of other sources of energy, it is highly recommended that a higher weight be given in Qatar green tall building rating system to the energy and atmosphere variable than the weight of 27% currently assigned by LEED. Such an adjustment would help

<sec id="sec9-1420326X11413477"><title>Materials and Resources</title>
<p>According to the LEED rating system, the assessment of the materials and resources are weighed by 13 points (19% of the total points).</p>
<p>It is known that green products and materials have inherent environmental advantages in terms of lower upstream or downstream impacts; accordingly, it is important to encourage green materials and resources early in the design process. Green building materials and resources are considered as products that avoid toxic or other emissions, save energy or water, reduce heating and cooling loads, and contribute to a safe, healthy built environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1420326X11413477">22</xref>]. In Qatar, the major construction materials are steel and concrete, and the examples of finishing materials are glass and aluminium.</p>
<p>Generally, most construction materials need to be imported to Qatar, however, those that can be sourced within the state have become subject to various statutory constraints. Aggregates, which historically could be sourced in Qatar, have become an expensive commodity due to the quarrying ban introduced in 2005. Imports through Mesaieed Port, which in itself has struggled with the increased capacity of imported materials, have been severely affected by shut downs from sources of aggregates, an example of which occurred in the Northern Emirates in March 2008. In respect of sand, Qatar Sand Plant is the only producer of treated sand in Qatar, and its distribution has been restricted due to supply and demand problems and by the necessity to produce building permits and authorisation letters before the supplies are released to contractors. In respect of steel, which has to be imported, costs of rebar, in particular, have increased across the GCC by 50% in 2007. It has been calculated that the GCC could face an annual shortfall of 5.2 million tons of steel products by 2010 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1420326X11413477">23</xref>].</p>
<p>There are no recycling facilities available in the country for these materials. Though commonly produced by-products of the oil and gas industry include materials that are used in construction and finishing, these are not manufactured locally; even though Qatar has a huge oil and gas industry. Instead, raw materials are exported for international usage.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in Qatar about 32% of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions result from the manufacturing and construction sector, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1420326X11413477">Figure 4</xref> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1420326X11413477">24</xref>].
<fig id="fig4-1420326X11413477" position="float"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>The previous chart shows the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by sector in Qatar by 1999 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1420326X11413477">24</xref>].</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1420326X11413477-fig4.tif"/></fig>
</p>
<p>It is important to reduce the amount of emissions by waste management related to this sector. This can be achieved by reduction, reuse and recycling of building materials and resources that are employed in building industry.</p>
<p>For Qatar, if green materials and resources are considered in connection with the other green variables, considerable weight should be assigned to this criterion, given the challenge of using green materials, local products and recycling. However, the variables of water efficiency and energy, both resources in Qatar have been increased already in the previous sections in comparison to the LEED scheme. Therefore, the value of 18 points of the total 69, or 19% of the total possible LEED points, is a reasonable weight for this variable for developing the green metric of tall buildings in Qatar.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec10-1420326X11413477"><title>Indoor Environmental Quality</title>
<p>According to the LEED rating system, the assessment of the indoor environmental quality is 22% of other variables (15 points of 69 points). The aim of this variable is to establish minimum indoor air quality (IAQ) performance to prevent the development of IAQ problems in buildings and maintain the health and wellbeing of the occupants. This variable could be considered by designing the HVAC system to meet the ventilation requirements of the reference standard, identifying potential IAQ problems on the site and locating air intakes away from contaminant sources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1420326X11413477">22</xref>]. Indoor environmental quality could also contribute to enhancing the energy efficiency of the building envelope.</p>
<p>Reducing operational energy use, as well as reducing condensation related moisture issues, design, construction and material selection strategies, would contribute to enhancing both indoor and outdoor air quality. As already discussed earlier, energy efficiency has been assigned a greater weight in the Qatar metric, and the variable of materials and resources has been kept the same as in the LEED scheme at a high rating of 19%. If the energy efficiency is met to a higher standard in the Qatari scheme and green materials that reduce the usage of air conditioning systems are employed, then this variable can be assigned less weight that it currently holds in the LEED scheme.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec11-1420326X11413477"><title>Innovation and Design Process</title>
<p>In LEED, the innovation and design process is evaluated to have five points of the total points (7% percentage weight). This variable is divided into two subareas:</p>
<p><italic>Innovation in Design (One to Four Credits)</italic>: This credit is set to provide the design teams and projects the opportunity to be awarded points for exceptional performance above requirements set by the LEED green building rating system and/or innovative performance, in green building categories, not specifically addressed by the LEED green building rating system. Thus, it allows for the gaining of a specified rank of credits, if the building substantially exceeds a LEED performance credit, such as energy performance or water efficiency. Other variables which gain these credits that are not covered by LEED include acoustic performance, education of occupants, community development or life cycle analysis of material choices.</p>
<p><italic>LEED AP (One Credit)</italic>: This credit is set to support and encourage the design integration required by a LEED green building project and to streamline the application and certification process. This credit is gained if at least one principal participant of the project team has successfully completed the LEED AP.</p>
<p>While the innovation and design process criteria are important for Qatar, it should not take priority over issues of energy and water efficiency, as this paper has argued. While Qatar is attempting to attract foreign investment in the innovativeness of the design of its tall buildings, it must also focus on the basic criteria of sustainable buildings in this desert environment; sustainability, energy use and water efficiency, the three variables increased in weight in this study, when compared with the LEED scheme. This is not to underestimate the importance of innovation in design but to prioritise the criteria for Qatar at this stage in its development process such as culture, climate and various environmental conditions which exist in the region. These aspects aim at preserving the architectural identity of Qatar and the region and enhancing the creative solutions to address other challenges. In regard to the AP credits that gain weight in LEED, Qatar has already started to take similar steps by encouraging contractors, designers and government institutions to promote awareness of the need of such green building initiatives. For these reasons, in the Qatari scheme suggested here, this variable might be assigned less weight than in the LEED scheme.</p>
<p>According to the previous analysis, the hypothesis of weighing green variables for tall buildings in Qatar can be drawn by fixing the total points of LEED green building system (69 points) as a stable measurement, while re-evaluating the different weight assigned to each of the LEED variables, to meet Qatar's specific conditions. The changes in weight for the developed Qatari rating system for each variable compared with LEED are represented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1420326X11413477">Table 4</xref>.

<sec id="sec12-1420326X11413477"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Green architecture is defined as the method in which the building design takes advantage of using resources in an efficient way. Green development concepts (applied to the design, construction, and operation of buildings) can enhance both the economic wellbeing and environmental health of communities. These enhancements are achieved by meeting the resource requirements such as energy, water and materials. Green architecture also emphasises reducing the impacts of buildings on the environment and human health during the building's life cycle.</p>
<p>This paper briefly reviewed various GBA schemes such as BRANZ and BREEAM and selected LEED as the main reference for establishment green metric for Doha's tall buildings.</p>
<p>Theoretical studies about Qatar (including information about the country's natural resources, industries, future view and the steps that the country is planning to achieve a greener environment) were conducted as a main tool for understanding and establishing the Qatari green system.</p>
<p>The acquired knowledge related to the state of Qatar in particular was compared in relevance to the LEED criteria and recommendations were made regarding adaption to the LEED scheme to develop a GBA for tall buildings in Qatar. Accordingly it is concluded that the LEED GBA is not, as is, an accurate evaluation for tall buildings in Qatar, and it is important to implement a green tall building sustainability assessment tool that applies specifically to Qatar. This tool should take account of the existing legislation in Qatar, besides the region's social, economic, environmental and cultural conditions that are different from other parts of the world. Issues such as desertification, scarcity of water and cultural identity have to be considered in a manner relevant to Qatar and the region. Consideration should be levied to reassigning weight to the various LEED variables by increasing sustainable site, water efficiency and energy atmosphere, maintaining the weight for material and resources and reducing the weight for IAQ, and innovation and design process.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec13-1420326X11413477"><title>Recommendations for Future Work</title>
<p>Following the acquisition of the previous theoretical knowledge, it is important to test this hypothesis by conducting the case studies at Qatar. This paper argues that due to Qatar's natural environment and resources, a new point system, adapted from LEED, should be developed for Qatar. Special consideration should be given to the availability of materials, the significance of the indoor thermal comfort, the value of the reservation and the site impact, the energy consumption in relation to resources and water management. This hypothesis requires further consultation with various experts in the field of green architecture in Qatar, as well as selected local case studies, to evaluate the basis of the hypothesis for changing the weight of the variable from the LEED scheme and deciding upon the percentages to which these weights should be modified.</p>
<p>The outcome of this paper is considered as significant for more in-depth study of green architecture development in the state of Qatar. The most important of these is the development of a Qatari metric, which adapts the weight of the LEED variable to local conditions, based upon local case studies. It is important that a central government authority develops criteria for the evaluation of Doha's tall buildings. The Qatari government should enhance and encourage the green criteria for tall buildings by balancing the need for attracting economic investment with the need of sustaining and preserving its natural environment.</p>
