<p>As the importance and thus the demand for Modeling and Simulation (M&amp;S) technologies started to increase in Turkey, Turkish Armed Forces (TAF) and the Undersecretariat for Defence Industries initiated various kinds of research collaborations with some prominent universities in Turkey eleven years ago. One of the results of this initiative is MODSIMMER, which is an M&amp;S Research and Development Center established at the Middle East Technical University. Besides carrying out defence research on M&amp;S, MODSIMMER organizes national and international conferences, symposia and seminars to disseminate the knowledge created in this area.</p>
<p>The most important arena for dissemination is the biannual national M&amp;S conference, called the USMOS. It is the only conference in the defence M&amp;S area in Turkey, which is organized by METU-TAF-MODSIMMER, with the support of the Ministry of Defence, General Staff and Undersecretariat for the Defence Industry; and with the cooperation of the Defence Sciences Institute of the Military Academy, the Naval Science and Engineering Institute of the Naval Academy, and the Aeronautics and Space Technologies Institute of the Air Force Academy. The basic and applied research on M&amp;S that is performed by the Turkish Air Force, academia, civilian and military and research agencies has created a proper environment to disseminate the results of the technology and the system development projects in Turkey.</p>
<p>This special issue contains five of the best papers from this USMOS Conference:</p>
<p><italic>Sim-PETEK: A Parallel Simulation Execution Framework for Grid Environments by Doruk Bozağaç, Gülşah Karaduman, Ahmet Kara and M Nedim Alpdemir</italic>
</p>
<p><italic>Simulations on concrete penetration of shaped charge by M Sarper Yavuz and R Orhan Yildirim</italic>
</p>
<p><italic>Investigation of rain erosion on a brittle material by means of numerical simulation by H Anıl Salman and R Orhan Yıldırım</italic>
</p>
<p><italic>Modeling and simulation of a small-sized Tiltrotor UAV by Ferit Çakıcı and M Kemal Leblebicioğlu</italic>
