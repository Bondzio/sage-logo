<abstract>
<p>There is widespread acknowledgement that the vocational education system in Britain needs to be much more effective. Its attractiveness and quality impacts on business, young people and communities alike. Many attempts have been made at reform, with a continuously changing institutional and funding landscape being one of the major consequences. The latest of the reforms is the Wolf Review, which concludes that vocational education is failing thousands of young people because it is not leading to university or a job. Despite being wide ranging in its scope, with some positive proposals, the proposed improvements to vocational education will generate mixed results unless other real challenges, such as the focus on quantity rather than quality, a voluntary approach to skills investment by employers and competition based largely on price, are tackled.</p>

<body>
<p>Vocational education is once again in the docks. According to the latest policy review, commissioned by Michael Gove, Secretary of State for Education at the Department for Education, and undertaken by Professor Alison Wolf, vocational education is failing thousands of young people because it is not leading to university or a job. Whilst acknowledging the provision of some excellent vocational education in England, Wolf argues that this is <italic>despite</italic> the system rather than due to its design.</p>
<p>A broad definition of vocational education can be described as ‘any form of activity and experience leading to understandings or skills relevant to work’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269094211434467">Stasz et al., 2004</xref>), and covers education-based and work-based learning routes. This form of practical and technical learning has always been prone to excessive government intervention and perennial changes compared to universities and gold standard ‘A’ levels, where the middle-classes hold much greater sway.</p>
<p>However, it would be wrong to assume that once upon a time Britain’s rich industrial past supported high quality vocational education. This is how the system was described at advent of the 20th century (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269094211434467">Webb and Webb, 1897</xref>): ‘Undemocratic in its scope, unscientific in its educational methods, and fundamentally unsound in its financial aspects, the apprenticeship system, in spite of all the practical arguments in its favour, is not likely to be deliberatively revived by modern democracy’. Vocational routes offered 30 to 40 years ago, however, were seen as offering better prospects than is certainly the case now.</p>
<p>The Wolf Review, published in March 2011 and covering England, comes at a time of an urgent need to boost Britain’s productivity, raising of the participation age (RPA) and growing unemployment amongst young people. To the lay observer, this review may appear as another in the line of attempts to tackle the long-running challenge of developing high quality vocational education, littered with good intentions but poor outcomes.</p>
<p>It is interesting to note at the outset that this was a review of vocational education for 14 to 19 year olds, not a review of vocational education per se <italic>–</italic> but some of the issues it raises cut across the whole of the system. What is to be read into the absence of the Department of Business, Innovation and Skills at the table, which after all is not only responsible for adult vocational education but is also the architect of the complex vocation system in England? It was also not a review of <italic>all</italic> 14 to 19 provision, with ‘A’ levels and Diplomas outside the scope of the review.</p>
<p>The Labour Government had commissioned its own much broader review of 14 to 19 qualifications in 2004, covering both academic and vocational qualifications. David Tomlinson then recommended the introduction of a general Diploma to help integrate rather than separate these two routes, creating a common standard. This idea was dropped by the Labour Government, which preferred to maintain ‘A’ levels and introduce a number of lines of Diploma. Furthermore, with ‘A’ levels as the primary route to university, the drive to get 50% of 18 to 30 year olds into university did not particularly aid the vocational cause – with the overtly complex Diploma failing to secure the level of momentum needed to raise the status of vocational education.</p>
<p>A large number of young people depend on the quality of vocational education for their future success:<disp-quote>
<p>Most 14 to 16 year olds take some form of ‘vocational’ qualification, and some follow a programme in which GCSEs play quite a small part. Post-GCSE, about a third take only ‘A’ levels, the conventional ‘academic’ route. In other words, <italic>two-thirds do not</italic> – and almost all of these young people spend all or some of the years from 16 to 19 on courses which are partly or wholly ‘vocational’. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269094211434467">Wolf, 2011</xref>: 20)</p></disp-quote>Not surprisingly, the debate about ‘parity of esteem’ between ‘academic’ and ‘vocational’ qualifications is often at the heart of any debate but is largely a misguided issue. There is no particular rationale why high quality vocational education needs to be benchmarked <italic>against</italic> academic education – they are simply different forms of learning and the quality and standard of vocational education should be of no less concern than that of academic education.</p>
<sec id="sec1-0269094211434467"><title>Gold standard vocational education</title>
<p>So, as the belief in the promise of education begins to lose some of its shine in the current climate of high youth unemployment and expensive university education, can the <italic>Wolf Review</italic> deliver where previous strategies have floundered? In part the vocational system has partly been a victim of exaggerated claims about the advent of the knowledge economy, with universities and schools receiving preferential treatment. The other story of the last two to three decades has been the growth of the service economy, with many people employed, not only in traditional physical and technical jobs, but in service jobs in diverse sectors such as health care and leisure.</p>
<p>But its real problem has always been around its dual purpose. Compared to some of its European counterparts, Britain’s educational system remains much more unequal. This creates its own specific challenges post-14 and for vocational education policy. Successive governments have seen it as a solution to two very different problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269094211434467">Hodgson and Spours, 2008</xref>). Primarily it has been to use this area of education and training as a means of dealing with disaffection and as a second-chance route. However, for many young people wage returns on low level vocational qualifications continue to be poor. The subordinate aim has been to promote high quality vocational education, with extensive employer ownership and leadership.</p>
<p>Interestingly, emerging evidence is also showing that both academic and vocational education require ‘brain-power’, with the superiority of one form of learning over the other increasingly being challenged by new research into neuroscience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269094211434467">Claxton et al., 2010</xref>). Contrast this with the view of Michael Gove MP, claiming that too many young people were being channelled into ‘easy’ vocational subjects by schools eager to boost their position in the league table – the benchmark again being academic qualifications rather than evidence about inherently weak vocational qualifications. He wants to see ‘core subjects’ being placed back at the heart of the curriculum, with one of his first policy measures being the introduction of the English Baccalaureate. Critics argue that the Ebacc is unduly restrictive and a technical Baccalaureate should be championed and offered alongside.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec2-0269094211434467"><title>The real challenges</title>
<p>There is growing recognition that vocational education is an important part of the solution to industrial competitiveness, sector diversification, development of technical skills and social mobility. Apprenticeships, University Technical Colleges and Foundation Degrees reflect in various ways attempts to reform parts of the vocational education system.</p>
<p>Apprenticeships have been even touted as <italic>the</italic> silver bullet in education, from tackling the NEET (not in education, employment and training) problem to creating a highly skilled technical class and offering an alternative pathway to university. Growing to well over 400,000 apprentices on 200 Apprenticeship programmes in 2010/2011, it has been one of the few programmes to receive additional investment at a time of austerity. By definition, one can only be an apprentice under the programme if employed. With a lack of jobs, the impact of the programme on tackling unemployment could well be limited and result in significant deadweight, an issue which undermined the Train to Gain scheme.</p>
<p>The dash for growth, not untypical in how new programmes are often scaled up, is sacrificing quality for quantity. The Apprenticeship programme success rate at 75% is much better than a few years ago, but with some questionable programmes. Frameworks are shorter, narrower, less academically rigorous, very employer influenced and with low expectations in some sectors. The Government also has a huge mountain to climb if it wants to create a large-scale 16 to 18 apprenticeship system in the context of RPA. Whilst one-third of all 16 to 18 year olds participate in AS/A levels, (640,000), a meagre 1.5% (30,000) undertake Level 3 apprenticeships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269094211434467">LSN, 2011</xref>). Removing bureaucracy and making it easier to offer apprenticeships will help but is unlikely to deliver youth apprenticeships. Not surprisingly, the last Autumn Statement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269094211434467">HM Treasury, 2011a</xref>) announced that small firms would be offered 40,000 incentive payments to take on young apprentices.</p>
<p>The debate about vocational education is critically important not only in its own terms but also because it is linked to an equally important but parallel debate about industrial strategy and growth. Robust economic development depends on bringing together issues of education and skills, infrastructure and business development with the need for long-term local strategies for economic diversification, specialisation and cluster development. The Government’s Plan for Growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269094211434467">HM Treasury, 2011b</xref>), published in March 2011 (before the Wolf Review) missed the opportunity to align the strategy with skills. It is highly fragmented in the relationship between the sectoral components of the plan and vocational education. Some sectors such as advanced manufacturing are explicit about the links and skills investment objectives, with the plans for other sectors failing to make any systematic connection with skills.</p>
<p>Such linkages, and indeed the vocational system as a whole, cannot be entirely driven top-down from a national level. Wolf regards the whole system centrally regulated by Ofqual and Sector Skills Councils, which respectively approve qualifications and determine their eligibility for public funding, as unfit for purpose. The resulting accountability has been upwards rather than to learners, employers and local communities. Under her proposed model the key relations should be between regulated (i.e. recognised) Awarding Bodies, employers and schools and colleges. Employers would be the key arbiters of quality rather than Ofqual and the model would help recreate and strengthen a genuine relationship between vocational education and the labour market.</p>
<p>This idea needs to be welcomed and policy changes are already moving in that direction but two challenges are apparent. First, as the experience of apprenticeships is showing, employers are not always the best arbiters of quality, particularly in terms of determining learning outcomes. Second, employer ownership continues to be a major challenge for the vocational education system. New Employer Ownership pilots have been announced in the Autumn Statement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269094211434467">HM Treasury, 2011a</xref>), with an initial investment of £250 m. These will effectively put the design, development and purchasing of vocational programmes in the hands of employers but the evidence that such an approach will influence employer behaviour to any great extent beyond the material gains is weak. There is a concern that employer networks and clusters are highly variable in terms of their make-up, some lacking capacity for strategic skills development, or could be prone to vested interests, a perennial issue in economic development policy.</p>
<p>Vocational education also needs to offer much better progression. For those aged 18, it needs to provide an opportunity to study <italic>at degree level</italic> in a centre of vocational excellence endorsed by an employer or study <italic>for</italic> a degree. Higher apprenticeships, for example, have been piloted with great success in aeronautical engineering. In a highly competitive environment for university places and with much higher student fees, it remains to be seen how those with vocational qualifications and apprenticeships will fare in the high entry stakes.</p>
<p>It is a truism that high quality practical and technical education has always been a challenge in England with its flexible labour market and voluntary approach to employer investment in skills. Since the publication of the Wolf Review, external events have forced the creation of yet another set of new policy initiatives which will demand the support and engagement of employers in short-term initiatives.</p>
<p>Creating high quality vocational education that inspires young people and supports progression for those who want it is now tougher than ever before as the gap between need and investment going in to meet that widens. There are many factors that drive quality beside the qualifications themselves. Pressure on the system to drive down unit costs or compete only on the basis of price rather than quality is a real issue. As we look enviously to other European countries such as Germany we need to regard the Wolf Review at best as a partial attempt at reform. It has put the issue of quality of vocational education on the agenda and challenged the value of some qualifications being offer to young people. Strategic issues, ranging from the how employer responsibility and accountability could be enhanced to moving apprenticeships ‘upmarket’ and investing in teacher training, now need much greater attention.</p></sec>
