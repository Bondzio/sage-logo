<abstract>
<p>Leading wool suppliers such as Australia began marketing organic wool to counter a decades-long decline in the world wool market. Given the challenge of adopting certified organic practices for wool production in certain parts of the world including the United States, consumer demand for organic wool products relative to alternative production attributes is assessed to explore the feasibility of certifying these attributes. An Internet survey found that most US consumers preferred wool to acrylic; distinguished wool products by origin; valued organic certification less than combined environmental sustainability and animal welfare claims; and lowered their valuation for wool products in response to the information provided on wool attributes.

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The livestock sector has been noted for its large input to our environmental problems, mostly attributed to the growth in intensive, industrialized production of pigs and poultry, and a decline in extensive production of cattle, sheep, and goats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0887302X12446064">Steinfeld et al., 2006</xref>). Large confined livestock operations, in particular, contribute to concentrated emissions of greenhouse gas and water pollutants through animal waste and chemical seepage. However, browsing animals, such as sheep and goats, have been noted for their potentially positive contributions to the environment, besides their convenience in increasing, small-scale or hobby farming. Their incorporation enables sustainable means of weed management in farming, pastoral, or forestry operations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0887302X12446064">Longwell, Miller, &amp; Schreiweis, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Sustainable practices in agriculture would only be adopted if they are economically viable for farmers. A contribution to the financial value of incorporating browsing animals is market revenue of wool. Unfortunately, the wool market has been experiencing a worldwide decline during the recent decades. For example, in the United States, total use of wool in 2006 equaled approximately a third of its level in the early 1990s (U.S. Department of Agriculture Economic Research Service [USDA ERS], <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0887302X12446064">2007</xref>). The real price of wool has declined by 55% in 2010 since its recent peak in 1988.</p>
<p>The value of sustainable agricultural products is critically dependent on consumer awareness and perception. Indeed, approximately a quarter of consumers around the world have been identified as part of a growing segment of the consumers who are interested in “lifestyles of health and sustainability” (LOHAS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0887302X12446064">Harding, 2010</xref>). The market power of these consumers has been evident in the dramatic growth of the organic food industry, which grew by 12.4% in 2010 to reach a global value of nearly US$60 million, with a forecast growth of 48% to US$88 million by 2015 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0887302X12446064">Datamonitor, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Some in the fiber industry have been able to take advantage of the LOHAS trend. Sales of environmentally friendly or organic fiber products have grown by at least 30% over the past few years in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0887302X12446064">Marks, 2007</xref>). The Australian wool industry, the world’s leading producer of wool, has made gains in marketing organic products to LOHAS consumers, generating 10–15% premium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0887302X12446064">Australian Broadcasting Corporation, 2005</xref>). The U.S. organic cotton producers also have formed marketing cooperatives to successfully take advantage of the trend.</p>
<p>Yet, the response of other fiber producers to this new opportunity has been slow, particularly among U.S. wool producers. One challenge, as reported by animal fiber producers, is a much greater obstacle than cotton producers in becoming certified organic wool fiber producers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0887302X12446064">Druchunas, 2002</xref>). Specifically, the USDA’s ban on exposing organic-certified animals to synthetic chemicals beginning in the last third of their gestation poses difficulty, because sheep are particularly vulnerable to parasitic infections during pregnancy. The U.S. National Organic Program requires sick animals to be treated and removed from the organic herd, since not treating infected animals breaches animal welfare. Therefore, the cost of entering the organic market will remain prohibitively high for wool producers in many regions of the world, including the United States, without an effective organic means of treating parasites.</p>
<p>Another rising concern of socially discerning consumers is animal welfare, where the Australian wool industry has faced some setbacks in the recent years surrounding their practice of mulesing (removing a large area of skin around the posterior to discourage fly infestation). A campaign against their wool was initiated by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals in protest (PETA, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0887302X12446064">2007</xref>), while the U.S. National Retail Federation has requested that the mulesing status (e.g., nonmulesed, mulesed with pain relief, mulesed) be labeled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0887302X12446064">Ockenden, 2010</xref>). The Australian industry is yet to address these concerns, and such damage to the reputation of Australian wool in terms of animal welfare may present marketing opportunities for producers in other regions, such as the United States, where these practices are not common. Besides concerns over the health and welfare of the sheep, ranchers in the United States have recently formed a group to certify producers that work to protect rather than eliminate what they call “keystone species” of wildlife, including coyotes, bears, and mountain lions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0887302X12446064">Predator Friendly, 2011</xref>). Predator-friendly ranching operations reduce interaction between predators and sheep by adopting practices, such as the careful timing and location of lambing in protected pastures and use of guard animals. Llamas, donkeys, and dogs are examples of guard animals that will alert the herd to an intruder and deter predation.</p>
<p>These claims conveyed by labels, which cannot always be evaluated easily by consumers, are called credence attributes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0887302X12446064">Darby &amp; Karni, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0887302X12446064">Nelson, 1970</xref>). Researchers have conducted consumers’ willingness-to-pay  (WTP) studies to find that food consumers place value on credence attributes besides organic practices, such as origin (local or geographical brand) and other production/processing features, as they relate to health, environment, and social issues. The evidence is less certain on whether such behavior applies to consumption of fiber products. For apparel, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) mandates labeling of the country where the item was manufactured but not the origin of fiber. Further, animal welfare is an attribute unique to animal-based products, and the context of animal fiber production is distinct from meat production.</p>
<p>Operations that incorporate browsing animals need not to be certified organic. Assessing consumer demand for these organic-alternative production attributes, such as lower environmental impact and animal welfare, will help producers’ decision to adopt the use of browsing animals as another sustainable production practice. Similarly, an assessment of demand for fiber originating from specific countries will provide insight on how consumers form country images associated with value-based fiber production practices and what role their preferences toward locally sourced products play in the animal fiber market.</p>
<p>Consequently, the objectives of the article were threefold (1) to analyze the U.S. demand for organic certification of wool products relative to other sustainability-related labels, namely environment-related certification, country of origin (COO), and animal-focused claims; (2) to identify socioeconomic and psychographic characteristics of individuals that share similar preferences for these labeled attributes; and (3) to examine how their valuation of these labeled attributes is affected by providing objective statements about the attributes. To meet these ends, a survey was designed with and without information regarding wool attributes to collect choice experiment (CE) responses from U.S. consumers. The responses were used to estimate a random parameter logit (RPL) model to obtain the WTP values for the attributes by individuals and by the amount of information presented.</p>
<p>In the following section, the literature on product attributes, including consumer demand analysis for production attributes of wool and related products and the impacts of various factors on WTP, is briefly reviewed to provide theoretical background for this study. Following a discussion on the CE approach, the details on the survey instrument are presented. The results section first discusses the data characteristics, and then the estimation results are presented and discussed. In conclusion, we discuss implications of our results pertaining to both policy makers and the marketing opportunities of sustainably produced wool products.</p>

<title>Related Literature</title>
<p>Consumers make their purchase decisions based on all types of product attributes. The categorization of attributes this and many other studies use is attributed to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0887302X12446064">Nelson (1970</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0887302X12446064">Darby and Karni (1973</xref>). Search attributes are observable attributes including price and brand, while experience attributes are those including taste and other sensory features. Credence attributes cannot always be verified easily by consumers, and their presence is conveyed by labels, which transform them into search attributes. Third-party certifications may provide assurance to consumers. Many different types of labels can be attached to any given product, including brands, health or environmental claims, origin, or production attributes such as those certified organic. Given the importance of labels in the marketplace, many consumer studies have attempted to estimate the values consumers place on labels based on the value theory of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0887302X12446064">Lancaster (1966</xref>), which purports to decompose utilities for goods into utilities derived from respective attributes.</p>
<p>The growth of the organic apparel market suggests that consumers are most likely willing to pay premium for products made with organically produced wool. Yet, few studies have been conducted on consumers’ WTP comparisons for organic or other sustainability claims of apparel products. A 2005 mail survey of U.S. consumers found that the organic fiber content attribute of t-shirts was salient to a sizeable segment (53%) of consumers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0887302X12446064">Hustvedt, 2006</xref>). A study that examined consumer interest in labeling alternative to organic labeling, found that consumers were most interested in purchasing products that met standards for humane treatment of animals, followed by local origin and a living wage. The findings suggested that organic standards are not meeting many consumer concerns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0887302X12446064">Howard &amp; Allen, 2006</xref>). Focus group research conducted with 47 female, self-proclaimed ethical consumers in the United States found that labor/workers rights, animal welfare concerns, and environmental sustainability were each mentioned more often than organic attributes, when participants were asked to list concerns related to wool purchases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0887302X12446064">Sneddon, Lee, &amp; Soutar, 2009</xref>). These environmental issues included the “distance it travels” and suggested local origin would have been of interest to the participants as well.</p>
<p>Studies of apparel consumers related to COO have concerned mainly on the FTC mandate for labeling the country in which the garment was manufactured, and its impact on economic opportunity and worker welfare in apparel production. Several studies, for example, have examined consumer response to the “Made in the USA” marketing campaigns of the 1980s designed to protect the jobs of U.S. garment workers. Studies such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0887302X12446064">Abraham-Murali and Littrell (1995</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0887302X12446064">Eckman, Damhorst, and Kadolph (1990</xref>) found that COO of apparel was far less important to apparel consumers than price, style, and quality attributes. Labeling for the origin of the fiber used in the apparel product is a different proposition. The FTC regulation allows for, but does not require, the modification of the fiber content information to include fiber origin (e.g., 60% Egyptian cotton). One study on consumer WTP for fiber origin labeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0887302X12446064">Hustvedt &amp; Bernard, 2008</xref>) found that some consumers residing in Texas were willing to pay approximately 10% more for cotton socks labeled as “made with Texas cotton” than a generic pair, but no significant premium associated with labeling for “made with U.S. cotton.” While their study also included credence attributes related to production, such as organic and genetically modified fiber, the study design did not explore the difference that information made on consumer WTP. A motivation behind preference for domestic fiber could be related to supporting domestic fiber producers, similar to the support for local farmers for food products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0887302X12446064">Morris &amp; Buller, 2003</xref>). COO could signal quality in cases of wool where Australian wool, known for their merino herds, often receives a higher price in the market than U.S. wool of comparable quality.</p>
<p>The WTP estimates can be impacted by various factors including sociodemographic and psychographic characteristics of consumers and additional information provided about the product under evaluation. Researchers have created psychographic measurements, such as perceptions and beliefs, pertinent to the context of their studies to measure their impacts on consumer preferences and WTP. For example, consumers who perceived the need for action concerning environmental issues and that their consumption can impact the environment had stronger preferences for ENERGY STAR labeled refrigerators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0887302X12446064">Ward, Clark, Jensen, Yen, &amp; Russell, 2011</xref>); WTP for enhanced health-promoting quality in a functional food depended on the perceptions consumers held regarding its scientific validity (Marette, Roosen, Blanchemanche, &amp; Feinblatt-Mélèz, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0887302X12446064">2010</xref>). Some studies generate psychographic measures from multiple items using factor analysis (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0887302X12446064">Ward et al., 2011</xref>), while other studies used a single item specified as a binary or a multipoint scale variable (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0887302X12446064">Marette et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0887302X12446064">Peterson &amp; Burbidge, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Many studies on the information effect have been conducted for innovations in food production with uncertain consequences on health, environment, and society, including genetic modification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0887302X12446064">Lusk, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0887302X12446064">Noussair, Robin, &amp; Ruffieux, 2002</xref>) and nanotechnology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0887302X12446064">Roosen, Bieberstein, Marette, Blanchmanche, &amp; Vandermoere, 2011</xref>). Such studies have also been useful in examining innovations in the context of food safety, such as irradiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0887302X12446064">Fox, Hayes, &amp; Shogren, 2002</xref>) and traceability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0887302X12446064">Lee, Han, Nayga, &amp; Lim, 2011</xref>), where there are positive aspects of the attribute (improvement in food safety) and negative aspects (potential health risks or higher cost of food). These studies provide certain pieces of information to subsets of their sample to measure the information effects and, in general, have found that positive information increased WTP if any, negative information decreased WTP, and the negative impacts outweighed positive impacts. Information treatment has also been used to identify the extent and content of consumer education needed for marketing efforts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0887302X12446064">Peterson &amp; Burbidge, 2012</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section3-0887302X12446064">
<title>Modeling Approach</title>
<p>Consumer demand theory provides the theoretical framework for this study. There are two primary ways to assess consumer demand: revealed and stated preference methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0887302X12446064">Louviere, Hensher, &amp; Swait, 2000</xref>). Revealed preference data are collected from actual monetary transactions, while stated preference data are collected from asking consumers how they might act in hypothetical opportunities to expend money. Revealed preference data analyses are useful when research questions can be addressed by retail scanner data or auction data with detailed product characteristics. For the purpose of the study, stated preference methods were used because most wool products are currently not sold with information on fiber attributes.</p>
<p>Among stated preference methods, we chose conjoint-based CE, given the study’s primary focus is to assess demand for attributes of wool products. Not only has it been useful to value environmental or public amenities (for example, Takatsuka Cullen, Wilson, &amp; Wratten, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0887302X12446064">2009</xref>), it is a well-established method in marketing and agricultural economics studies. In a CE, respondents are asked to choose from a set of alternatives with varying combinations of attributes. The CE is conceptually founded on the value theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0887302X12446064">Lancaster, 1966</xref>) and the random utility theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0887302X12446064">Thurstone, 1927</xref>), which assumes that the utility of individual comprises of a systematic component that is observable by researchers and a random, unobservable term.</p>
<p>Among several econometric models that have been developed for analyzing CE responses, RPL models allow for heterogeneous preferences with unrestricted substitution patterns and are also flexible enough to approximate any random utility model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0887302X12446064">McFadden &amp; Train, 2000</xref>). In similar applications, the systematic component of utility is typically specified as a function of product attributes. Specific distributions can be specified for the parameters that define this function, and their conditional means can be specified as functions of individual characteristics. RPL models are estimated using simulation, and parameters can be estimated for each respondent, based on choices they made and individual-specific variation in the error component (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0887302X12446064">Greene, 2007</xref>, N17–N37). Then, individual-specific WTP estimates for attributes can be computed from these individual-specific attribute parameters.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0887302X12446064">
<title>Survey Instrument</title>
<p>The survey method allows for a systematic collection of information from consumers nationwide about variables that are not easily observed including attitudes and intentions. While surveys can be vulnerable to some sources of bias, such as nonresponse or socially desirable responses, surveys are an accepted and popular method of obtaining descriptive data, and careful design of the survey instrument was sought to reduce these sources of bias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0887302X12446064">Dillman, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>The choice task in the survey asked respondents to select a pair of wool or acrylic gloves for purchase with a statement asking them to assume in their decision that the gloves were available in their favorite color and design. The option to opt out from wool products was set as acrylic, allowing assessment of consumer preferences for natural fiber over its major synthetic counterpart. The wool attributes were chosen for this study to explore how organic certification was valued relative to a combination of other sustainability claims that may be of concern to consumers.</p>
<p>Consequently, the study was designed with two levels of certification, two levels of COO, two levels of animal-focused claim, and three levels of price, resulting in a 2 × 2 × 2 × 3 study model. The two levels of certification attribute were organic and pro-environment (see the Appendix A for the definitions used in the study). While many consumers equate organic and pro-environment labeling, our definitions made it clear that organic labeling was regulated by the USDA and that pro-environment claims refer to “production and processing methods that may or may not be stringent than those of the organic standards.” The two levels for the COO attribute—United States and Australia—depending on whether wool came from sheep raised and shorn in the United States or Australia. All wool options were labeled with an animal-focused claim, either pro-animal or predator friendly. The pro-animal claim implied “wool that was shorn with care from sheep that were treated humanely, with respect for their physical and mental wellness,” and the predator-friendly label suggested that wool came “from sheep raised by producers who do not kill native predators on their land.” We assumed that animal welfare claims would be needed, since it is not currently nested within organic attributes but were unsure of which animal welfare message should be used, so both were included in the CE. Lastly, the price attribute was specified with three levels (US$7.50, US$8.25, and US$8.50) chosen to reflect the average price for knit gloves in stores at the time but with enough range to detect price sensitivity (as validated through pretesting), by offering price-conscious but interested consumers the option to select wool gloves that matched the acrylic ones on price.</p>
<p>The design of the choice tasks accounted for orthogonality and balance. Orthogonality allows discerning the effects of one attribute from those another, and balance in attribute levels is desirable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0887302X12446064">Louviere et al., 2000</xref>). D-efficiency quantifies the goodness of an experimental design using the geometric mean of the eigen values of the experiment design matrix; when it is 100, the design is orthogonal and balanced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0887302X12446064">Kuhfeld, 2010</xref>). The OPTEX procedure in SAS generated six choice scenarios, each consisting of three wool gloves with the D-efficiency value of 96.79. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0887302X12446064">Table 1</xref> demonstrates an example choice scenario.</p>

<p>To examine the impact of information on attribute demands, two versions of the survey were prepared with differing amounts of information provided about the attributes. Version 1 did not provide any narrative regarding the attributes of the wool gloves that appeared in the choice task. In Version 2, a list of product attributes with briefly stated definitions preceded the choice task. Further, the subject was asked to scroll through two pages of web screens with additional information about the attributes. The narrative was designed to convey the perspectives of the wool industry to assess the impact of industry claims and communications, based on materials prepared by the industry and individual conversations with stakeholders. The narrative was pretested with individuals to ensure that it was worded as objectively as possible without being unnecessarily disturbing. The informational content appears in the Appendix A.</p>
<p>Given that specialized apparel including those that are organic is widely sold on the Internet, the population of consumers who have access to and use the Internet were considered as plausible buyers of wool products labeled for various credence attributes. An online panel of consumers was purchased from a company that specializes in market research. No limitations were placed on the characteristics of the sample, and the sample was randomly split into half with respondents directed to one of the two versions of the survey. From a list of individuals who have indicated their willingness to participate in online research, the research company generates a random sample of our specification. After an approval from The Institutional Review Board, the selected individuals receive e-mail messages inviting them to participate in the survey with an individualized survey link. By participation, the individuals indicate their consent. Upon completing the survey, the respondents are redirected to the panel provider’s website to receive a compensation for completing the survey.</p>
<p>The survey appeared on 8 and 12 pages in Versions 1 and 2, respectively. The first section explored shopping habits and the perceived importance of various apparel attributes. The second section included several 5-point Likert-type items intended to measure psychographics, such as belief in animal rights, knowledge of the environmental impact of apparel production, and familiarity with organic products. Then, the choice tasks were introduced by a short discussion of the comfort and convenience attributes of superfine wool to mitigate any negative stereotype held toward wool products. The additional information included in Version 2 followed the discussion. Demographic items were included in the final section of the survey.</p>
<p>The limited nature of research on belief in animal rights means that there is no widely accepted measure related to the issue. Previous research on consumer WTP for food products (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0887302X12446064">Lagerkvist, Carlsson, &amp; Viske, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0887302X12446064">Shepherd, Magnusson, &amp; Sjödén, 2005</xref>) has included animal welfare as an attribute but did not seek to measure consumer beliefs related to it. For this reason, an exploratory item designed to measure consumer belief in animal rights was developed specifically for this study based on a statement by the animal rights organization PETA that “Like humans, animals are capable of suffering and have interests in leading their own lives” (PETA, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0887302X12446064">2012</xref>). This was adapted to a single item that asked respondents to indicate their agreement using a 5-point Likert-type scale with the statement that “Animals are capable of suffering and leading lives of interest to themselves.”</p>
<p>Similarly, the familiarity with organic food products was measured using a single statement that asked consumers to express their degrees of familiarity with organic foods using a 4-point scale that ranged from <italic>never heard about it</italic> to <italic>very familiar with its attributes</italic> along the lines of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0887302X12446064">Fotopoulos and Krystallis (2002</xref>). The knowledge of environmental impact of apparel products was measured in a slightly less direct fashion that, like the belief in animal welfare, was developed specifically for this study. Participants were asked to rate the environmental damage (from <italic>no damage</italic> to <italic>much damage</italic>) caused by six fiber and apparel production processes: growing cotton, raising sheep, manufacturing polyester, manufacturing rayon, dyeing cotton, and dyeing polyester. Participants were allowed to indicate <italic>don’t know</italic> for each of the six processes; given that previous research such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0887302X12446064">Kim and Damhorst (1998</xref>) suggests that consumers are generally not well informed about apparel production, these responses likely indicate honesty rather than lack of attention to the questions.</p>
<p>Before the full administration, the survey was given to about 30 individuals (mostly university professionals and students) for pretesting to ensure clarity and suitability of the price levels to generate sufficient variability in responses for statistical validity. This pretesting also indicated that the psychographic items were able to measure the variability in beliefs in animal welfare, knowledge of environmental impact of apparel and familiarity with organic products. After slight modifications, the survey was administered in October 2007. Of 585 individuals invited to participate in the survey, 514 successfully completed the demographics page at the end of the survey (88% completion rate). The completions were split 258 and 256 between Versions 1 and 2, respectively.</p>

<title>Respondent Characteristics</title>
<p>The respondents who completed the survey were more likely to be female (70%) and better educated (34% with a bachelor’s or higher degree) than the average American (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0887302X12446064">Table 2</xref>). The sample was less ethnically diverse than the United States as a whole, with 87% of the sample identifying as White, compared to 73.9% of Americans according to the 2006 American Community Survey (U.S. Census Bureau, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0887302X12446064">2011</xref>). Thus, the sample was similar to the typical organic food consumer regarding educational attainment and race (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0887302X12446064">Dettmann &amp; Dimitri, 2007</xref>), although our sample’s average income level was lower than the population. The sample was geographically more concentrated in the Northeast and Midwest with 4% and 8% points more respondents than would be expected from those regions, respectively, and 6% points fewer respondents from each of the Southern and Western regions.</p>

<p>Three psychographic variables were selectively constructed from the survey responses and are fully described in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0887302X12446064">Table 3</xref>, along with the socioeconomic variables used in the analysis. The first measured the respondents’ belief in animal rights (<italic>ANIMR</italic>). The average response was 3.66, which on a 5-point scale suggests that most respondents partly or mostly believed in animal rights. The second reflected the respondents’ knowledge on environmental damage caused by fiber and apparel production processes (<italic>ENVK</italic>). Higher values of the variable corresponded to less confidence in their knowledge about the environmental impacts of these processes. Lastly, respondents were asked about their familiarity with organic food (<italic>FORG</italic>). The average response was 2.86, which, on this scale, means that typical participants ranged from having heard about it but did not know what organic foods were to being moderately familiar with their attributes.</p>

<title>Model Estimates</title>
<p>In addition to price, the following binary attribute variables were included in the RPL model: organic (<italic>ORG</italic>), US-origin (<italic>US</italic>), and acrylic (<italic>ACRYL</italic>). Thus, the values of these attributes can be examined relative to the wool product of Australian wool, with a combination of other claims and price. To explore the impact of information on the elicited values of wool attributes, a binary variable representing the individual’s exposure to the additional information in Version 2 was included in the model as interaction terms with the binary attribute variables. The attribute parameters were specified as random, distributed as normal, with conditional means dependent on gender, age, income, education, and three psychographic variables defined in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0887302X12446064">Table 3</xref>. The price parameter and the interaction terms were specified as fixed to make the model tractable. The RPL was estimated by simulating distributions using 100 draws from Halton method, using NLOGIT 4.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0887302X12446064">Greene, 2007</xref>, p. N17–N63).

</table-wrap>
<p>Of the random coefficients on binary attribute variables, the mean of the <italic>ORG</italic> variable is negative and is statistically significant at the 5% level (−0.630, <italic>p</italic> = .044), implying that on average, respondents valued certified organic less than the combined labels of pro-environment and animal welfare. Yet, the standard deviation of this coefficient was also statistically significant at the 1% level (0.450, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), suggesting that the valuation toward organic was variable among respondents. Of the individual characteristics included in the model, only familiarity with organic foods mattered (0.161, <italic>p</italic> = .020). Naturally, respondents who were more familiar with organic foods valued organic wool products higher than those with less familiarity, all else equal.</p>
<p>On average, respondents were indifferent to wool from the United States compared to that originating from Australia (0.348, <italic>p</italic> = .608). Yet, the standard deviation of the <italic>US</italic> coefficient is statistically significant at the 1% level (2.048, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), and comparing its magnitude to that of the <italic>ORG</italic> coefficient showed how much more divisive respondents’ valuations were toward the origin of wool than toward wool being certified organic. The variation in valuation did not vary systematically across individual characteristics (all <italic>p</italic> values &gt;.1).</p>
<p>A negative mean of the <italic>ACRYL</italic> parameter suggests that respondents, on average, valued wool products higher than acrylic products, although the coefficient was not statistically different from 0 (−2.059, <italic>p</italic> = .260). Again, the standard deviation of the parameter was statistically significant and large, implying wide heterogeneity in people’s preferences toward wool and acrylic products (9.650, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). Some of the heterogeneity was systematic across demographic characteristics: older people valued acrylic higher than wool (0.137, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), while those with higher household income valued wool higher (−0.250, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). Those who held stronger beliefs in animal rights (−1.321, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), as well as those who were more informed about environmental impacts of apparel production (0.215, <italic>p</italic> = .058), and those who were more familiar with organic food (−2.415, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) valued wool more than acrylic.</p>
<p>Regarding the fixed coefficients, the <italic>Price</italic> coefficient was negative and statistically significant at the 1% (−1.305, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), which is expected; respondents receive lower utility from higher prices. The information terms on <italic>ORG</italic> and <italic>US</italic> were statistically not different from 0 (<italic>p</italic> = .108 and .152, respectively). But, the signs hinted that additional information on wool production further encouraged people to value the combined claims of environmental sustainability and animal welfare more than certified organic and to value U.S. wool over Australian wool. The information term on <italic>ACRYL</italic> is statistically significant and positive (1.761, <italic>p</italic> = .005), suggesting that information on the state of wool production lowered overall wool’s appeal to respondents.</p>
<p>While the participants were randomly assigned to each version of the survey, analysis (independent <italic>t</italic> test) confirmed the goal that the respondents to each version not differ significantly in terms of the selected sociodemographic and psychographic variables were met. There were no statistically significant differences between the versions based on gender (<italic>p</italic> = .358), age (<italic>p</italic> = .459), education (<italic>p</italic> = .556), or income (<italic>p</italic> = .575). The means for each version were also not significantly different for animal rights (<italic>p</italic> = .549), environmental impact knowledge (<italic>p</italic> = .625), and familiarity with organic food (<italic>p</italic> = .647). Thus, the estimated coefficients on the information terms could be confidently interpreted as the direct impact of the provided information rather than the differences in socioeconomic and psychographic characteristics of the respondents in the two subsamples.</p>

<p>Compared to a pair of wool gloves, the average respondent discounted acrylic gloves by $6.23 per pair. The distribution of WTP was skewed to the right, with 79.4% of respondents valuing acrylic products less than wool products. With additional information on wool production, the average discount was adjusted upward by $1.35, but still 74.7% of respondents valued wool products over acrylic products.</p>

<title>Discussion and Conclusions</title>
<p>In terms of the first objective of the study, which was to analyze the U.S. demand for organic certification of wool products relative to other sustainability-related labels, the results suggest that most (over 85%) respondents valued wool products with a combination of claims on environmental sustainability and animal welfare more than certified organic wool products. This result confirms the results of the focus group study in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0887302X12446064">Sneddon, Lee, and Soutar (2009)</xref>, where organic production was a distant fourth to labor, animal welfare, and environmental impact in a list of wool consumer concerns. Many (over 75%) respondents in this study valued products made from domestic wool over those using Australian wool, illustrating preference toward domestic products more strongly than in previous apparel studies. This finding is consistent with the findings related to food (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0887302X12446064">Peterson &amp; Burbidge, 2012</xref>). Approximately 80% of respondents valued wool products over acrylic products. Such preference toward wool was held particularly among younger respondents and those earning higher income, as well as those who held stronger beliefs on animal rights, more knowledge about environmental impacts of apparel production, and familiarity with organic foods.</p>
<p>The significance of these results for the marketing and labeling of sustainably produced wool is apparent. First and foremost, the respondents clearly valued wool products over acrylic alternatives in this product category. In terms of the second objective of the study, which was to identify socioeconomic and psychographic characteristics of individuals that share similar preferences for these labeled attributes, the variance in individual preferences toward wool products based on socioeconomic and psychographic characteristics, suggests that wool marketing in general should consider targeted audiences.</p>
<p>Finally, in terms of our third objective, to examine how consumers’ valuation of these labeled attributes are affected by providing objective statements about the attributes, we found that while respondents with self-proclaimed knowledge on environmental impacts of apparel production valued wool products higher than their counterparts, the study respondents overall reacted negatively toward additional information on wool production. Thus, promotional material for wool products needs to be carefully developed and tested so that information about the merits of competing production systems does not tarnish the consumers’ view of wool as a whole.</p>
<p>Additionally, the results of this study clearly spell out the need for the U.S. wool industry to take advantage of consumers’ preferences toward domestic fibers. The U.S. wool producers also have the opportunity to highlight their sustainable production practices, which need not be certified organic. In fact, this study indicates that a pro-environment label along with an animal welfare claim could be more valuable to the majority of consumers than the organic label, proffering revenue-enhancing opportunities to silvopastoral operations.</p>
<p>In terms of theoretical contributions, the results of this study confirms that WTP for credence attributes for apparel are sensitive to both negative and positive information, which is in line with previous studies on food products, such as Fox et al. (2002) or <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0887302X12446064">Roosen, Bieberstein, Marette, Blanchmanche, and Vandermoere (2011</xref>). However, the effect of the information, overall, was not to raise or lower WTP for specific credence attributes depending on the positive or negative information connected to the attribute but to lower WTP for the entire category of products associated with the credence attributes. Due to our experiment design, it is not clear whether this finding is applicable to cases beyond wool and acrylic products. Another study that offers a choice of a product with attributes not discussed in the externally provided narrative is needed to determine whether the two-sided information about a product’s attributes has indeed caused the subjects to hesitate buying the product altogether.</p>
<p>However, the main goal of this study was to provide guidance for policy makers and producers about the marketing of wool products labeled for environmental and animal-focused claims. The results confirm that alternatives to organic labeling, such as “ecofriendly” and “animal-friendly,” are viable and indeed attractive to specific segments of consumers. Further study is needed to explore the most effective forms of animal welfare and other sustainability claims, but this research demonstrates that policy makers should not ignore the importance of these issues to concerned consumers. The U.S. wool producers who are not being served by an organic labeling system may not be able to adequately respond to their production difficulties related to the health and welfare of their herd.</p>
<p>While there naturally are limitations to the implications of this study, given that while the consumers who participated were choosing hypothetical rather than real products, and were chosen to reflect the likely market for the products, rather than the United States as a whole, collectively, our findings suggest that consumer demand supports efforts to depart from treating fiber products as generic commodities, such as establishing traceability for production attributes related to environmental impact or animal welfare, as well as fiber origin.</p>

<title>Additional Narrative</title>
<p>These labels may imply a few things such as the following:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>Organic farming and manufacturing practices limit the use of synthetic substances to those approved by the National Organic Standards. Besides the organic standards, there are other ways to produce wool that can be considered pro-environment. Producers who find it challenging to adhere to the organic standards can adopt less stringent production practices and still claim that their products are pro-environment.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>When people who raise sheep organically treat the sheep for worms using antiparasite drugs, the wool from the sheep is no longer considered organic under current standards. Since worms are common, this makes it difficult to produce organic wool. Some people believe that failing to give the sheep the most effective treatment for worms is cruel to the sheep.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>These labels may also imply the following:</p>
<list list-type="bullet">
<list-item>
<p>Country of origin tells us where the fiber production is taking place. If an organic or pro-environment production process is being used, the country of origin tells us which environment is directly benefiting from such production practices. Moreover, some people are concerned about the environmental impact of transporting products over long distances.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Producers who make a commitment not to kill the native predators, such as wolves or bears that might threaten their livestock can label their products as certified predator friendly. Predator friendly growers reduce the risks of livestock losses by using guard animals such as llamas, dogs, and burros and by using pasture-management strategies to minimize confrontations between their animals and predators.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Mulesing is an important part of sheep husbandry in Australia, where the skin around the backside is surgically removed to prevent fly strike caused by Australian blowfly. The process of mulesing has been reported to mutilate many sheep by trussing the animals upside down and carving large pieces of flesh from their rumps without any pain-relief medication.</p>
