<title>More Equality, More Justice</title>
<p>I recently completed my ninth year as a high school instrumental music teacher in New York City. This fall I will be beginning my full-time doctoral studies at Teachers College.</p>
<p>I am writing to let you know how much I enjoyed the June 2012 issue of <italic>Music Educators Journal.</italic> The themes covered—social justice, equality for all—are so important to our field, yet are too rarely discussed in professional literature.</p>
<p>In particular, I thoroughly enjoyed Lisa C. DeLorenzo’s piece, “Missing Faces from the Orchestra.” I have never read an article that has so accurately captured the challenges faced by both educators and students, especially in urban settings. While reading, I found myself frequently exclaiming, “Exactly!” This will be an article that I will often refer back to throughout my professional career.</p>
<p>I must also note that I was very impressed by the article coauthored by Randall Everett Allsup (my mentor and future professor) and Eric Shieh, “Social Justice and Music Education: The Call for a Public Pedagogy,” as it, too, addressed issues not discussed frequently enough among our professional community.</p>
<p>Congratulations on such a fine issue! I truly hope that there will be more issues similar to this one in the future.</p>
