<abstract>
<p>This article sought to identify factors related to high school completion rates and college enrollment among Hispanic students. Hispanic students were found to have high attrition rates in institutions of higher education. Implications for the development and implementation of retention programs for Hispanic high school students, such as culturally sensitive professional staff and faculty training, increased parent or family involvement, and improved parent or caregiver service provider communication in the development of programs aimed at the retention of Hispanic students, are presented.</p>

<p>The purpose of this article is to present trends in U.S. Hispanic student dropout and success across years. The trends are contextualized using the socioecological model to better identify the social determinants of educational success in the Hispanic population. The socioecological model is based on Bronfenbrenner’s ecological systems theory, which spans multiple levels of the social environment affecting individual outcomes. The socioecological model is used to review the literature on Hispanic academic achievement, to interpret the educational trends over time and suggest strategies to enhance academic achievement among Hispanics.</p>
<p>According to the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) in the 2008-2009 academic year, 75.5% of students in the United States graduated high school. The high school drop-out rate is close to 10% nationally. Many factors related to high school dropout have been identified, including reduced academic motivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1538192712437935">Alfaro, Umaña-Taylor, Gonzales-Backen, Bámaca, &amp; Zeiders, 2009</xref>), social and cultural capital (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1538192712437935">Ream &amp; Rumberger, 2008</xref>), health disparities (Hollar et al., 2010), and delinquency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1538192712437935">Alvarez-Rivera &amp; Fox, 2010</xref>). Lower educational attainment is a predictor of higher levels of engagement in risky behaviors (substance abuse, delinquency, violence, and sex), life expectancy, the burden of illnesses, increased health disparities, and overall mental health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1538192712437935">Freudenberg &amp; Ruglis, 2007</xref>). The impact of lower educational attainment is seen in the health outcomes of families with lower education, suggesting a generational impact of education on families’ health and well-being. Today’s disparities in educational achievement between Hispanics, Blacks, and Whites are resulting in deleterious consequences for the Hispanic community.</p>
<p>More alarming is that the Hispanic population has grown at a rapid rate and yet has remained the lowest-achieving group in education over the past four decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1538192712437935">Alfaro, Umaña-Taylor, &amp; Bámaca, 2006</xref>). In 2006 it was estimated that 6% of Hispanic kindergarteners would eventually obtain a bachelor’s degree (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1538192712437935">Bohon, Johnson, &amp; Gorman, 2006</xref>). These staggering findings run counter to research indicating Hispanic children enter school with similar fundamental cognitive processes and capabilities despite racial and/or ethnic differences compared to the majority group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1538192712437935">Fuller &amp; García Coll, 2010</xref>). The young population of Hispanics, with a median age of 26 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1538192712437935">National Center for Education Statistics, 2008</xref>), face many challenges to educational attainment, including higher risks of high school dropout (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1538192712437935">Alfaro et al., 2006</xref>), teen pregnancy, substance abuse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1538192712437935">Freudenberg &amp; Ruglis, 2007</xref>), and low college enrollment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1538192712437935">National Center for Education Statistics, 2008</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1538192712437935">Behnke, Gonzalez, and Cox (2010)</xref> conducted a survey study among 501 Latino students in North Carolina, investigating reasons for school dropout. According to this study, some of the reasons that trigger school dropout include school work, personal problems, peer pressure, and working to help the family economically. To alleviate drop-out rates, the authors suggested more Spanish-speaking staff/teachers, academic and personal support (i.e., after-school programs), and improved ESL (English as second language) classes.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1538192712437935">Alfaro et al. (2006)</xref> used an ecological approach to explore the role of family members and teachers on student academic motivation. They found generational status, gender (parent and child), and teacher support have an impact on Latino student academic motivation. Specifically, mothers influenced their daughter academic motivation to a higher degree, whereas fathers had a stronger influence on male children. Teacher support was a salient finding across both child genders. A focus on the mesosystem (educational organizational level) with parental involvement, especially fathers, and cultural training for teachers was emphasized to improve academic motivation among Latino adolescents.</p>
<p>In addition, exosystems (community level) and macrosystems (public policies) contribute to the educational advantages and disadvantages among Hispanics who often live in high-poverty neighborhoods and attend segregated schools that are underfunded. Such conditions set up students for disadvantaged educational experiences and outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1538192712437935">Eamon, 2004</xref>). Early efforts to explore the reduced educational performance levels and attainment rates of Hispanics have led to cultural blaming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1538192712437935">Fuller &amp; García Coll, 2010</xref>). Experts have posited that Hispanics turn away from the education system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1538192712437935">Fuller &amp; García Coll, 2010</xref>), underperform due to their limited English proficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1538192712437935">Martinez, DeGarmo, &amp; Eddy, 2004</xref>), and are influenced by peers with negative attitudes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1538192712437935">Behnke et al., 2010</xref>). Furthermore, the education system, racial and ethnic stereotyping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1538192712437935">Alfaro et al., 2009</xref>), low expectations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1538192712437935">Bohon et al., 2006</xref>), and lack of extracurricular activities in schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1538192712437935">Gándara, 2004</xref>) have been found to influence the educational success of Hispanics.</p>
<p>Given the diversity within the Hispanic population, the influence of the socioecological model varies further with each Hispanic subgroup and the communities in which they reside. The Hispanic population is comprised of Cubans, Mexicans, Puerto Ricans, and a growing population from the Caribbean and Central and South America; the diverse group encounters different levels of hardships while living in the United States. To date, the majority of published literature in education has focused on the three largest Hispanic groups in the United States, namely, Cubans, Mexicans, and Puerto Ricans. These groups vary by culture, generation, region, and sociopolitical history (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1538192712437935">Bohon et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1538192712437935">Fuller &amp; García Coll, 2010</xref>). The variability in education achievement within the Hispanic community has been linked to multiple sociocultural factors such as culture, family cohesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1538192712437935">Alfaro et al., 2006</xref>), historical and political timing, human capital, income, racism, and regional differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1538192712437935">Monkman, Ronald, &amp; Théramène, 2005</xref>). In addition, discrimination has been found to be a significant factor affecting Hispanic student achievement. For instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1538192712437935">Alfaro et al. (2009)</xref> conducted a longitudinal study of 221 Latino adolescents and their experiences with discrimination. The researchers found perceived discrimination and gender to be affecting academic motivation and success on the part of Hispanic students.</p>
<p>One of the determinants of educational achievement is social and cultural capital. Social capital and cultural capital are defined as resources reflecting cultural practices, social relationships, and knowledge to access these resources for social and economic benefit. Basic resources in social capital include social networks (neighborhood, group membership, and formal institutions-schools), relationships (parent-teacher, parent-child), information (expectations, gaining access), language (bilingualism, English proficiency), money (socioeconomic status), and physical goods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1538192712437935">Monkman et al., 2005</xref>). Cultural capital takes many forms, such as styles, manners, cultural knowledge, cultural preferences and affinities, music, art, historical sites, literature, dance forms, academic credentials, and educational qualifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1538192712437935">Monkman et al., 2005</xref>). Despite many barriers to educational attainment, if viewed in the various forms, cultural capital may be an area of advantage for Hispanic children and families. Hispanic family structure may provide high levels of cultural capital but lower levels of social capital. This imbalance may affect educational attainment. For instance, after-school programs and extracurricular activities have shown positive results in education attainment by drawing on theories of social and cultural capital (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1538192712437935">Auerbach, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1538192712437935">Behnke et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1538192712437935">Gándara, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1538192712437935">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1538192712437935">Martinez et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1538192712437935">Ream &amp; Rumberger, 2008</xref>). The Futures and Families project (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1538192712437935">Auerbach, 2004</xref>) stemmed from a study at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) school partnership with goals to narrow the information gap by educating Latino parents about social networks to enhance their social and cultural capital. Families were provided monthly college access meetings developed and run by teachers, counselors, community liaisons, and UCLA staff. The contents included information about financing college, the college environment, and various topics presented by guest speakers of color. The majority of students enrolled in 4-year institutions followed the program. The researchers suggested this was due to both program staff involvement with students and parent’s college knowledge development. Students of parents who were noticeably absent from the monthly meetings did not enroll or attend college. However, many families remain unaware of after-school programs and resources. The impact of not participating in programs on Hispanic student experience and education attainment is unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1538192712437935">Martinez et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section1-1538192712437935" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>A study protocol was developed to identify the national data for educational attainment. For comparative purposes of this study, U.S. Census and the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) high school drop-out, graduation, and college enrollment data for Hispanic, Black, and White populations were identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1538192712437935">National Center for Education Statistics, 2008</xref>). The data on 1975-2009 high school dropout and 1975-2010 high school graduation rates were drawn from the U.S. Census Bureau. The 2- and 4-year institutional fall enrollment rates by race and ethnicity were identified from the NCES data. The 2- and 4-year institution enrollment rates are also presented by within–Hispanic group classification, allowing for comparison between students of Cuban, Mexican, and Puerto Rican descent. Findings are presented in tables to allow for comparison of educational attainment over time.</p>

<title>High school drop-out rates 1975-2009</title>
<p>Hispanic students’ drop-out data covering the past three decades showed that Hispanics had higher rates of both event and status dropouts compared with non-Hispanic White and Black students. For students who drop out in a single year without completing high school for Grades 10 to 12 (event dropouts) for years except 2005, Hispanics had the highest rates of event dropouts compared to Black and non-Hispanic Whites (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1538192712437935">Table 1</xref>). The highest rate for Hispanics occurred in 1995 at 11.6% and the lowest in 2005 at 4.7%. In 2005, the proportion of Black students exceeded Hispanics, with non-Hispanic Whites remaining the group with the lowest event drop-out rates. Despite decreases in event and status dropouts for all groups since 1975, in 2009 Hispanics maintained the highest drop-out rates at 5.3% and 20.8%, respectively.</p>

<p>The percentages of 18- to 24-year-olds who have not completed high school and are not enrolled, regardless of when they dropped out (status dropouts), were more than double that of event dropouts for Hispanics, Blacks, and non-Hispanic Whites. In 1980, Hispanics had the highest percentage of status dropouts (40.3%) across all years and groups. The same year, 23.5% of the Blacks and 14.4% of non-Hispanic Whites were reported as status dropouts. Five years following, the percentage of Hispanic status dropouts decreased to 31.5%. An increase occurred in 1990, with the percentage jumping to 37.3%, while the rates for Blacks declined by 2.5 percentage points. Drop-out rate of non-Hispanic Whites remained constant at 13.5%. Similar percentages of status dropouts were observed for Black and non-Hispanic Whites in 1995, 2001, and 2007. Hispanics greatly exceeded Black and non-Hispanic Whites every year reported. The lowest percentages for Hispanics, Blacks, and non-Hispanic Whites was reported in 2007, and the percentage of Hispanic status dropouts was equal to the combined drop-out percentages of Black and non-Hispanic White groups.</p>

<p>The Hispanic group remained the group with the lowest percentage of graduates up to 2010. Teasing apart the data for Hispanic community, we found that Mexicans and Puerto Ricans graduated high school less often than Cubans every year. Mexicans outperformed Puerto Ricans in 1975, with 31% graduating compared to Puerto Ricans whose graduation was 28.7% for the same year. However, each year proceeding Puerto Ricans graduated at higher rates than Mexicans. By 2010, a 17.4 percentage-point difference was found between the groups, with 74.8% of Puerto Ricans graduating and only 57.4% of Mexicans.</p>

<title>Fall College Enrollment</title>
<p>For both fall enrollment in 2- and 4-year institutions the number of White students largely surpassed Hispanics and Blacks (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1538192712437935">Table 2</xref>). Two-year institutions enrolled greater number of Black students in 1990 than Hispanic students. After 1990, Hispanics enrolled in 2-year institutions more often than Blacks did, with the gap in enrollment rate widening each year between the two groups.</p>
<p>Enrollment numbers for 4-year institutions demonstrated the opposite. In 4-year institutions fewer Hispanics were enrolled compared to Black and White students for the years 1990 through 2009. Hispanics had the lowest increase in enrollment over time, with an average rate of 76,400 a year for the period 2002-2009. White students had the largest rate of increase in enrollment, averaging at 186,230 per year. The table indicates a large disparity between Hispanics and Whites and the steady difference between Hispanics and Blacks.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The national data indicate Hispanics are dropping out of high school at rates greatly surpassing their Black and White counterparts. The drop-out rates directly affect the lower high school graduation and college enrollment rates at both 2- and 4-year institutions over time. The persistent high school drop-out rate suggests that the educational experience for Hispanic students is laden with lowered expectations for their future. The factors contributing to the dismal circumstances and outlook include generational status, English proficiency, discrimination, and the influence of Hispanic family microsystems (e.g., immediate and extended family).</p>
<p>Researchers have expressed optimism regarding the educational progress of Hispanics. The increase in Hispanics graduating from high school and pursuing higher education suggests progress is being made. Cubans and Puerto Ricans, in particular, have made the largest academic gains within the Hispanic community.</p>
<p>The history of these two groups is closely tied to educational success and struggles. For instance, in the 1960s Cubans were offered political asylum, entry into the United States, and several services, including educational opportunities. The experiences and educational background of many Cubans who moved to the United States partially explain their heightened academic achievement over the years. Despite their U.S. citizenship status, Puerto Rican’s have faced cultural and housing discrimination in the United States, leaving them more prone to dropping out of high school and underachieving academically. Mexican American challenges began in the early 1900s as they came in hordes into United States seeking work in agriculture, which led to school and housing segregation and limited assimilation into the broader U.S. society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1538192712437935">Aguirre &amp; Turner, 2004</xref>). Their low-status image in the United States has persisted and is even more discouraging given the increase in the antiimmigrant climate today. In addition, immigration status, language, SES, and family demographics, to name a few (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1538192712437935">Bohon et al., 2006</xref>), strengthen the likelihood of Mexicans having the lowest high school graduation and enrollment rates of the Hispanic subgroups studied. Of concern is the current immigration climate and upcoming immigration reform, which may further marginalize this Hispanic subgroup with the lowest educational attainment.</p>
<p>Hispanics are more likely to enroll in community colleges as a next step in education. It is perceived as a mean of success in gaining social capital on the journey of earning a bachelor’s degree (Zell, 2009). Community colleges attract Hispanics, given their low tuition cost, flexible schedules, proximity, and a classroom size that may be seen as less intimidating when compared to a 4-year institution. On the other hand, 4-year universities receive more applications from Hispanics attending high schools that promote academic success by building a college climate through providing support, placing high expectations, working with parents, enhancing social capital, and offering career center resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1538192712437935">Stern, 2009</xref>). Administrators, teachers, and other staff members foster social opportunities by promoting diversity within schools for students from different backgrounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1538192712437935">Ream &amp; Rumberger, 2008</xref>). Zell’s (2009) study reinforces the role of faculty and family support in academic achievement.</p>
<p>In addition, Hispanic adolescents’ academic success will increase their future social and cultural capital. Educational institutions have a strong influence on having positive perceptions about the value of education and expectations associated with pursuing higher education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1538192712437935">Monkman et al., 2005</xref>). However, educational institutions currently serve as barriers that prevent Hispanics from gaining more social capital. To ameliorate this dilemma the investment in developing cultural capital will lead to acquiring social capital. However, Hispanics need to learn how to effectively activate their growing social and culture capital. Hispanics appear to recognize the need for and initiate efforts to gain capital within a specific context, a point that merits further focus in future research focusing on Hispanic higher education as a whole. For example, Hispanics have strong ties within their specific Hispanic community that most often share similar class and ethnic status, biculturalism, neighborhoods, and families (immediate and extended). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1538192712437935">Gándara (2004)</xref> discusses an approach known as “Funds of Knowledge” where Hispanic communities are capable of creating social capital by having students recognize their strengths at home and in communities. The Hispanic families and students are becoming intellectually more competent of utilizing the resources available in school, and such a competence in turn promotes parental involvement, teacher awareness of parent engagement, and bringing the skills and talents of the Hispanic communities into the classroom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1538192712437935">Gándara, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>That Hispanic children enter the higher educational system prepared to succeed points to differences in K-12 educational settings and offers an opportunity for intervention. Hispanic parents have been found to hold high educational expectations for their children. Parents may become advocates for increased educational attainment among their children. It would be optimal for K-12 programming to incorporate and develop Hispanic cultural resources to negotiate, enhance, invest, and most important, activate social and cultural capital to promote high school graduation and educational success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1538192712437935">Galindo, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1538192712437935">Monkman et al., 2005</xref>). For example, programs may use culturally informed communication strategies to increase school–family partnerships. Strengthening school–family partnerships will lead to better communication between families and teachers and increased family participation and support in children’s education, and thus, increasing student retention and achievement. In addition to increasing social capital among Hispanic families, programs should include approaches to tackle the adverse effects of discrimination, lack of encouragement by K-12 teachers, low extracurricular offering and involvement, and lack of adequate Spanish or bilingual resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1538192712437935">Martinez et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>The socioecological model suggests there are multiple factors that lead to an increase in high school drop-out rate among Hispanic students. Family, peers, community, school, and culture, all create pathways leading to both positive and negative educational outcomes among the Hispanic student population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1538192712437935">Woolley, 2009</xref>). Each social structure further varies specific to a region or context in which Hispanic youth live. For instance, Hispanic families are typically one- or two-parent households, which may complicate the capacity of families to monitor youth and support their academic performance. Among Hispanic immigrants and migrants, transience is a barrier to structure and continuity in education leading to decreased performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1538192712437935">Ream, 2005</xref>). Non-Hispanic parents are likely to have the time and resources to monitor and supervise their kids and engage more with school staff and teachers. Motivation and academic support from parents, teachers, and other school staff may help enhance students’ academic achievement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1538192712437935">Behnke et al., 2010</xref>). It is crucial that programs aiming to prepare Hispanic students and families for higher education make efforts to increase their social capital (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1538192712437935">Auerbach, 2004</xref>) and promote an understanding of how to navigate within the higher education system as a first-generation student.</p>
<sec id="section7-1538192712437935">
<title>Implications for Research and Program Development</title>
<p>The educational inequity and long-term trends indicate that reduced culture and social capital cannot fully explain the low academic achievement rates of Hispanic students. Factors across the micro level, including health disparities and the role of gender, may enhance our understanding of the differences in academic achievement levels within the Hispanic population. At the macro level, other factors such as institutional barriers, history of Hispanic subgroups in the United States, and discrimination should be further investigated to identify the determinants of low educational attainment among Hispanic students. Unfortunately, the available literature does not provide a socioecological approach to isolating the contributing factors that play a key role in the educational trajectory of Hispanics, including subgroups of their population, which is necessary for policy making. Current trends in educational attainment point to a divergence between the educational system (i.e., school environment, officials, and teachers) and Hispanic families. Promoting a connection between Hispanic students, their families, and the K-12 educational system and resources may improve high school graduation rates, 2-year college enrollment, and increase transfer to and enrollment in 4-year institutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1538192712437935">Woolley, 2009</xref>). In this regard, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1538192712437935">Stern (2009)</xref> credits the Chicago Public Schools (CPS) for creating career centers within 100 schools, with a college counselor available for promoting a college-type climate to prevail within the school. CPS experienced a 13% increase in the completion of the Free Application for Federal Student Aid with the use of this program. Extracurricular activities, after-school programs (i.e., multicultural clubs, culturally sensitive mentoring), and parent–child education programs (i.e., monthly college access meetings—Puente Project) that encourage educational achievement and develop family–school relationships may fulfill this goal. Programs offering these connections should be instituted at the state and federal level. Research on the successful implementation and outcomes of existing and future programs is necessary to determine their impact on Hispanic participants. A review of achievement and engagement within the school systems vis-à-vis specific socioeconomic status groups within the Hispanic population is needed to determine whether Hispanic students from different backgrounds perform differently in the school setting. Specifically, it would be important to identify key demographic characteristics of the communities, families, and schools and use these data to further inform the design and development of educational interventions aimed at promoting success in K-12 education. In addition, questions related to a program’s merits, including whether the program is culturally sensitive, focuses on promoting better access to college resource, encourages family inclusion, and promotes educational achievement, should be addressed in educational achievement and school evaluation reports. Also necessary is the collection of data that will allow researchers to examine the needs of Hispanic youth for succeeding academically. Last, and also equally essential, are efforts such as faculty and staff professional development workshops and training opportunities that facilitate an understanding of the unique cultural and integration circumstances of Hispanic students, effective teaching strategies for engagement and promotion of success among this student population, and collaboration techniques in working with the families of these students. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1538192712437935">Monkman et al. (2005)</xref> provided a case example demonstrating how to effectively help students in urban settings, build their social and educational value through cultural respect, recognition of own teaching practices to an underserved population, and increase students’ access to education. The higher participation of Hispanics in such programs will contribute to their increased school success over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1538192712437935">Auerbach, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1538192712437935">Behnke et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1538192712437935">Gándara, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1538192712437935">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1538192712437935">Martinez et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1538192712437935">Ream &amp; Rumberger, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Current trends in Hispanic high school drop-out rates and low 2- and 4-year higher education enrollment point to a continued disparity and need for systematically addressing education in the growing Hispanic minority population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1538192712437935">Gándara &amp; Contreras, 2009</xref>).</p>
