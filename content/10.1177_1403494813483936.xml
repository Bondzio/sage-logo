<p><italic>Background</italic>: Acute myocardial infarction (MI) is a leading cause for morbidity and mortality in Sweden.

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Acute myocardial infarction (MI) remains a leading cause for morbidity and mortality in Sweden and other countries, although mortality has decreased during the last 20 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1403494813483936">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1403494813483936"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1403494813483936"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1403494813483936">4</xref>]. During this period of time, diagnostic tools and treatments for acute coronary syndromes have seen major changes. Several Swedish nationwide health registers of high quality provide good possibilities to follow and describe such changes in epidemiology and clinical practice. Among these are the Register of information and knowledge about Swedish heart intensive care admissions (RIKS-HIA, since 2009 included in the Swedeheart register) and the Swedish statistics of acute myocardial infarctions (S-AMI), both described below.</p>
<p>The S-AMI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1403494813483936">4</xref>] is a register based on linkage between the National patient register and the Cause of death register. The National patient register contains information on all hospitalizations with discharge diagnoses in Sweden since 1987 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1403494813483936">5</xref>], whereas the Cause of death register includes all deaths in Sweden with supposed cause of decease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1403494813483936">6</xref>]. RIKS-HIA started as a regional register in 1991 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1403494813483936">3</xref>]. It includes patients who have been hospitalized in coronary (CCU) or intensive care units (ICU). The register has developed gradually and today all 73 hospitals in Sweden taking care of patients with acute coronary syndromes in a CCU or ICU participate. A main purpose of the register is to improve quality of care and to increase compliance to national guidelines concerning the treatment of patients with acute coronary syndromes. This is achieved by following temporal trends within the hospital and by comparisons between hospitals, which are made public and available to health care providers, decision makers and health economists.</p>
<p>One potential limitation of RIKS-HIA is that several patients with acute coronary syndromes are hospitalized in other units than a CCU/ICU for various reasons, e.g. old age, concomitant diseases, or logistic reasons within the hospital organization. The ambition nowadays is also to include patients with an acute MI hospitalized in other wards than the CCU/ICU. Hospitals have the opportunity to report patients who are taken care of outside the CCU/ICU to RIKS-HIA, but use this opportunity differently. However, some information about these patients can be obtained from S-AMI. Knowledge about these patients is important, in order to provide for a correct description of patients with an acute MI in Sweden, and to ascertain adequate care of all patients with an acute coronary syndrome. Thus, the aim of this study was to examine similarities and potential differences of patients with an acute MI included in RIKS-HIA and in the population based S-AMI.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1403494813483936" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>All patients with a discharge diagnosis of an acute MI and who were included in RIKS-HIA during the time period from 1 January 2001 to 1 January 2007 were selected. Thereby we identified 114,311 hospitalizations in a CCU or ICU for an acute MI. In S-AMI, all patients by definition have a diagnosis of an acute MI. A total of 198,693 cases were included in S-AMI during the same time period. In the S-AMI register all hospitalizations due to an MI within 28 days after the index diagnosis are supposed to be related to the incident case. This is due to the ICD-classification, and thus no new incident cases are counted during the first month. RIKS-HIA, however, counts every hospitalization as a new MI. To avoid matching several times for the same event, only one match per 28 days was allowed, based on the incidence date in S-AMI.</p>
<p>Linkage between the two registers was made using the personal identification number given to everyone living in Sweden, and widely used in health care. Linkage was possible for 110,958 cases (matched, 55.3%), 2893 cases (1.4%) could be identified in RIKS-HIA only, and 79,836 (39.8%) in S-AMI only. Further analysis showed that among the cases found in S-AMI only, 7097 (3.5%) actually were registered in RIKS-HIA but under other diagnoses. Thus, we identified four groups of cases. Each group was characterized according to age, sex, mortality and to level of care in different county councils. Comorbidity (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1403494813483936">Table I</xref>) was obtained by linkage to the National patient register. Information about mortality for the cases included in RIKS-HIA was only obtained by linkage between RIKS-HIA and the Cause of death register. Linkage failed for 12 patients due to wrongly registered death dates.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study compares two Swedish nation-wide registers, one including subjects with a hospital discharge diagnosis of an acute MI (that is, S-AMI) and the other including patients hospitalized in a CCU/ICU, most of them due to acute coronary syndromes (that is, RIKS-HIA). We have previously shown excellent validity of diagnoses in S-AMI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1403494813483936">7</xref>] and RIKS-HIA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1403494813483936">8</xref>]. Altogether, our results show that just about every second patient in Sweden with an acute MI was hospitalized in a CCU/ICU during the studied years. These patients, compared to those not treated in such units, were younger and more likely to be male, showed less comorbidity, were more often subject to coronary artery interventional procedures, and had a favourable prognosis. Similar results were found in a smaller regional study comparing patients with acute MI during 2005 included in the Swedish register LOMAS (Longitudinal Multilevel Analysis in Scania) with patients included in RIKS-HIA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1403494813483936">9</xref>].</p>
<p>One major finding is that RIKS-HIA included just 57% of all patients with an acute MI as discharge diagnosis, while almost all (99%) of the cases with a MI were identified by S-AMI. There was, however, a trend for better covering of patients in RIKS-HIA with an acute MI over the studied years (from 54% in 2001 to 56% in 2006). Indeed, in recent years, Swedeheart also regularly links to S-AMI to provide better information about the degree of coverage.</p>
<p>We found more comorbidity in cases included in S-AMI only (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1403494813483936">Table IV</xref>). Valvular heart disease was the only comorbid condition equally common among the cases included in both registers as among those included in S-AMI only. This may be plausible, as valvular heart disease may worsen heart failure in association with an acute MI and make the patient more likely to be referred to a CCU/ICU. However, a prior MI or a diagnosis of heart failure did not increase the likelihood to be treated in a CCU/ICU. Among the patients with comorbidity, there are probably cases where it would be unethical to provide intensive cardiac care, while others may have symptomatic and prognostic benefit from more intense care. Nevertheless, patients included in S-AMI only presented with more comorbidity and were more likely to have a worse prognosis than their counterpart in RIKS-HIA.</p>
<p>Case fatality both at day 28 and at 1 year was approximately two-fold higher in patients included in S-AMI only, as compared to matched cases treated in a CCU/ICU. Our results are in agreement with findings from a smaller register study by Herlitz and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1403494813483936">10</xref>], and suggest that the prognosis of patients with an acute MI treated in a CCU/ICU does not reflect the prognosis of the entire population of patients with a discharge diagnosis of an acute MI.</p>
<p>We observed more women among the patients included in S-AMI only. This could be explained by age and/or comorbidity since women are on average older and have more concomitant diseases than men when they develop coronary heart disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1403494813483936">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1403494813483936">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1403494813483936">11</xref>]. However, the difference remained when age and comorbidity was taken into account, and also when men and women with no other known comorbidity up to and including 80 years of age, were compared. Our results extend observations by Herlitz and collaborators, who concluded that women with an acute MI were less frequently referred to treatment in a CCU [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1403494813483936">12</xref>]. It is possible that the difference in gender referral rate can be explained by differences in severity of the acute MI, that is, men would have more severe MI than women, and thus more often be referred to a CCU/ICU. In this study, it was not possible to control for severity of the MI. Of note, a study of patients with non-ST-elevation MI showed no difference in mortality between men and women once adjustments were made for difference in age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1403494813483936">13</xref>].</p>
<p>The proportions of cases included in the two registers differed substantially between regions (and also between hospitals). Some regions with a high proportion of matched cases, that is, more subjects with an acute MI hospitalized in a CCU/ICU, had fatality rates above the rates of those reporting fewer matched cases. This may at first seem unexpected. However, the results could reflect different organizations of the health care system and the hospitals. Some treatments and highly specialized care for high risk patients with a presumed worse prognosis will be concentrated to devoted hospitals. These hospitals will take care of more severe cases and might thus have higher mortality. Small number of cases in some hospitals can influence the result by chance. Referral of patients between different hospitals can influence the reporting of the patient to RIKS-HIA. More important, however, the observed differences in fatality rates may reflect differences in the ambition to include all cases in RIKS-HIA, or selecting relatively low risk patients, and/or avoiding referral of patients with dismal prognosis to the CCU/ICU. This may have implications when results and outcomes between hospitals and regions are compared. Similarly, results of different treatment regimens obtained from large randomized clinical trials in patients with acute coronary syndromes can be misleading and not readily generalized to daily clinical practice, as such trials often include low risk patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1403494813483936">14</xref>].</p>
<p>Both registers examined have important limitations. S-AMI has the disadvantage of a being based on more or less precise diagnoses set by the clinician. However, our previous validation of the register suggests this to be of minor importance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1403494813483936">7</xref>]. There is also limited information about each patient in the register. No information regarding the severity of myocardial damage, complications, interventions or medication that can be related to outcome, is available. The lack of clinical data other than age, sex and other diagnoses given at the same time, limits the ability to properly estimate comorbidity and other factors that might influence the level of care and patient outcome.</p>
<p>In contrast, RIKS-HIA contains ample information about every included patient. However, data is (at present) entered manually over the internet, demanding extra time beyond documentation in patient records. The resources allocated for this varies between hospitals. Thus, different selection criteria for inclusion have been applied between hospitals introducing important bias in the data entered. The introduction of electronic patient records opens up new possibilities to extract structured information from patient records directly into national registers. This process has begun in Sweden but requires substantial efforts of adapting both the electronic patient records and the national registers for this task.</p>
<p>While the purpose of S-AMI is to cover all patients given a primary or secondary diagnosis of MI in the entire Swedish population, RIKS-HIA aims to evaluate adherence to guidelines in acute coronary care. Thus, there are important discrepancies between the registers even within the diagnosis of an acute MI, since only patients where it is justified from an ethical and health economical perspective to treat according to guidelines have so far been the main focus for RIKS-HIA. As shown in this study, the inclusion criteria vary substantially between hospitals. To be able to compare standards of care between different geographical regions by RIKS-HIA, our results indicate that a more universal inclusion in RIKS-HIA is warranted. It is encouraging to note that reports from Swedeheart suggest considerable improvement on this issue during the past years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1403494813483936">3</xref>]. Another interesting issue to study would be drug utilisation and outcome. The Prescribed drug register contains complete data on all dispensed drugs in the country with unique identifiers of patients for &gt;99% of all prescriptions since 2005 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1403494813483936">15</xref>]. Linkage to S-AMI and Swedeheart in future studies could contribute importantly to our knowledge about treatment strategies after discharge from hospital.</p>
<p>Recognising these limitations, RIKS-HIA remains an important tool for studies of treatment effects, to detect rare complications, and changes in disease patterns. Notwithstanding the valuable information that can be obtained from registers such as RIKS-HIA, they complement population based registers (e.g. S-AMI). Thus, the combined use of S-AMI and RIKS-HIA, after necessary measurements to secure the personal integrity, may give a more correct description of patients with an acute MI.</p>
