<abstract>
<p>Although there is ample evidence of discrimination toward Muslim Americans in general, there is limited information specific to Muslim American adolescents. The few existing studies specific to this age group suggest that Muslim American adolescents encounter much discrimination from teachers, school administrators, and classmates. This descriptive qualitative study complements the few existing studies on Muslim American adolescents by obtaining in-depth description of the discrimination they encounter. The sample was 14 Muslim American adolescents who participated in one of two gender-specific focus groups about their discrimination experiences. Findings identified school settings as rife with discrimination toward Muslims, portrayed Muslim girls as at risk for harassment by strangers in public places, and illustrated how Muslim youth cope with discrimination. The study findings sensitize school nurses to the nature of the problem and provide direction for intervention.</p>

<p>Racial/ethnic discrimination refers to being singled out for hostility, denigrated, or receiving unequal treatment because of one’s race or ethnicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1059840511432316">Contrada et al., 2009</xref>). The topic is of importance for child development and health, including school health. There is ample evidence from recent systematic research reviews, extensive population-based studies, and local studies of specific racial and ethnic groups that acute and sustained exposure to discrimination has cumulative effects that adversely impact mental and physical health and child development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1059840511432316">Ahmed, Kia-Keating, &amp; Tsai, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1059840511432316">Brondolo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1059840511432316">Coker et al., 2009</xref>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1059840511432316">Paradies, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1059840511432316">Pasco &amp; Richman, 2009)</xref>. Negative consequences for children can be poor self-concept, internalizing and externalizing behavior problems, poor academic performance, limited life aspirations, and estrangement from mainstream society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1059840511432316">Ahmed et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1059840511432316">Coker et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1059840511432316">Rumbaut, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1059840511432316">Steele, 1997</xref>). Over time, a wide variety of psychological and physical stress-related diseases (e.g., depression, hypertension) can develop from cumulative discrimination experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1059840511432316">Brondolo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1059840511432316">Krieger, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1059840511432316">Paradies, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1059840511432316">Pasco &amp; Richman, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Discrimination is particularly salient during adolescence, a time when youth explore self-identity, including racial and ethnic identity and the meaning of minority status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1059840511432316">Fisher, Walton, &amp; Fenton, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1059840511432316">Helms, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1059840511432316">Quintana &amp; Vera, 1999</xref>). Exposure to discrimination also increases during adolescence as jobs, sports, and other extracurricular activities move teenagers into wider, more racially and ethnically diverse social circles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1059840511432316">Fisher et al., 2000</xref>). The cognitive ability to perceive discrimination based on group identity is also well established by adolescence. By the sixth grade, minority children understand discrimination and are sensitive to subtle expressions of prejudice and how others negatively characterize their racial or ethnic group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1059840511432316">Quintana &amp; Vera, 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>Although they are not an official minority, the approximately 4 to 7 million U.S. Muslim Americans routinely encounter discrimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1059840511432316">El-Haj, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1059840511432316">Moradi &amp; Talal, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1059840511432316">Naber, 2006</xref>).  Muslim Americans are confronted with media portrayals of Muslims as terrorists and having a culture and religion that is different and inferior to “American” culture and religion. In fact, the sharp increase in hate crimes against Muslim Americans after 9/11 made them the most frequently targeted group, exceeding other minority groups that have historically been targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1059840511432316">Human Rights Watch, 2002</xref>).  Although information specific to Muslim American adolescents is limited, there is some evidence that they encounter persistent problems in school, including physical assaults and death threats from peers and overt ethnic and religious bigotry and harassment from teachers, school administrators, and peers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1059840511432316">El-Haj, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1059840511432316">Khanlou, Koh, &amp; Mill, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>This descriptive qualitative study compliments the few existing studies on Muslim American adolescents by obtaining in-depth description of the discrimination they encounter in their daily lives. The study findings sensitize school nurses to the nature of the problem and provide direction for intervening to decrease the occurrence of discrimination.</p>
<sec id="section1-1059840511432316">
<title>Method</title>
<p>The study underwent an expedited review at a university Institutional Review Board. Parental consent and youth assent were required. Interested families received the consent form prior to the study and the researcher was available by phone to answer any questions.  The signed consent/assent forms were returned before study participation.</p>
<sec id="section2-1059840511432316">
<title>Sample</title>
<p>The sample was 14 Muslim American adolescents, 10 boys and 4 girls, who participated in one of two gender-specific focus groups. Gender-specific focus groups were because of Muslim norms for gender segregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1059840511432316">Aroian, Katz, &amp; Kulwicki, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1059840511432316">Carolan, Bagherinia, Juhari, Himelright, &amp; Mouton-Sanders, 2000</xref>). Eligibility criteria included self-identifying as Muslim, being between the ages of 13 and 17, and having parental consent. There were no exclusion criteria.</p>
<p>Participants were recruited through a key informant who was a Muslim parent of teenagers and affiliated with a large Islamic society in a Southeastern city in the United States. The Islamic society—a community-based religious organization with a mission to cater for the spiritual, educational, and social needs of local Muslims—links nine different Mosques in a city that has approximately 50,000 Muslims. Thus, this recruitment site yielded participants from the same religious community but from different high schools and neighborhoods.  The high schools and neighborhoods varied widely in terms of sociodemographic characteristics and ethnic and religious composition.</p>
<p>The original intention was to have focus groups comprising 6 to 8 participants in each gender group. Ten boys and 10 girls were recruited in anticipation of losing some adolescents between the time they expressed interest in participating and when the focus groups occurred. Every boy who expressed interest in participating arrived for the assigned focus group, whereas six girls did not. In all but one instance, last minute cancellations among the girls pertained to transportation difficulty. Unlike boys, who pooled transportation with other participants, girls relied on rides from parents or older brothers. </p>
<p>Grade in school ranged from 7th to 9th grade for the girls and 8th to 12th grade for the boys. Seventy-five percent of the girls (n = 3) and 40% of the boys (n = 4) were foreign born. All of the girls’ parents were foreign born. All but two of boys had at least one parent who was foreign born. Countries of origin for foreign-born parents included countries in the Middle East, South Asia, and Africa. The boys with both parents born in the United States identified that their grandparents were from Trinidad or Guyana. Self-reported ethnic background of the boys was as follows: Half Indian and half Pakistani (<italic>n</italic> = 2), Guyanese African American (<italic>n</italic> = 1), Trinidadian African American (<italic>n</italic> = 1), Libyan (<italic>n</italic> = 1), Egyptian (<italic>n</italic> = 1), Kenyan (<italic>n</italic> = 2), and Syrian (<italic>n</italic> = 2). Self-reported ethnic background of the girls was as follows: Syrian (<italic>n</italic> = 2), Kuwaiti (<italic>n</italic> = 1), and Lebanese (<italic>n</italic> = 1).  When referring to race or skin color, participants with a Middle Eastern, South Asian, or North African background referred to themselves as brown, whereas participants from the Caribbean or sub-Saharan Africa referred to themselves as African American.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1059840511432316">
<title>Data Collection</title>
<p>Data were collected through interactive performance (IP) in a focus group format. IP is an adaptation by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1059840511432316">Wirth (1994</xref>) of Augusto <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1059840511432316">Boal’s (1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1059840511432316">1995</xref>) improvisational and activist theater.  In improvisational activist theater, dialogue is created between actors and the audience. Wirth’s adaptation is that two actors, who he renamed as “inter-actors,” obtain stories of participants’ life events or situations by prompting participants to provide personal details for an evolving story. With direction from the participants, the inter-actors act out the evolving story. In this study, the evolving stories were replays of real-life discrimination incidents encountered by the adolescents participating in the study.</p>
<p>IP differs from role play in that participants shape and direct the inter-actors’ performance, both by verbally directing the performance and by participating as performers to show the inter-actors how the story evolves. IP was chosen over traditional role play because IP provides a mechanism to empower adolescents by having them direct or shape the inter-actors’ performance. This empowerment offsets the victimization associated with discrimination, rendering feelings more manageable and disclosure easier for an age group that, for developmental reasons, does not readily self-disclose.  (See <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1059840511432316">Norris, Aroian, Warren, and Wirth, 2011</xref>, for more in-depth description of IP and its developmental advantages over role playing in focus group research with adolescents.)</p>
<p>Each group lasted for approximately 3 hr, with about a ½ hr devoted to collecting demographic data and distributing $25 in cash to each participant as a thank you for participating in the study.  Both groups were coled by a nurse researcher (K.J.A.) and the lead inter-actor. The lead inter-actor was also assisted by a second inter-actor.</p>
<p>The groups began with a warm-up period of about half an hour that included an activity designed to establish a feeling of play and put participants at ease. Next, the lead inter-actor explained IP. The explanation was followed by an example whereby the lead inter-actor and his assistant demonstrated an incident that had happened to the lead inter-actor when he was a child.</p>
<p>Following this example, the lead inter-actor asked for a participant to volunteer an incident that had happened to him or her recently. No emphasis was placed on the topic of discrimination, as the purpose was to orient the participants to the process of IP. First, the volunteer was asked for sufficient detail for the inter-actors to begin the performance. Next, the volunteer was prompted to help shape the performance once it commenced. For example, a participant volunteered an incident that occurred shortly after he got his driving license when he hit another car while parallel parking. The inter-actor prompted him for the details and the accompanying feelings. Both inter-actors began by acting out the incident. Eventually, the lead inter-actor asked the participant to take his place in the performance to illustrate more about the incident.</p>
<p>Next, the nurse researcher reviewed the purpose of the study and asked for volunteers to provide information and direct performances about recent (i.e., within the last few months) discrimination incidents. Discrimination incidents were defined as when “someone assumed negative things about you or other Muslims or treated you badly or unfairly because you are a Muslim.”  Participants readily volunteered examples of discrimination. Each incident was enacted and discussed.  Discussion either ensued spontaneously or the nurse researcher interjected questions into the performance to ask for clarification or elaboration. After a sufficient number of incidents were performed, participants in both gender groups shifted the IP component to pure discussion. This shift from performance to pure discussion was not preplanned and likely occurred because of the participants’ increasing engagement and comfort with verbal disclosure.  The last 10 minutes were devoted to debriefing or eliciting participants’ feedback about participating in the study. The warm-up exercises, the IPs, discussions, and debriefings were videotaped.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1059840511432316">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>The nurse researcher watched the videotapes a number of times, taking detailed notes to document nonverbal behavior and group dynamics and transcribing the verbal reports verbatim. Both the observational notes and verbatim verbal reports were integrated into a single, written document.  The transformation from videotape to a written document was for ease of analysis. The main focus of the analysis was on verbal reports but observations of group dynamics and nonverbal behavior were used to supplement the verbal reports.</p>
<p>The text was content analyzed for themes and patterns. Consistent with a qualitative descriptive design (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1059840511432316">Sandelowski, 2000</xref>), there was no conceptual framework or hypotheses guiding the study or the data analysis. Rather, the goal was to describe the discrimination experiences of the study population by inducing themes and patterns from the data. The resulting themes and patterns were validated by presenting the final construal to two study participants (one boy and one girl) and asking whether the researcher interpreted the data correctly.  Both participants were in agreement with the researcher’s interpretation.</p>
<p>Seeking feedback from two study participants instead of inviting every participant to review the study findings was for convenience. Both youth were chosen because they volunteered when participants were asked about who was interested in remaining accessible to the researcher for additional information. There was no indication from the focus group data that they or their views differed from the other study participants.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1059840511432316">
<title>Findings</title>
<p>The boys volunteered six specific incidents and the girls volunteered three specific incidents of discrimination. The participants in each gender group agreed that the specific incidents that were volunteered accurately portrayed the kinds of discrimination they encountered routinely.  The 9/11 attacks on the United States were identified as the turning point that prompted interpersonal discrimination toward Muslims. However, participants added that discrimination toward Muslims had increased over the years, in part because of the intensity of ongoing media assaults.  Media assaults further aggravated the interpersonal discrimination the participants experienced, putting them on guard whenever they were not exclusively with other Muslims.</p>
<p>There were gender variations in reports about the perpetrators and locations of the discrimination incidents.  All of the boys’ incidents occurred at school by teachers or classmates. Only one of the girl’s incidents occurred at school and this school-based incident was perpetrated by a classmate. The remaining incidents reported by the girls were perpetrated by strangers in non-school settings.  Gender differences were also apparent in the extent to which the youth were intentionally targeted by perpetrators who knew that they were Muslim.  Although boys reported some incidents that occurred because the perpetrator knew of their Muslim identity, the boys emphasized that they were often mistaken as Hispanic. Thus, some of the boys’ incidents were not necessarily personal attacks but directed at Muslims in general.  In contrast, all of the girls’ incidents were personal attacks by people who knew they were Muslims. Both gender groups also initiated discussions of how they coped with the discrimination. Much of their coping displayed maturity and self-restraint in that almost every example portrayed the participants’ calculated judgments about effectiveness and risk for further harm.  The location of the discrimination incidents (i.e., School, non School) and perpetrator categories of discrimination (i.e., Teacher, Classmate, Stranger) are described next, followed by reports of how the youth coped with discrimination. </p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1059840511432316">
<title>School-Based Incidents: Teachers and Classmates</title>
<p>Seven of the nine reported incidents of interpersonal discrimination occurred in a school setting.  As previously mentioned, school was the location for all six of the boys’ and one of the girl’s reported incidents.</p>
<p>Specific communities were mentioned when describing three of the seven school incidents. The demographic profiles of these communities were well known to everyone in the room, including the nurse researcher and the inter-actors. All of the communities were primarily White, with few minority residents.  However, the communities represented two extreme poles of socioeconomic status: They were either upper-class elite or lower-class disenfranchised neighborhoods. Participants appeared to implicitly understand how these demographic characteristics increased the likelihood for discrimination against Muslims.  For example, when these specific communities were mentioned, participants would nod and mutter, “Oh yeah” in shared recognition.</p>
<p>One of the seven school incidents occurred in the girls’ bathroom, whereas all of the remaining six school incidents all occurred in a class. Teachers perpetrated half of the in-class incidents.  In one of these incidents, the teacher clearly knew that the participant was a Muslim but knowledge of the participant’s Muslim identity was not apparent in the other two incidents of perpetrated by teachers. </p>
<p>Class subjects were mentioned in over half of these in-class incidents. All but one class subject (i.e., math) pertained to U.S. or world history or U.S. government.  Like the shared recognition that occurred when particular communities were mentioned, history or government courses also appeared to have special meaning for the participants.  One of the inter-actors asked, “What’s with these history classes?”  Everyone laughed because the pattern about class subject was so striking.  After the laughter subsided, the participants elaborated that courses that focused on American nationalism were more apt to elicit teacher and classmate negative comments about Muslims.  These patterns are apparent in the following descriptions of the school-based incidents.</p>
<p>One teacher incident involved a teacher who had arranged a group learning activity based on the game Jeopardy. Students in the classroom were called individually to come up to the front of the classroom when it was their turn to play the game. According to the participant, his teacher knew that he was an Arab Muslim because of his name. (His first name was a highly typical Muslim name and his surname was easily identifiable as Arab.) The participant added, “The teacher did not like Muslims because he was a U.S. veteran who had served in Iraq.”  When the participant was called to the front of the classroom, the teacher used his computer to broadcast the Muslim call to prayer.  This prank generated much laughter from other students in the classroom. The participant ignored the call to prayer as well as the laughter while he tried his best to answer the American history question.</p>
<p>Another incident involved a substitute teacher. The participant attributed the teacher’s behavior to the fact that he was the only “brown” skinned student in the class (his ethnic background was South Asian). His school served a primarily White, upper-class community.  He elaborated that his class had, “No Blacks, no Hispanics” and added, “I was the only colored person.” In this incident, the teacher asked for a volunteer to take attendance. He enthusiastically volunteered by raising his hand and repeating twice, “I’ll do it.” The substitute teacher shook her head vehemently and said, “No, I don’t like the way you raised your hand. Sit down and don’t do that ever again.”  His classmates whispered, “I can’t believe she just did that,” confirming that it was the teacher’s rather than the participant’s behavior that was inappropriate.</p>
<p>The third teacher incident occurred in a U.S. government class. The teacher was identified as a veteran of the U.S. armed forces. The teacher was expounding on the Middle East, contrasting the Middle East with the United States. The teacher stated authoritatively, “The Middle East stones people when they do something wrong.” The teacher attributed stoning to Sharia law, which is the Islamic code of conduct about society, family, and individual behavior. For example, Sharia law proscribes gender roles and prohibits alcohol and pre- and extra-marital sex.  The teacher’s comment was offensive to the participant for two reasons:  First, the comment reflected a misinterpretation of Sharia law. Second, the comment was an overgeneralization, characterizing all Muslims and all nonsecular Muslim governments as religious extremists.</p>
<p>Half of the boys’ and one third of the girls’ school-based incidents were perpetrated by a classmate. These school-based incidents included classmates perceiving Muslims as terrorists and denigrating or misunderstanding Muslims. One classmate incident was reported by a boy, which occurred when a new Muslim female student joined his class. The new student was easily identified as Muslim because she was wearing a headscarf. When she arrived, a classmate turned around in his seat and whispered to the participant, “Watch out, she has a bomb.” Another student who overheard the comment giggled.  The participant responded, “That’s not funny. What makes you think she is a terrorist?”</p>
<p>In another classmate incident, a classmate boasted of his plans to join Reserve Officers Training Corps (ROTC) and go to the Middle East to “blow up Arabs.” The boy participant responded, “Those are my people. You might blow up a girl I could have married.” The classmate replied with a pejorative comment, stating, “I don’t care how many women you marry.”  The participant added that he did not continue the conversation because the classmate was “low class” and “bigoted.”</p>
<p>Another classmate incident portrayed a classmate who inadvertently revealed her fear of Muslims. A boy participant sneezed and the classmate who was sitting next to him responded spontaneously with, “Bless you.” Immediately afterward, the classmate became anxious about blessing the participant, apologizing and stated, “Oh my gosh, is that okay? You won’t kill me for saying ‘Bless you’?” Everyone overhearing the incident laughed. The participant perceived the laughter as directed at the girl. He joined in the laughter as a means of “making her feel bad for being so stupid.”</p>
<p>The fourth classmate incident involved a girl participant. It occurred in the girls’ bathroom of a public school. The participant explained that she had removed her headscarf to comb her hair.  A peer noted, “You have such pretty hair. You should leave the headscarf off.” The participant reported explaining why she chose to wear a headscarf. The peer responded, “Whatever!” and left the bathroom. The participant elaborated that the non-Muslim girls in her school are “racists” because they assume that wearing a headscarf is imposed by a dogmatic religion rather than her personal choice. The remaining girl participants joined in, elaborating about their reasons for wanting to wear headscarves and expressing distress about how others perceive them as victims of their religion.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1059840511432316">
<title>Non-school-Based Incidents: Strangers</title>
<p>As previously stated, only girls reported non-school-based incidents. These incidents involved strangers in public places. Headscarves, which visibly identified the girls as Muslims, were the focal point. Headscarves provoking discrimination was also spontaneously described by the boys. The boys had firsthand experience of the plight of Muslim women who wore headscarves and other traditional clothing because of seeing the “dirty looks” their mothers and sisters get when they are in public places. The boys perceived that boys “had it easier” than girls because, as previously explained, not everyone they encountered was aware of their Muslim identity.  The fact that girls were easy targets for people who harbored anti-Muslim sentiments is readily apparent in the two non-school-based incidents described below.</p>
<p>In one non-school-based incident, a girl participant was a passenger in a car with her mother, who was driving on a busy city route.  Both the participant and her mother were wearing headscarves.  A car full of teenaged boys passed and made obscene hand gestures at them.  When the car passed a second time, the boys rolled down the window and yelled verbal epithets about Muslims.  During the incident, both the participant and her mother stared straight ahead. Once they turned off of the road, the participant reported breathing a sigh of relief.  When asked what she and her mother said to each other after the incident, the participant responded, “Nothing. It happens all the time.”</p>
<p>The other non-school-based incident was similar except that it occurred in a local shopping mall. The participant was with her friends, a group of four other Muslim girls. The girls encountered a group of boys who taunted them with physical gestures and verbal epithets about Muslims.</p>
<p>The girls reported that neither of these two incidents was unusual.  They elaborated that they frequently encounter hostility from strangers by happenstance and without any provocation on their part. The hostility typically includes strangers calling them “Dirty Arabs” and “terrorists.” The girls also expounded on their feelings about these verbal epithets, unanimously agreeing that they felt sad when people were angry and hateful toward them. One participant who was wearing a very attractive vibrant blue and gold headscarf elaborated, “Why can’t a stranger come up to me and tell me my headscarf is pretty?”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1059840511432316">
<title>Coping With Discrimination</title>
<p>At first glance, there were some gender differences in descriptions of how the participants coped with discrimination.  Boys explained that they used to routinely laugh off incidents of discrimination but had grown less willing to do so over the years. Presently, their preference was to educate or confront perpetrators. The girls reported that they “ignored” the perpetrators. However, on closer inspection it was apparent that both genders made calculated judgments, choosing strategies that fit the context surrounding specific discrimination incidents. These calculated judgments included assessing perpetrators by considering whether educating them had a chance of being effective and/or whether directly confronting the perpetrator might incur further self-harm.</p>
<p>The coping strategy used by the boy who described the offensive comments made by his U.S. government teacher about Muslims, Sharia law, and stoning is illustrative of educative efforts combined with calculated judgments about harm and effectiveness.  The participant made an effort to educate his teacher about the fact that not all Muslims are extremists and in doing so, also shared his personal impression of the teacher’s overgeneralization. However, he emphasized that he chose to do so in private because he perceived that all of his classmates agreed with the teacher. He explained, “No one is going to listen to me. I was the only Arab Muslim in the class. If I speak up, I am going to be diminished.” </p>
<p>In contrast to directly confronting a perpetrator, a participant explained when it was best to do nothing. His explanation also included a calculated judgment about self-harm. He explained that sometimes it is better to “let incidents slide” because of possible retribution.  He elaborated, “We can’t say anything to defend ourselves. If we do, the government picks up on it. You don’t want to draw attention to yourself.”  He was referring to the fact that many members of his Muslim community have been interrogated by the Federal Bureau of Investigations, reportedly for reasons that were not well substantiated. His comment prompted another boy to describe the following incident: “I watched an Israeli classmate draw pictures of blowing up Palestinians.  He was doing it to bother me. Do you tell the teacher? No, if you do, you’ll appear anti Semitic.” Similarly, girls reported that they chose to “do nothing” and “ignore” incidents, particularly when incidents are perpetrated by strangers who assault them with obscene gestures and verbal epithets. One girl elaborated, “There is nothing you can do with people like this but get away from them.”  </p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The finding that Muslim American adolescents are targets of discrimination is not surprising in today’s anti-Muslim climate.  However, the illustrative examples generated by this study go beyond reinforcing general knowledge and provide more specific information.  First, the findings are consistent with two previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1059840511432316">El-Haj, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1059840511432316">Khanlou et al., 2008</xref>) that identified school settings as rife with discrimination toward Muslim American adolescents.  More specifically, 7 of the 9 discrimination incidents reported in this study occurred in school settings, perpetrated by teachers as well as classmates.  Second, study findings illustrate the alarming prevalence of random harassment against Muslim American girls who wear headscarves or other traditional clothing. Third, participant reports about coping with discrimination suggest that Muslim youth often cope by doing nothing because of perceived futility or fear of retribution.  Given that participants chose coping strategies based on calculated judgments, doing nothing should be interpreted as indicative of their maturity and self-restraint.  In other words, the discrimination incidents illustrated in this study indicate circumstances that left few options for direct confrontation. Although there are insufficient data for drawing definitive conclusions, the data also suggest that upper- or lower-class school districts that are primarily White, classes on American history or government, and teachers with military service to combat terrorism may be more likely to discriminate against Muslim American youth.</p>
<p>It is noteworthy that none of the participant reports about school-based discrimination included school administrators, particularly since both <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1059840511432316">El-Haj (2007</xref>) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1059840511432316">Khanlou, Koh, and Mill (2008</xref>) identified school administrators as perpetrators in addition to teachers and classmates.  The lack of participant reports about school administrators in the present study may not be because school administrators are inculpable but perhaps because of this study’s inductive design and small sample.  If participants in this study had been asked directly about school administrators or if more discrimination incidents were sampled, there may have been reports about school administrators.</p>
<p>Although some of the participant reports pertained to the fact that wearing a headscarf and other traditional clothing makes Muslim girls an easy target for discrimination, it is also important to note that some boys have markers, albeit it less visible ones, of Muslim identity. For example, one of the boy incidents reportedly occurred because his first and last names were religious and ethnic identifiers. Thus, both boys and girls are vulnerable to personal harassment based on their known identity.</p>
<p>The fact that girl participants reported few school-based incidents was curious. More specifically, only one of three of the incidents reported by the girls took place in a school setting, whereas all of boys’ incidents did so. I sought a post hoc explanation for the low incidence of school-related incidents for girls. A spokesperson for the girls clarified that only one of the girls was attending public school. The remaining three girls were enrolled in an Islamic middle school.</p>
<p>The fact that over half of the incidents reported in this study took place in a school setting suggests that school-based interventions are crucial.  The need for school-based interventions is also apparent from participant reports of perceived barriers to intervene on their own behalf. One could argue that reasons for not intervening on their own behalf are reinforced by teachers or authority figures participating in or initiating discrimination. Such behavior by school authority figures is not only illegal according to Title IX and federal hate crime laws but also gives implicit permission for students to engage in similar behavior. This implicit permission creates a climate that tolerates rather than prohibits discrimination and increases victims’ fear of retribution if they try to intervene on their own behalf.</p>
<p>School-based interventions are also applicable to discrimination incidents that occur in non-school-based settings.  Education, establishing norms, and creating a climate of no tolerance in school settings can transfer or carry over to behaviors outside of school.  Alternatively stated, if school-based interventions are successful, those receiving the intervention should be less likely to harass Muslim women and girls in public places outside of school.</p>
<p>School nurses are well suited for taking the initiative to combat school-based discrimination against Muslims. School nurses are recognized health experts and are thus able to influence school personnel by educating them about the health and developmental effects of discrimination. By leveraging their authority about the health and developmental effects of discrimination, they can set normative expectations for a culture of zero tolerance for anti-Muslim discrimination. Also by taking the lead in condemning discrimination, school nurses can model appropriate behavior for school personnel and students who are contributing to the problem.</p>
<p>School nurses should also consider discrimination effects whenever Muslim American students seek attention for somatic complaints. Participant reports in this study of doing nothing because of perceived barriers suggest that Muslim American adolescents may develop somatic responses over time to the stress of discrimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1059840511432316">Gini &amp; Pozzoli, 2009</xref>). Although school nurses might be tempted to intervene by helping Muslim American adolescents personally take action to decrease discrimination toward Muslims, findings from this and two previous studies about teacher and school administrator perpetrators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1059840511432316">El-Haj, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1059840511432316">Khanlou et al., 2008</xref>) suggest that the situation warrants intervention by people with authority, like school nurses.</p>
<p>More general recommendations for school nurses are to be aware of state and federal laws for reporting discrimination and examining their own issues regarding Muslim Americans. Knowledge of laws for reporting discrimination will prepare school nurses for how to handle student disclosure or observing discrimination firsthand.  Examining their own issues will assist school nurses to take better inventory of anti-Muslim sentiments in their schools and communities and provide safety for their students.</p>
<p>Limitations of this study are the small number of focus groups conducted, the small number of girls who participated, the reliance on one key informant to recruit study participants, and the fact that the study population lived in a single area in the United States. As with all research with these characteristics, generalizing study findings is problematic. However, the fact that participant reports are highly consistent with the literature suggests that the discrimination incidents noted in this study are not unique. It is also likely that our study findings about gender differences in school-based discrimination incidents apply to other traditional Muslim girls. The pattern of school enrollment for girls participating in this study is consistent with Islamic norms for gender segregation and typical of how girls are educated in traditional Islam (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1059840511432316">Carolan et al., 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>A recommendation for further research is to conduct a nation-wide survey to assess key patterns in perpetrators and settings in discrimination toward Muslim American adolescents. Results from a nationwide survey will allow determining how generalizable the study findings are to other geographic areas and targeting interventions to those most likely to perpetrate discrimination.</p>
