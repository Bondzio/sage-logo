<abstract>
<p>States in the USA have been reacting to increased budgetary pressures by reducing discretionary budgets, including those for economic development. As a result, state economic development organizations are adopting new strategies such as innovation, clusters, entrepreneurship and economic gardening. They are increasingly partnering with regional organizations and the private sector, including in some instances reorganizing as a public-private partnership in lieu of a stateagency. Calls for increased efficiency and effectiveness of economic development investments have not to date been met by increased evaluation or accountability.</p>

<p>For the past three years, states have faced increasingly challenging budget shortfalls, the result of declining revenues due to the recession, and resistance to the use of tax increases to balance the budgets. Increasing portions of states’ budgets are nondiscretionary, including health care costs, pensionsand education, leaving budget cutters focused on discretionary items, including economic development. These same dynamics are also impacting the federal budget, and so to the extent that the states are the laboratory for enhancing economic development and job creation, the strategies being employed by the states to cope with reduced budgets are instructive.</p>
<p>Several trends have emerged in economic development in the US, replacing the traditional recruitment model prevalent for the preceding decades. Instead of using incentives to lure companies from one locale to another, a zero-sum gameat best, states are now using seven other strategies to compete for economic sustainability. These strategies are generally less expensive to implement than recruitment, and, in some cases, involve pushing activities into the private sector or to local governments, lowering the state contribution and budget.</p>
<p>The first strategy is regionalism. Some states are reducing their statewide focus and instead planning and acting in sub-state regions. This approach reflects the varied geographic, demographic and economic realities of the regions, and allows a great deal of self-determination at the local level. A popular methodology that supports regionalism is ‘asset-mapping’ where regions are encouraged to catalog their physical, social, intellectual and human assets. These maps are then used to build strategies that capitalize on a region’s strengths, and identify ways to strengthen weaker assets.</p>
<p>For instance, the Mobilize Maine project was implemented in three regions of the state,Northern Maine, Eastern Maine and Androscoggin Valley (Western Maine). In each region, an extensive asset-mapping effort was undertaken in 2010, resulting in a new appreciation of the positive attributes of each area. Androscoggin Valley found 10 of Maine’s 14 highest mountains, a vibrant Nordic and alpine ski industry, arts and cultural performance venues, and a substantial transportation and logistics opportunity. The Northern Maine Development Corporation used the asset-mapping analysis to focus on two industry clusters, information technology and energy, as focal points for future economic growth. One leader noted that asset mapping allowed local business leaders to be engaged in shaping economic development strategy. These efforts were funded entirely by local economic development agencies, federal funds and private corporate contributions. No state funds were used at all, reflecting an explicit strategy to drive economic development activity to the regions.</p>
<p>A related strategy that is emerging nationally is the focus on innovation and clusters. Once the purview of technology-based economic development organizations and separate from local, regional or state economic development infrastructure, innovation and clusters have become a buzzword in the states. As traditional industries continue to decline and go offshore, more and more states and regions are looking at their intellectual assets such as local universities and other research organizations, and thinking about how to leverage them for job creation. A related development is the focus on clusters, where analysis of strengths in particular sectors or intersection of industries leads to a sustained investment in a cluster, either through a cluster development organization, or through projects that strengthen a targeted area.</p>
<p>The implementation of many of these cluster initiatives has been regional, with costs borne by states and by large companies in those regions. A notable example is in Ohio where $2.3 bn in bonds were issued to fund the Third Frontier Initiative. The Ohio Third Frontier was started in 2002 and expanded through 2015 as an innovation-based economic development strategy that supports applied research and commercialization, entrepreneurial assistance, early-stage capital formation and expansion of askilled talent pool that can support technology-based economic growth. The program has been funded through bonds authorized by the Ohio legislature and approved by the voters.</p>
<p>The Third Frontier Initiative funded a number of programs including NorTech in northeast Ohio, a regional innovation organization serving 21 counties surrounding Cleveland, Ohio. This is an area that is in the heart of the Rust Belt, a region that has seen declining manufacturing for over three decades. NorTech has used roadmapping to assess its opportunities, and is now focusing on two clusters, advanced energy and flexible electronics. The Advanced Energy Cluster features more than 400 companies and over 35,000 employees, with deep R&amp;D expertise in emerging green technologies. Members of the Flexible Electronics Cluster are world leaders in new materials and technologies and have a skilled manufacturing workforce in fields such as liquid crystal displays and organic photovoltaics, among others.</p>
<p>Another cluster development example isthe Oregon Nanoscience and Microelectronics Institute, (ONAMI) an organization dedicated to increasing research and accelerating commercialization of technology developed at its member institutions. Formed in 2003 as a partnership of Oregon State University, Portland State University, University of Oregon, Pacific Northwest National Laboratories, and Oregon Health and Science University, ONAMI acts as aresource for the cluster, making R&amp;D grants, providing businesses with access tospecialized equipment, and supporting entrepreneurial activities that commercializeresearch. A collaborative organization, ONAMI is using technology-based economic development practices linking its member institutions to create a critical mass in a less-populous state.</p>
<p>Like policy makers in Ohio, economic developers in other Midwestern states are trying to retool their economies by focusing on policies that develop the innovation economy. Minnesota has recently created an 18-member Science and Technology Advisory Commission, while Nebraska’s Innovation and Entrepreneurship Task Force offered policy advice to the Governor in December 2010, calling for increased entrepreneurship support. The Iowa Innovation Council was formed for a similar purpose.</p>
<p>All of these initiatives are private-sector driven, although the recommendations will have fiscal implications for the states. For instance, Minnesota and Michigan each have new angel capital tax credit programs that support innovation-based companies, but have a direct negative impact on revenues in the short term. Angel capital tax credits provide investors with an immediate tax credit for an investment in a qualified company, sometimes as much as 50 percent or more of the investment. This reduces the risk that the investor is taking, and makes investments in early-stage companies more attractive. The state granting the tax credit is assuming that the company will grow and create more tax revenue than is lost through the initial credit.</p>
<p>A third strategy, practiced by all of the states mentioned so far, is support for entrepreneurship. For 30 years or more, the US hasbeen supportive of small business, but as an afterthought to the attraction and retention of large employers. A number of new initiatives to support entrepreneurs have emerged in the last few years, joining the existing incubators and small business support programs that have been in existencein all states since the 1980s. Venture support organizations such as TechStars (Boulder, Colorado; Boston, Massachusetts; and Seattle, Washington), YCombinator (Mountain View, California), JumpStart (Cleveland, Ohio), MassChallenge (Boston), and i2e (Oklahoma City, Oklahoma) all combine mentorship, funding and network development to fast track young and promising enterprises. These accelerator programsare generally based on a competition model—once a year companies can apply and only a small number are accepted—ratios of 10/500 are not uncommon. The companies selected get a little capital, a lot of mentoring and connections, and three months in an incubator-like facility. Well suited for web and software start-ups, accelerators have shown success in obtaining follow-on funding for their participant companies.</p>
<p>This strategy exists alongside a more traditional economic development strategy gaining currency—economic gardening. Simply stated, economic gardening means working with local businesses, usually existing companies with 10–99 employees, to create jobs. New research enabled by the release of a longitudinal database of US enterprise has led to published reports by the US Small Business Administration and the Kauffman Foundation that separate out small businesses from start-ups and rapidly growing businesses. This research suggests that established companies that have high growth are the best targets for assistance—in a word, economic gardening. According to this research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269094211424256">Acs et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269094211424256">Stangler and Litan, 2009</xref>), high-impact firms account for almost all employment and revenue growth. The authors argue that support for high-growth firms would appear to be the best strategy for economic developers, and notes that these firms are 25 years old on average, although they are generally younger and smaller than low-growth firms.</p>
<p>This is a significant transition for many state and regional economic development organizations, which previously used significant budgets to recruit large companies from other cities, states and countries. Now, with greatly reduced budgets, economic developers are finding that they can support local companies by helping make connections, providing financing and expertise, and creating markets (e.g. energy efficiency standards thatsupport local construction and energy companies by creating demand). This effort is seen as less expensive than recruiting and more effective than supporting start-ups.</p>
<p>GrowFL, for instance, is the official Economic Gardening Technical Assistance Program for the State of Florida, created in 2009 to stimulate investment in Florida’s economy by providing technical assistance for expanding businesses in the state. The program provides technical assistance for ‘second-stage’ companies, and helps them grow.</p>
<p>One strategy for which there was new funding during the recession, primarily from the federal government, was green jobs. The policy window formed by the convergence of interest in and concern about climate change, the oil price spike in the summer of 2009, and US consumer’s increasing support of environmental issues, led to a surge of strategies focused on developing a green economy. The definitions of green have evolved to be very broad, including alternative and renewable energy, local agriculture and food production, bio-based industrial products and energy efficiency, among others. Almost $4 billion in funding from the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act (ARRA) was available for research for new renewable energy technologies as well as retrofitting of homes and industrial sites for energy efficiency.</p>
<p>Projects supported included the 845MW Caithness Shepherds Flat wind farm in eastern Oregon, the new Massachusetts Clean Energy Center test facility for large wind blades, a solar energy system in Nelsonville, Ohio and a compressed natural gas facility for Idaho’s Treasure Valley Clean Cities Coalition. For states and regions with projects that were ‘shovel-ready’, this funding was a great help, but otherwise did little to offset ongoing budget shortfalls.</p>
<p>One result of the recession and proposed budget cuts is that questions are being raised about the effectiveness and efficiency of existing programs. As governors and legislators struggle to make cuts, they often ask: Which economic development programs are making the biggest difference? Which are the most efficient? Which are the most effective? Unfortunately, most state and regional economic development organizations cannot answer this question well, if at all. Some organizations make an attempt to collect job impact data, but the quality of this data varies widely and they are generally discounted by legislative bodies. Most organizations do not have the data systems in place to track the companies that take advantage of their programs, nor do they regularly assess the progress of their clients. And, most critically, the organizations lack the analytic ability to determine what would have happened without the assistance offered by the economic development agency, the causality question.</p>
<p>Tax incentives are among the least studied economic development programs, and responsible for large tax expenditures. Generally, these are under the oversight of the state’s revenue (tax collection) agency, not economic development, and, once enacted, are rarely reviewed.</p>
<p>One counter example is the William S Lee Act tax incentives in North Carolina. These incentives were designed to encourage industry to invest in the most rural and poor regions of the state. After several years of analysis by economists at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill found that the Lee Act incentives were not effective, they were replaced and restructured in 2006.</p>
<p>One last trend that has been accelerating in the past three years relates not to strategy per se, but as a reaction to budget pressures. Thirteen states have proposed or have already transitioned from a state agency for economic development to a private-public partnership. The advantages of this change are thought to include increased private corporate leadership, accountability, less bureaucracy and therefore more flexibility and responsiveness. Many who propose these changes also hope that a private-public partnership will mean decreased public budget inputs, although this rarely happens in practice.</p>
<p>States as diverse as Arizona, Iowa, Ohio and Wisconsin are in the process of changing from a fully public model to a partnership model. They will join Michigan (Michigan Economic Development Corporation, Rhode Island (Rhode Island Economic Development Corporation) and Florida (Enterprise Florida), among others. It remains to be seen if these organizational structures are any more efficient or effective at economic development than their predecessors.</p>
<p>2012 continues a multi-year trend of decreasing revenues and increasing pressures on state budgets. The easy cuts have been made, and federal funds that propped up many state budgets in 2009, 2010 and 2011 are no longer available. Ironically, economic development budgets are targeted for cuts, even as calls for job creation get louder and louder as the recovery proceeds very slowly. States are responding with new strategies and shared responsibility with the private sector and their regions.</p>
