<p>Publishers tend to shy away from books emerging from symposia, and this may partly explain the high price of this one. But it really is a cracker: it brings together some of the leading sociologists and related trades working on contemporary Europe, and a good many younger scholars whose work deserves attention here and in the future. </p>
<p>The book is the product of the third and last in a series of symposia in memory of the brilliant Polish sociologist Edmund Mokrzycki, who died tragically early in 2001. The focus is substantially, but by no means exclusively, on the theme of borders, neatly captured in the title, which of course echoes the early environmental classic report <italic>Limits to Growth. </italic>As the European Union confronts questions both of its extensive and of its intensive development (e.g. Schengen the Eurozone), it is an exceptionally timely contribution. </p>
<p>Borders, as Andrzej Rychard points out in a tantalisingly brief closing chapter, are not just geographical – europeanization, like globalization, is also local. Thus, for example, the ways in which different European capital cities modulate interrelations between nations, rulers and churches, in Göran Therborn’s chapter, or the way in which controversies over biopolitics play out in Catholic Poland, in the one by Teresa Kulawik, illustrate different features of Europe’s ‘unity in diversity’. Sven Eliaeson, in a splendidly wide-ranging introduction, stresses the historical importance of the line between Western and Eastern Christianity, what Samuel Huntington called ‘the Velvet Curtain of culture [which] has replaced the Iron Curtain of ideology’ but Bernhard Weßels (who presents this quotation on p. 134) shows that these differences have little salience in observable attitudes and values.  </p>
<p>Poland, as one would expect, has a prominent place in this book, but other parts of post-communist Europe, such as Russia and Bulgaria, are also addressed (included is an all too rare discussion of Armenia); the region as a whole is addressed by Bafoil, François Bafoil’s chapter on Europeanization and Nikolai Genov’s wide-ranging discussion of rationalization. The border theme intersects with those other foci of so much work on contemporary Europe: issues of historical memory and its politics and of civil society. The sociological classics also get a look in, with a splendid retrospective on <italic>The Communist Manifesto </italic>by Bob Jessop complemented by chapters on Elias and Myrdal. One way or another, it touches on most of the bases of contemporary sociology of Europe: finalizing a couple of conference papers as well as working on a book manuscript, I found myself eagerly supplementing my bibliographies and footnotes. Individual chapters also serve as useful ‘tasters’ for their authors’ work published elsewhere, such as Nico Stehr’s on markets, Stefan Immerfall’s on territoriality or Jan Zielonka’s on the fuzzy borders of empires – a term which he seems to have dropped.   </p>
<p>We are left with Europe and all its current uncertainties. As Georg <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0001699311431523">Vobruba (2005)</xref> has argued, the European Union has an inherently expansionist dynamic, whether or not it explicitly pursues this aim, as it did in the end in East Central Europe and may continue to do in the Balkans or elsewhere. At the same time it is clearly getting what Wittgenstein called ‘boils’, as it runs up against limits, not perhaps of reason (Kant) or language (Wittgenstein) but of what is feasible. Winkler’s nasty slogan of 2002 that we may be ‘enlarging ourselves to death’ hangs in the air, as it does in a footnote in Dieter Gosewinkel’s chapter. Yet, in the current crises of the Eurozone and Schengen, it is not the 2004/7 accession states which have upset the common European apple-cart, but the PIGS or, more politely, GIPS, and Denmark (along with founder members Italy and France). And Eliaeson’s suggestion (p. 2) that ‘core Europe is apparently synonymous with Western Europe’ may fit the original Franco-German motor well enough but might be countered by pointing out that it is countries in the northern and northwestern fringe which have opted out of the Eurozone and/or Schengen and in one case out of the Union itself. We should avoid easy stereotyping: we are, in the slogan of a government which has made ‘coalition’ a c-word in the UK, ‘all in this together’. Yet Stefan Immerfall (p. 78) suggests that ‘Trans-European politicisation is more likely to lead to a re-territorialisation of politics than to the Europeanisation of mass politics’. </p>
<p>I end with one of many insights in this book, again from Gosewinkel’s chapter (p. 50). He concludes his analysis of ‘Europe as a Political Boundary Concept’ with these words: ‘Only with profound knowledge of the specifically national stamp given to the awareness of Europe in the countries and societies of the continent can the existence of shared, Europe-wide, genuinely “European” notions about the continent and its boundaries be established.’ Unity in diversity indeed.</p>
