<body>
<p>Wallerstein’s modern world-systems analysis attempts to explain what is important about social life in macro, long-range historical terms. His method of construction has something of the bricolage about it. He takes Braudel’s <italic>longue durée</italic>, employing a 400-year time frame. He takes Parsons’s notion of social system, then globalizes it and adds an historical dimension. He takes Kondratieff cycles, globalizes them and employs a sophisticated version of under-consumption theory to explain how the cycles work. He uses dependency theory to explain the relationship of the parts of the modern world-system to the whole, adding a part (the semi-periphery) and discounting the disastrous development strategy which emerged out of it. He employs the Marxian concept of surplus labor abandoning the centrality of free labor to capitalism or any commitment to the inevitability of a socialist or communist future.</p>
<p>Wallerstein has carved out a path counter to much of prevailing contemporary scholarship. His scope is wide, long and deep. The modern world-system has its beginnings in the long 16th century in much of Europe, parts of the Americas, and small slivers of Africa. By the end of the 19th century the modern world-system covered most of the globe. It is characterized by a system-wide axial division of labor and system of stratification, multiple political centers which, over time, take the form of nation states organized into a nation-state system and, in the 19th century, a dominant culture or ‘geo-culture’.</p>
<p>The outline, shape, and mechanics of what Wallerstein has put together with these diverse parts are available in a number of places – two of the clearest are his <italic>Historical Capitalism and Capitalist Civilization</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0896920512443139">1983</xref>) and more recently, <italic>World-Systems Analysis: An Introduction</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0896920512443139">2004a</xref>). The risk of relying on these clear and accessible overviews of world-systems analysis is that they may give the appearance of a teleological explanation of history which explains the present as an almost inevitable unfolding of its past. The multi-volume <italic>Modern World-System</italic>, by contrast, demonstrates the use of Wallerstein’s construction to make sense of some central elements of the historical development of human action. The risk of the multi-volume approach is that the reader may lose the forest for the trees. This risk is heightened by the length of time involved in the writing and publication of the multi-volume work. <italic>Capitalist Agriculture and the Origins of the European World-Economy in the Sixteenth Century</italic> was published in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0896920512443139">1974</xref>. <italic>Mercantilism and the Consolidation of the European World-Economy, 1600–1750</italic>, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0896920512443139">1980</xref> and <italic>The Second Era of Great Expansion of the Capitalist World-Economy, 1730–1840s</italic>, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0896920512443139">1989</xref>.</p>
<p>The volume under review here appears 22 years after the volume that preceded it. In the preface to the current volume he gives two reasons for the delay. ‘As time went on, I became more involved in many other intellectual activities that competed with the time available to me to write volume 4’ (p. xvi). That is putting it modestly. Rivaled only by perhaps Michael Foucault, Noam Chomsky, and Jurgen Habermas, Wallerstein became one of the best known public intellectuals of the Left. That no doubt took some time off his schedule.</p>
<p>Secondly, the volume of literature that must be covered increases exponentially as one gets closer to the present. One has to sympathize. The task Wallerstein has set for himself is worse than Malthusian – the works to be covered keep increasing geometrically while Wallerstein’s capacity to read them increases, one would assume, not at all.</p>
<p>The focus of this volume is a surprise and will be to some, no doubt, a disappointment. It is devoted to ‘the creation … of a geoculture largely fashioned around and dominated by … centrist liberalism’ (p. xiii). Perhaps even more surprising, the book is almost exclusively Western European in focus, or again in world-systems vocabulary, it is centered on a part of the core, notably England and France. Those who expected Wallerstein’s account of the ‘long 19th century’ (1789 to 1914) to cover the rise of Germany, German–United States rivalry, the scramble for Africa, the ‘opening’ of China to the West, and the coming of the Great War won’t find it in this volume. While three of these stories – the scramble for Africa, the United States–German economic and political rivalry, and the incorporation and peripheralization of East Asia – have their start in the middle of the 19th century, they are, for Wallerstein, better thought of as part of the long 20th century, to be dealt with in the next volume. Besides, he says, struggles for world dominance and capitalist economic expansion are instances of cyclical processes described in earlier volumes.</p>
<p>The struggle of world dominance is in his terms ‘the rise and decline of hegemonic powers in the interstate system’ (p. 276). Volume two covered the rise of the Netherlands to hegemonic status in the 17th century and volume three the rise of Great Britain to that status with its defeat of France in 1815. Volume three covered as well the incorporation of four zones into the world economy – Russia, the Ottoman Empire, the Indian Empire, and West Africa. ‘These were stories we did not need to retell in this volume’ (p. 276).</p>
<p>What is covered here is liberalism. It is approached on three fronts. Ideologically, he describes liberalism’s role in the formation of the geoculture of the modern world-system and its virtual incorporation of conservatism and radicalism as variants of itself. All three variants, he argues, favored progress implemented through the application of scientific principles largely through the medium of the state. Politically, Wallerstein describes liberalism’s role in the construction of the ‘nation’ in nation states, its role in transforming the ‘dangerous classes’ into the working classes and into citizens. Finally, liberalism is described as providing the foundation for the social sciences which take the form of the disciplines of political science, sociology, economics, history, anthropology, and oriental studies.</p>
<p>That many of the positions Wallerstein takes here have been taken elsewhere in essay form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0896920512443139">Wallerstein, 1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0896920512443139">1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0896920512443139">1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0896920512443139">2004b</xref>) hardly reduces the value of this volume. In his essays it is not always clear that world-systems analysis isn’t itself an ideology which, because it can explain everything, explains nothing convincingly. In this volume as in the previous three, Wallerstein makes a good case that his approach, at least in the manner in which he applies it, is considerably more than that precisely because it is clearly simultaneously less than that. For him the ideologies are not social philosophies but political meta-strategies applied strategically in concrete historical situations. The particular form centrist liberalism took (and it took different forms in different countries), the way elites in each core country strengthened state structures (again, elites in each country behaved differently), and the emergence and development of the social sciences were not preordained.</p>
<p>As he has in previous volumes, Wallerstein relies almost exclusively on secondary sources. He makes no claim to be an historian in any conventional sense. He certainly can’t be accused of cherry-picking these sources. He doesn’t use citations from other left-wing scholars as evidence supporting his own views. In this volume, for instance, he uses works by Henry Kissinger, W.W. Rostow, F.A. Hayek, and Gertrude Himmelfarb. Here, as before, Wallerstein demonstrates his impressive skill at giving coherent, fair accounts of historical controversies, identifying common grounds between opposing positions, and deftly integrating this common ground into his own account. This borders on being overdone. Not only are conservatism, liberalism, and radicalism (a term used almost interchangeably with socialism) variants of the same, so are protectionism and free trade. In volume three Wallerstein argued that the Industrial Revolution and the French Revolution were not ‘really’ revolutions. Here he argues that the revolts of 1848 (compared elsewhere with the rebellions of 1968) really were revolutions – succeeding in their collective failures to secure real change in the geoculture of the system (p. 159). At times in Wallerstein’s account it seems as if France and England differ more in geographical locale than anything else.</p>
<p>Any approach as ambitious as Wallerstein’s world-systems analysis was bound to bring with it controversy and criticism. Is it still possible to take the labor theory of value seriously? Do Kondratieff cycles really exist and even if they do can they be explained in the way Wallerstein explains them? Is it possible to clearly differentiate core, semi periphery, and periphery from one another? What exactly is a strong state?</p>
<p>Only the last question is addressed in any depth in this volume. Rulers want to make the states they rule strong in two senses. They want to strengthen their internal authority – the ability to carry out their decisions effectively within their own borders. They want to strengthen their power in the world, increase their capacity to impose their will on other states, and prevent other states from doing the same to them.</p>
<p>Previously Wallerstein has argued that core regions of the modern world-system are in part defined by the existence of strong states within them. In volume two, for instance, he argued that the 17th-century Netherlands was a ‘strong state’. Here he has come to the conclusion that strong states could only emerge in core regions in the ‘post 1789 atmosphere of normal change and popular sovereignty’. Strong states, he now argues, are states ‘with an adequate bureaucratic structure and a reasonable degree of popular acquiescence … and it was the liberals and only the liberals who could construct such states in the core zones of the world-system’ (p. 112).</p>
<p>By the 19th century, Great Britain and France already had relatively strong state machinery. What they lacked was popular legitimacy. What legitimacy they had had was largely lost during the French Revolution. Liberalism in the 19th century recreated and vastly strengthened that legitimacy ‘and thereby cements the strength of these states, internally and within the world-system’ (p. 10).</p>
<p>After the French Revolution and Napoleon, increasing authority within states necessitated the construction and effective use of ‘that extraordinary invention of the nineteenth century – the political ideology’ (p. 23). After Napoleon the authority of rulers depended upon the widespread belief in popular sovereignty within the modern state.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The problem for the notables, therefore, was how to construct a structure that would seem to be popular and in fact was not, but would nonetheless retain the support of a significant proportion of the ‘people’. That would not be easy. The liberal state was to be the historic solution to this problem. (p. 23)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Between 1815 and 1848 Europeans began to accept modernity and the permanence of change.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>… [T]hree positions toward modernity and the normalization of change had evolved: conservatism, or circumscribe the danger as much as possible; liberalism, or achieve in due time the happiness of mankind as rationally as possible; and socialism/radicalism, or accelerate the drive for progress as much as possible by struggling against the forces that were strongly resisting it. (p. 11)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Liberalism and modern conservatism, he insists, has little to do with the free-markets or small governments. While railing against big government and trumpeting laissez-faire, British liberals (along with their conservative avatars) installed ‘parliamentary reform in 1832; the first factory act in 1833; Peel’s budget in 1841; the Mines Act of 1842; the repeal of the Corn Laws in 1846; the Ten Hours Bill in 1847’ (p. 113). These political initiatives, Wallerstein argues, demonstrate the willingness of elites in Britain to use the state to advance their interests.</p>
<p>By 1830–32 the liberal state governed by the liberal center had been established in Great Britain, France, and Belgium – the economic and cultural core of the world-system. It was the model for any state aspiring to similar prosperity and stability (p. 75).</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Maintaining or increasing authority within modern states meant convincing its people that the politics of a state made a difference in their ordinary lives. The people as subject had as its primary ‘object’ the state. It is within the state that the people exercise its will that it is sovereign. Since the nineteenth century the ideologies have told us that the people form a ‘society.’ The state and society form the great antinomy of modernity. (p. 13)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>All three ideologies seem to side with society and the individual against the state but, according to Wallerstein, the anti-statism of the ideologies is largely an illusion, at least in practical terms. Adherents to each ideology employed the state frequently to achieve their objectives. To this day conservatives rail against liberals and radicals for employing the state to advance their goals. Liberals and radicals take great glee in pointing out the hypocrisy of conservatives who also employ the state to achieve their goals (p. 14).</p>
<p>Conservatives emphasized the need to re-socialize the people before they could be trusted to emphasize sovereignty and participate in politics. Particularly in England this re-socialization was the role of Evangelicals who tamed the aristocratic culture of lavish entertainment, alcoholism, and licentiousness and imposed a habit structure of sobriety, savings, and self-discipline on the working classes which would become a distinguishing characteristic separating them from the ‘dangerous classes’.</p>
<p>It was during this period that the strong state was constructed in France as well. France resolved some of the same tensions faced by England through the ‘populist authoritarianism’ of the Second Empire (p. 105). Under the Second Empire, France employed the state to propel the economy tripling foreign trade and improving foreign and domestic investment while steering the economic focus from consumer goods to industrial production. Napoleon III was positively Durkheimian before Durkheim. Durkheim called the state the brain of the social organism, Napoleon ‘the benevolent motor’ of the social organism. As a caveat Napoleon warned that the state should refrain from engaging in activities which the private sector could do as well or better (p. 106). The Second Empire emphasized social amelioration as well as economic development. It was Napoleon III during the Second Empire who led the modernist sector of the middle classes, ‘the true liberals’ away from the ‘party of order’ of the July Monarchy.</p>
<p>Central to building strong states in the core was internal stability, but after the French Revolution that stability could only be built on widespread consensus amongst the population. The ideologies could only take that consensus so far. While the budding welfare state might take that consensus further still, it was ultimately nationalism that welded ‘the people’ together.</p>
<p>For nationalism to be viable the people had to be part of the nation. By the 19th century that meant citizenship. What the rights and responsibility of citizenship should involve has constituted much of what politics has been about from this period to the present. Should citizenship be based on property, education, gender, race, age, religion? Should citizens have the right to vote, run for office, organize political parties, have access to media? Do citizens have social as well as political and individual rights – the right to free education, decent housing, employment, and health care? Citizenship, as Wallerstein points out, has always involved inclusion by exclusion.</p>
<p>In the 19th century, integrating the working classes into the nation meant excluding the ‘dangerous classes’ and of course ‘foreign’ elements. Taming the working classes was in large part a matter of turning their social movements away from attacks on the world-system and into unions and political parties with the goals of higher wages and better working conditions and using the power of the state to do so. To achieve these goals working class anti-systemic movements had to create permanent organizations capable of successfully negotiating with owners and contesting for control of the state in elections. Achieving these goals involved connecting union organizations with political parties. In the struggle to achieve these goals working-class movements ceased to be anti-systemic and became part of the nation state, the nation state system, and the world capitalist system. Despite lots of tactical twists and turns along the way, reformism was, in Wallerstein’s view, inevitable. Whether the object of labor parties was seizing state power or employing the political process to gradually leverage state power to ameliorate the condition of working classes, using the state meant being used by it as well. The state, after all, is a crucial part of the world-system and ultimately can’t be used against the system. Contesting for state power is ultimately, in Wallerstein’s view, a zero/sum game – in for a penny, in for a pound.</p>
<p>Given the provocative critiques of the social sciences Wallerstein has made elsewhere, the concluding section of this volume is disappointing. It is little more than overview of the early history of economics, political science, sociology, and anthropology. The only point he makes is that leading figures in all the disciplines shared a largely center-liberal bias. He doesn’t demonstrate, as one might have hoped, how the social sciences became divided into the disciplines. He also isn’t clear as to whether the social sciences are merely more sophisticated versions of ideology or, as Habermas argues, produce technically exploitable knowledge.</p>
<p>It seems to me that Wallerstein sees the modern world-system as more than an intellectual construct. For him it is part of the real, not just a very useful mechanism for making sense of key parts of the real. I’m as convinced as he is that we are in a period of transition marking the ‘end of the world as we know it’. I’m less convinced that Wallerstein has identified the reasons for this transition and ending.</p>
<p>World-systems analysis is today a fairly moderate form of ‘Big History’. It has spurred work with an even longer duree – 5000 or 10,000 rather than 400 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0896920512443139">Frank and Gills, 1993</xref>). In Big History terms, 400 or 500 years is small potatoes or, as Braudel would say, ‘dust’. Nowadays Big History is the evolution of life on earth, the history of the earth, the solar system, and the universe, to say nothing of ‘a brief history of time’. Charles Tilly’s <italic>Big Structures, Large Processes, Huge Comparisons</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0896920512443139">1984</xref>), though dated, is still a good introduction to the Big History approach.</p>
<p>There is much to be said about the benefits of longer and longer durees, and Wallerstein has said much about it in other places. Still, it’s worth reminding the adherents of the variants of Big History that what is gained by taking the long view comes with a loss of detail, a lot of detail. Is the detail lost consequential? That depends on who is doing the viewing and what they are looking for.</p>
<p>All that said, I wait with excitement for volumes five and six of Wallerstein’s <italic>Modern World-System</italic> to be published and hope that, at 80, this towering figure of contemporary social thought can ‘last that long’. If he’s right about our future he can truly say, as did King Louis XV, ‘après moi, le deluge’.</p>
