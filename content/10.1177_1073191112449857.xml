<p>The original Inventory of Depression and Anxiety Symptoms (IDAS) contains 11 nonoverlapping scales assessing specific depression and anxiety symptoms.

Furthermore, the scales demonstrate substantial criterion and incremental validity in relation to interview-based measures of <italic>DSM-IV</italic> (<italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</italic>, fourth edition) symptoms and disorders. Thus, the expanded IDAS-II now assesses a broad range of depression, anxiety, and bipolar symptoms.</p>

<body>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1073191112449857">Watson et al. (2007)</xref> created the Inventory of Depression and Anxiety Symptoms (IDAS) to complement traditional self-report measures of depression, such as the Beck Depression Inventory–II (BDI-II; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1073191112449857">A. Beck, Steer, &amp; Brown, 1996</xref>) and the Center for Epidemiological Studies–Depression Scale (CES-D; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1073191112449857">Radloff, 1977</xref>). The IDAS differs from these older instruments in two basic ways. First, unlike measures such as the BDI-II, the IDAS was specifically designed to include multiple scales assessing specific symptoms of depression (e.g., insomnia, appetite loss, suicidality). Second, a wide range of evidence has established that depression measures are strongly associated with symptoms of anxiety (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1073191112449857">Clark &amp; Watson, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1073191112449857">Mineka, Watson, &amp; Clark, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1073191112449857">Watson, 2005</xref>). Consequently, the original IDAS item pool contained a broad range of anxiety-related symptoms. The inclusion of these items facilitated the development of depression scales with good discriminant validity and also led to the creation of complementary anxiety scales.</p>
<p>The IDAS contains 11 nonoverlapping, factor analytically derived scales (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1073191112449857">Watson et al., 2007</xref>). The Dysphoria scale—which contains items assessing depressed mood, anhedonia, worry, worthlessness, guilt, hopelessness, psychomotor disturbance, and cognitive difficulties—was created to capture the nature and scope of a large, nonspecific factor representing the core affective and cognitive symptoms of depression and anxiety (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1073191112449857">Watson et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1073191112449857">table 1</xref>). It is not only a strong marker of general distress/negative affect but also contains a secondary component of low positive mood and, consequently, assesses the same basic dimension as the Demoralization scale of the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory–2–Restructured Form (MMPI-2-RF; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1073191112449857">Ben-Porath &amp; Tellegen, 2008</xref>).</p>

<p>The 10 remaining scales assess specific symptom dimensions. Five scales represent specific symptoms of major depression: Insomnia, Lassitude (i.e., fatigue, lack of energy, and hypersomnia), Suicidality, Appetite Loss, and Appetite Gain. In addition, Ill Temper assesses feelings of anger and hostility that can serve as an alternative expression of depressed mood in children and adolescents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1073191112449857">American Psychiatric Association, 2000</xref>), whereas Well-Being taps content reflecting high energy and positive affect that has been shown to be specifically related to depression (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1073191112449857">Mineka et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1073191112449857">Watson, 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1073191112449857">Watson &amp; Naragon-Gainey, 2010</xref>). The final three scales—Panic, Social Anxiety, and Traumatic Intrusions—tap specific types of anxiety symptoms.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1073191112449857">1</xref></sup></p>

<title>The Current Research: New IDAS-II Anxiety and Bipolar Symptom Scales</title>
<sec id="section2-1073191112449857">
<title>Rationale for the IDAS-II</title>
<sec id="section3-1073191112449857">
<title>Purpose of the IDAS-II</title>
<p>These data established that the original IDAS measures a large number of distinctive symptom dimensions in a relatively efficient manner (a total of 64 items). These encouraging results further suggested that it would be desirable to expand the instrument in order to assess mood and anxiety symptoms more comprehensively. This led to the creation of the expanded version of the IDAS or IDAS-II. Our basic goal in developing the IDAS-II was to create new scales assessing other important aspects of the anxiety disorders (e.g., OCD, agoraphobia) as well as key symptoms of bipolar disorder.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1073191112449857">
<title>Relation to existing symptom measures</title>
<p>Most IDAS-II scales contain content (e.g., depressed mood, social anxiety, OCD symptoms) that also is tapped in other self-report scales. Nevertheless, we believe there are important advantages to subsuming all this diverse content within a single, more comprehensive inventory. First, because these scales were developed jointly using factor analysis, we were able to consider discriminant validity evidence directly when selecting items for the final measures. This enabled us to maximize differentiation among the scales so that each symptom cluster is assessed as clearly and distinctly as possible. Along these lines, we subsequently present data demonstrating that some IDAS-II scales show superior discriminant validity in comparison with existing alternatives.</p>
<p>Second, analyses of symptom structure currently are complicated by the influence of format and method variance. That is, all other things being equal, variables assessed in exactly the same way (e.g., using a common response format and time frame) will be more strongly related than those based on somewhat different methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1073191112449857">Johnson, Rosen, &amp; Djurdjevic, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1073191112449857">Reio, 2010</xref>). The IDAS-II bypasses this problem of method-related variance and simplifies structural analyses by assessing all of this diverse content within a single common method, format, and time frame. Put differently, the IDAS-II permits one to examine relations among a diverse array of symptom content without having to model the confounding effects of methodological factors, such as format and time frame.</p>
<p>Third, although the IDAS-II bipolar scales contain content broadly similar to that found in several existing self-report measures, they assess this content somewhat differently. That is, widely used measures such as the General Behavior Inventory (GBI; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1073191112449857">Depue et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1073191112449857">Depue, Krauss, Spoont, &amp; Arbisi, 1989</xref>) and the Hypomanic Personality Scale (HPS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1073191112449857">Eckblad &amp; Chapman, 1986</xref>) assess stable, long-term individual differences in manic/hypomanic tendencies. The Hypomania Checklist–32 (HCL-32; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1073191112449857">Angst et al., 2005</xref>) takes a different approach, asking respondents to indicate how they felt during an elevated mood state. In contrast, the new IDAS-II scales assess current (i.e., past 2 weeks) symptoms of bipolar disorder. Thus, these IDAS scales should provide information that differs somewhat from that obtainable from currently available measures.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1073191112449857">
<title>Relation to omnibus psychopathology inventories</title>
<p>Of course, several popular measures—such as the MMPI-2-RF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1073191112449857">Ben-Porath &amp; Tellegen, 2008</xref>), the Personality Assessment Inventory (PAI; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1073191112449857">Morey, 2007</xref>), and the Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory–III (MCMI-III; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1073191112449857">Millon, 2009</xref>)—already assess a broad range of psychopathology. The IDAS-II differs from these other instruments in three important ways. First, as already noted, the IDAS-II explicitly assesses current (past 2 weeks) symptoms; thus, it does not measure the longer term, more stable forms of psychopathology (e.g., manifestations of personality pathology) that are captured by these other inventories.</p>
<p>Second, content coverage in the IDAS-II is restricted to symptoms of mood and anxiety disorders. The IDAS-II therefore is more focused than these other instruments, which also contain strong markers of both externalizing (e.g., MMPI-2-RF RC4 [Restructured Clinical], MCMI-III Alcohol Dependence, PAI Antisocial Features) and thought dysfunction (e.g., MMPI-2-RF RC8, PAI Schizophrenia, MCMI-III Thought Disorder).</p>
<p>Third, the IDAS-II—which takes advantage of recent data explicating the symptom structure of various <italic>DSM-IV</italic> disorders—provides more detailed and extensive coverage within its more limited range. For instance, as part of its assessment of anxiety symptoms, the PAI includes single measures of OCD (Obsessive–Compulsive), PTSD (Traumatic Stress) and phobia (Phobias). In contrast, as we describe subsequently, the expanded IDAS-II now contains (a) three OCD symptom scales, (b) two PTSD scales, and separate measures of (c) social anxiety/social phobia and (d) claustrophobia. Overall, the IDAS-II provides the most detailed and differentiated coverage of current mood and anxiety symptoms that is currently available.</p>

<sec id="section6-1073191112449857">
<title>Initial Measurement Model</title>
<sec id="section7-1073191112449857">
<title>Homogeneous item composites</title>
<p>In developing the initial item pool for the IDAS-II, we included multiple markers for each of the targeted symptom dimensions. To ensure that sufficient markers were included for each potential dimension, we rationally organized the candidate items into <italic>homogeneous item composites</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1073191112449857">Hogan, 1983</xref>) or HICs (for more detail regarding the logic of this approach, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1073191112449857">Watson et al., 2007</xref>). Specifically, we developed 12 initial symptom clusters tapping PTSD (two HICs), OCD (three HICs), social phobia (two HICs), specific phobia (three HICs), agoraphobia (one HIC), and mania (one HIC). We now briefly review the rationale for each of these target dimensions.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1073191112449857">
<title>Posttraumatic stress disorder</title>
<p><italic>DSM-IV</italic> groups PTSD symptoms into three clusters: Criterion B (intrusions and reexperiencing of the trauma; five symptoms), Criterion C (emotional numbing and avoidance of trauma-related stimuli; seven symptoms); and Criterion D (manifestations of increased arousal; five symptoms). Structural studies, however, have provided extensive support for two different four-factor models (for a meta-analytic review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1073191112449857">Yufik &amp; Simms, 2010</xref>). The first model, which initially was identified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1073191112449857">King, Leskin, King, and Weathers (1998)</xref>, follows the <italic>DSM-IV</italic> organization, except that the Criterion C symptoms are split into separate Avoidance (two symptoms) and Numbing (five symptoms) factors. The second model, which was proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1073191112449857">Simms, Watson, and Doebbeling (2002)</xref>, contains Intrusions and Avoidance factors that are identical to those specified in the King et al. scheme. However, it includes a smaller two-item Hyperarousal factor as well as a broad, nonspecific Dysphoria factor (eight symptoms) containing both Criterion C and Criterion D symptoms.</p>

<title>Obsessive–compulsive disorder</title>
<p>It now is recognized that OCD is heterogeneous and can be decomposed into several distinguishable symptom clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1073191112449857">Leckman et al., 2010</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1073191112449857">Mataix-Cols, Rosario-Campos, and Leckman (2005)</xref> reviewed 12 major factor-analytic studies and established the existence of four highly replicable symptom dimensions: (a) symmetry and ordering, (b) cleaning and contamination, (c) obsessions and checking, and (d) hoarding. These same four symptom factors also have emerged consistently in item-level analyses of the Obsessive–Compulsive Inventory (OCI; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1073191112449857">Foa, Kozak, Salkovskis, Coles, &amp; Amir, 1998</xref>), the OCI–Revised (OCI-R; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1073191112449857">Foa et al., 2002</xref>), and the Schedule of Compulsions, Obsessions, and Pathological Impulses (SCOPI; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1073191112449857">Watson &amp; Wu, 2005</xref>; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1073191112449857">Foa et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1073191112449857">Watson &amp; Wu, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1073191112449857">Wu &amp; Watson, 2003</xref>).</p>

We therefore expanded our coverage in the IDAS-II item pool to include three separate HICs related to cleaning, ordering/rituals, and checking/counting.

<title>Social phobia</title>
<p>The IDAS contains a single undifferentiated measure of social anxiety. However, there is replicated evidence for two distinguishable dimensions within social phobia: (a) a social interaction factor centered around fears related directly to interacting with others (e.g., initiating a conversation, making eye contact) and (b) a performance/scrutiny factor that focuses on fears of being watched by others, as well as engaging in activities (such as public speaking, writing, and eating) that would not be stressful if performed in private (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1073191112449857">Habke, Hewitt, Norton, &amp; Asmundson, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1073191112449857">Hughes et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1073191112449857">LeBeau et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1073191112449857">Safren, Turk, &amp; Heimberg, 1998</xref>).

<p>The participants were 307 undergraduate students enrolled in an introductory psychology course at the University of Iowa (Student Sample 1). They completed a battery of self-report questionnaires in partial fulfillment of a course research exposure requirement. The sample (<italic>M</italic> age = 19.3 years) consisted of 194 women and 113 men and was predominantly White (89.3%).</p>

</sec>
<sec id="section18-1073191112449857">
<title>IDAS-II Item Pool</title>
<p>The participants completed a 169-item version of the IDAS, along with other self-report measures (which will be described in Phase II); respondents indicated the extent to which they experienced each symptom “during the past two weeks, including today” on a 5-point scale ranging from <italic>not at all</italic> to <italic>extremely</italic>. The instrument included the final, 64-item version of the original IDAS, plus a 6-item measure of anxious mood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1073191112449857">Watson et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The remaining 99 items were organized into 12 HICs; a research team that included several of the authors (DW, MWO, KNG, EK, MC, SMS) generated these new items, based on descriptions of the target constructs. As discussed previously, these HICs targeted the following dimensions: traumatic avoidance (7 items; e.g., avoided situations that brought up bad memories), numbing (7 items; e.g., felt cutoff from others), cleaning (9 items; e.g., worried a lot about germs), checking/counting (8 items; e.g., checked things repeatedly), ordering/rituals (7 items; e.g., needed to do things in a fixed, specific order), social interaction anxiety (6 items; e.g., felt nervous making small talk), performance/evaluation anxiety (6 items; e.g., felt uncomfortable eating or drinking in front of others), animal phobia (11 items; e.g., avoided bugs and insects), blood-injection phobia (4 items; e.g., felt faint at the sight of blood), situational phobia (8 items; e.g., was afraid of flying), agoraphobia (6 items; e.g., had trouble leaving my home), and bipolar symptoms (20 items; e.g., thoughts jumped rapidly from one idea to another).</p>

<title>Results and Discussion</title>
<sec id="section20-1073191112449857">
<title>Basic Analytic Approach</title>
<p>We conducted a separate series of principal factor analyses (using squared multiple correlations as the initial communality estimates) in each sample. All factors were rotated using both varimax (which constrains them to be orthogonal) and promax (which allows them to be correlated). In selecting dimensions as targets for scale development, we were guided by two basic principles. First, our goal was to identify the maximum number of factors (and scales) that were psychologically meaningful in order to differentiate specific types of symptoms as precisely as possible. Second, we only were interested in dimensions that were robust and generalizable; consequently, our final scales reflect factors that emerged clearly in both data sets. Specifically, to be retained for scale development, a dimension had to have at least three consistent markers across both samples; a marker was defined as a variable that (a) loaded at least |.35| on the target factor and (b) had loadings below |.30| on all other factors.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section21-1073191112449857">
<title>Scale Development Analyses</title>
<sec id="section22-1073191112449857">
<title>Preliminary analyses</title>
<p>Preliminary analyses of the candidate items revealed two problems related to poor construct differentiation/discriminant validity. First, the numbing items were very strongly related to the existing Dysphoria scale and failed to define a distinct dimension in our structural analyses. For example, a scale created by summing the seven candidate numbing items correlated .84 and .83 with Dysphoria in the student and community samples, respectively. This dimension therefore was dropped from further consideration.</p>
<p>Second, the social interaction and performance anxiety items were strongly correlated with both (a) each other and (b) the existing IDAS Social Anxiety scale. For instance, the summed social interaction candidate items correlated .79 and .84 with the performance items in the student and adult samples, respectively. Similarly, these summed scores had correlations with the existing Social Anxiety scale that ranged from .75 to .80 across the two samples. Not surprisingly, therefore, these items all loaded .50 or greater on a single common dimension that accounted for 93.7% and 89.9% of the common variance in the student and adult samples, respectively. We therefore abandoned the idea of creating separate social interaction and performance scales.</p>
<p>Additional analyses, however, indicated that we could enhance the psychometric properties of the existing Social Anxiety scale by adding in one of the performance items (“I was anxious about talking in public”); specifically, including this item increased the coefficient alpha for Social Anxiety without raising its correlations with other IDAS-II scales. We therefore added this item, thereby creating an expanded, six-item version of Social Anxiety in the IDAS-II.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section23-1073191112449857">
<title>Creation of the IDAS-II anxiety scales</title>
<p>Next, we conducted item-level principal factor analyses of the 80 remaining candidate symptoms; these analyses revealed eight clear, replicable content dimensions. Six of these factors tapped anxiety symptoms. Five factors closely resembled our rational HICs: Cleaning, Ordering, Checking, Traumatic Avoidance, and Animal Phobia. The sixth factor included items from both the agoraphobia and situational phobia HICs. This dimension makes good sense clinically; indeed, both the <italic>DSM-IV</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1073191112449857">Craske et al., 1994</xref>) and <italic>DSM-5</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1073191112449857">LeBeau et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1073191112449857">Wittchen, Gloster, Beesdo-Baum, Fava, &amp; Craske, 2010</xref>) anxiety disorders work groups have acknowledged the close connection between agoraphobia and the situational subtype of specific phobia. We labeled this hybrid dimension “Claustrophobia” to (a) reflect the core content of its strongest markers (e.g., “I felt anxious in small spaces”) and (b) emphasize its significant links to both agoraphobia and situational phobia (for a discussion of how claustrophobia relates to these disorders, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1073191112449857">Craske et al., 1994</xref>). Finally, the blood-injection items failed to define a replicable factor in these samples; consequently, they were not considered further.</p>
<p>We created scales to assess these six robust dimensions. In selecting items for the final scales, we were guided by two basic considerations. First, we retained items that were the purest factor markers (i.e., had high loadings on that dimension and very low loadings on all other factors) and, therefore, maximized the discriminant validity of the scale vis-à-vis the others. Second, we minimized redundancy as much as possible and retained maximally distinct and informative items. On the basis of these considerations, we created a seven-item measure of Cleaning; five-item Ordering and Claustrophobia scales, a four-item measure of Traumatic Avoidance, and a three-item Checking scale. The final five-item Claustrophobia scale included three items from the original situational phobia HIC and two items from the agoraphobia HIC; the other scales drew all of their items from the corresponding HIC.</p>
<p>We also created a provisional nine-item Animal Phobia scale. Although this scale showed good internal consistency (coefficient α = .85 and .86 in the student and adult samples, respectively), it performed poorly in preliminary analyses of convergent and discriminant validity (based on measures described in Phase II). It therefore was dropped from further consideration, leaving us with five new anxiety scales.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section24-1073191112449857">
<title>Creation of the IDAS-II bipolar scales</title>
<p>The bipolar items defined two replicable factors. The first dimension had 11 consistent markers; these robust markers reflected talkativeness/pressure of speech, flight of ideas, affective lability, and the negative sequelae of excessive goal-directed activity; we labeled this dimension <italic>Mania.</italic> The second factor had seven consistent markers representing elevated mood, heightened energy, and grandiosity/excessive self-esteem; we labeled this dimension <italic>Euphoria</italic>.</p>
<p>We subsequently conducted correlational and factor analyses examining these 18 remaining items in relation to the original IDAS scales. Two types of Mania items—namely, those reflecting (a) affective lability and (b) the negative sequelae of excessive goal-related activity—showed poor discriminant validity in relation to Dysphoria; we dropped these items, creating a reduced five-item Mania scale. Similar analyses revealed that two Euphoria markers showed poor discriminant validity vis-à-vis the IDAS Well-Being scale. They therefore were dropped, creating the final five-item version of Euphoria.</p>
<p>Thus, the expanded IDAS-II now contains 99 items that are organized into 18 nonoverlapping scales, plus General Depression (which contains items from several other scales). In Phase II, we present data to establish the construct validity of these new scales.</p>

<p>Participants in the Student 1, Student 2, and Adult 1 samples completed the PSRS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1073191112449857">Cutshall &amp; Watson, 2004</xref>). The PSRS assesses content related to social phobia, agoraphobia, and specific phobia; items are rated on a 4-point scale ranging from <italic>strongly disagree</italic> to <italic>strongly agree.</italic> The PSRS contains five scales. One scale (Social; 11 items) assesses the interpersonal/evaluative fears characteristic of social phobia. Three other scales—Animal (8 items), Blood-Injection (10 items), and Bodily Harm (8 items)—measure various aspects of specific phobia. The final scale—Physical Confinement (9 items)—taps content related to both agoraphobia and situational phobia (e.g., “I dislike crowded places” and “I would be terrified if locked in a small, dark room”); it therefore should converge well with the IDAS-II Claustrophobia scale. Coefficient alphas for these scales ranged from .77 to .89 across the various samples.</p>

<title>General Behavior Inventory</title>
<p>Participants in the Student 1, Student 2, Student 6, Adult 1, and Adult 3 samples completed the GBI Hypomania and Biphasic scales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1073191112449857">Depue et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1073191112449857">Depue, Krauss, et al., 1989</xref>). The GBI was designed to assess an individual’s likelihood of risk for bipolar disorder (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1073191112449857">Depue et al., 1981</xref>). The 21-item Hypomania scale taps a broad range of bipolar symptoms (e.g., distractibility, reduced need for sleep, pressure of speech), whereas the 7-item Biphasic scale focuses more narrowly on affective lability (e.g., rapid shifts in mood or energy) and behavioral volatility (e.g., changes in eating patterns). Respondents rate how often they experience each item on a 4-point scale ranging from <italic>never or hardly</italic> to <italic>very often or almost constantly</italic>. Coefficient alphas ranged from .83 to .92.</p>

<sec id="section39-1073191112449857">
<title>Hypomanic Personality Scale</title>
<p>Participants in the Student 5, Student 6, and Adult 3 samples were assessed on the 48-item HPS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1073191112449857">Eckblad &amp; Chapman, 1986</xref>). Similar to the GBI, the HPS measures long-term manic/hypomanic tendencies, rather than current symptoms. The items are rated using a true–false format. In addition to creating a total score, we also examined the three HPS subscales recently developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1073191112449857">Schalet, Durbin, and Revelle (2011)</xref>: Mood Volatility (12 items; e.g., “When I feel an emotion, I usually feel it with extreme intensity”), Social Vitality (19 items; e.g., “In unfamiliar surroundings, I am often so assertive and sociable that I surprise myself”), and Excitement (7 items; e.g., “I often feel excited and happy for no apparent reason”). This last scale—which assesses feelings of elation, excitement, energy, and high spirits—should converge particularly well with the IDAS-II Euphoria scale. Coefficient alphas for these scales ranged from .73 to .89 across samples.</p>

Respondents are asked to indicate how they felt during “a period when you were in a ‘high’ state.” Sample items include “I am more self-confident,” “I am less shy or inhibited,” and “I think faster.” Coefficient alphas for this scale were .79 (Student Sample 6) and .83 (Adult Sample 3).</p>

<title>Clinician Rating Version of the IDAS (IDAS-CR)</title>
<p>To examine the convergent and discriminant validity of the IDAS-II Traumatic Intrusions and Traumatic Avoidance scales, we obtained parallel clinical ratings using an expanded version of the IDAS-CR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1073191112449857">Watson et al., 2008</xref>) in the Student 3, Student 7, Patient 2, and Patient 4 samples. Trained staff members conducted the interviews and rated the participants on each symptom dimension using a 3-point scale (<italic>absent, subthreshold, present</italic>). To make these ratings, the interviewers asked a standard initial probe question, as well as several standard follow-up questions, for each symptom. The interviewers also were free to ask additional questions to ensure that they had enough information to rate the individual confidently on the dimension (for further details regarding the IDAS-CR, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1073191112449857">Koffel, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1073191112449857">Watson et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>To assess interrater reliability, the interviews were audiotaped; a second interviewer independently scored 51 (Student Sample 3), 72 (Student Sample 7), 50 (Patient Sample 2), and 51 (Patient Sample 4) of these tapes. Intraclass correlations (ICCs) for Traumatic Intrusions ranged from .81 (Student Sample 3) to 1.00 (Patient Sample 4), with a median value of .92; corresponding values for Traumatic Avoidance ranged from .88 (Patient Sample 2) to .98 (Student Sample 7), with a median value of .95. ICCs in this range indicate excellent interrater reliability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1073191112449857">Cicchetti, 1994</xref>).</p>

<title>Personality, Cognitions, Consciousness, and Perceptions Interview (PCCP)</title>
<p>To examine the convergent and discriminant validity of the IDAS-II Checking, Ordering, and Cleaning scales, we obtained parallel clinical ratings using the PCCP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1073191112449857">Chmielewski &amp; Watson, 2008b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1073191112449857">Koffel, 2011</xref>) in the Student 3, Student 7, Patient 2, and Patient 4 samples. The PCCP is modeled after the IDAS-CR and uses the same 3-point rating scale (<italic>absent, subthreshold, present</italic>). To assess each symptom, the interviewer asks a standard probe question and three to five follow-up questions.</p>
<p>ICCs for Ordering (range = .81 to .92; median = .88) consistently indicated excellent interrater reliability. ICCs for Cleaning were in the excellent range in the Patient 2 (.83), Student 7 (.96), and Patient 4 (.98) samples, but the value in Student Sample 3 was somewhat lower (ICC = .68, which indicates “good” reliability). Finally, the interrater reliability for Checking was excellent in the Student 7 (ICC = .91) and Patient 4 (ICC = .96) samples, good in Patient Sample 2 (ICC = .71), and only fair in Student Sample 3 (ICC = .57).</p>

<title>The Interview for Mood and Anxiety Symptoms (IMAS)</title>
<p>We obtained symptom-level clinical ratings in Patient Sample 3 using the IMAS. The IMAS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1073191112449857">Gamez, Kotov, &amp; Watson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1073191112449857">Watson et al., 2007</xref>) assesses current (i.e., past month) symptoms without the use of skip-outs; that is, every question is asked of every participant. Items were derived from the mood and anxiety disorder modules of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1073191112449857">Kessler &amp; Üstün, 2004</xref>) and were designed to cover all <italic>DSM-IV</italic> mood and anxiety disorder symptom criteria. Based on data from prior studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1073191112449857">Gamez et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1073191112449857">Watson et al., 2007</xref>), the IMAS was revised to improve its symptom coverage. The revised version—which consists of 10 scales corresponding to major <italic>DSM-IV</italic> anxiety and mood syndromes, plus irritability—was used in this study: Depression (49 items; α = .95), GAD (12 items; α = .89), PTSD (25 items; α = .89), Panic (23 items; α = .87), Agoraphobia (15 items; α = .87), Social Phobia (15 items; α = .88), Specific Phobia (13 items; α = .81), OCD (19 items; α = .92), Mania (20 items; α = .88), and Irritability (6 items; α = .87).</p>
<p>Extensively trained lay interviewers administered the IMAS. Individual items are scored on a 3-point rating scale (<italic>absent, subthreshold, above threshold</italic>). All interviews were recorded; a randomly selected interviewer rescored 34 tapes. Interrater reliability consistently was excellent, with ICCs ranging from .97 to .99 across the various scales.</p>

<title>Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID-IV)</title>
<p>To obtain current <italic>DSM-IV</italic> diagnoses, participants in Patient Sample 3 (<italic>N</italic> = 290) were interviewed using the mood disorders and anxiety disorders modules of the SCID-IV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1073191112449857">First, Spitzer, Gibbon, &amp; Williams, 1997</xref>). The interviewers were graduate students in clinical psychology who had completed their master’s degree and received formal training in the SCID. We report results on nine current mood and anxiety disorder diagnoses in this sample: major depression (prevalence rate = 26.2%), manic episode (7.6%), GAD (27.6%), PTSD (16.6%), panic disorder (26.9%), agoraphobia (22.4%), social phobia (25.5%), specific phobia (32.8%), and OCD (12.8%).</p>

<title>Analytic Overview</title>
<p>To explicate the construct validity of the IDAS-II scales, we present three basic types of analyses. First, we describe general properties of the scales (e.g., internal consistency, descriptive statistics) and examine the internal structure of the expanded instrument. Next, we analyze the convergent and discriminant validity of the new IDAS-II scales in relation to self-report and interview-based measures of the same constructs. Finally, we examine the criterion validity of the scales by relating them to current <italic>DSM-IV</italic> disorders.</p>

<title>Results and Discussion</title>
<sec id="section48-1073191112449857">
<title>Internal Consistency</title>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1073191112449857">Table 1</xref> presents internal consistency data (coefficient alphas) and average interitem correlations (AICs) for the IDAS-II scales in the overall patient, adult, and student samples; it also provides median values to facilitate cross-sample comparisons. The alpha values generally were strong, with the large majority falling in the range of .80 to .90. The values for Euphoria were a bit lower, however, ranging from .72 (Adults) to .79 (Patients).</p>
<p>Ideally, the AIC for a scale should be moderate, falling between .15 and .50 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1073191112449857">Clark &amp; Watson, 1995</xref>); given that these symptom scales are specific in scope, one would expect their values to be in the upper part of this range. Five of the new or revised scales—Cleaning, Social Anxiety, Ordering, Mania, and Euphoria—met this general expectation, with AICs ranging from .34 to .56 across samples. Overall, these scales tap a range of moderately related content. The results for the five-item Claustrophobia scale were more variable: its AIC was moderate (.53) in the students but higher in the adults (.59) and patients (.62). In contrast, the AICs for Traumatic Avoidance and Checking were consistently higher (≥.65); these two scales clearly subsume a narrow range of content.</p>

<title>Descriptive Statistics</title>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1073191112449857">Table 2</xref> presents scale means and standard deviations in the combined patient, adult, and student samples. As would be expected, the patients reported the highest levels of psychopathology; the students generally obtained intermediate scores, with the adults showing the healthiest functioning. To quantify these group differences, we computed effect sizes using Cohen’s <italic>d</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1073191112449857">Cohen, 1992</xref>) by (a) calculating the difference between the mean scale scores of two groups and then (b) dividing this value by the pooled standard deviation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1073191112449857">Cohen (1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1073191112449857">table 1</xref>) proposed that <italic>d</italic> values from |0.20| to |0.49| represent small effect sizes; those ranging from |0.50| to |0.79| reflect medium effect sizes; and values of |0.80| or greater indicate large effect sizes. Based on these cutoffs, the patients reported substantially greater levels of psychopathology (i.e., medium or large effect sizes) in 13 of 18 comparisons involving the adults and in 8 of the 18 comparisons with the students; in contrast, mean-level differences between the students and adults consistently were small in magnitude.</p>

<p>The results for four of the new or revised scales (Traumatic Avoidance, Claustrophobia, Social Anxiety, and Mania) conformed to this general trend. In contrast, however, group differences on the three OCD scales consistently were small, with <italic>d</italic>s ranging from only 0.30 to 0.47 in the patient–adult comparisons, and from only 0.04 to 0.14 in the patient–student analyses. These small group differences, in part, could reflect the fact that subclinical manifestations of OCD symptoms are quite common in the general population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1073191112449857">Fullana et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1073191112449857">Ruscio, Stein, Chiu, &amp; Kessler, 2010</xref>). Moreover, these data are consistent with the more general observation that OCD symptoms contain a relatively modest component of general distress/demoralization—the nonspecific dimension that broadly differentiates clinical from nonclinical samples—in comparison with other indicators of depression and anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1073191112449857">Watson, 2009a</xref>). Nevertheless, these results do raise potential concerns regarding the construct validity of these new OCD scales that we address in subsequent analyses.</p>
<p>The results for the new Euphoria scale are even more striking: Patients had significantly <italic>lower</italic> scores than both adults (<italic>d</italic> = −0.10) and students (<italic>d</italic> = −0.34). These results raise potential concerns about the validity of this new scale. That is, one could argue that it simply assesses a particular type of positive mood rather than tapping a significant form of psychopathology. We address these concerns in subsequent analyses.</p>

<title>Scale correlations</title>
<p>For ease of presentation, to examine the correlations among the IDAS-II scales, we report combined data collapsed across all the samples (<italic>N</italic> = 4,503). To eliminate mean-level differences across populations (i.e., patients vs. adults vs. students), we standardized the scale scores on a within-population basis and then combined them to permit a single overall analysis. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1073191112449857">Table 3</xref> presents the scale correlations in this overall standardized combined sample. Three aspects of these data are noteworthy. First, the new IDAS-II scales tend to be less related to Dysphoria than the original IDAS scales. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1073191112449857">Table 3</xref> indicates that the other 10 original IDAS scales (including the expanded version of Social Anxiety) had correlations with Dysphoria that ranged from −.40 (Well-Being) to .69 (Lassitude), with a mean value of |.57|. In contrast, the seven new scales had correlations ranging from .08 (Euphoria) to .56 (Mania), with a mean value of only |.40|. These data indicate that the content of these new scales is less strongly saturated with the nonspecific variance that lies at the core of the distress disorders (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1073191112449857">Watson, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1073191112449857">2009a</xref>).</p>

<p>Second, one would expect to see particularly strong correlations between (a) the two trauma scales and (b) the three OCD scales; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1073191112449857">Table 3</xref> confirms this expectation. Nevertheless, the correlations between the two trauma scales (<italic>r</italic> = .63) and between Checking and Ordering (<italic>r</italic> = .63) are high enough to raise potential discriminant validity concerns that we address in subsequent analyses.</p>
<p>Third, Euphoria generally correlated weakly with the other scales, with two exceptions: it was substantially positively related to both Well-Being (<italic>r</italic> = .51) and Mania (<italic>r</italic> = .45). Indeed, a multiple regression analysis—with Mania and Well-Being as predictors and Euphoria as the criterion—yielded an <italic>R</italic> of .68, indicating that these scales jointly accounted for 46% of its variance. On the basis of these results, it seems reasonable to suggest that Euphoria taps a form of positive affect that is specifically related to mania.</p>
<p>These findings are unusual for two reasons. First, Well-Being and Mania are completely unrelated to one another (<italic>r</italic> = .02). Second, Euphoria has a substantial <italic>positive</italic> correlation with both scales, despite the fact that Mania and Well-Being tend to relate oppositely to other variables. This curious pattern is helpful in explaining its associations with other variables, which can be viewed as a compromise between two opposing forces (i.e., Well-Being and Mania). For example, Mania (<italic>r</italic> = .56) and Well-Being (<italic>r</italic> = −.40) are oppositely related to Dysphoria; Euphoria essentially splits the difference and, consequently, has a weak positive correlation with Dysphoria (<italic>r</italic> = .08). Similarly, Euphoria’s correlation with Ill Temper (<italic>r</italic> = .19) falls between those of Mania (<italic>r</italic> = .46) and Well-Being (<italic>r</italic> = −.21). Note that these results also provide a context for understanding the mean-level findings discussed earlier. For example, patients reported <italic>higher</italic> levels of Mania (<italic>d</italic> = 0.57)—but substantially <italic>lower</italic> levels of Well-Being (<italic>d</italic> = −0.66)—than adults. Euphoria again essentially splits the difference between these two effects, such that patients had slightly lower scores (<italic>d</italic> = −0.10) on this scale.</p>
<p>This unusual pattern might suggest that Euphoria represents a “shotgun wedding” of two unrelated components. This is not the case, however. In fact, the correlations among its five items ranged from .31 to .57 in this overall standardized sample, with a mean value of .40; moreover, its items all loaded .50 or higher on the first principal factor in these data. Thus, this duality of content is inherent in the items themselves.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section52-1073191112449857">
<title>Factor structure of the IDAS-II</title>
<p>Analyses of the original IDAS scales yielded a single general factor that (a) accounted for 85.9% to 95.4% of the common variance and (b) essentially was defined by the Dysphoria scale (which had loadings ranging from .89 to .93 across eight samples; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1073191112449857">Watson et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1073191112449857">table 5</xref>). We examined how the inclusion of the seven new scales altered the internal structure of the expanded instrument by subjecting the data from the standardized combined sample (<italic>N</italic> = 4,503) to a principal factor analysis. These analyses revealed the presence of three interpretable factors, which were rotated to oblique simple structure using promax (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1073191112449857">Table 4</xref>). Factor I—which we labeled “Distress”—closely resembled the general factor of the original instrument and again essentially was defined by Dysphoria (which had a loading of .90). Factor II (“Obsessions/Fear”) was marked primarily by the three OCD scales (loadings ranged from .64 to .72); Claustrophobia (.60) and Social Anxiety (.41) also had salient loadings on this dimension. Factor III (“Positive Mood”) was defined primarily by Euphoria (.70) and Well-Being (.69); Mania also had a significant secondary loading (.33) on this dimension. Thus, the inclusion of the new scales—which provided most of the markers for Factors II and III—has expanded the scope and complexity of the instrument by moving it beyond distress-based symptoms of internalizing.</p>

<p>We see strong evidence of convergent validity in these data. As one would expect, the level of convergence is particularly impressive between the two sets of self-report scales, which produced an overall mean <italic>r</italic> of .72 across all symptoms and samples. It also is noteworthy that the IDAS-II (mean convergent <italic>r</italic> = .59) and SCOPI (mean <italic>r</italic> = .59) scales showed similarly strong correlations with the clinical ratings. Finally, it is reassuring to see that the convergent correlations were substantial across all three symptom dimensions (for cleaning, mean <italic>r</italic> = .67; for ordering, mean <italic>r</italic> = .66; for checking, mean <italic>r</italic> = .59) and in both the patient (mean <italic>r</italic> = .67) and student (mean <italic>r</italic> = .61) data.</p>
<p>We turn now to discriminant validity. In discussing these data, it is important to emphasize that valid measures of OCD symptoms should not be completely independent of one another but rather should be significantly interrelated. Thus, the key issue here is the <italic>pattern</italic> of the correlations; that is, whether purported measures of the same construct (e.g., IDAS-II Checking vs. PCCP Checking) correlate more highly than purported measures of different constructs (e.g., IDAS-II Checking vs. PCCP Ordering).</p>
<p>A classic test of discriminant validity is that each of the convergent correlations should be higher than any of the other values in its row or column of the heteromethod block (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1073191112449857">Campbell &amp; Fiske, 1959</xref>). All the scales easily met this criterion; indeed, all the convergent correlations were at least .14 greater than the discriminant coefficients in the same row or column of the heteromethod block. We tested these differences formally using the Williams modification of the Hotelling test for two correlations involving a common variable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1073191112449857">Kenny, 1987</xref>), again comparing the convergent correlations with each of the discriminant coefficients in the same row or column of the heteromethod block. There are six different heteromethod blocks in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1073191112449857">Table 5</xref>, which yield a total of 72 individual comparisons. All 72 comparisons were significant (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .01, one-tailed; <italic>z</italic>s ranged from 4.55 to 11.49). Thus, we see clear evidence of discriminant validity, even between strongly correlated measures of checking and ordering.</p>

<p>Paralleling the OCD data, we see strong evidence of convergent validity in these analyses. As would be expected, the convergence was particularly impressive between the IDAS-II and PCL scales, with an overall mean <italic>r</italic> of .73 across all analyses. Both sets of self-report scales also converged well with clinician ratings on the IDAS-CR, although the coefficients for the IDAS-II (mean <italic>r</italic> = .60) were slightly stronger overall than those for the PCL (mean <italic>r</italic> = .56). Finally, it is worth noting that the convergent correlations were substantial in both the patient (mean <italic>r</italic> = .67) and student (mean <italic>r</italic> = .61) data and across measures of both intrusions (mean <italic>r</italic> = .64) and avoidance (mean <italic>r</italic> = .64).</p>
<p>PTSD symptom dimensions contain a large component of general distress and tend to be strongly interrelated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1073191112449857">Watson, 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1073191112449857">Yufik &amp; Simms, 2010</xref>). Consistent with this broader trend, the discriminant correlations were relatively high, particularly within the self-report data (<italic>r</italic>s ranged from .60 to .80 across scales and samples); the discriminant correlations in the clinicians’ ratings were somewhat lower but still were substantial (<italic>r</italic> = .61 and .64 in patients and students, respectively). We conducted significance tests comparing each of the convergent correlations to the other values in its row or column of the heteromethod block. It is noteworthy that all 16 comparisons involving the IDAS-II Traumatic Intrusions and Traumatic Avoidance scales were statistically significant (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, one-tailed; <italic>z</italic>s ranged from 1.72 to 7.07 in the patients and from 1.66 to 4.64 in the students). Thus, these IDAS-II scales show consistent evidence of discriminant validity in these data. In contrast, the discriminant validity of the PCL scales was more modest; overall, only 11 of the 16 comparisons involving these scales were significant (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, one-tailed).</p>

<sec id="section56-1073191112449857">
<title>Social anxiety and claustrophobia</title>
<p>Next, we examine the convergent and discriminant validity of the IDAS-II Social Anxiety and Claustrophobia scales vis-à-vis conceptually related measures from the FQ, APPQ, and PSRS. For ease of presentation, we report combined data from all relevant samples (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-1073191112449857">Table 7</xref>). Given that these data were collected from both students and adults, we again standardized the scales on a within-population basis and then combined them to permit a single overall analysis.</p>

<p>As expected, IDAS-II Claustrophobia was strongly related (<italic>r</italic> = .51) to the PSRS Physical Confinement scale.

In contrast, Claustrophobia correlated more weakly with measures of agoraphobia (<italic>r</italic> = .30 and .37 with FQ Agoraphobia and APPQ Agoraphobia, respectively). These data are consistent with our earlier argument that the IDAS-II Claustrophobia scale assesses content related to both agoraphobia and situational phobia (as does PSRS Physical Confinement), rather than representing a specific indicator of either domain.</p>

It also displays multiple <italic>R</italic>s from a series of regression analyses in which all 18 IDAS-II scales were used to predict each of the mania scores. The IDAS-II scales jointly accounted for 24% (HPS Social Vitality) to 50% (GBI Biphasic) of the variance in six of the seven criteria; clearly, however, their combined ability to predict the HCL-32 (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = .17) was substantially weaker. Overall, these results indicate that the IDAS-II scales jointly account for a substantial amount of the variance in commonly used self-report measures of mania.</p>

</table-wrap-foot></table-wrap>
<p>Looking now at specific scales, IDAS-II Mania was substantially related to several other measures, displaying particularly strong associations with GBI Hypomania (<italic>r</italic> = .56), HPS Mood Volatility (<italic>r</italic> = .54), and GBI Biphasic (<italic>r</italic> = .51). As expected, Euphoria correlated more strongly with HPS Excitement (<italic>r</italic> = .45) than with the other HPS subscales (<italic>r</italic> = .34 and .31 with Social Vitality and Mood Volatility, respectively); Euphoria also was moderately correlated with the HPS Total score (<italic>r</italic> = .45) and with GBI Hypomania (<italic>r</italic> = .44), which further demonstrates its convergent validity.</p>
<p>Next, we conducted significance tests to identify specific convergent/discriminant patterns in these data. These analyses revealed that (a) the HPS Total score and HCL-32 correlated more strongly with Euphoria and Mania than with any other IDAS-II scale (<italic>z</italic>s ranged from 2.23 to 17.37); (b) GBI Hypomania and HPS Mood Volatility correlated more strongly with Mania than with any other IDAS-II scale (<italic>z</italic>s ranged from 2.33 to 17.95); and (c) HPS Excitement and HPS Social Vitality correlated more strongly with Euphoria than with any other IDAS-II scale (<italic>zs</italic> ranged from 4.87 to 13.24). Thus, the <xref ref-type="table" rid="table8-1073191112449857">Table 8</xref> data display a clear convergent/discriminant pattern and help to establish the construct validity of the IDAS-II bipolar scales.</p>
<p>Finally, it is noteworthy that the GBI Biphasic scale correlated significantly more strongly with Dysphoria (<italic>r</italic> = .62) than with any other IDAS-II scale (<italic>z</italic>s ranged from 5.22 to 19.00). This finding is consistent with our Phase I structural analyses, which indicated that affective lability items showed poor discriminant validity vis-à-vis Dysphoria.</p>

<title>IMAS analyses</title>
<p>We now examine the criterion validity of the IDAS-II scales by relating them to current <italic>DSM-IV</italic> disorders. We first consider correlations with the IMAS scales—which are interview-based measures of <italic>DSM-IV</italic> symptoms—in Patient Sample 3 (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table9-1073191112449857">Table 9</xref>). It is noteworthy that (a) IDAS-II Social Anxiety had the strongest association with IMAS Social Phobia (<italic>r</italic> = .70); (b) all three OCD scales showed clear specificity to IMAS OCD (<italic>r</italic>s range from .66 to .68); (c) Claustrophobia had the strongest links to both Agoraphobia (<italic>r</italic> = .71) and Specific Phobia (<italic>r</italic> = .49); (d) Euphoria (<italic>r</italic> = .64) and Mania (<italic>r</italic> = .63) both were strongly and specifically related to IMAS Mania; (e) Ill Temper was substantially related to Irritability (<italic>r</italic> = .72); and (f) Dysphoria was the best predictor of both Depression (<italic>r</italic> = .74) and GAD (<italic>r</italic> = .72). There are a few anomalies, however. For example, IDAS-II Panic had the strongest association with IMAS Panic (<italic>r</italic> = .65) but it was equally related to GAD (<italic>r</italic> = .63). In addition, although Traumatic Intrusions (<italic>r</italic> = .61) and Traumatic Avoidance (<italic>r</italic> = .59) both were substantially correlated with PTSD, so was Dysphoria (<italic>r</italic> = .63). In general, however, the associations shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table9-1073191112449857">Table 9</xref> make good sense conceptually and support the criterion validity of the IDAS-II scales.</p>

These results strongly support the criterion validity of the IDAS-II scales.

<p>In terms of the individual scales (a) Traumatic Intrusions and Traumatic Avoidance both contributed significantly to the prediction of PTSD; (b) Social Anxiety and Panic were the strongest predictors of Social Phobia and Panic, respectively; (c) Claustrophobia made the strongest contributions to both Agoraphobia and Specific Phobia; (d) Checking, Ordering, and Cleaning were the only significant predictors of OCD; (e) Euphoria and Mania had the strongest associations with IMAS Mania; (f) Ill Temper was the only significant predictor of Irritability; and (g) Dysphoria made the strongest contribution to both Depression and GAD. Finally, (h) Cleaning also was secondarily related to Specific Phobia. This last finding is consistent with previous research and likely reflects the shared role of contamination-related fears and disgust sensitivity in both types of symptoms (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1073191112449857">Cisler, Olatunji, &amp; Lohr, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1073191112449857">Muris, van der Heiden, &amp; Rassin, 2008</xref>); its emergence in these data highlights the potential benefits of assessing these OCD symptom dimensions separately.</p>

<title>SCID-IV analyses</title>
<p>Next, we examine relations with formal <italic>DSM-IV</italic> diagnoses in this same sample. We begin with associations at the bivariate level. In examining scale-diagnosis relations, a problem with standard Pearson product–moment correlations is that they are substantially influenced by the differential base rates of various disorders; specifically, they will be inflated for more common diagnoses and attenuated for less prevalent syndromes, regardless of the true strength of the relations (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1073191112449857">Kotov, Gamez, Schmidt, &amp; Watson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1073191112449857">Watson et al., 2008</xref>). Accordingly, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table11-1073191112449857">Table 11</xref> presents polychoric correlations between the IDAS-II scales and nine <italic>DSM-IV</italic> mood and anxiety disorder diagnoses. Polychoric correlations estimate the associations between normally distributed latent continuous variables that are presumed to underlie observed scores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1073191112449857">Flora &amp; Curran, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1073191112449857">Schmukle &amp; Egloff, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1073191112449857">Watson &amp; Tellegen, 1999</xref>). They retain the relative rank order information provided by Pearson correlations (i.e., the same scales will be relatively strong—or weak—predictors of particular diagnoses) but are unaffected by differences in prevalence rates, thereby facilitating cross-diagnosis comparisons. Diagnoses were scored as 0 = <italic>absent</italic>, 1 = <italic>present</italic>, so that positive correlations indicate that higher scores on a scale are associated with an increased likelihood of receiving the diagnosis.</p>

<p>These results closely parallel the IMAS analyses. Once again (a) Traumatic Intrusions (polychoric <italic>r</italic> = .51) and Traumatic Avoidance (<italic>r</italic> = .48) both were substantially related to PTSD; (b) Social Anxiety displayed the strongest association (<italic>r</italic> = 48) with social phobia; (c) Claustrophobia was linked to both agoraphobia (<italic>r</italic> = .54) and specific phobia (<italic>r</italic> = .48); (d) Ordering and Checking were specifically related to OCD (<italic>r</italic> = .55 and .45, respectively); (e) Cleaning was correlated with both OCD (<italic>r</italic> = .51) and specific phobia (<italic>r</italic> = .50); (f) Euphoria (<italic>r</italic> = .47) and Mania (<italic>r</italic> = .33) both were significantly associated with current manic episodes; and (g) Dysphoria had the strongest association with major depression (<italic>r</italic> = .67) and GAD (<italic>r</italic> = .35). One anomaly is that the IDAS-II Panic scale (<italic>r</italic> = .43) did not show a particularly strong or specific link to panic disorder. Generally speaking, however, these data are consistent with expectations and further establish the criterion validity of the IDAS-II scales.</p>
<p>Next, we conducted a series of logistic regression analyses (another unbiased approach to modeling associations between dichotomous and continuous variables) to identify the unique, incremental ability of the individual IDAS-II scales to predict each <italic>DSM-IV</italic> disorder. To facilitate interpretation, the symptom scales were standardized to put them on the same metric. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table12-1073191112449857">Table 12</xref> presents the odds ratios (ORs) from these analyses. It is noteworthy that (a) Traumatic Intrusions contributed significantly to the prediction of PTSD; (b) Panic had the strongest association with panic disorder; (c) Social Anxiety was the only significant predictor of social phobia; (d) Claustrophobia made a unique, incremental contribution to agoraphobia; (e) Ordering was a significant predictor of OCD; (f) Cleaning contributed significantly to both OCD and specific phobia; and (g) Dysphoria was significantly related to both depression and GAD. Three other effects approached significance: Traumatic Avoidance with PTSD (OR = 1.60, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.93-2.75, <italic>p</italic> = .087), Claustrophobia with specific phobia (OR = 1.43, 95% CI = 0.94-2.17, <italic>p</italic> = .091), and Euphoria with current manic episodes (OR = 2.01, 95% CI = 0.99-4.10, <italic>p</italic> = .054). Two expected findings, however, failed to emerge. (a) Checking did not predict OCD and (b) Mania failed to contribute to current manic episodes.</p>

<title>Basic Properties of the New Scales</title>
<p>Our goal was to create specific symptom scales tapping important aspects of the mood and anxiety disorders not already assessed in the IDAS. We believe we were successful in achieving this goal. Our factor analyses revealed several distinct, interpretable, and replicable symptom dimensions. The resulting scales are internally consistent; moreover, with a few exceptions, the correlations among the scales are moderate in magnitude, suggesting that they reflect distinctive types of symptoms. Finally, these new IDAS-II scales showed good convergent, discriminant, and criterion validity when related to other self-report and interview-based measures of anxiety, depression, and mania.</p>

<title>Review of Individual Scales</title>
<sec id="section64-1073191112449857">
<title>OCD scales</title>
<p>We developed scales that captured our three target dimensions of checking, ordering/rituals, and cleaning. Despite the relatively strong correlation between Checking and Ordering (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1073191112449857">Table 3</xref>), the scales showed significant convergent and discriminant validity in relation to both (a) self-ratings on the SCOPI and (b) clinician ratings on the PCCP (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1073191112449857">Table 5</xref>). They also displayed clear specificity in the criterion validity analyses. For example, they had correlations ranging from .66 to .68 (mean <italic>r</italic> = .67) with the IMAS OCD scale; their correlations with the other IMAS scales ranged from .22 to .43, with a mean value of only .32. Similarly, their polychoric correlations with OCD diagnoses ranged from .45 to .55 (mean <italic>r</italic> = .50); in contrast, their correlations with other disorders (with the exception of the link between Cleaning and specific phobia) ranged from .05 to .34, with a mean coefficient of only .19. The only notable exception to this pattern involved Cleaning, which also correlated strongly with <italic>DSM-IV</italic> diagnoses of specific phobia (<italic>r</italic> = .50). Finally, the scales contributed significantly to the prediction of OCD in both the SCID and IMAS analyses.</p>
<p>Unlike Checking and Ordering, Cleaning also contributed significantly to the prediction of specific phobia in both the IMAS and SCID analyses. As noted earlier, this association likely reflects the shared role of contamination-related fears and disgust sensitivity in certain aspects of OCD (i.e., washing/cleaning) and specific phobia (especially the animal and blood-injection-injury subtypes; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1073191112449857">Cisler et al., 2009</xref>). This distinctive pattern of associations highlights the potential advantages of assessing these OCD symptom dimensions separately.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section65-1073191112449857">
<title>PTSD scales</title>
<p>We included items related to both avoidance and numbing in the IDAS-II item pool. The numbing items were very strongly related to the existing Dysphoria scale, however, and failed to define a distinct dimension in our structural analyses; we therefore abandoned our attempt to create a separate measure of numbing in the IDAS-II.</p>
<p>We were successful in creating a measure of Traumatic Avoidance, however, so that the expanded IDAS-II now includes two trauma-based scales (the other being Traumatic Intrusions). These scales showed significant convergent and discriminant validity in relation to both (a) self-ratings on the PCL and (b) clinician ratings on the IDAS-CR (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1073191112449857">Table 6</xref>). They also displayed clear specificity in the criterion validity analyses. Traumatic Intrusions had a mean correlation of .56 with our two PTSD criteria (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table9-1073191112449857">Tables 9</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table11-1073191112449857">11</xref>); in contrast, its correlations with the other disorders ranged from .02 to .54, with an average value of only .31. Similarly, Traumatic Avoidance had an average correlation of .54 with the PTSD criteria; its other correlations ranged from .12 to .54, with a mean value of only .33. Finally, Traumatic Intrusions contributed significantly to the prediction of PTSD in both analyses; taken together with the results of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1073191112449857">Watson et al. (2008)</xref>, it now has shown incremental validity in predicting PTSD in three separate analyses. Traumatic Avoidance also made an incremental contribution in both analyses, although this effect only approached significance in the SCID data.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section66-1073191112449857">
<title>Social anxiety</title>
<p>We attempted to create separate scales tapping social interaction and performance fears in the IDAS-II. This attempt failed, as all our social anxiety items defined a single undifferentiated dimension. However, we were able to create an expanded, six-item version of the Social Anxiety scale by adding in one of the newly written performance items. This augmented scale consistently showed good convergent, discriminant, and criterion validity in our data. It correlated strongly with self-report social phobia measures from the APPQ (<italic>r</italic> = .68), PSRS (<italic>r</italic> = .59), and FQ (<italic>r</italic> = .53). It also displayed clear specificity in the criterion validity analyses. Overall, Social Anxiety had a mean correlation of .59 with our social phobia criteria; in contrast, its correlations with the other disorders ranged from .05 to .59, with an average value of only .37. Finally, Social Anxiety contributed significantly to the prediction of social phobia in both analyses; taken together with the results of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1073191112449857">Watson et al. (2008)</xref>, this scale now has shown incremental validity in predicting social phobia in three separate analyses.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section67-1073191112449857">
<title>Claustrophobia</title>
<p>We included four separate groups of items assessing animal phobia, blood-injection phobia, situational phobia, and agoraphobia in the IDAS-II pool. The blood-injection items failed to define a replicable factor in our scale development samples and were dropped from further consideration. A provisional Animal Phobia scale performed poorly in preliminary analyses of convergent and discriminant validity; it also was dropped. Finally, items from the agoraphobia and situational phobia HICs jointly defined a robust factor. We created the IDAS-II Claustrophobia scale—which contains three of the original situational phobia items plus two agoraphobia items—to assess this dimension.</p>
<p>Consistent with its origins, this scale is best viewed as assessing content related to both agoraphobia and situational phobia, rather than as a specific indicator of either domain. For example, it correlated more strongly with the PSRS Physical Confinement scale (<italic>r</italic> = .51) than with specific measures of agoraphobia (<italic>r</italic>s ranged from .30 to .37). Furthermore, it correlated substantially with interview-based measures of both agoraphobia (mean <italic>r</italic> = .62) and specific phobia (mean <italic>r</italic> = .48), and contributed to the prediction of both disorders in our criterion validity analyses (although the effect in the SCID data only approached significance). We believe that its inclusion represents an important expansion of the symptom coverage in the IDAS-II. In this regard, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1073191112449857">Watson et al. (2008)</xref> found that the original IDAS scales accounted for little variance in diagnoses of specific phobia; in contrast, our current data establish that the IDAS-II scales now account for substantial variance in both specific phobia and agoraphobia.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section68-1073191112449857">
<title>Bipolar scales</title>
<p>We created two bipolar symptom scales for the IDAS-II. The new Mania scale showed substantial convergent validity with existing self-report mania scales; it converged particularly well with GBI Hypomania (<italic>r</italic> = .56), HPS Mood Volatility (<italic>r</italic> = .54), and GBI Biphasic (<italic>r</italic> = .51). Moreover, Mania exhibited significant criterion validity across various analyses. It correlated particularly strongly (<italic>r</italic> = .63) with the IMAS Mania scale and also was significantly associated with current manic episode diagnoses (<italic>r</italic> = .33). Multivariate analyses indicated that the scale showed significant incremental power in predicting IMAS Mania (β = .35), but not in relation to current manic episodes on the SCID. Overall, the available evidence is encouraging, in that it indicates that the scale (a) overlaps substantially with existing self-report measures of mania and (b) captures clinically meaningful variance that is specifically related to <italic>DSM-IV</italic> bipolar disorders.</p>
<p>The new Euphoria scale has some curious properties. Most notably, it had substantial positive correlations with both Mania (<italic>r</italic> = .45) and Well-Being (<italic>r</italic> = .51); together, these two scales jointly accounted for 46% of the variance in Euphoria. As discussed previously, this pattern is unusual, given that Mania and Well-Being (a) are completely unrelated to one another (<italic>r</italic> = .02) and (b) tend to have <italic>opposite</italic> relations with other variables. Despite this complex pattern, however, the scale itself is unidimensional, indicating that this striking duality of content is inherent in the items themselves. In light of these data, Euphoria can be viewed as capturing the elevated, expansive mood that is a hallmark of many manic episodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1073191112449857">American Psychiatric Association, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1073191112449857">Gruber, Mauss, &amp; Tamir, 2011</xref>); thus, it essentially represents a pathological type of positive affect.</p>
<p>Euphoria showed significant convergent validity in relation to other self-report mania measures, although these associations tended to be more moderate than those observed for Mania (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table8-1073191112449857">Table 8</xref>). Its strongest associations were with the HPS Total score (<italic>r</italic> = .45), HPS Excitement subscale (<italic>r</italic> = .45), IDAS-II Mania (<italic>r</italic> = .45), and GBI Hypomania (<italic>r</italic> = .44).</p>
<p>Finally, it is important to note that Euphoria demonstrated strong criterion validity in our data. At the bivariate level, in fact, it had the strongest individual associations with both IMAS Mania (<italic>r</italic> = .64) and current manic episodes (<italic>r</italic> = .47). In the multivariate analyses, the scale displayed significant incremental power in predicting IMAS Mania (β = .40) and also showed a nonsignificant trend in relation to current manic episodes (OR = 2.01, <italic>p</italic> = .054).</p>
<p>In summary, Euphoria showed good convergent validity and substantial criterion validity. Given its highly distinctive nature—and the fact that it contains some unique variance that is not assessed by existing mania scales (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table8-1073191112449857">Table 8</xref>)—we believe it represents a significant incremental contribution to the assessment of bipolar symptoms.</p>
</sec></sec>
<sec id="section69-1073191112449857">
<title>Expanded Scope of the IDAS-II</title>
<p>Analyses of the original IDAS scales yielded a single general factor (“Distress”) that essentially represents distress-based symptoms of internalizing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1073191112449857">Watson et al., 2007</xref>). The inclusion of the seven new scales altered the internal structure of the expanded instrument, which now contains additional dimensions that we labeled <italic>Obsessions/Fear</italic> and <italic>Positive Mood</italic>. It is interesting to note that this three-factor model seems to be broadly congruent with the higher order structure of psychopathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1073191112449857">Markon, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1073191112449857">Sellbom, Ben-Porath, &amp; Bagby, 2008</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1073191112449857">Sellbom et al. (2008)</xref> reported that the Restructured Clinical Scales of the MMPI-2-RF also define a three-factor structure consisting of Internalizing, Externalizing (which includes manifestations of mania), and Thought Disturbance (a domain that includes OCD symptoms as significant markers; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1073191112449857">Chmielewski &amp; Watson, 2008a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1073191112449857">2008b</xref>). Thus, the expanded IDAS-II has moved beyond emotion-based manifestations of internalizing and also assesses other important types of symptoms.</p>

<title>Limitations and Future Directions</title>
<sec id="section71-1073191112449857">
<title>Importance of longitudinal data</title>
<p>Although these results are encouraging, we also must acknowledge several significant limitations of our data. First, we need a broader range of reliability and validity evidence to explicate the construct validity of these scales more fully. For example, our current data are completely cross-sectional in nature so that we do not know how scores on these new scales change as a function of time or in response to treatment. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1073191112449857">Watson et al. (2007)</xref> reported that the original IDAS scales displayed strong short-term retest reliability and also showed some sensitivity to change; it will be important to collect similar data on these new scales.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section72-1073191112449857">
<title>Need for replication</title>
<p>Our results are limited to college student, community adult, and psychiatric outpatient samples. It will be important to replicate these findings in other populations, such as adolescents and older adults. Moreover, most of our participants were White and non-Hispanic; it therefore is important to examine the generalizability of these findings in more ethnically diverse samples. Finally, although we were able to show that most of our main criterion validity results replicated across both the IMAS and the SCID, these analyses were limited to a single outpatient sample (Patient Sample 3); it therefore will be important to establish the robustness of these findings in other samples.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section73-1073191112449857">
<title>Changes to the DSM</title>
<p>Finally, our criterion validity analyses are limited to <italic>DSM-IV</italic> symptoms and disorders, which will soon be supplanted by a new nosological scheme (<italic>DSM-5</italic>) that is scheduled for implementation in 2013 (for information about proposed changes in <italic>DSM-5</italic>, go to: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.dsm5.org/Pages/Default.aspx">http://www.dsm5.org/Pages/Default.aspx</ext-link>). Although it will be desirable to collect data on <italic>DSM-5</italic> criteria in the future, we do not view this as a significant problem for three reasons. First, it appears that the symptom criteria for those disorders most directly relevant to our scales (e.g., major depression, panic disorder, OCD, PTSD) are not undergoing major changes in <italic>DSM-5</italic>. For example, the current proposal for <italic>DSM-5</italic> PTSD is to replace the existing tripartite scheme with the four-factor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1073191112449857">King et al. (1998)</xref> model; consequently, the one basic change is to separate symptoms of avoidance and numbing into distinct clusters.</p>
<p>Second, the proposed changes in <italic>DSM-5</italic> have not yet been finalized. It therefore would be premature to base validity analyses on these tentative new criteria. In fact, we believe that data such as ours have the potential to inform these ongoing deliberations. For instance, consistent with other evidence (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1073191112449857">Gootzeit &amp; Markon, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1073191112449857">Watson, 2009a</xref>), our Phase I data indicated that numbing symptoms have a substantial component of general distress/dysphoria and show poor discriminant validity vis-à-vis depression and other types of internalizing psychopathology. These results raise questions about the overall utility of these numbing symptoms in the diagnosis of PTSD.</p>
<p>Finally—and most important—our scales are designed to assess the basic symptom dimensions underlying <italic>DSM</italic> disorders, rather than to serve as screening instruments for the diagnoses themselves. As such, they are not closely tethered to the <italic>DSM</italic>; indeed, it is noteworthy that several scales actually cut across current <italic>DSM</italic> boundaries. For example, the new Claustrophobia scale assesses content related to both agoraphobia and specific phobia. Similarly, Ill Temper (which taps anger and hostility) and Well-Being (which measures high energy and positive affect) contain content relevant to multiple <italic>DSM</italic> disorders. In a related vein, the structure defined by the IDAS-II depression scales deviates significantly from the current organization in the <italic>DSM</italic>. For instance, Lassitude contains items reflecting both fatigue/anergia (Criterion 6 for a major depressive episode) and hypersomnia (part of Criterion 4), whereas Dysphoria subsumes content from five different major depressive episode criteria. Thus, the clinical and research utility of the scales is largely unaffected by periodic changes in the <italic>DSM</italic>’s specification of these disorders.</p>
</sec></sec>
<sec id="section74-1073191112449857">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In fact, one of our basic goals in developing the IDAS and IDAS-II was to create a diverse instrument that would bypass various problems associated with disorder-based analyses (including the complicating effects of changing diagnostic criteria; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1073191112449857">Watson, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1073191112449857">2009a</xref>) and provide an alternative dimensional approach for addressing key issues such as (a) the specificity versus nonspecificity of different types of symptom content and (b) the underlying structure of psychopathology. With the addition of these new anxiety and bipolar symptom scales, the expanded IDAS-II now provides broad coverage of the homogeneous symptom dimensions underlying major depression, the bipolar disorders, PTSD, panic disorder, agoraphobia, social phobia, specific phobia, and OCD. Although the instrument still is not completely comprehensive (e.g., its coverage of specific phobia remains limited), this expanded coverage greatly improves its ability to address these important issues.</p>
