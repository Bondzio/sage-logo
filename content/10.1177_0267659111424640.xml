<abstract>
<p>Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) still represents a serious problem in clinical routine and is associated with a high mortality. Several concepts are known for special treatment, but, in some instances, the application of an extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is necessary for both the improvement of oxygenation and the elimination of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>). One basic aspect in lung protective ventilation in this context is alveolar recruitment, which can be achieved by different approaches, such as “the open lung concept”, according to Lachmann, or by additional kinetic therapy. The most exposed feature of this entity is ‘prone’, which may be quite challenging in patients requiring extracorporeal support or organ replacement therapy under ongoing critical illness.</p>
<p>We report two outstanding cases of prone under conditions of a veno-venous ECMO therapy which improved significantly under this position. Furthermore, we reflect critically possible risk factors and adverse events of such procedures and afford a current view from the literature.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) remains a worldwide substantial problem in intensive care medicine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0267659111424640">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0267659111424640">3</xref></sup>. The underlying reasons for the development are various and of high relevance for all basic therapy strategies. The incidence of a severe ARDS depends on the region: from 1.5 cases /100,000 inhabitants per year up to 87 cases/100,000 inhabitants per year in the United States<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0267659111424640">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0267659111424640">10</xref></sup> and increases in times of pandemic respiratory relevant infections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0267659111424640">11</xref></sup>. Mortality rates remain high and have been reported to be 66%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0267659111424640">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0267659111424640">12</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Besides the basic treatment of the causative entities, different therapeutic options have become standard concepts, such as lung-protective ventilation with low tidal volumes or adjunctive SIRS (systemic inflammatory response syndrome)-sepsis therapy. Other approaches, e.g. the application of corticosteroids or the use of inhalative nitric oxide (NO) and/or prostacyclin, are still matter under discussion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0267659111424640">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0267659111424640">14</xref></sup>.</p>
<p>Imaging diagnostic criteria commonly include X-ray of the chest and CT-scans. In many cases, CT-scans show excellently the differently affected parts of the lung from which the medial sections can frequently be classified as recruitable. Thus, the recruitment therapy and the “open-lung-concept”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0267659111424640">15</xref></sup> have become crucial parts of the treatment. This includes not only the choice of the best PEEP, but also kinetic therapy in order to achieve an effective alveolar ventilation with the best ventilation/perfusion ratio. On account of this background, the prone position is widely used for such a goal, with satisfactory benefit<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0267659111424640">16</xref></sup>. This, however, may often be handicapped in the critically ill by coincident running of extracorporeal organ replacement therapy, such as hemofiltration, intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation or even ECMO. In this context, clinical data are relatively rare. Thus, we present two unique cases of adult and massive obese patients suffering from a severe ARDS, requiring veno-venous ECMO therapy, who did not improve significantly until concomitant prone position was performed.</p>

<title>Clinical cases</title>
<sec id="section3-0267659111424640">
<title>Case 1</title>
<p>A 21-year-old woman was admitted to a basic hospital with generalized exanthema and pyrexia up to 39°C. Her body mass index (BMI) was 61 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. Mechanical ventilation due to oxygenation failure was necessary one day after admission to the hospital. Since antibiotic drug therapy for suspicion of pneumonia using a carbapenem, clindamycine and a macrolide had not led to success, and even using a PEEP of 18 cmH<sub>2</sub>0 and a FiO<sub>2</sub> of 0.8 oxygenation and ventilation were not satisfactory, our mobile extracorporeal life support team travelled to the peripheral hospital and established a veno-venous ECMO circuit percutaneously from the right femoral vein to the right jugular vein. Subsequently, the patient was admitted to our center. Radiologic findings ensured a diagnose of a severe ARDS due to pneumonia with massive pleural effusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0267659111424640">Figure 1</xref>). Under conditions of the running ECMO system, we performed ultraprotective lung ventilation, using very low tidal volumes of 4 ml/kg bodyweight and carried out repetitive recruitment maneuvers according to Lachmann<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0267659111424640">15</xref></sup>. We increased PEEP up to 20 cmH<sub>2</sub>0. Meanwhile, microbiologic examination showed evidence for H1N1 from the alveolar lavages, as well as coagulases negative staphylococci. For this, we changed the antibiotic treatment to vancomycine, ciprofloxacine and metronidazole. Furthermore, we performed a five-day period of virostatic therapy with a neuramidases inhibitor (Tamiflu<sup>©</sup>). The patient developed acute renal failure due to the severe ongoing sepsis, with a need for renal replacement therapy and both oxygenation and elimination of carbon dioxide remained difficult. Even under extracorporeal circulation, the body temperature increased to 38.8°C. The infectious parameters peaked at 15.1 µg/l procalcitonin (PCT), 80 ng/l interleukin-6 (IL-6), 16.6 mg/dl C-reactive protein (CRP) and 30.6x10<sup>3</sup>/µl leukocytes. Thus, the patient was kept in a prone position of 135° once daily for 4 hours three days running (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0267659111424640">Figure 2</xref>). This finally led to a sustainable improvement and the ECMO system could be removed after nine days. Further controls of bronchoalveolar lavages had run uneventful. After the establishment of a surgical tracheostomy, the definite weaning process was started and the patient could be discharged to her primary referring hospital.</p>

<title>Case 2</title>
<p>A 46-year-old male patient was admitted to the general hospital due to dyspnoea and atrial fibrillation. The BMI of this patient was 51 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. After further respiratory deterioration, the patient underwent endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. Since oxygenation was not satisfactory even under an FiO<sub>2</sub> of 1.0 and using a PEEP of 20 cmH<sub>2</sub>0, our mobile extracorporeal life support team travelled to this hospital and established a veno-venous ECMO from the right femoral vein to the right jugular vein. The patient was subsequently transported to our institution and underwent primary ultraprotective lung ventilation with low tidal volumes of 3-4 ml/kg bodyweight. X-ray of the chest showed massive venous congestion and moderate bilateral infiltrates so that the diagnosis of a severe ARDS was drawn (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0267659111424640">Figure 3</xref>).</p>

<p>Concurrent results from the alveolar lavages showed oxacillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (OSRSA). For this we changed the initial antibiotic drug therapy from piperacilline, including a beta-lactamases inhibitor, to a triple therapy, consisting of vancomycine, ciprofloxacine and metronidazole. Further alveolar lavages showed evidence for Candida glabrata as well as Candida albicans so an additional antimycotic therapy with anidulafungin was performed. Clinical improvement, however, did not set in until the patient was also put into a prone position of 135° once a day for four hours four days running under ECMO therapy. Renal function remained stable and after four days of intermittent prone the weaning process of the ECMO was started and it was removed after a total of twelve days. Body temperature proved to be stable below 38°C under extracorporeal circulation and the infectious parameters peaked at 12.6 mg/dl (CRP) and 15.4x10<sup>3</sup>/µl (leukocytes). Under use of a surgical tracheostomy, the patient underwent a further weaning process from mechanical ventilation successfully.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Mechanical ventilation is one crucial aspect that influences the duration in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) sustainable. Unreflected adjustment of the respirator, however, may induce several adverse aspects of mechanical ventilation, such as barotrauma, volutrauma, trauma by atelectases or biotrauma with the releasing of mediators which are able to aggravate a systemic inflammatory process during an ongoing ARDS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0267659111424640">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0267659111424640">18</xref></sup>. For an early restoration in cases of severe pulmonary failure, Lachmann developed, in 1982, his “open lung concept” and claimed a lasting recruitment of recruitable alveoles, choosing high PEEP values and intermittent positive pressure ventilation up to 50 cmH<sub>2</sub>0<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0267659111424640">15</xref></sup>. However, in some instances, this concept alone does not lead to final success and, especially in cases of frequent repetition, the deleterious effects on pulmonary trauma may once more occur. Thus, different alternative and/or additive approaches for a helpful recruitment have been pursued. One of these concepts is represented by specific kinetic therapy in order to improve the ventilation-perfusion coefficient: routine prone position has been described to be helpful, going by these results, in many cases. Charron and colleagues report on employing this method in clinical practice since 1997 and presented a total of 218 patients with ARDS, from whom 57 were kept in the prone position, and they claimed a satisfactory feasibility and a sustaining improvement in oxygenation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0267659111424640">19</xref></sup>. Gattinoni et al. presented, in 2001, a multi-center trial and compared each of 152 patients who were treated for ARDS, either in the prone or supine position, and found a comparable incidence of major complications in both groups<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0267659111424640">20</xref></sup>. Furthermore, the positive effect of prone on pleural effusion is reported in contrast to those patients who remain in a supine position<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0267659111424640">21</xref></sup>. But, of course, such procedures hold not only advantages, but also disadvantages: bleeding from appliance insertion sites, appliance dislodgment, unplanned extubation, cutaneous pressure ulceration, corneal abrasion or extreme hemodynamic instability with excessive need for catecholamines are the most prominent instances for major complications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0267659111424640">22</xref></sup>. Cardiac surgical patients may have an increased risk for severe sternal wound complications because of the shear stress the sternal bone is subjected to. Similar conditions apply for large abdominal wounds following major visceral surgery.</p>
<p>Our institution has practised using the prone position for more then ten years, even though clinical data from cardiac surgery is still lacking. Besides that, data concerning patients suffering from an ARDS undergoing concomitant extracorporeal circulation, e.g. renal replacement therapy or mechanical circulatory support (intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation) is thin on the ground. Only Goettler and colleagues report a small series of seven patients undergoing prone under running acute renal replacement therapy (CVVHDF) and show only one case of a prone-associated cannula complication<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0267659111424640">23</xref></sup>. To our knowledge, no clinical case for an adult patient has yet been presented on keeping a patient in the prone position under ongoing ECMO therapy. However, a single series exists that reports 63 children with a median age of twelve months receiving ECMO therapy due to severe pulmonary failure who were, additionally, kept in the prone position<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0267659111424640">22</xref></sup>. From this group, 52 patients were discharged from hospital and no major complication occurred that could be associated with prone.</p>
<p>It is self-explanatory that imminent complications, such as dislocation or deviation of the cannulas, can have disastrous consequences and even may cause the patient’s death once they occur. An alternative approach is represented by kinetic therapy in a special pivoting bed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0267659111424640">24</xref></sup>. The underlying data for this, however, are heterogeneous and it can be assumed that the efficacy of alveolar recruitment is not superior to prone. In addition, neither of our patients in the current report were really suitable for a special pivoting bed, remembering the BMI of up to 60 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. Thus, we support a highly specialized team performing prone with excellent routine in achievement and observation of this patient population<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0267659111424640">25</xref></sup>. We present only two patients who were treated by this remarkable and extraordinary therapeutic approach and register promising results. Since clinical data are very short in this context, there is a strong need for larger clinical series.</p>
