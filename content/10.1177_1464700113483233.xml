<p>Feminist theorising on the question of beauty has gained an important place amongst critical scholars, as attested by a wide range of well-documented and insightful research. Rather than seeing beauty simply as a ‘window’ into women's lives, or as an ultimately unattainable but banal practice, recent scholarship demonstrates a push towards what Maxine Leeds <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1464700113483233">Craig (2006)</xref> calls a more ‘complicated’ stance, generating a new wave of work that not only takes an intersectional approach but also believes wholeheartedly that the ‘lure’ of beauty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1464700113483233">Felski, 2006</xref>) deserves serious consideration in itself. From this perspective, beauty is also theorised as an experience that ‘does’ something and in that doing entangles everyday life in unexpected ways. This upholds Peggy Z. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1464700113483233">Brand's</xref> claim in <italic>Beauty Matters</italic> that, ‘[f]or women, beauty has always mattered – in a personal way, and as an inevitable, and underlying socio-political framework, for how they operate in the world’ (2000: 5–6). This special issue takes this stance as its starting point. It also develops Claire Colebrook's important argument in <italic>Feminist Theory</italic> that a renewed interest in the ‘question [of beauty] for feminist politics … is not so much moral – is beauty good or bad for women? – but pragmatic: how is beauty defined, deployed, defended, subordinated, marketed or manipulated, and how do these tactics intersect with gender and value?’ (2006: 132).</p>
<p>The specific contribution of this special issue to feminist politics and theory is to bring a focus on the pragmatics of beauty in its intersection with notions of ‘race’ and the specificity of racial projects in Latin America and the Caribbean. We therefore aim to demonstrate that theorising gender and beauty always requires attention to the central role of notions of ‘race’ in framing how beauty is understood and experienced. We are interested in bringing to readers’ attention how the complexities of the racial dynamics in the region mark the connection between gendered and racialised beauty as especially important for feminist theory to untangle; we also point towards the complexities of the myriad and elaborate ways that sexuality, class and nation link with gendered and racialised beauty. Indeed, the articles in this special issue address beauty as an empirical question rooted in experiences emerging from Latin America and the Caribbean. Have ideas about beauty changed in the current context of neoliberalism and multiculturalism in Latin America and the Caribbean? Have shifting migration patterns impacted long held ideas about race, nation, and appearance? How do standards of beauty reflect and emerge from particular political and cultural conditions? How are emotion and affect applied to understandings of beauty in ways that complicate basic intersectional frameworks for analysing identity, difference and experience? How do Latin American and Caribbean feminist theories and politics address, challenge, or collude with dominant representations of beauty? How do gender, race, beauty and the economy intersect and produce value?</p>
<p>Although feminists have long theorised the role of beauty in gender politics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1464700113483233">Bordo, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1464700113483233">Faludi, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1464700113483233">Jeffreys, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1464700113483233">Wolf, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1464700113483233">Young, 1980</xref>), literature on beauty from the Latin American and Caribbean context is just starting to coalesce into a more coherent body of work. While important studies of the region have emerged, they have not always engaged directly with feminist scholarship. Existing studies have concentrated on analysing the famous beauty contests throughout the region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1464700113483233">Cohen Ballerino et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1464700113483233">López, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1464700113483233">Siu, 2005</xref>), representations of the indigenous body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1464700113483233">Canessa, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1464700113483233">De la Cadena, 2000</xref>), plastic surgery and national discourses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1464700113483233">Edmonds, 2007a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1464700113483233">2007b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1464700113483233">2010</xref>) and the relations between physical appearance and sex work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1464700113483233">Kempadoo, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1464700113483233">Pope, 2005</xref>). There have been a few studies that are more explicitly attuned to the relationship between feminist theory and beauty in their articulation with gender, racism and national identities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1464700113483233">Casanova, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1464700113483233">Moreno Figueroa, 2012</xref>). In this special issue, we contribute to the consolidation of this recent work by bringing together new scholarship that considers how beauty is linked to broader discourses regarding power relations and the specific cultural and social formations of a very diverse region. The articles that follow encompass a rich range of national contexts, histories and politics. They also aptly demonstrate the theoretical advantages of approaching beauty from an intersectional perspective that takes the empirical and affective complexities of gendered racialisation as a point of departure.</p>
<p>Ideas about beauty, appearance, physical characteristics, and racialised perceptions of skin colour and the body inform each other within the specific historical configuration of <italic>mestizaje</italic> (racial mixing) in a Latin American and Caribbean context. The specificity of <italic>mestizaje</italic> as the dominant racial discourse of the region, and its tensions with the growing importance of multiculturalism, have made even more evident the major role it plays in ideas about physical appearance and in the gendered dimensions of social relations. Mónica Moreno Figueroa's argument in this issue in relation to Mexico could be applied to the region as a whole, where <italic>mestizaje</italic> is an unsettled, relational project: ‘people are not white or black, but rather, they are whiter than or darker than others’ (2013: 139). Yet the articles brought together here also demonstrate the complexities of understanding the role of <italic>mestizaje</italic> even within the region. For example, Megan Rivers-Moore argues that whiteness is emphasised and <italic>mestizaje</italic> is denied in Costa Rica, while Doreen Gordon discusses the tensions between discourses of whitening, racial mixture, and multicultural promotions of black pride in Brazil. In the Venezuelan context, Elizabeth Nichols identifies <italic>mestizaje</italic> as a project meant ‘to produce “<italic>café con leche</italic>” or “coffee with milk” citizens. However, it has always been understood that more milk is better than more coffee’ (2013: 173). Celebrations of <italic>mestizaje</italic> obscure the hierarchies that are part of the region's colonial and postcolonial legacy. This group of articles reflects on these ideas and on their impact and materialisation on the racialised bodies of Latin American and Caribbean peoples and their diasporas; that is, these pieces explore how bodies can be both a witness to and a bearer of history.</p>
<p>The special issue considers how practices of and concerns about beauty are by no means trivial; they actually reveal the depth of racial attitudes and their consequences for the performance of femininity and a sense of self-worth. We consider ‘beauty’ as a concept that involves the realm of the visible in the construction of identity and the problems this raises for the racialised body. Skin colour and hair texture are addressed in many of the articles, demonstrating the ways in which beauty becomes a daily, embodied visual experience with profound effects on women's lives in particular. Nichols’ analysis of classic Venezuelan literature argues that concerns about racial lineage are revealed in hair:<disp-quote>
<p>Hair that is too wavy, coarse, or curly would indicate an undesirable amount of African heritage. Conversely, hair that is too straight suggests indigenous blood. In either case, a woman’s hair is representative of her family’s bloodline. (2013: 182)</p></disp-quote>Gordon's interviews with middle class Brazilian women demonstrate that hair is a delicate subject for many, with significant tensions between hair straightening and the reclamation of black pride through what she calls a transnational black aesthetic. Nation combines with racialised ideas and practices related to beauty and, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1464700113483233">Edmonds</xref> in his work on Brazil argues, aesthetic imaginaries reflect histories ‘of racial mixing and nation-building that classif[y] and value appearance in distinct ways’ (2007a: 373). Shirley Tate's article takes the question of nation further, addressing how migration from the region has ‘translated’ specific racial discourses and how transnational connections impact and are impacted by Latin American and Caribbean notions of beauty in the diaspora, focusing on the complexities of shame and black beauty for women of Jamaican heritage in Britain. As Moreno Figueroa writes, ‘beauty is difficult. It is a resource and a feeling, an unavoidable lure that does different kinds of work: it stabilises and enables hierarchies’ (2013: 146). These articles suggest that beauty, and the practices and concerns around it, raise alternative feminist ways of approaching the analysis of women's gendered experiences in contemporary postcolonial societies.</p>
<p>The articles that follow explore how beauty relates to the co-constituted processes of racism, sexism, heterosexism and nationalism in Latin America and the Caribbean from a range of disciplinary perspectives and focusing on a variety of countries. The pieces take on board the literature on beauty from the region discussed above and the strong tradition of feminist scholarship on this topic. Rebecca Coleman and Moreno Figueroa's survey of the field argues that ‘recent feminist work has identified how approaches to beauty tend to circulate around the dichotomies of pleasure-pain, active-passive, affirmation-suffering, liberation-oppression’ (2010: 359). Rita Felski suggests that such feminist analyses have converted the ‘positive’ aspects of beauty into their more ‘negative’ counterpoints. She raises concerns about this ‘compulsion to immediately translate aesthetic surfaces into political depths’ without ‘teasing apart the multifarious socio-political meanings’ (2006: 281). With an aim to challenge the claims that concerns about, practices of and experiences of beauty are superfluous, ‘wrong’ and/or only a source of pain, this special issue engages in feminist scholarship that not only focuses on aesthetic representations, but also works to complicate both experiences of and ideas about beauty. Indeed, we consider how beauty is embodied and lived by Latin American and Caribbean women in concrete ways as a process, how particular ideals are experienced as attainable or not and what this reveals about contemporary social relations in the region.</p>
<p>Several of the articles in this special issue consider beauty in relation to social relations of class, whether the experiences of middle class women in Mexico (Moreno Figueroa) and Brazil (Gordon) or working class women in Costa Rica (Rivers-Moore) and Colombia (Wade). According to Gordon, ‘[a]s a person climbs the social ladder, one is expected to transform one's physical appearance into socially acceptable, upper middle class ideals that emphasise the submersion of “African” characteristics’ (2013: 208). For non-white elites, this is about creating racial distance but also distance from the poverty associated with blackness. The articles brought together here seek to elucidate these sorts of multiple, and potentially contradictory, intersections of gender, race, class and nation with notions of beauty. Both Peter Wade and Rivers-Moore consider the role of sexuality and the erotic as complex forms of beauty. In Wade's article, racially marked women are overrepresented in domestic service, a role in which they are also often seen as sexually available. While a distinction is frequently made between moral and pure beauty and immoral and tainted sexuality, Wade points out that ‘erotic desirability cannot be simply opposed to aesthetic appeal: “beauty” can lead to sexual appeal, just as the “erotic” can be seen as beautiful; the two are intertwined in complex ways’ (2013: 188). Similarly, Rivers-Moore considers how Costa Rican sex workers take advantage of North American men's racialised views of them as especially erotic. Both Wade and Rivers-Moore consider how beauty and sexuality combine in the context of gendered work environments.</p>
<p>The articles included here come from a variety of disciplines (anthropology, sociology, Spanish), utilise various research methods (ethnography, interviews, focus groups, literary analysis) and encompass many geographical locations (Brazil, the Caribbean diaspora, Colombia, Costa Rica, México, Venezuela). Articles were chosen with the intention of including a broad range of countries, as well as a wide variety of topics. There remain many areas for further research; for example, all the articles included here focus on women's gendered experiences, but there is much left to be said about masculinity and beauty. As Michael Taussig's recent book on beauty reminds us, ‘aesthetics is as crucial to the tough guys and the state as it is to bigger breasts, face lifts, or willowy thinness through liposuction’ (2012: ix). To this end, each author points to different avenues that are still in need of attention. However, in relation to our specific contribution, the special issue aims to demonstrate the theoretical advantages of approaching beauty empirically through a variety of substantive areas and geographic locations. Rather than positioning Latin America and the Caribbean as the purview of area studies, as a region where theory is tested and applied, we hope this special issue will show that a focus on Latin America and the Caribbean can offer a fruitful opportunity for theorising beauty from an intersectional perspective, one that brings together the complexities of gender with race, class, sexuality and nation in ways that will be of interest to gender and feminist scholars more broadly.</p>
