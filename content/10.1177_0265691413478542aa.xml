<p>‘Dwarfed’ by the memory of Garibaldi’s famous expedition, the war of 1859 sits awkwardly in the history of the Risorgimento. It is mostly remembered for the sell-out of the Villafranca armistice – signed by Napoleon III and Emperor Franz Joseph to end a war that had become known as an unpopular conflict. In <italic>Visiting Modern War in Risorgimento Italy</italic>, Jonathan Marwil convincingly argues that such a sudden end to the war was not due to simple, cold-blooded political self-interest. He painstakingly reconstructs the tapestry of emotions of correspondents, surgeons, photographers, illustrators or simply ‘war tourists’ who witnessed and related the war horrors. For decades the memory of the sacrifice of so many soldiers would haunt a generation of Italians, French and Austrians. Nowadays, the book shows, the legacy of this warfare episode remains in oblique ways – in the spirit of the International Red Cross born out of this experience and in the landscape of northern Italy, marked by more than one ossuary.</p>
<p>Marwil is clearly concerned with what happened before and after the battles of Magenta and Solferino. In line with recent historiographical perspectives focused on the experience of the displacement of troops, Marwil investigates the feelings of ‘getting there’ as much as the horror of ‘being there’. And, after the battles, the book’s description of the business of burying the dead, as well as – years later – exhuming and sorting the bones for display, powerfully demonstrates the need to take the long view when recounting the history of a war known for its ‘surprising brevity’– only ten weeks. Marwil’s approach is largely cultural, although the methodology adopted in the first chapter – which deals with the nitty-gritty of diplomacy and day-to day ‘high politics’ during the ‘preparations for the show’ – hardly delivers the suggestive promise of ‘a book which will sometimes appear novelistic’. The tone however does change once the narrative moves on to represent the ‘curious tourists’: Marwil most definitely leaves behind the disinterestedness of military history to focus on individual experiences, using sources which lend themselves to a more ‘intimate history’, diaries, letters and sketches.</p>
<p>The war portrayed, known in Italy as the ‘Second War of Independence’, here assumes all the traits of a transnational war, involving volunteers on the battlefield, such as the Cornish Colonel Peard, and French surgeons willing to organize hospitals for <italic>all</italic> the wounded. Crucially, this experience would inspire Henri Dunant to write a book which laid the foundations for creating the International Red Cross. Marwil is most impressive when describing in mesmerizing detail the horrors of war, the traumatic theatre of battle, the gore of death in the battlefield and the piles of corpses flung together in mass graves ‘with no dignity or identity’ – although occasionally he does risk falling into the trap of representing history ‘as affect’. Even so, Marwil is convincing when he intermingles the history of emotions with sensory history, describing the sights and sounds of ‘men being sawn’ – the ‘stench’ of ‘blood, bodies and human waste’ hitting the ‘tourists of war’. Indeed, it was on these battlefields that the first photographs of the war dead were taken. Marwil’s interest lies in the rhetoric and visual representation of war, initially reconstructed in the illustrated papers, widely disseminated across national boundaries. Illustrators and photographers first and, later, pictorial artists of the Risorgimento – who chose to illustrate battle scenes by representing the transport of the wounded – would all contribute towards jolting the public’s consciousness in a way that was previously unknown.</p>
<p>The sheer numbers of the dead also produced a shift in commemorative ceremonies – now not so focused on individual heroes but staged in remembrance of the common soldier. The exhumed bones and skulls of soldiers who had fought against each other were placed together in a peaceful crypt, a model which would be repeated to honour the dead of other battles – inaugurating a new form of pilgrimage/tourism: travel to the ossuary. If, despite this, the memory of the 1859 war was subsequently lost abroad – Marwil argues – part of the responsibility may be traced to G. M. Trevelyan’s ‘Trilogy’, which underplayed the importance of the episode in Italy’s unification process. That the memory of this war should have been lost in Italy, however, may only be ascribed to the far greater losses suffered on the Isonzo during the First World War. Marwil is to be commended for bringing to the surface the memory of a ‘European war’ which – like the half-buried bones exhumed and displayed – needed to be dug up in order to claim its place in the realm of cultural history. His painstaking research into original primary material contrasts, however, with the thin reference made to secondary sources.</p>
