<abstract>
<p>High-speed vehicles are exposed to crosswinds that can result in the overturning of the vehicle. As part of the vehicle homologation process, the characteristic wind curve (CWC) must be calculated to determine the maximum vehicle velocity under different wind conditions. European Standard EN 14067-6 presents different approaches for studying this matter, from a two-dimensional (2D) model to a full multi-body model. The key to the problem rests in the uncertainties inherent in a multi-body model: characterizing its suspension elements and obtaining its aerodynamic coefficients. This paper compares a 2D model with a multi-body model of the same vehicle, and presents the advantages and disadvantages of each one. Results show that a 2D model is valid for graphing the CWC and sufficient for studying the basics of the overturning process. Furthermore, a wheel unloading time signal is also studied. It is concluded that the simplification process can modify the transitory response but that the maximum wheel unloading remains constant. Finally, a study of the wheel/rail contact is performed to check if the contact model has an influence on the calculation of the CWCs.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0954409711424094"><title>1 INTRODUCTION</title>
<p>This paper is driven by the requirement to maintain high levels of safety and comfort on the increasing number of high speed lines that have started to operate or are currently under construction worldwide. In the last decade, and particularly in the last five years, considerable effort has been expended on the study of the effects of crosswinds on railway vehicles, however, despite this intense effort there still remain open questions in this area.</p>
<p>Weight reduction methods to reduce the deadweight per passenger, for example, by developing lighter rolling stock [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954409711424094">1</xref></bold>], are of particular interest. Furthermore, the design of new lines with higher embankments and a large number of bridges or viaducts worsens the situation. Consequently, the risk of a train being overturned by crosswinds is increased due to the combination of increased vehicle speed and reduction in weight, this decreases the stabilizing momentum.</p>
<p>The aerodynamics community is also concerned about crosswinds; steady and unsteady aerodynamic forces and their interaction with vehicles have been studied in [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954409711424094">2</xref></bold>–<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954409711424094">4</xref></bold>] and [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954409711424094">5</xref></bold>], respectively<bold>.</bold> The influence of crosswinds on the dynamic behaviour of a vehicle and the risk of it being overturned has been studied by several authors [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954409711424094">6</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0954409711424094">7</xref></bold>]. In [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0954409711424094">8</xref></bold>] a full multi-body model was used to study the dynamics of a vehicle while negotiating curves. In [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0954409711424094">9</xref></bold>] a full multi-body model and experimental analysis were compared, and a two-dimensional (2D) model was used to check a few of the experimental results. Xu and Ding [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0954409711424094">10</xref></bold>] presented a study in which the influence of track irregularities was investigated using a full multi-body model.</p>
<p>This paper studies and compares the results of a simplified model and a full multi-body model of a rail vehicle when subjected to crosswinds. The aim of this work is to identify and quantify differences between both models; understanding where these differences come from, and knowing whether the simple model gives a bigger or smaller margin of safety. Although the current standard [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0954409711424094">11</xref></bold>] prescribes the use of a full multi-body model for most situations, there are some simulations in which the standard allows a 2D model. In these cases, we can assume differences will exist between the results obtained using the three-dimensional (3D) and 2D models. If this difference is small, it can be similar to the one implicit in the characterization of the suspension components or the calculation of the 3D aerodynamic coefficients. Therefore, the 2D model would be advantageous for studying some aspects related to the response of the vehicle such as the construction of the characteristic wind curve (CWC), the measurement of body displacement, or wheel unloading evaluation.</p>
<p>In order to meet the stated aim, throughout this paper results from the simplified model will be compared to the results from the full multi-body model of the same vehicle. The comparison will be made in the time domain in order to clearly appreciate the difference between both models. Finally, those aspects related to the vehicle model that differentiate between the full and the 2D model and determine whether the 2D model is applicable will be noted. One important aspect of this difference is how the wheel/rail contact is modelled. In this study the MBS Simpack [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0954409711424094">12</xref></bold>] is used, so the different possibilities this software gives the user will be presented and then compared in terms of the wheel unloading factor. Another aspect is the aerodynamic loads considered in the simulations. Obviously, the six components cannot be introduced in the scenario when working with the 2D model; this limitation will also be considered and compared in the calculation of the CWC.</p>

<sec id="sec2-0954409711424094"><title>2 PROBLEM DESCRIPTION AND DEFINITIONS</title>
<sec id="sec3-0954409711424094"><title>2.1 Standard EN 14067-6:2010</title>
<p>Standard EN 14067-6:2010 presents various methods for assessing the crosswind stability of railway vehicles. In the standard, stability is characterized in terms of the wheel unloading factor (see appendix 2). From the dynamic point of view, the standard prescribes different procedures for determining that value: building a full multi-body model, building a simplified five-mass model, or building just a 2D vehicle model.</p>
<p>For both quasi-static models, the 2D model and the five-mass model (a carbody, two bogies, and two mass-equivalent wheelset), the results from these configurations ‘are considered to be less precise but conservative because of built-in margins’: the characteristic wind speeds are lower than those of a multi-body model. Furthermore, only the multi-body model is expected to integrate the wind scenario as a function of time, this means that only the full model provides time-dependent simulations.</p>
<p>The standard prescribes that ‘the five-mass model is suitable for many vehicles’, giving the reader the choice of deciding between the five-mass and the multi-body model, always taking into account the limitations of the quasi-static study of the five-mass model. In the end, the simplest way to study the effect of crosswinds is through a 2D model. The standard warns that ‘the method is less precise but more conservative because of built-in margins’ and is only suitable for conventional vehicles with two sets of running gears or two single axes.</p>
<p>In the context of the conditions referred to in the standard, the purpose of the present analysis is to check whether a simplified 2D model is appropriate to study the response of the vehicle to crosswinds through a time-dependent simulation. In fact, when wheel unloading is calculated, the destabilization process and thus the movements that the bodies describe are mainly 2D in nature. This paper proposes a simplified dynamic representation of the full model. Nevertheless, in the process of simplifying the full multi-body model into a 2D model some elements will necessarily be neglected because they have a strictly 3D configuration. Some others will be simplified in transforming their 3D behaviour to 2D space. The final 2D model, which is the result of the simplification process of the full one, will lead to an error that must be quantified before being accepted.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-0954409711424094"><title>2.2 Vehicle models</title>
<p>Two different models were used to study the problem: a simplified three-mass model and a complete multi-body model of the same vehicle.</p>
<sec id="sec5-0954409711424094"><title>2.2.1 2D model</title>
<p>Although this model is also a multi-body model because simulations are carried out with multi-body code, in this paper it is called a simplified three-mass model as it is simplified to 2D. The proposed vehicle model had three masses (the carbody, another mass acting as both bogie frames, and another mass representing all the wheelset of the vehicle) and three degrees of freedom (lateral, vertical, and roll) as result of a simplification in the multi-body vehicle model, which is explained in the next section. Mass values and coordinates of the centre of gravity are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0954409711424094">Table 1</xref>.

<p>The suspension elements included in the model were limited to the minimum number. All of them were in the <italic>Y–Z</italic> plane. The secondary suspension, which acts between the carbody and the bogie frame, was composed of linear springs in both vertical and lateral directions. It also had a linear anti-roll stiffness that transferred momentum around the <italic>X</italic>-axis. In addition, non-linear lateral bumpstop were taken into account and were modelled as progressive reaction forces, though they are not included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954409711424094">Fig. 1</xref>. The primary suspension, which connects the bogie frames and the wheelset, was modelled with linear springs in both lateral and vertical directions.

<p>The contact force between the wheel and the rail was modelled with a linear spring which acted only in the compression direction; stiffness and damping terms were taken from the multi-body model so the total contact force computation was the same in both studies. It is important to note that the same value for lateral and vertical contact stiffness was introduced into the model with the purpose of having the same rigidity in all directions; the same principle applies to damping. The contact stiffness was considered only for the purpose of representing the same joint between the wheelset and the ground of the full model. Another possibility would be to consider an infinite stiffness at the contact. However, considering the same stiffness for the multi-body model does not introduce any extra problems, and it represents the full model more faithfully.</p>
<p>Damping in the wheel/rail contact and primary and secondary suspension were also taken into account. The stiffness and damping values for all the suspension elements are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0954409711424094">Table 2</xref>.

<p>The full vehicle model had 23 bodies and 44 degrees of freedom. The parameters were estimated in order to represent a generic high-speed vehicle, but do not exactly correspond to any existing train. The aerodynamic forces were calculated using the coefficients provided by the standard annex for an ICE3 train which are represented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954409711424094">Fig. 2</xref>. The carbody, bogies, and wheelset each had six degrees of freedom. The primary suspension consisted of vertical and lateral linear springs and dampers. The secondary suspension was built in the vertical, lateral, and longitudinal directions; linear and non-linear springs and dampers were taken into account. In addition, torsion springs were added to the full model. The model included the standard S1002 wheel profile and UIC60 with an inclination of 1:40 rail profile. The full set of vehicle parameters is listed in Appendix 3. The wheel–rail forces were calculated by means of Kalker's Fastsim algorithm. Multi-body simulations with a multi-body model were run with the commercial MBS Simpack code.

<p>Throughout this work, only the tangent track scenario was considered. Regarding wind scenarios, more than one is necessary, and for this reason a clarification will be given in each section.</p>

<sec id="sec7-0954409711424094"><title>2.2.3 Checking the 2D model</title>
<p>In order to verify that the simplified model parameters were correctly set, a comparison was made regarding vibration modes and sway behaviour. An additional objective was to demonstrate that the 2D movements of the vehicle as a reaction to aerodynamic loads were equivalent for both models.</p>
<sec id="sec8-0954409711424094"><title>Vibration modes</title>
<p>The comparison made in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0954409711424094">Table 3</xref> is between the two models discussed in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec5-0954409711424094">sections 2.2.1</xref> and <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec6-0954409711424094">2.2.2</xref>. Obviously, only the modes which are in the Y–Z plane can be compared. The results show that the modes that play a role in the characteristic movement of the vehicle when subjected to crosswinds are similar: natural damping as well as resonance frequencies are in agreement.

<sec id="sec9-0954409711424094"><title>Sway behaviour</title>
<p>Sway simulation was carried out in order to verify whether the simplified model reacted in a similar fashion to the multi-body model when it was exposed to external forces. The aerodynamic forces created by the crosswinds primarily cause the vehicle to turn its carbody, so the way it reacts to that kind of disturbance needs to be verified.</p>
<p>The expression for the sway coefficient for each step can be written as
<disp-formula id="disp-formula1-0954409711424094"><label>(1)</label><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954409711424094-eq1.tif"/></disp-formula>
</p>
<p>The results of the comparison can be observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954409711424094">Fig. 3</xref>. The simulation consisted of the calculation of the sway coefficient for different values of superelevation, from 25 to 225 mm, with an increment of 5 mm; other values were interpolated. Although the curves diverge for superelevation values greater than 200 mm, the difference between them does not reach 1 per cent.
<fig id="fig3-0954409711424094" position="float"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Comparison of the results obtained in the sway tests</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954409711424094-fig3.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>If the sway test coefficients agree for different cants, then the value of the rotating degree of freedom around the <italic>X</italic>-axis of both models also agree as can be deduced from the sway test coefficient formula.</p>
<p>It can be concluded that both models achieved similar results and that the simulations with the simplest model can provide sufficient precision.</p>

<sec id="sec10-0954409711424094"><title>3 2D SIMULATIONS: COMPARISON WITH THE FULL VEHICLE MODEL AND INHERENT LIMITATIONS</title>
<p>Regarding CWC calculations, the aim of the simulations discussed in this section was to show the extent of the differences between the results of the 2D model and the full 3D model. First, the responses of both models to dynamic loads are analysed in order to perform a final check of the simplified model. Dynamic loads are modelled to represent wind loads to verify that the three-mass model is suitable to perform this kind of calculation. A comparison of the wheel unloading ratio and discussion of the limitations of the 2D model follows. Finally, as the standard prescribes the elaboration of CWC curves to measure the safety of a vehicle against crosswinds, the simplified model will be directly contrasted with the full model by calculating these curves.</p>
<sec id="sec11-0954409711424094"><title>3.1 Analysis of the response of both models to dynamic wind loads</title>
<p>One of the critical elements of the suspension set of the vehicle is the bumpstop since how it works is a key factor in the response of the vehicle in terms of its dynamic behaviour under crosswinds. The standard also identifies it as a critical element if the study is centred on dynamics under crosswinds. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954409711424094">Figure 4</xref> compares the lateral deformation of the bumpstop for the two models. It is remarkable how both curves follow the same pattern throughout the entire wind scenario; the stop is located at 60 mm of displacement, and both models reach it at the same time. The amplitude of the oscillations differs but the error is acceptable.
<fig id="fig4-0954409711424094" position="float"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>Lateral deformation of the bumpstop. Comparison between the 2D model and the multi-body model</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954409711424094-fig4.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954409711424094">Fig. 5</xref>, the displacement of the centre of gravity of the carbody is shown. Note that the three-mass model is less damped, which means that the model needs more time to reach the steady state after being hit by the gust of wind. While the multi-body model reaches equilibrium at around 40 s, the 2D model needs a few more seconds. Small differences can be observed when displacements reach the maximum value at the moment the gust of wind hits the vehicle. Furthermore, the three-mass model gives the highest value of the measure as a consequence of the damping characteristic of the model. If the same aerodynamic forces load the multi-body and the three-mass model, almost the same lateral displacement is observed when loads are constant. The difference becomes greater when the full set of loads is applied to the multi-body model, but in that case different load cases are compared.

</sec>
<sec id="sec12-0954409711424094"><title>3.2 Wheel unloading calculations with both models and restrictions of the 2D model</title>
<p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0954409711424094">Fig. 6</xref>, a comparison of wheel unloading from the simplified model and the multi-body model is shown. Throughout this section the crosswind scenario considered is one where the vehicle is running on a straight track and the angle between the flow and the track is 90°. The wind scenario matches with the standard double track ballast and rails. The load case corresponds to a planar state, which means only <italic>F<sub>y</sub></italic>, <italic>F<sub>z</sub></italic>, and <italic>M<sub>x</sub></italic> were considered. In general terms, both curves have the same appearance. The differences between the models appear because some elements cannot be introduced in the simplified model. This is the case for the primary suspension, where the sway link was ignored in the simplified model, as well as the yaw damper in the secondary suspension. The removal of the lateral and longitudinal rigidities of the silent block produces a deviation in sustained wind, as shown from 15 to 25 s. The removal of the yaw damper results in a modification of the transitory response of the model; this effect is observed between 30 and 40 s. This results in a small error in the peak amplitude of the wheel unloading, resulting in a difference of 0.034 while the difference when the wind loads are constant is 0.024.

<p>In conclusion, it can be said that the three-mass model is less damped and that the maximum wheel unloading is lower in comparison with the multi-body model.</p>
<p>The 2D model is limited to giving an average of the <italic>Q</italic> forces of the four wheels located at each side of the vehicle. Thus, the wheel unloading factor calculated through the three-mass model gives the mean value of all the wheelset of the vehicle.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0954409711424094">Table 4</xref> compares the wheel unloading factor for the same wind scenario as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0954409711424094">Fig. 6</xref>. The table contains the factor calculated for each wheelset; using the formula given by the standard for the wheelset of the first bogie; and by averaging the ratio of the four wheelset; in this case, using the full and the simplified models. If the purpose of building the simplified model is to calculate the wheel unloading ratio, this demonstrates that averaging is a good approximation. The difference between the 2D model and the 3D model is estimated to be 3 per cent.

<sec id="sec13-0954409711424094"><title>3.3 Calculating characteristic wind curves with both models</title>
<p>A problem arises when CWC curves must be calculated. It is well known that wheel unloading is a conservative criterion: reaching 90 per cent of wheel unloading does not mean the vehicle is not on the verge of overturning. Carrarini [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0954409711424094">13</xref></bold>] studied the probability of overturning in detail.</p>
<p>An example calculation of CWC is given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954409711424094">Fig. 7</xref>. The scenario consists of the vehicle running on a straight track on the windward rail over a typical 6 m embankment; CWC calculations in three different configurations are performed.

<p>Agreement between the multi-body model and simplified model is obtained when the same loads are applied, and the deviation between them is in the range between 0 and 0.5 m/s, a reasonable result that is due to the fact that the sway test and vibration modes are quasi-equivalent. However, due to the elimination of momentum around the <italic>Y</italic> and <italic>Z</italic> axes, which contributes to vehicle unloading, the results differ when the CWC is calculated with full sets of loads. Since the contribution of <italic>M<sub>y</sub></italic> and <italic>M<sub>z</sub></italic> to the overall wind load is higher when the vehicle slows, the disparity between the curves increases at lower vehicle velocities.</p>
<p>One advantage of the simplified model is the reduction in the amount of time needed for a single calculation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec14-0954409711424094"><title>3.4 Differences when using different contact options</title>
<p>As in any rail vehicle multi-body simulation a contact option has to be selected, this section explores if the different options have any influence in the context of CWC calculations.</p>
<p>When using Simpack, different ways of modelling the contact are possible, and results may differ, as explained in the following discussion. In Simpack the user can choose between
<list id="list2-0954409711424094" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Option 1: constraint or elastic and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Option 2: one-point and multi-point contact.</p></list-item>
</list> The first option refers to how the forces in the contact region are calculated. If the constraint option is selected, an internal Simpack algorithm is used. Selecting the elastic option introduces a spring/damper with a known rigidity and damping perpendicular to the contact direction by only introducing force in compression. In the crosswind context, both methods produce similar results.</p>
<p>The second option allows the user to choose how many contact points to take into account, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0954409711424094">Fig. 8</xref>. In order to check what is the difference between one point and multi-point contact, the full vehicle model is loaded with a wind force whose components are <italic>F<sub>y</sub></italic> = 250 kN and <italic>M<sub>x</sub></italic> = 250 kN; the others are zero (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954409711424094">Fig. 2</xref>). The load is big enough to move the wheelset upwards to create flange contact. If the contact path is represented by a single point, the equilibrium will be given by the displacement of that point and the load that is transmitted through it. The contact point can move from the static position towards the flange, remaining at the flange if required to maintain equilibrium. On the contrary, when the multi-point contact option is selected, it becomes possible to represent the appearance of two contact points simultaneously: one at the tread and another at the flange. In the last case, the total <italic>Q</italic> force is obtained by adding the <italic>Q</italic> force of the tread and the <italic>Q</italic> force of the flange, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0954409711424094">Fig. 8</xref>.

It is easy to check that the one-point contact locates the contact point somewhere between the locations of the two points of the multi-point contact. This is reasonable because equilibrium cannot be achieved in another way since the load is transmitted only through that point.

<p>If lateral forces are checked, the conclusion is that <italic>Y</italic> forces behave similarly to the <italic>Q</italic> forces. The total <italic>Y</italic> force does not change between the two configurations.</p>
<p>Since the multi-point option includes more than one area of contact, vertical and lateral forces are calculated separately for each area. The contact force appears in each area as the contact point moves between the contact points or when two contact points appear at any one time. At this point the question arises as to whether the number of areas (one or two) affects the wheel unloading calculation; that is to say, whether considering just the tread is equivalent to considering the tread and the flange.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-0954409711424094">Table 7</xref> gives an example of the wheel unloading calculation using the Chinese Hat approach (see Appendix 2). It compares the different possibilities that must be selected to set-up the vehicle model. As stated previously, there is no difference between the constraint and elastic options. The difference appears in the multi-point contact option where there is the possibility to choose the number of areas from which the wheel unloading is calculated. The assessments indicate that neglecting the <italic>Q</italic> force at the flange leads to an error which is no higher than 5 per cent. Obviously, it needs to be recalled that the calculation of the wheel unloading using only the <italic>Q</italic> forces at the tread assumes that the <italic>Q</italic> force at the flange is small. This is only true when aerodynamic loads are modelled based on the Chinese Hat approach. In this wind scenario, flange contact takes place for a very short time because it is only reached when the maximum wind load hits the vehicle. Under this hypothesis, the load transmitted through the flange is rather small and thus it can be disregarded.

<p>When the three-mass model was presented in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec5-0954409711424094">section 2.2.1</xref>, one of the critical simplifications, which causes inaccuracy, was the elimination of the aerodynamic momentum around the <italic>Y</italic> and <italic>Z</italic> axes. That simplification leads to a level of inaccuracy higher than that which results from considering no more than three masses in the vehicle representation.</p>
<p>The obtained results are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0954409711424094">Fig. 9</xref>. Curve A shows the influence of the number of <italic>Q</italic> forces accounted for in the wheel unloading calculation, that is to say, in Case 1 the <italic>Q</italic> force at the flange is dismissed. This simplification modifies <italic>v</italic><sub>w</sub> approximately to 1.0 m/s.
<fig id="fig9-0954409711424094" position="float"><label>Fig. 9</label><caption><p>Difference in results of CWCs when cases 1 to 4 are compared to the Reference case (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table8-0954409711424094">Table 8</xref>)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954409711424094-fig9.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>Curve B reflects the analysis presented in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec12-0954409711424094">section 3.2</xref>, which concluded that the choice between one-point and multi-point contact did not affect the calculation of the <italic>Q</italic> forces. Nevertheless, it must be remembered that when using one-point contact, the contact path is not correctly modelled and therefore the actual dynamic of the vehicle will differ from the computer simulation results.</p>
<p>Curve C compares how the load state of the multi-body modifies the calculated <italic>v</italic><sub>w</sub>, and thus it evaluates the influence of the aerodynamic momentum in the <italic>Y</italic> and <italic>Z</italic> axes: <italic>M<sub>y</sub></italic> and <italic>M<sub>z</sub></italic>. From this curve we can state that the results from the multi-body model are highly dependent on the choice of the forces introduced into the model. The difference between the planar load case (<italic>F<sub>y</sub></italic>, <italic>F<sub>z</sub></italic>, and <italic>M<sub>x</sub></italic>) and the full load case (six components of the aerodynamic loads) results in a difference of between 2.0 and 3.5 m/s in the estimations of <italic>v</italic><sub>w</sub>.</p>
<p>Curve D shows that calculations with the 2D model leads to differences between 2.0 and 3.0 m/s with respect to the multi-body model when simulating with multi-point contact.</p>
<p>By comparing Curve A and Curve C it can be concluded that the aerodynamic momentum levels have more influence on wheel unloading than the number of <italic>Q</italic> forces from which it is measured. The difference between Curve C and Curve D is between 0.0 and 0.5 m/s; hence, if <italic>M<sub>y</sub></italic> and <italic>M<sub>z</sub></italic> are ignored, the 2D model is as accurate as the multi-body model because both give the same results.</p>

</sec>
<sec id="sec16-0954409711424094"><title>4 CONCLUSIONS</title>
<p>The paper has quantified the differences that result from using a simplified 2D model rather than a full 3D multi-body model to calculate the CWC<italic>.</italic> The differences arise from the fact that some suspension elements, as a consequence of a planar configuration, are not included in the simplified model: the sway link in the primary suspension and the yaw damper in the secondary suspension. As a first step, a preliminary verification of the simplified model was performed using vibration mode and sway behaviour calculations. Both models achieved similar results, and consequently wheel unloading simulations with the simplest model could provide sufficient precision.</p>
<p>What is important in terms of safety is that the wind unloads the wheel located at the leeside, which can lead to the overturning of the vehicle if the wind forces are big enough. When the problem is studied in 2D, wheel unloading is calculated in terms of an averaged factor. In the simplified model, the factor that is calculated is one that represents the average of the four wheels. However, the standard prescribes that the most representative bogie, and the most critical one, is the leading bogie. This study has checked that in the wind conditions considered the average calculated in the 2D model can accurately represent the safety clause established in the standard.</p>
<p>It has been shown that wind load is a key factor. The difference between the planar load case (<italic>F<sub>y</sub></italic>, <italic>F<sub>z</sub></italic>, and <italic>M<sub>x</sub></italic>) and the full load case (six components of the aerodynamic loads) resulted in a difference of between 2.0 and 3.5 m/s in the calculated <italic>v</italic><sub>w</sub>. Moreover, if <italic>M<sub>y</sub></italic> and <italic>M<sub>z</sub></italic> are ignored, the multi-body model contact gives the same results as the 2D model. Taking into account that these two components are not easy to measure in tests or to estimate by calculations, one could conclude that when only three components of the aerodynamic forces are introduced, it is not worth building a whole multi-body model. Between the complete model of the vehicle (multi-body, multi-point contact, and full set of loads) and the 2D model, the difference in the calculated <italic>v</italic><sub>w</sub> is no higher than 3.0 m/s.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the difference between using one-point or multi-point contact in the wheel/rail contact options does not change the final result of the wheel unloading ratio. However, if the <italic>Q</italic> force at the flange is not considered because it is very small in comparison with the <italic>Q</italic> force at the tread, the difference is estimated to be 1 m/s, which does not seem to be very relevant.</p>

<p>The average value of wheel unloading, Δ<italic>Q</italic>, of the most critical running bogie cannot be allowed to exceed 90 per cent of the average static loads, <italic>Q</italic><sub>0</sub><italic>,</italic> of the running bogie. The standard also establishes that all the signals related to this factor must be low-pass filtered with a 4th order Butterworth filter and a cut-off frequency of 2 Hz. This filter will eliminate high-frequency influences coming from the track, for example, from track irregularities.</p>
