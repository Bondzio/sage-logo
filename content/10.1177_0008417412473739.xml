<p>In his most recent book, <italic>Visual Attention in Children: Theories and Activities</italic>, Kenneth Lane provides theory, research, and more than 100 tools in a training program to enable the reader to adequately understand, devise, and execute solid and sequential vision training therapy. The book is divided into two distinct sections, each making an invaluable contribution to the overall body of work.</p>
<p>The first section contains eight chapters and focuses on vision development, including attention, executive function, and memory. Separate chapters have been included for individuals with a range of diagnoses, including attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, autism, and reading disabilities, and those who have experienced a cerebrovascular accident or a traumatic brain injury. The second half of the book, the training program, contains a number of black-and-white and coloured tools and associated procedures that are easy to use to transfer learned information into practice. Most of the tools can be photocopied, plasticized, and reused because the general structure of each tool is in a one-page format. While a substantial number of tools are available to equip the therapist with enough long-term visual attention therapy tools for his or her clients, pointers are also given as to how to generalize provided principles to independently conceive further tools and activities.</p>
<p>This book provides the reader with more than ample theory and research allowing a quick grasp of essential concepts while remaining very pleasant and rapid to read, making it an excellent and quick reference guide. It is well written with clearly explained technical language, and complicated ideas are easily understood by the reader less familiar with the concepts that are being presented.</p>
<p>In sum, <italic>Visual Attention in Children: Theories and Activities </italic>will likely become an invaluable resource for occupational therapists and other professionals targeting visual attention in their therapy within a developmental frame of reference. It is a must-have in your library.</p>
