<abstract>
<p>This study investigates the effect of familiar musical distractors on the cognitive performance of introverts and extraverts. Participants completed a verbal, numerical and logic test in three music conditions: vocal music, instrumental music and silence. It was predicted that introverts would perform worse with vocal music, better with instrumental music and even better in silence across all tests while for extraverts it would be the reverse. Results showed that during the verbal test, overall performance for all participants was significantly better in silence, supporting the idea that lyrics interfere with the processing of verbal information in the task. However, no significant music-personality interactions were found. Possible explanations for, and implications of, these results are discussed.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The effects of distracting stimuli on the cognitive task completion of different individuals has been widely researched (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0305735611422672">Cassidy &amp; MacDonald, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0305735611422672">Furnham &amp; Strbac, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0305735611422672">Lesiuk, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0305735611422672">Oakes &amp; North, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0305735611422672">Salamé &amp; Baddeley, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0305735611422672">Ylias &amp; Heaven, 2003</xref>). This is true for different working environments, such as during academic study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0305735611422672">Campbell &amp; Hawley, 1982</xref>) or everyday working situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0305735611422672">Fox &amp; Embrey, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0305735611422672">Milliman, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0305735611422672">Ransdell &amp; Gilroy, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0305735611422672">Schlittmeier &amp; Hellbruck, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0305735611422672">Smith, 1961</xref>) including in-vehicle music listening while driving (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0305735611422672">Dibben &amp; Williamson, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>A central question for ‘distraction’ researchers is how music played during or before testing can influence performance in different types of tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0305735611422672">Fox &amp; Embrey, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0305735611422672">Milliman, 1982</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0305735611422672">Schellenberg, Nakata, Hunter and Tamoto (2007)</xref>, testing both children and adults from Canada and Japan, found that playing different types of music <italic>before</italic> a task can change a person’s arousal level and mood which can subsequently have a direct, immediate and significant effect on an IQ subtest score.</p>
<p>However, results in this area have been equivocal. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0305735611422672">Smith (1961)</xref> found that when music was played during breaks in between repetitive tasks, there was a positive effect on workers. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0305735611422672">Konz (1962)</xref> also found that with monotonous tasks, in this case letter-matching and a manual assembly task, performance improved with music by nearly 20%. Yet when music is played during more complex tasks, it is viewed more as a distraction and would be expected to cause a negative effect on performance. This result was found by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0305735611422672">Dannenbaum (1945)</xref> where in the presence of music, participants had more failures with identifying geometric faults. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0305735611422672">Ransdell and Gilroy (2001)</xref> also found background music disrupted writing fluency. They showed that even unattended music placed heavy demands on working memory and clearly interfered with word processed writing. However, neither <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0305735611422672">Smith (1961)</xref> nor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0305735611422672">Freeburne and Fleischer (1952)</xref> (in this case, a reading comprehension task) found any significant effect of background music in task performance.</p>
<p>To resolve these equivocal results, the focus shifted to using different types of music distraction. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0305735611422672">Sogin (1988)</xref> found no significant effect of different styles of music but <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0305735611422672">Freeburne and Fleischer (1952)</xref> found that those who listened to jazz music were significantly faster at reading. They claim that this is because extra effort has been put into the reading and to overcome this music as a distraction, based on its ‘marked and regular rhythm’.</p>
<p>One specific aspect of music has also been investigated, namely its <italic>complexity</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0305735611422672">Kiger (1989)</xref> studied the different information load in music, which was classified by its tonal range, repetitiveness and rhythm. Music with low information load was described as ‘highly repetitive…with a narrow tonal range’ and high information load music was ‘dissonant, rhythmically varied and highly dynamic’. On a reading comprehension test, participants who listened to low information load music had significantly better scores than those in silence or those with high information load music.</p>
<p>Another aspect of music that has been studied is its <italic>modality</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0305735611422672">Kellaris and Kent (1992)</xref> found that music’s modality had an influence on people’s perception of time. With major key music, perceptions were significantly overestimated and time seemed to go slower. More recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0305735611422672">Kantor-Martynuska (2009)</xref> looked at the effects of tempo and loudness.</p>
<p>The difference between vocal and instrumental music has also been investigated because lyrics added to a piece of instrumental music increases its information load (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0305735611422672">Randell &amp; Gilroy, 2001</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0305735611422672">Salamé and Baddeley (1989)</xref> tested the short-term memory recall of visually-presented number sequences in the presence of vocal and instrumental music and found that vocal music led participants to make significantly more errors. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0305735611422672">Crawford and Strapp (1994)</xref> found that popular vocal music caused more detriment to performance on a verbal logical reasoning and spatial scanning task compared to instrumental music. However, in various studies the vocal/instrumental nature of the music is confounded because different songs/tunes are played as examples of each.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0305735611422672">Stroupe (2005)</xref> investigated the difference between lyrical, non-lyrical music and silence on the accuracy and speed of answering a reading comprehension test. Lower reaction times were expected with the presence of non-lyrical music and silence compared to lyrical music as the added complexity with lyrics was expected to cause more disruption and lead to slower processing of the task. Stroupe reported no significant difference between the non-lyrical and silent groups on the accuracy of their answers, but the lyrical group did significantly have lower accuracy. Also, the non-lyrical and silent groups did have significantly faster processing times than the lyrical group. This means that cognitive processing took longer and was less accurate whilst listening to vocal music compared to instrumental music and no music at all.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0305735611422672">Schlittmeier and Hellbruck (2009)</xref> compared participants’ memory under five conditions: pure office noise, office noise with staccato music, office noise with legato music, office noise with continuous noise, and silence. The music did not serve to partially mask ambient sounds and as has been found many times, short-term memory works best in silence.</p>
<p>Many studies have successfully shown the differing effects music has on performance in various cognitive tasks, yet explanations for this phenomenon are not clear. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0305735611422672">Fox and Embrey (1972)</xref> suggested that music can increase one’s arousal to keep it on a level which benefits those doing repetitive tasks, but <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0305735611422672">Uhrbrock (1961)</xref> claimed that this increase in arousal and feelings of excitement caused by music has an underlying source: an increase in blood pressure.</p>
<p>There are individual differences in the responses to music along a personality dimension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0305735611422672">Kantor-Martynuska, 2009</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0305735611422672">Eysenck (1967)</xref>, introverts and extraverts differ in their optimum cortical arousal levels, which is where individuals perform to their best potential without distraction. This level is much lower for introverts than for extraverts. Thus, introverts require little external stimulation in order to reach their optimum level and do their best at work. Extraverts need a more stimulating environment to reach their optimum level and work at their best. Therefore, if music is introduced into a working environment, this stimulation would be enough for extraverts to reach their optimum arousal level but for introverts, their arousal would increase past their optimum level and would view this as a distraction. This would lead extraverts to achieve a better performance in the presence of music, whereas for introverts music would lead to more failures.</p>
<p>Indeed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0305735611422672">Campbell and Hawley (1982)</xref> found that extraverts were more likely to be found studying in the floors of the library that were rated the noisiest, with introverts more likely to be found in the quieter floors. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0305735611422672">Pervin and John (2001)</xref> claimed that introverts and extraverts differ in their physiological reactions to the same piece of music, where introverts’ heart rate increases more than for extraverts.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0305735611422672">Eysenck’s (1967)</xref> cortical arousal theory has been widely supported. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0305735611422672">Furnham and Bradley (1997)</xref> administered two cognitive tests: reading comprehension and memory recall which were carried out with a radio extract playing in the background or in silence. It was found that for performance on both the reading comprehension task and delayed memory recall, it was significantly worse for introverts compared to extraverts when music was playing in the background. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0305735611422672">Furnham and Allass (1999)</xref> found a similar result but they also took into consideration the complexity of the music. They found a significant interaction between music and personality on tests of observation, immediate and delayed memory recall, but not for the reading comprehension test. When music increased in complexity, the extraverts performed significantly better, but the introverts performed significantly worse. A significant interaction was also found in a reading comprehension test as investigated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0305735611422672">Furnham and Strbac (2002)</xref> who also support the Eysenckian hypothesis, but compared music to office noise (ringing telephones, people typing on typewriters) and silence.</p>
<p>Other types of auditory stimuli have been investigated in this area of research. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0305735611422672">Ylias and Heaven (2003)</xref> found extraverts performed significantly better than introverts in the presence of television noise. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0305735611422672">Furnham, Trew and Sneade (1999)</xref> used a reading comprehension, logic and coding task and predicted that in the presence of vocal music, introverts will perform significantly worse than extraverts compared to in the presence of instrumental music. However, despite finding trends that followed this prediction, they did not find significant results.</p>
<p>One aspect of music that seems to be important is the mood effects it has for participants. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0305735611422672">Furnham and Stephenson (2007)</xref> predicted that extraverts were more likely to perform worse having been induced with a negative mood, whereas introverts were more likely to perform better, as this result was found with ‘defensive pessimists’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0305735611422672">Norem &amp; Illingworth, 2004</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0305735611422672">Furnham and Stephenson (2007)</xref> manipulated the affective value of the music by having positive, negative and ambiguous music and saw how this interacted with introverts, extraverts, stable and neurotic children. However, they did not find significant results for their prediction.</p>
<p>More recently <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0305735611422672">Cassidy and MacDonald (2007)</xref> introduced the idea of high and low level arousing music. Their 40 participants completed five cognitive tasks in the presence of highly arousing music, low-arousal music, noise or silence. Scores were highest in the silent condition, and significantly higher in the low as opposed to high-arousing music condition. Further, as predicted, introverts were more detrimentally-affected than extraverts, in the presence of highly arousing music and noise.</p>
<p>The aim this study is to test for a significant music-personality interaction with vocal/instrumental, background music. It used different music than those in previous studies and an older ‘cleaner’ measure of extraversion that has more impulsivity and less sociability items which measures the heart of the Eysenckian distractability hypothesis. Further, familiar music instead of ‘novel’ music will be compared. Familiar music may increase its distractibility for introverts and cause stronger detriment to their performance. It may also increase its strength on being a beneficial influence for extraverts. This study tested the following hypotheses: First, on the verbal test scores, participants will perform significantly worse in the presence of vocal music compared to instrumental music, and in vocal music compared to silence (silence &lt; instrumental &lt; vocal). This is because <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0305735611422672">Stroupe (2005)</xref> found that listening to lyrics in music led to a slower speed of processing in a task that involved reading verbal information. Second, introverts will perform significantly worse in all tests in the presence of vocal music compared to silence, in instrumental music compared to silence, and in vocal music compared to instrumental music. This is because <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0305735611422672">Furnham et al. (1999)</xref> found trends following this interaction, where vocal music is viewed as more arousing and would lead extraverts’ level of arousal to increase to their optimum level.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>58 students (36 females and 22 males) with ages ranging from 16 to 18 years old (mean age = 16.78 years) took part. All were volunteer first-year British students. They gave their consent on a standard form after the experiment was approved by the departmental ethics committee.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0305735611422672">
<title>Materials</title>
<p>For the music conditions, the songs played were chosen by four independent raters (aged 17–18) and were being rated on familiarity and tempo. During each of the instrumentals to 14 songs, the raters had to judge on a 10-point scale the extent to which they agreed on a range of statements, such as ‘I hear this song all the time’ where 1 indicated ‘strongly disagree’ and 10 indicated ‘strongly agree’. Also, raters judged how they felt best described the tempo of the song, with a score of 1 indicating ‘very slow’ to 10 indicating ‘very fast’. Three songs were chosen to feature in the experiment that lasted the duration of each test, taking into consideration the highest familiarity scores and those centered on the median tempo scores. The three songs are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0305735611422672">Table 1</xref> together with their mean familiarity and tempo scores. The music played in the vocal and instrumental conditions were exactly the same except that in the instrumental condition, the music did not contain the artists’ voices. The order in which the songs were played were also counterbalanced and pre-determined across the three testing sessions.</p>

<p>In order to determine participants’ level of extraversion, the Eysenck Personality Inventory (EPI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0305735611422672">Eysenck &amp; Eysenck, 1964</xref>) was used with a maximum score of 24 where introverts would score lower than extraverts. The mean score was 15.13 which is similar to population norms. The test is thought to be superior to the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire (EPQ) in its measurement of introversion-extraversion because it has more impulsivity and less sociability items. It is in essence a ‘purer’ measure of arousal theory extraversion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0305735611422672">Rocklin &amp; Revelle, 1981</xref>).</p>
<p>There were three ‘job selection’ tests that tested three types of cognitive skills (Saville Consulting: Verbal, Numerical and Diagrammatic Analysis tests, which were purchased for the testing). Each lasted for 10 minutes and were multiple-choice with a maximum score of 16. The verbal test involved the reading and interpretation of passages with multiple choice questions relating to an understanding of the text. The numerical test involved answering multiple choice questions on the underlying meanings of various tables (i.e., sales reports) showing numerical data. The diagrammatic test involved choosing the correct answer from various options that questioned the understanding of logical or flow diagrams. All were related to real world, rather than abstract issues.</p>

<sec id="section5-0305735611422672">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>This study employed a classic latin-square design, using three groups (A, B, C) who completed three different tests under three conditions. Participants completed the three job-selection tests under the music conditions in an order that was pre-determined for each testing session. Before each test, the experimenter announced that participants had 10 minutes to complete the test and would be warned when there were 2 minutes left. There were slightly different instructions given before the diagrammatic test, where participants still had ten minutes but the first 2 minutes were for reading the instructions only and asking the experimenter any questions if there was something they did not understand. Participants were also told before the test if music was going to be played, and it was played for the duration of the test from a CD on a stereo. This was kept at the same volume and positioned at the same place in the classroom (at the front) throughout the experiment. A stopwatch was also used to time the 10-minute intervals. After all three tests were completed under their appropriate music conditions, participants were asked to complete the optional post-test questionnaire. This was designed to see if the music used was rated appropriately in terms of familiarity and tempo by comparing their ratings to the ratings made by the independent raters.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0305735611422672">Table 2</xref> shows the mean scores and standard errors from the three tests according to the three music conditions in which the tests were taken. It can be seen that the test with the lowest mean scores across all music conditions is the diagrammatic test, with the lowest score in the silence condition (4.00), and the highest came from the instrumental condition (9.63). The silence condition has had a positive influence on the verbal test but a puzzling negative influence on the diagrammatic test. In the numerical test, there seems to be little variation between the mean scores across the three music conditions compared to the other two tests. This shows that across the three testing sessions, participants performed quite similarly in the numerical test, but varied in performance on the other two tests across the different music conditions.</p>

<p>A regression analysis was employed for each type of test to see whether there was a main effect of music, personality or an interaction between music and personality. Then three pair-wise comparisons were made for each test by employing independent sample <italic>t</italic>-tests in order to compare the test scores achieved within the three music conditions.</p>
<p>From the regression analysis carried out from the scores on the <italic>verbal test</italic>, it was found that there was a main effect of music (<italic>F</italic>(2,52) = 14.34, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), but there was no main effect of personality (<italic>F</italic> &lt; 1) or the interaction between music and personality (<italic>F</italic> &lt; 1). The overall model accounted for 27.2% of the variability in the verbal test scores, where the main effect of music accounted for 31.1%, personality accounted for 0.4% and the interaction accounted for 0.9%. To investigate the main effect of music further, it was found that there was a significant difference in the verbal scores between the vocal music condition and silence (<italic>t</italic>(52) = 3.63, <italic>p</italic> = 0.001), there was a significant difference between the instrumental music and silence (<italic>t</italic>(52) = 5.33, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001,) but there was no significant difference between the vocal and instrumental music (<italic>t</italic>(52) = 1.95, <italic>p</italic> = 0.06).</p>
<p>The regression analysis from the scores on the <italic>numerical test</italic> showed that there was no main effect of the music conditions (<italic>F</italic>(2,51) = 2.62, <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05, a marginally significant main effect of personality (<italic>F</italic>(2,51) = 3.71, <italic>p</italic> = 0.06, and no main effect of the interaction between music and personality (<italic>F</italic> &lt; 1). The overall model accounted for 18.7% of the variability in the numerical test scores, where the main effect of music accounted for 9.2%, personality accounted for 6.5% and the interaction accounted for 3%. Three pair-wise comparisons for investigating the effect of music showed that there was no significant difference between the vocal and silence conditions (<italic>t</italic>(51) = 1.60, <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05), there was no significant difference between the instrumental and silence conditions (<italic>t</italic>(51) = 0.74, <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05), but there was a significant difference between the vocal condition and the instrumental condition (<italic>t</italic>(51) = 2.27, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05).</p>
<p>An analysis of regression on the scores from the <italic>diagrammatic test</italic> showed that there was a main effect of music (<italic>F</italic>(2,52) = 8.84, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), no effect of personality (<italic>F</italic> &lt; 1), and no main effect of the interaction between them (<italic>F</italic>(2,52) = 1.44, <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05). The overall model accounted for 27.2% of the variability in the diagrammatic test scores, where the main effect of music accounted for 23.3%, personality accounted for less than 0.1% and the interaction accounted for 3.8%. Within the music conditions, it was found that there was a significant difference between the vocal and silence conditions (<italic>t</italic>(52) = 2.47, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05), there was a significant difference between the instrumental and silence conditions (<italic>t</italic>(52) = 4.14, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), but there was no significant difference between the vocal and instrumental conditions (<italic>t</italic>(52) = 1.92, <italic>p</italic> = 0.06).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Results from the three regression analyses for each test found no main effect of personality. This is not uncommon in this area where often results are in the predicted direction but fail to reach significance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0305735611422672">Furnham &amp; Stephenson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0305735611422672">Furnham et al., 1999</xref>) possibly because of the small <italic>N</italic> and not choosing ‘extreme’ groups of introverts or extraverts at least one standard deviation from the norm. The results showed that for all tests, there were no significant main effects of the music-personality interaction. Another explanation as to why no significant interactions were found is that <italic>all</italic> participants may have found the music too distracting and too familiar. This supports previous claims that music overall can have undesirable effects in a working situation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0305735611422672">Uhrbrock, 1961</xref>) and that familiar music which is likely to elicit positive feelings like major key music leads to distortions in their perception of time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0305735611422672">Kellaris &amp; Kent, 1992</xref>). Participants may have found themselves enjoying the music too much that they perceived time to be going slower and may have had to rush the tests when they realized they were actually running out of time. It may also be that the tasks themselves contributed a lot to the variability in the scores and that the other factors became less powerful as a result. That is, variability in the task and the distractor account for much more variance than that of the personality of the participant.</p>
<p>However, despite the lack of a significant interaction in the numerical test, the regression results show a pattern of results in the predicted direction. In both the vocal and instrumental music conditions, extraverts tended to score higher particularly in the vocal condition. From the pair-wise comparisons, it was found that there was a significant verbal test score difference in the scores in the presence of vocal music compared to silence. There was also a significant difference between the instrumental music and silence. However, there was no significant difference in the presence of vocal compared to instrumental music, although this was marginally significant (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.07).</p>
<p>Participants did perform better when taking the verbal test in silence compared to when taking the test with vocal music. Participants also performed better in silence compared to instrumental music. Nearly all studies in this area have shown that the highest scores achieved are when the tests were completed in silence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0305735611422672">Cassidy &amp; MacDonald, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0305735611422672">Miller &amp; Schyb, 1989</xref>). It can therefore be concluded that music, regardless of whether it contains lyrics or not, had a detrimental effect on verbal performance, and that the best environment for all participants when doing a verbal test is to be in silence. This result followed the expected direction and provides support for <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0305735611422672">Stroupe (2005)</xref>. Thus when workers are doing a complex task, or students attempt to learn/process complex material, or indeed complete an exam it may be strongly advised that they do so in silence so as to ensure maximal performance.</p>
<p>The results followed the opposite direction to what was expected in the numerical test. Here, the only significant pair-wise comparison was between the vocal and instrumental music conditions, where those in the presence of vocal music achieved better scores. The possible reason why better numerical scores were achieved with vocal music could be because there was no conflict of verbal information between the music and the test. The numerical test lacked verbal information and does not need to compete with the verbal information in the vocal music. This lack of distraction <italic>could</italic> therefore lead to better performance. This is in comparison to when the verbal test was being answered with vocal music – two sets of verbal information would have to be processed at the same time leading to distraction. Another explanation is that the vocal music produced a high amount of arousal that was needed for answering a numerical test that is practiced less often. Because we process words more frequently than processing numbers, more arousal is needed for a task practiced less, and so better scores were achieved where the most arousal was produced (with the vocal music). However it should be noted that other studies using arithmetic/numerical tasks did tend to find any distractor-impaired performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0305735611422672">Furnham &amp; Strbac, 2002</xref>)</p>
<p>Perhaps the most surprising results were found in the diagrammatic test. Performance in the presence of both the vocal and instrumental music conditions were significantly different compared to the performance in silence. However, the regression showed that the distribution of scores is generally higher in the presence of music, both for vocal and instrumental, compared to silence. This is opposite to what was found from the verbal test where scores were generally higher in the silence condition. This is also opposite to what was found by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0305735611422672">Dannenbaum (1945)</xref> where in the presence of music, participants performed worse when identifying geometric faults, a very similar task to the diagrammatic test in the present study. This type of test was probably least familiar to the participants. Further, there was a large standard error in the silent group and it is possible that because a few participants did particularly badly the results occurred as they did. Certainly this anomalous finding requires replication on a bigger sample.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0305735611422672">Furnham et al. (1999)</xref> found that instrumental music led to a significantly better performance in the logic/diagrammatic task. Therefore, it could be that when doing logical reasoning tasks (similar to some extent to Ravens Progressive matrices), instrumental music is best to listen to in order to improve one’s performance. However it is also possible that instrumental music without vocals is particularly distracting to students because it is unfamiliar or even that they ‘sing along’ if they know the words.</p>
<p>Results from the post-test questionnaire showed that the majority (74.1%) of participants gave a rating of 6 or more when asked how often they listen to music whilst studying. It was also found that the majority (59.3%) gave a rating of 6 or more on a 10-point scale when asked the extent to which they agree that listening to music whilst studying generally helps.</p>
<p>A future study may want to include participants who do not necessarily want to work with music, as the result may lead those participants to realize that listening to music whilst working may actually benefit them, especially when using headsets. Another suggestion for future research is to study different preferences of music but also incorporating the variable of music complexity. This link was proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0305735611422672">Berlyne (1971)</xref>, where it was claimed that the relationship between music preference and the perception of music’s complexity is an inverted ‘U’ shape. It is also interesting to test whether listening to music people choose and prefer whilst working correlates with task enjoyment and performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0305735611422672">Lesiuk, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Research in this area has demonstrated that the effect of distraction on task performance depends on the nature of the task, the nature of the distraction and the personality of those doing the task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0305735611422672">Cassidy &amp; MacDonald, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0305735611422672">Ylias &amp; Heaven, 2003</xref>). Most studies have looked at music as a distraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0305735611422672">Schellenberg et al., 2007</xref>) and introversion-extraversion as the most relevant personality variable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0305735611422672">Furnham et al., 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>Most studies have shown some support for their hypotheses though the results are frequently non-significant, and occasionally, as in this study, significant but against the predictions. This possibly reflects three things: first, that experimental studies often have small <italic>N</italic>s of 10–30 per condition and where high variability on tasks can introduce error; second, that there are various important and subtle effects of music that are often not taken into consideration such as loudness, familiarity and liking; and third, that the individual difference effects are subtle and may well be influenced by other factors (i.e., intelligence, test-taking attitudes) that are not considered. However, the obvious relevance of this research to educational and work setting means that research is likely to continue and improve to answer some of the important questions in this area.</p>
