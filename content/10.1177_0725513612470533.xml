<abstract>
<p>Despite a constitutional and oft-stated political commitment to an undefined notion of non-racialism, South Africans continue to operate in formal and informal ways with ‘race’ as the common-sense organizing principle of legal systems, ways of thinking, social identities, constructing arguments or closing debate, organizational and mobilizing strategies, policy development and execution, and interaction in daily life. This state of affairs is regrettable and dangerous, often questioned and rejected, but objections are waged and alternatives suggested against the tide of societal trends. What the organizing principle of race thinking does is to close the mind to alternative possibilities – of thought, social practice and ways of living. Here I explore an overview of racialism as it permeates and shapes the life cycles of citizens from birth to death. I make an argument for a way of thinking that is necessarily utopian, as one of few options of escaping a social world made in the image of apartheid.</p>

<title>Classification and the South African body</title>
<p>A Google search of the South African Department of Home Affairs websites in 2012 produces two forms for ‘Notice of Birth’ – the one (BI-24 E) asks for no racial identification; not for the ‘child’, nor for the ‘father’ and the ‘mother’ (these last two designations carry their own problems in a country that legally recognizes same-sex marriages, but not for this exercise I am engaging in) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0725513612470533">DHA 2012b</xref>). The second form, produced through a URL aimed at births registered from the USA (also BI-24), specifies ‘natural mother’ and ‘natural father’ of the child on the front page, but on the second page (identified as ‘Information for Medical and Health Use Only’) it demands ‘Population Group’ for both ‘Mother’ and ‘Father’ along with medical details of the newborn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0725513612470533">DHA 2012a</xref>). The identical BI-24 form was also available a decade ago at a private hospital in Durban. Because this is South Africa, the form-filler completing the second page of BI-24 would have no difficulty understanding the four spokes of the population wheel indicated through a choice of blocks to tick: <italic>African</italic>, <italic>Coloured</italic>, <italic>Indian</italic> and <italic>White</italic>. There is an <italic>Other</italic> option, which may present some trouble or at least reflection, but there will not be many of those whose self-identification will be inclined toward this amorphous category.</p>
<p>Here is another form: In 2011 I had a personally sad occasion to complete it in order to allow cremation at the municipal facility in the eThekwini Metropolitan area, within which the city of Durban is located (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0725513612470533">eThekwini Metro 2011</xref>). The form has 11 questions that must be answered before a body can be disposed of, in keeping with protocols of medical clearance, a death certificate and permissions from the next of kin and the Will of deceased. Seventeen years after the end of the racialized and racist apartheid order, Question 3 remains: ‘The race of the deceased was XXX?’ Does the use of past tense indicate that death ends race classification? Or does the label rather apply to an ideal category, of which individuals are inevitable but temporary (even if life-long) members? What does it mean that children (sometimes confusingly) carry the race classification of the parents and that race continues to be a primary way the nation is demographically described?</p>
<p>Research by Ipsos-Markinor, reported recently in an Afrikaans-language daily newspaper, <italic>Die Burger</italic> (2012), captures the ‘make up’ of the nation this way: If ‘Averageville’ in South Africa had 100 inhabitants, 76 would be ‘black’, 12 ‘white’, ten ‘brown’ (or ‘coloured’) and two ‘Indian’. Eighty-three would have mobile phones or the use of one, but 80 would have no access to the internet. IsiZulu is the home language of 20 in this fictive place, while 19 speak English and 13 speak Afrikaans as first languages. The sexes are evenly spread. In this account, there is no hybridity or entanglement. The very word ‘demographics’, when used in the media and wider, has become parlance for expressing a single aspect of belonging and group identity: that of race.</p>
<p>These statistics and their representations in forms and documentation point to the ubiquitous and everyday presence of race-thinking in South Africa. Continuing calls for the relevance of race, in such a variety of situations and towards so many projects, is enabled by what Brian Fay called a ‘prior vocabulary’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0725513612470533">1996</xref>: 73). Race words, their relevance to the ongoing experience of people, the historical confirmation of their essences, persist in post-apartheid times. This is in large part because they have been created over centuries. However, for a prior vocabulary of race to continue, directly and deliberately, it has to be newly imagined and experienced as having current relevance – it has to be seen as valid to the present social context, valid to the concerns of the now. This process of continuity calls on researchers to explore the manner in which ‘acceptable narratives are constructed’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0725513612470533">Lampland and Star 2009</xref>: 7), constructions that utilize the vocabulary that already exists, even if apparently towards diametrically different ends.</p>
<p>Instruments that classify the South African human body by race, at birth and at death and everything in between, raise two main points: first, the state has historically been – and continues to be – central to the creation and maintenance of racialized identities for reasons of power and control, and the concomitant material benefits; and, while there are various ways in which this occurs, they all relate to the formal recognition and labelling of the body through bureaucratic and policed processes. Second, it requires the passive and active participation of the individuals so-labelled to make race continually meaningful as a social category.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0725513612470533">1</xref>
</sup> What are the reasons for such ‘allegiances’ to the notion of race? Race, as a pervading ideology, is for most South Africans a ‘common sense’ way of thinking about the social world, it is embedded in language, in space, place and in ways of interacting. It cannot ‘be wished away’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0725513612470533">Everatt 2012</xref>: 11), and indeed few social theorists are ‘naïve’ enough to believe that the science that refutes biological conceptions of ‘race’ will lead to the demise of racialism or racism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0725513612470533">Everatt 2012</xref>: 11).</p>
<p>Where does this leave social scientists, like those who generated the data displayed by the newspaper in the case of South Africa’s ‘Averageville’? How do we not only describe, but explain, the apparent contradictions of living constitutional non-racialism while addressing the world around us as consisting of races? What is the nature of the race thinking that circulates: what characteristics, visual cues and cultural stereotypes are attributed to race categories that enable their reproduction?</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0725513612470533">
<title>The how and the why of (South African) classification</title>
<p>In an investigation of how humans ‘sort things out’, similar to Bauman’s claim about ‘abstraction’ (2000: 227), Geoffrey C. Bowker and Susan Leigh Star set themselves three questions that are relevant in this discussion of race classification: ‘What work do classifications and standards do?’; ‘Who does that work?’; and ‘What happens to cases that do not fit?’ (2000: 9).</p>
<p>Bowker and Star argue that classification, a human activity, can take many forms and engage a multitude of objects or practices. Some of them can be rewarding in various direct and indirect ways. The solar system explorer ‘Curiosity’ could not have landed on Mars if classification and accompanying standards had not been agreed upon by the multitude of manufacturers of parts or creators of computer control systems; consumers cannot be protected against the misuse of inappropriate ingredients or evaluate measures of weight or volume unless the state and producers agree on labelling procedures; birders globally would not be able to converse and agree on sightings unless all were aware of the (ever-changing) classification of birds.</p>
<p>Human beings are not birds. But over the centuries, similar debates to those that concern the classifiers of birds have engaged scientists, politicians and bureaucrats with regard to the classifications of human beings. Much has been written about these scientific incursions, debates, bureaucratic practices and policies (see, for example, for South Africa: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0725513612470533">Dubow 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0725513612470533">Bowker and Star 2000</xref>: ch. 6; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0725513612470533">Malik 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0725513612470533">Kohn 1995</xref>; and the novel by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0725513612470533">Basu 2006</xref>). Scientific racism has shaped the world, creating and confirming popular prejudices and providing justifications for the ill-treatment, exploitation and domination and genocidal killings of racialized groups, lodging itself in attitudes and practices that can be traced to colonialism and subsequent domination but are firmly ensconced in thoroughly ‘modern’ societies. The refutation of those ideas – through science, through post-Holocaust United Nations-driven political initiatives, and more recently through the generation of genetic information – has been far less successful. Even in certain ‘scientific’ fields of knowledge and practice, such as medicine, the presence of race as un-nuanced indicator remains (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0725513612470533">Witzig 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>Race, as a continued vocabulary, articulates with both historic and contemporary material inequalities (operating on a global scale from slavery and colonialism to globalization). But it has also organized responses to inequalities and historical traumas. Race speaks to what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0725513612470533">Cheng (2000)</xref> called ‘grief’, emotional legacy of racism, to distinguish it from the more material demands for justice and retribution that originate from ‘grievance’. In other words, race also at times provides ‘comfort’ through historical experiences of group belonging, and through explanations operating at a group level; race belonging addresses psychological hurt; race belonging can serve in very powerful ways to stir emotions (see the debate Appiah ignited in America when he touched on this issue, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0725513612470533">Appiah 1989</xref>).</p>
<p>‘Race’, then, is considered by many the most appropriate means through which to address grievances in post-apartheid South Africa. The grievances are those of material discrimination, those that can be addressed through political power, especially those over distribution and redistribution of social goods, such as housing, electricity and water, and other infrastructure, capitalist ownership of the means of production (especially land), the ability to distribute rewards in wages and profits, and correction of the massive imbalances in racialized demographics in workplaces (especially of skilled employment). We can start providing an answer to Bowker and Star’s first question: ‘What work do classifications and standards do?’ In the arena of social and productive life, classification of races allows the many practices of (re)distribution to be undertaken, to correct the damage inflicted by apartheid and previous systems of discrimination. Race is not the only vector through which corrective policies could be driven, but it stands in policy as an over-arching correlate for other possible ways.</p>
<p>If ‘race’ is a means for such ends, what is ‘race’? The way in which that answer is provided is always context specific, at least in the specifics as shaped by historical experience and the demands of the moment. Brazil is not dealing with it in the same manner as Britain or Germany, and certainly not in the same way as South Africa. Processes of labelling humans need to find, or confirm if the moment of first creation lies in the past, those who are ‘not us’, within which lies the organizing principle of aspects of difference. Such a process, of necessity, requires a notion of ‘us’ or a continuous search for and definition of what ‘we’ are, and reasons why we are what we are. It must be noted, however, that there have been many convincing arguments that those in hegemonic dominance do not have to define the ‘us’, as that is already the given, the other within <italic>others</italic> are strange, and strangers and different, groups to be ‘tolerated’ (on the implications of such an approach see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0725513612470533">Brown 2006</xref>). This would apply, especially, to arguments that there exists a global ‘whiteness’. Such processes hold for encompassing labels such as race, ethnicity, and gender, as well as for micro-groupings with less rigid boundaries, such as religion, or family, which are open to or demand inclusion over time. ‘Racialism’ (or race thinking) refers to the classification of humans into identifiable groups (‘races’), argued to be biologically distinct, with this distinction being manifested in appearance (such as skin, hair, facial features), and with each of these groups having specific cultural attributes and the members sharing personal traits. ‘Racism’ enters the picture when a hierarchy of status and/or abilities is perceived to exist between ‘races’. Racism can be enacted if the power to do so exists (see, for example, the discussion by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0725513612470533">Miles 1989</xref>). The existence of races is treated as fact. In an engaging chapter entitled ‘Do people in different cultures live in different worlds?’, Brian Fay notes that ‘facts’ (like race) are ‘<italic>phenomena under a particular description</italic>’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0725513612470533">1996</xref>: 73, emphasis in original). Fay continues:<disp-quote>
<p>Facts are linguistically meaningful entities, which select out from the stream of events what happened or what exists. But this means that in order for there to be facts at all there must be a vocabulary in terms of which they can be described. Without a prior vocabulary which a describer brings to a situation there would be no facts whatsoever.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>In the case addressed here the terms of description, the vocabulary of race, of four races in South Africa, rather than two, or six, or one, developed and changed over centuries, and was often contested and changed during that contestation. In apartheid South Africa, the naming of the ‘facts’ of races varied, even if the categories remained distinct: for example, ‘native’ became ‘Bantu’ became ‘black’ (and is now, also, designated ‘African’ or ‘black African’). There were contestations between apartheid ideologists and bureaucrats, and between resistance organizations (such as the Unity Movement, Black Consciousness movement and organizations, and the African National Congress) over inclusivity or exclusivity of categories such as ‘black’. There were even – in a few cases –rejections of race categories. There was and remains the hard work of giving meaning to non-racialism as shared vision, and as lived reality, rather than just one of the politically-correct slogans.</p>

<title>Historical constructions of race: The founding example</title>
<p>The settlement of the Cape, at the south-western tip of the African continent, took place in 1652. The statue of the Dutch-East India Company representative at that moment, Jan van Riebeeck, still stands in Cape Town, and for much of the 20th century his arrival was celebrated through a public holiday on 6 April, Van Riebeeck’s Day, and then <italic>Founder’s</italic> Day (sic) from 1980, until abolished by the democratic government after 1994. Six years after the date of settlement, in 1658, there were already signs of another identity, based on material needs and a tone of rebellion, through a petition to Jan van Riebeeck, no longer as employees of the Company. ‘Pervading the petition was a sense of outrage that such things were being done to them while they were “the defenders of the land”, as they described themselves. They wanted to be “no Company slaves”. Instead of “being assisted, they were being oppressed”’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0725513612470533">Giliomee 2003</xref>: 1), stated those who as ‘free burghers’ had been released from Company employ, to provide the supplies for the passing ships at less cost to the DEIC than direct employment. These people, who had arrived as employees, were now settlers, also laying claim to land through private property and social relations of production brought from Europe. Their identities, and those who subsequently arrived as settlers, were to be shaped in the centuries to come by international factors as European conflicts had an impact on southern African government, occupation, conquest and other policies. But their concerns were increasingly local, as it became clear that new identities were being forged in response to Africa, its people and, increasingly, to its wealth. Europe nearly created another French-speaking part of Africa, indirectly through the arrival from 1688 of French Huguenots, fleeing religious persecution. Giliomee notes (2003: 11) that this arrival<disp-quote>
<p>prompted Van der Stel [‘commander’ of the settlement at the time] to stress the Dutch dimension of the burghers’ identity. A veteran of the Dutch-French war of the 1670s, he had no intention of allowing a French enclave to take root at the Cape [and] by 1750 no one under the age of forty could still speak French … [T]he Huguenots, nevertheless, did much to stabilise the free burgher population. Without a fatherland to return to, they had to take root or disappear.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>That final statement captures the subsequent site and social relations of identity formation amongst the settling population, and the clashes within the settling social formation. In the 20th century South African political and social theorists drew on the borrowed notion of ‘colonialism of a special type’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0725513612470533">Wolpe 1988</xref>) to characterize both the history and the rootedness of that part of the demographic mix – both of and foreign to the land of birth.</p>
<p>Slavery (there were slaves at the Cape from 1658) fed into the prevailing status aspirations amongst the burghers – first, through the foreign influences of the places of origin of the slaves. Second, manual labour was to be avoided by the free burghers to avoid ‘the connotation of slave status’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0725513612470533">Giliomee 2003</xref>: 12). Such a relationship to labour and to black people was to continue, with obvious historical specificities, until the various racist laws that privileged white workers in the 20th century, for example through ‘job reservation’ laws and practices. If Giliomee is correct, that until the end of the 18th century deliberate introduction of ‘clear racial distinctions or the need to develop an ideology of racism’ was not necessary, because legal status was sufficiently rigid and reproduced the existing order (2003: 50), such status still maintained divisions and othering that correlated with race (as colour and status, religion and language and customs). Racially conscious distinctions, when they took root, would then seem to be simply another name for the same categories. Race by any other name …? By the late-18th century, however, Giliomee notes that notions of race superiority were identifiably developing, at roughly the same time that the term ‘Afrikaner’ (person of Africa) started being used (2003: 51).</p>
<p>These racialized categories increasingly shaped perceptions, descriptions, attributions, and political forms, in the British colonies and the Boer republics that existed in the sub-continent during the 19th century. They were given legal status in the constitutions of both the (white) republics (until their defeat by Britain by the first years of the 20th century) and the Union in 1910, after defeat of the republics and the creation of the integrated social formation to be known as (the Union of) South Africa. That history of segregation, based on the overwhelming exclusion of anyone not categorized as ‘white’ or ‘European’, and then apartheid that firmed those divisions and introduced the additional categories of ethnic division amongst those classified as Bantu (in other words, the people who had occupied most of what became South Africa before 1652), the citizens-to-be of the Bantustans (or ‘homelands’ as they were called by the policy formulators) will not be repeated here, except to note the founding legislative base for the apartheid order, the Population Registration Act of 1950 (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0725513612470533">Horrell 1982</xref>). This Act, utilizing the opportunity provided by a subsequent census count, fixed the race and ethnic group membership (the latter through the prime indicator of language) of every South African, with the cynical intention of removing shared citizenship of more than 80 per cent of the population. Race categories, while informed by genealogy and ‘blood’, were not totally fixed in that way, but based in social terminology (for a glimpse into the verbal acrobatics required, see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0725513612470533">Girvin 1987</xref>). It was this apparent oddity that allowed appeals against race classification! It was never clear what (proverbial) ‘coloured’ skeletons would be found in which Afrikaner family cupboard. There was, after all, a book, called <italic>Groep Sonder Grense</italic> (Group without Borders) by HF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0725513612470533">Heese (2005)</xref>, with the revealing sub-title of <italic>Die rol en status van die gemengde bevolking aan die Kaap, 1652–1795 </italic>(<italic>The role and status of the mixed population at the Cape, 1652–1795</italic>). This book came long after the Population Registration Act of 1950 (the book was first published in 1985), but the knowledge was there from the start, that we were a <italic>bastervolk</italic> (bastard nation), as South African poet Breyten Breytenbach described it. In a review article of Giliomee’s book, Thembisa <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0725513612470533">Waetjen (2005</xref>: 91) comments that, for example,<disp-quote>
<p>Afrikaner racial identity, indeed, is never fixed in this story [the ‘biography’] and, for example, Giliomee dwells on the public discussions that cropped up about whether coloured [‘mixed-race’] Afrikaans-speakers should be drawn formally into Afrikaner civic, if not community, life.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>However, success in appeals against classification were achieved by those closest in appearance and culture to the ‘white’ standard (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0725513612470533">Erasmus 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0725513612470533">2011</xref>, and on standards in maintaining categories see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0725513612470533">Lampland and Star 2009</xref>). Those who have the power set the standards. In colonial southern Africa, and in segregationist and apartheid South Africa, the categories and the standards were adapted, maintained and policed to ensure that the groupings so recognized represented the needs of the policies of control and exploitation. Class and race were meshed in mutually reinforcing ways, as they are now.</p>
<p>Appeals may have been possible, and the success rate for those who did appeal was surprisingly high. But there was no attempt to undermine the system by flooding it with appeals. A central argument that I am making is that while the <italic>consequences of race classification</italic> were resisted, finally from the early 1960s through armed struggle, the <italic>categories of race-belonging</italic> were generally accepted long before (and long after) the Population Registration Act. This Act, in a manner probably similar to the Land Act of 1913, confirmed what had already taken place but gave it additional strength through the legal process, through the documentation, through (relatively) inflexible classification, and through sanctions that ultimately depended on the South African Police, courts and jails.</p>
<p>In the case of the 1913 Natives Land Act, it gave legal force to more than two centuries of cumulative conquest, and legalized dispossession of land occupied and utilized by groups of people living in what became South Africa, in some cases with a presence dating back tens of thousands of years. The Act also prohibited further acquisition of land by black people, in provinces where this was still possible; and it has featured prominently in land restitution policies and actions in the country since the 1990s (for an overview of the processes and motivation see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0725513612470533">Walker 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>The general acceptance of race as lived reality, the proper order of things, is what allows all citizens to be actual and potential classifiers – as we will see illustrated below – but now without the crude benefit of legislated definitions and identity documents that over-rode doubt. Let me explore this further, into post-1994 South Africa, because the consequences for the present (and the future) are enormous. Deborah Posel brought the past of the Population Registration Act of 1950 and the present of continued ‘race’ classification together. She concludes an article – ‘What’s in a name? Racial categorisations under apartheid and their afterlife’ – by noting that it ‘may then be one of the more disturbing ironies of post-apartheid “transformation” that it gives new salience to biological versions of race – a reinvestment in the significance of the body as a site of differentiation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0725513612470533">2001</xref>: 71).</p>
<p>Posel, too, notes that apartheid policy-makers adopted ‘a deliberately more flexible, elastic approach to the definition of racial categories […] one that gave official standing to long established social readings of racial difference’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0725513612470533">2001</xref>: 55). She also uses words like ‘common sense’, ‘manifest features of lived experience’, and ‘everyday experience’ to describe this process. So, the first answer to Bowker and Star’s question of ‘Who does the work?’ is that we all do, as South African citizens and as citizens in other racialized societies, but some as part of formal, state-required processes. It can now be left to ‘social readings’ and ‘common sense’, utilizing a ‘prior vocabulary’, to enforce or even just employ race on the state’s behalf.</p>
<p>Bowker and Star point to the elements of contemporary classification in South Africa:<disp-quote>
<p>As layers of classification system become enfolded into a working infrastructure, the original political intervention becomes more and more firmly entrenched. In many cases, this leads to a naturalization of the political category, through a process of convergence. It becomes taken for granted. (We are using the word naturalization advisedly here, since it is only through our infrastructures that we can describe and manipulate nature). We emphasize here the stubborn refusal of ‘race’ to fit the desired classification system suborned by its pro-apartheid designers. (2000: 197)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The question now is what happens when ‘society’ as a whole fits ‘race’ into the categories?</p>

<title>Race as policy</title>
<p>Any social formation that relies on ‘race’ classification as an element for policy implementation has to engage the participation of thousands of bureaucrats and enforcers. However, in the absence of clarity on ‘race’, but legal clarity on the results that can only be achieved through some process of classification, everyone becomes a potential classifier, whether in the public or the private sector. Every single site where a form has to be completed, whether a birth certificate, a travel claim document at some institutions, student registrations, the composition of sports teams, workplaces of all descriptions, tender documents, articles in newspapers, loan applications, tender processes to any government department, and many more, each demand that decisions on ‘race’ have to be made. This is obviously required of the person completing the form, but then also of the receiver, and of the final destination. For acceptance it relies centrally on the passive or active involvement of citizens, at least a large majority of them. The two forms mentioned in the introduction to this contribution are just some of these, among the many I have collected over the past 18 years. Those forms join thousands of other media reports that rely, even if not stated in the crude terms of the apartheid period, on the readers’ knowledge of the banality of race presence. These reports cover debates on ‘Transformation’,<sup>

<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0725513612470533">4</xref>
</sup> on the race demographics of sports teams, of musicians, of schoolchildren, of those who pass exams, succeed or fail at any endeavour. In fact, just about every aspect of social life that makes its way to the pages of the print media carries the stated or implied imprint of race.</p>
<p>How we participate in classification, the classes, and the measures (the ‘standards’) we use, ‘however imbricated in our lives, are ordinarily invisible’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0725513612470533">Bowker and Star 2000</xref>: 2). They continue:<disp-quote>
<p>Remarkably for such a central part of our lives, we stand for the most part in formal ignorance of the social and moral order created by these invisible, potent entities. Their impact is indisputable, and as Foucault reminds us, inescapable. Try the simple experiment of ignoring your gender classification … The material force of categories appears always and instantly. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0725513612470533">Bowker and Star 2000</xref>: 3)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>There are cases, some revealed through research and others reported in the press, that indicate the ‘how’ of the processes of classification in post-1994 South Africa. They indicate puzzlement and also at times concern – reflecting the third question asked by Bowker and Star, namely: ‘What happens to cases that do not fit?’ I will refer to just three illustrations, partly to answer that question.</p>
<p>The first draws on a case, reported in April 2007, and which I previously used in a footnote because it speaks so forcibly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0725513612470533">Maré 2011a</xref>: 76). A teacher in the Eastern Cape province in South Africa, upon enquiring about the ‘race’ of a child (as required for the completion of an Education Department form), was told ‘Miss, I’m mixed, so just call me black’. This occurred in the small town of Graaff Reinet. The teacher ‘wondered if the department [of Education] could provide guidelines on how to go about classification. “How black is black? And when is a pupil a coloured?”… A teacher at Uitenhage [another town in the Eastern Cape province] says if she can’t tell the race of pupils from their skin colour, she looks at their surnames, “failing that, I ask the pupil”’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0725513612470533">Olivier 2007</xref>). It becomes not ‘who are you?’, but ‘what are you?’, the essential switch that takes place in categorization in the effacing of the individual.</p>
<p>Ironically, because of both the speaker and the moment in history, earlier acknowledgement of such effect, of becoming a specimen of the category, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0725513612470533">Bauman (2000)</xref> put it, was made by Stoffel Botha in 1986, then South African Minister of Home Affairs. He was speaking to an amendment to the very Population Registration Act that would, it was claimed, ‘de-racialize’ the identity documents issued to all South Africans. He said: ‘This new identity document which has been debated here is merely an instrument for identifying a person. It says <italic>who he is, and not what he is</italic>’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0725513612470533">Girvin 1987</xref>: 5, emphasis added).</p>
<p>Other cases can be cited where fixed racialized and, hence, cultural identities inform the otherwise praiseworthy celebration of ‘cultural diversity’ on Heritage Day every year. Race classification by teaching staff informs their expectations of performance of cultural distinctions and the content thereof. ‘Indian’ South Africans shall be ‘Indian’ in terms of dress, religion and food, and so on. Social life is always more complex than what surveys and classifications can allow. With the abolition of all directly discriminatory laws, at least as far as race goes, the South African social world has expanded enormously. The uncritical maintenance of group belongings and boundaries under such circumstances denies that changing world. Nor is the potential and actual damage of classifying such young people into categories that do not make any sense of their own or their families’ lives, or that start the process of fixing race as an identity, confronted.</p>
<p>The second illustration is provided through a study executed at the University of KwaZulu-Natal on sites of classification within the university (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0725513612470533">Ruggunan and Maré 2012</xref>). In this case the original research had explored the ‘who’ and the ‘how’ (including ‘difficulties’ that arise and by implication standards employed) of race classification at this university, one of the top five of such institutions in the country. The presentation of the data also asked ‘why classify?’, and questioned the effects on classifier and classified. The interviews were conducted with human resource staff, those in services where decisions have to be made on the allocation of resources (such as bursaries to students), with staff who manage the data created through forms, and various other key informants amongst staff. Classification is usually the task of those lower on the employment ladder. The ‘how’ showed up the problematic issues, even for those embedded in South Africa as a previous and still thoroughly racialized society. For example, while much was made of self-classification by, for example, students, the classifiers would not see the irony of calling some such answers ‘misclassification’, and then to reject what was entered on a form. The staff who managed data would similarly make adjustments to categories selected by those required to complete forms. In some cases appearance and surnames added to the confusion of claims to identity. The ‘why’ of these processes was fairly simple: because ‘of the acknowledged need for redress of apartheid generated inequalities both in the labour market and in access to opportunities and resources (such as higher education)’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0725513612470533">Ruggunan and Maré 2012</xref>: 49). It was admitted by some interviewees that there could well be alternative ways of achieving the same goals, for example socio-economic indicators, or languages spoken, or whether any previous generation had enjoyed access to tertiary education (for more on this growing debate see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0725513612470533">Alexander 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0725513612470533">Habib and Bentley 2008</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0725513612470533">De Vos 2012</xref>). The effect on the classifiers varied. Some indicated no critical reflection nor discomfort in making life-affecting decisions on the basis of scientifically discredited and apartheid created notions of the existence of race and categories. Others were aware of the problematic nature of what they were required to undertake, and felt compromised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0725513612470533">Ruggunan and Maré 2012</xref>: 65).</p>
<p>A third illustration is census-taking during colonial and post-1910 South Africa, and includes the continued utilization of the same four-race approach developed under apartheid and in the post-1994 period. I have discussed this form of race classification in more detail elsewhere in connection with the issue of political minorities and majorities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0725513612470533">Maré 2011b</xref>), and Affirmative Action policies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0725513612470533">Maré 2011a</xref>). The National Party’s Population Registration Act, as noted above, was the basis of the identification documents that recorded the race and ethnic grouping of all citizens, literally from birth to death (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0725513612470533">Giliomee 2003</xref>: 503).</p>
<p>The classifications were confirmed or allocated during the 1951 census and became entered in identification documents, the hated and resisted means through which policing of race and its (intended and unintended) consequences took place. Census processes, apparently recording what they find, towards ends proper to the functioning of all states, in effect creating a world in the image planned by those in power (as it has been in many countries other than South Africa as well) (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0725513612470533">Nobles 2000</xref>). In South Africa it recorded the constructed <italic>facts</italic> of racial division, and the <italic>fact</italic> of language groups – the latter the basis of ‘homeland’ development for ‘Bantu [ethnic] <italic>nations</italic>’ rather than for the ‘Bantu <italic>race</italic>’. Thereby classification simultaneously turned a large majority into minorities. The Group Areas Act came into effect in the same year, 1950, and ensured that all ‘population groups’, and not just African South Africans, would be spatially and socially separated (for the consequences of the spatial dimension of apartheid policy; see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0725513612470533">Platzky and Walker 1985</xref>).</p>
<p>That was apartheid, founded on a census and with future censuses measuring the success or failure of division. Censuses continued post-1994, now towards creating data that was argued to be essential to redress – corrective action to attend, in the most efficient way, to the legacies of apartheid (for overviews of census-taking in South Africa see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0725513612470533">Christopher 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0725513612470533">2009</xref>).</p>
<p>It is little wonder that there should be confusion and morally problematic decisions to be made during the processes and at the various sites of race classification, and the census process reflects them as well. In the first case presented above, the teachers, innocent of any training, probably never expected to be confronted with this task in a democratic, post-apartheid country, and so they called on a higher authority—the ‘department’ – to solve the problem. In the second, taking place in an institution of higher learning, there is conflict between what is seen as a job description, demanded by requirements of bureaucratic nature towards admirable ends; on the other hand, the classifiers are located in a place where critical thinking is supposedly valued, the application of which raises moral and ethical concerns about a task which is presented and mostly perceived as another job requirement. In the case of the census-takers, the process is seen as a requirement towards ‘social-scientific ends’, gathering demographic data essential to state-demanded goals, towards the effective implementation of redistributive demands. ‘Race’ is simply (one of) the means and of the categories being explored; and conflict, when it exists, is between ‘self-definition’ and allocation, such as the race allocated to the ‘born-free’ category, as those too young to have been previously classified by apartheid agents is often referred. In the case of babies born after 1994, in the post-apartheid South Africa, there is no way of identifying ‘race’ other than to find refuge in apartheid itself, and deliberately to use that despised racial allocation again. Christopher, in one of his studies of census-taking in South Africa across the years, notes that in 2004<disp-quote>
<p>the census enumerators were advised that a population group was: ‘A group with common characteristics (in terms of descent and history), particularly in relation to how they were (<italic>or would have been</italic>) classified before the 1994 elections’ […]. In this manner those born since 1994 were brought within the ambit of apartheid race classification! (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0725513612470533">Christopher 2009</xref>: 107, emphasis added).</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Legislation gave effect to the particular route chosen towards redressing the apartheid past – it would be race-based. The Constitution disallowed discrimination in any form, except if it was deemed to be ‘fair discrimination’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0725513612470533">RSA 1996</xref>). Fairness would come from the intention, namely, to achieve an equal society. Race (and gender and disability) would be the basis for the fair discrimination. Equality would, in the first instance, be measured in terms of race representation. So, even in the case of the continuation of the capitalist system, often under assault and seen as abhorrent as racism in the struggle and mobilization against apartheid, equality in race-group numbers is the goal through the Broad-based Black Economic Empowerment Act (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0725513612470533">RSA 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>However, the legislation does not define ‘race’. Stone and Erasmus in their study asked, firstly, what legislation in post-1994 South Africa ‘depends on the acceptance of race categories’. They concluded that ‘legislators in democratic South Africa have avoided the pitfalls of defining race’, despite a number of laws that accepted race categories, with the consequence that such legislation ‘continues with a reliance on the common sense of the existence of racial groups, with the buck of classification and implementation being passed to lower level bureaucrats’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0725513612470533">2012</xref>: 138). Many people become bureaucrats through the ubiquitous requirement for classification, in the most unexpected places, as shown above.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0725513612470533">
<title>What then?</title>
<p>Pierre de Vos, a Professor in Constitutional Law at the University of Cape Town, introduces questions about the apparent approval of the Constitutional Court for race-based corrective measures, at least of such measures as the only way of achieving the goals stated. He argues ‘that the Court has not explicitly endorsed the notion of race as something essential and fixed’ (2012: 160). He continues: ‘Neither has it endorsed the notion that race-based remedial measures will remain permissible or required indefinitely’ (2012: 160). The jurisprudence of the Court, de Vos writes, shows ‘that constitutionally valid remedial measures aimed at addressing the effects of past racial discrimination need not always focus on the category of race’. The jurisprudence ‘leaves the door open for future contestation of race-based remedial measures’ (2012: 161).</p>
<p>As noted earlier, those committed to attending, with urgency, the ‘legacies of apartheid’ and not confusing them with the potential legacies of what is being done now; those who also note the dangers of thinking that race classification and race mobilization can be controlled or will not arise are increasingly basing arguments on alternative ways of approaching the same concerns. Denying the dangers of creating fixed categories goes against ongoing evidence in contemporary South Africa – violence against foreigners, violence against women, violence against ethnic groups, race-based violence.</p>
<p>The Constitution is a document, but it does indicate certain values essential to imagining and acting towards another type of society: anti-discrimination, dignity, equality, non-racialism, a democratic order. But, as argued in this article, the manner in which the race-based past has not been challenged in its foundational notions of ‘us’ and ‘them’, the manner in which gross inequality has continued and is being flaunted, and, what is more, the manner in which race thinking permeates so much of life, creates obstacles that cannot be overcome without change at the level of government and state. Here I have argued that there are too many who benefit in ways that increase inequality, opening the way for massive corruption even in the most amoral instances, so that race as a category of continued classification in post-1994 South Africa will not be easily discarded.</p>

<p>‘Transformation’ is commonly accepted, in nearly all situations where policy enters practice, social change towards the numerically correct – in terms of a racialized population count – presence of the four races in South Africa. Other measures, less frequently employed, are ‘disabled’ and ‘women’. The Employment Equity Act (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0725513612470533">RSA 1998</xref>) gives legal clout to the policy.</p>

<p>Black Economic Empowerment (implemented through the Broad-based Black Empowerment Act (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0725513612470533">RSA 2003</xref>) refers to policies that claim to ‘de-racialize’ the economy. Officially it is stated that the ‘fundamental objective of the Act is to advance economic transformation and enhance the economic participation of black people in the South African economy’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0725513612470533">DTI 2012</xref>). Basically it refers to policy initiatives that increase the number of capitalists – directly through individual owners, or changes in senior management, and indirectly through shareholding (such as in the case of trade union or ‘community’ investment bodies). The policy has been heavily criticized, from outside for creating a very wealthy group of politically-connected individuals and increasing inequality in an already unequal society; and from inside as not moving ahead fast enough. In the former case the state has responded with an extension into Broad-based Black Economic Empowerment – which adds further policy that should extend the number of beneficiaries as well as the forms of empowerment and rewards to companies for compliance.</p>

<p>Affirmative Action, drawing heavily on previous examples, such as in the US and Malaysia, is enabled by the ‘fair discrimination’ clause in the Constitution, as such discrimination enables ‘transformation’ (see note 2) in the workplace towards ‘racial equality’ in contrast to ‘discrimination’, otherwise defined as maintaining or creating inequality. It again starts off from the premise that the country’s racial demographics have to be reflected in all sites of employment. One contentious issue at present is whether national or provincial race demographics should apply in decisions about appointments or promotions.</p>
