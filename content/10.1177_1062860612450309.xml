<abstract>
<p>Although kidney transplant recipients at the authors’ institution had a short length of stay (LOS), delayed discharges and early readmissions were common; medication use and safety were at the core of these issues. A multidisciplinary quality improvement initiative was developed that targeted eliminating these issues. The team developed key initiatives including improved medication reconciliation, development of a diabetes management service, and improved discharge medication dispensing, delivery, education, and scrutiny. Follow-up analysis demonstrated reduced medication discrepancies by &gt;2 per patient and obtaining 100% adherence with reconciliation. Pharmacists reviewed discharge medications, reaching 100% by study end, leading to a 40% reduction in medication safety issues. LOS remained short, and delayed discharges were reduced by 14%; 7-day readmission rates decreased by 50%. Acute rejection and infection rates also significantly decreased. In conclusion, a multidisciplinary quality improvement initiative can improve medication safety in kidney transplant patients, which can lead to improved clinical outcomes.</p>

<body>
<p>Kidney transplantation has been established as a life-extending intervention that can have profound effects on end-stage renal disease patients’ quality and length of life. Multiple studies also have demonstrated that long-term health care costs are much lower for kidney transplant recipients compared with those who remain on dialysis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1062860612450309">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1062860612450309"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1062860612450309"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1062860612450309">4</xref></sup> Medicare mandates for transplant referrals have resulted in increasing numbers of patients being listed for a kidney transplant, but a limited donor pool has resulted in longer waiting times on dialysis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1062860612450309">5</xref></sup> The greatest increase in the waiting list has been in the older age group and among persons with diabetes. Furthermore, this has forced transplant programs to consider suboptimal donors such as expanded criteria donors and donors after cardiac death. During the same period, newer immunosuppressive drugs and induction therapies have evolved<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1062860612450309">6</xref></sup>; although these result in lower rejection rates, they are associated with higher costs, difficult logistics (eg, intravenous therapy), and a higher incidence of new-onset diabetes. A recent study has demonstrated that using more marginal donors has caused the cost of providing standard postoperative care for these patients to become prohibitive.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1062860612450309">7</xref></sup> These challenges of clinical practice in an environment of limited resources require transplant programs to constantly review their quality improvement process and metrics to ensure efficiency, patient safety, and financial stability. This study describes the development, implementation, and outcomes associated with using a formalized, long-term, patient-centered interdisciplinary process improvement initiative.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section2-1062860612450309">
<title>Study Design</title>
<p>This was an observational study of a formalized long-term quality improvement initiative designed to improve the efficiency and outcomes of care of kidney transplant recipients. Clinical outcome measurements included 1-year patient and graft survival rates, acute rejection rates, overall infection rates, and cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection rates. Additional surrogate markers of quality of care included initial hospital length of stay (LOS), readmission rates, and specific markers related to key elements that were implemented as part of this initiative (ie, medication reconciliation completion rate and quality, medication errors, adverse drug reactions).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1062860612450309">
<title>Patients</title>
<p>All adult kidney transplant recipients transplanted between June 2006 and July 2009 were included in this analysis. Patients younger than 18 years of age and recipients of multiorgan transplants were excluded. No patients were excluded from this analysis because of being lost to follow-up.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1062860612450309">
<title>Immunosuppressive and Anti-infective Prophylactic Regimens</title>
<p>All patients received triple immunosuppressive regimens consisting of tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and corticosteroids. All patients were started on a standard corticosteroid taper post transplant, with a goal of 5 mg of oral prednisone daily by 3 months post transplant. Induction therapy selection was based on protocol guidelines and transplant risk factors, such that patients who were retransplanted, had a panel reactive antibody &gt;20%, or had a cold ischemic time of &gt;24 hours received thymoglobulin at a dose of 1.5 mg/kg, given daily for 5 total doses; other patients received IL2RA induction (basiliximab 20 mg given intraoperatively and on postoperative day 4 or daclizumab 1 mg/kg given intraoperatively and on postoperative day 7). Target 12-hour whole blood trough concentrations for tacrolimus were as follows: weeks 1 to 12, 8-12 ng/mL; months 3 to 12, 6-10 ng/mL; longer than 1 year, &gt;5 ng/mL or as clinically indicated. During thymoglobulin induction, doses of calcineurin inhibitors were minimized but returned to full dose before discontinuation of the induction regimen. All patients received mycophenolate mofetil doses of 1 g by mouth, 2 times per day. All patients received prophylaxis against <italic>Pneumocystis jiroveci</italic> pneumonia with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for 90 days and against oropharyngeal candidiasis with nystatin oral suspension for 30 days. Patients received anti-CMV prophylaxis with valganciclovir for 90 days; a minority of low-risk patients received acyclovir 400 mg by mouth, 2 times per day for 90 days, with CMV polymerase chain reaction preemptive monitoring biweekly for 12 weeks, then monthly for 2 months.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1062860612450309">
<title>Definitions</title>
<p>Acute rejection was defined as biopsy proven and treated acute rejection. Borderline rejections were included in the analysis if they were treated as an acute rejection episode. CMV infection was defined as a CMV polymerase chain reaction showing more than 2000 copies/mL with no signs or symptoms of CMV syndrome or CMV disease. Infections were defined as any diagnosed and treated infection, including bacterial, fungal, or opportunistic. Mild self-limiting viral infections of the respiratory or GI tract were not included. Both inpatient and outpatient treated infections were documented and included urinary tract infections, respiratory tract infections, bloodstream infections, skin and soft tissue infections, and GI infections. LOS was calculated from day of admission to day of discharge with stay past midnight counting as a hospital day. Readmissions to the hospital were counted if they occurred in the specified posttransplant time period and resulted in a LOS of at least 1 day; readmissions to other facilities were not captured.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1062860612450309">
<title>Data Analysis and Statistics</title>
<p>Data were captured in an observational manner before, during, and after the initiation of this quality improvement initiative. Six months of baseline data were reviewed to determine opportunities in the quality and efficiency of care that was provided. During the quality improvement process, data were reviewed at regularly scheduled quality meetings to determine progress and future quality initiatives. Unless otherwise specified, all outcomes are from 1 year post transplant. Collected data variables included patient demographics, transplant characteristics, patient and graft survival, acute rejections, infections (already described), readmissions, and medication errors (related to readmissions or delayed discharges). Descriptive statistics were used to analyze data for nominal and continuous variables. Trends were established using means or percentages, with trend lines computed by reviewing these means over the surrounding 6 months of data to that mean.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1062860612450309">
<title>Quality Improvement Initiatives</title>
<p>The team was championed by the chief of transplant surgery and the transplant administer. The team comprised multiple personnel from different disciplines, including physicians, nurses, pharmacists, social workers, and financial coordinators. An interdisciplinary group of health care providers involved in the care of transplant patients, including surgeons, physician extenders, a transplant pharmacist, nurse coordinators, and transplant floor and clinic nurses, were invited to regular meetings. Input was gained from others such as general dispensing pharmacy and financial coordinators on an ad hoc basis. The improvement process followed an adaptation of the Lean Six Sigma Model; the entire discharge process was mapped, highlighting key factors perceived as concerns with regard to safety and/or efficiency. Each issue brought up in committee was affirmed or negated with data, and an appropriate action plan was initiated. When needed, additional data were collected retrospectively and analyzed (eg, medical issues resulting in readmission). Each initiative was implemented as a separate project spearheaded by different personnel within the multidisciplinary team but within the context of this overarching quality improvement project and under the auspices of this multidisciplinary group. These initiatives were rolled out over the course of 18 months and are described in what follows.</p>
<sec id="section8-1062860612450309">
<title>Review and revise transplant order sets, protocols, and clinical pathways</title>
<p>Transplant order sets, protocols, and clinical pathways were reviewed, revised, and implemented by the entire health care team. Revisions incorporated the most up-to-date evidence-based approaches, including analysis of internal data related to immunosuppression and anti-infective prophylaxis. For example, noted discharge delays were related to a lack of medical resident knowledge about when to remove the Foley bladder catheter, consult endocrinology or nephrology for intense disease state management, or order discharge medication. The team revised order sets and pathways to make consults and Foley removal automatic on postoperative day 3 unless otherwise specified by the operating surgeon. Also, the inpatient transplant coordinator and pharmacist were responsible for ordering and procuring discharge medications.</p>
<p>Uncontrolled blood pressure (BP) also was recognized as a variable contributing to discharge delays. Most renal transplant patients are on an antihypertensive or have a history of hypertension at the time of their transplant admission; posttransplant delayed graft function and large volume shifts along with high doses of corticosteroids and calcineurin inhibitors can lead to drastic variations in BP. The transplant program, led by the clinical pharmacists, revised the hypertension protocol. Early postoperative reinstitution of BP medications known to cause rebound hypertension was essential. Pharmacy residents, under the direction of their preceptors, educated surgical residents and midlevel practitioners about which medications to restart and when to do so. The majority of interventions were made on early morning work rounds to facilitate administration early in the day for afternoon discharge. After update and approval by the group, these order sets, protocols, and clinical pathways were placed on the health care systems intranet, which allowed easy access to these resources by all members of the care team, ensuring that key individuals would have the correct documents and data needed to make critical decisions at the patient’s bedside.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1062860612450309">
<title>Early and comprehensive outpatient follow-up care</title>
<p>A number of early readmissions resulted from lack of patient and caregiver medication education. Improved early and comprehensive outpatient follow-up was implemented to supplement inpatient medication education. This was achieved by a number of important interventions. First, all patients were discharged to a local hotel, where a trained transplant nurse would visit the patient twice daily. This nurse provided one-on-one care and reinforced the medication education that was initiated in the hospital. This was an essential step because the use of opioids and high-dose corticosteroids in conjunction with sleep deprivation significantly impair the cognitive abilities of patients during the initial education process. The home health nurse also checks vital signs and assesses symptoms. This information is relayed back to the transplant team in a daily report; patients at high risk for noncompliance, those who demonstrate suboptimal understanding, or patients in need of more rigorous antihypertensive or glucose management are then quickly identified for immediate intervention and reinforcement in the clinic.</p>
<p>Early follow-up care also extends to the ambulatory clinic. All transplant patients return to the transplant clinic the day after discharge. During this visit, focused patient and caregiver education is continued. Midlevel practitioners, clinical pharmacists, nurse coordinators, social workers, and when relevant, diabetes educators and nutritionists all meet with the patient. The transplant team is able to reinforce education, and pharmacists can engage in a more thorough discussion of medications. A number of medication errors have been identified and rectified during this process before these errors have a chance to harm the patient and cause readmission.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1062860612450309">
<title>Improved dispensing and delivery of medications</title>
<p>Kidney transplant patients stay in the hospital for approximately 3 days at the authors’ center, and an average of 8 to 10 new medications are initiated. The mean cost of discharge kidney transplant medications is ~$6000/month (based on 2009 average wholesale prices). Many third-party payers require additional paperwork and prior authorization before dispensing, which can lead to additional delays in education and discharges.</p>
<p>To optimize the process, the inpatient transplant nurse coordinator would write the prescriptions and send them to the outpatient pharmacy; based on the protocols developed, the required prescriptions could be anticipated and ordered immediately. This allowed time to select alternative agents and/or to make regimen modifications, if needed, based on the patient’s financial resources.</p>
<p>A single pharmacist was identified to fill these prescriptions to allow optimal communication between the inpatient transplant team and the outpatient pharmacy. After medications are filled, they are delivered to a convenient location for patients’ caregivers to pick up, usually by postoperative day 1 to allow for inpatient teaching.</p>
<p>In the event that a necessary but expensive medication, such as valganciclovir, is not covered by insurance, 3 designated individuals have the background and training to help patients apply for medication assistance programs. This allows for rapid procurement of necessary medications.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1062860612450309">
<title>Diabetes management service</title>
<p>New-onset diabetes and uncontrolled blood sugar in those with existing diabetes is common secondary to the high doses of corticosteroids and use of tacrolimus in the early posttransplant period. Many patients are initiated on insulin immediately following transplant and are required to adhere to strict glucose monitoring as an outpatient. This, in conjunction with a short hospital stay, resulted in a high rate of hospital readmissions post transplant. The transplant team realized that trained diabetes educators and endocrinologists were necessary to ensure optimal glucose control and patient safety. A new and unique consult service—the diabetes management team—was created to manage the inpatient and acute outpatient treatment of diabetes. The service is run by midlevel practitioners and endocrinologists who are responsible for all care related to diabetes, including discharge education and ensuring receipt of all home diabetes supplies and medicines. Once discharged, follow-up with the diabetes management service is arranged in the transplant clinic during the first visit with the transplant team, allowing for early intervention and continued education on discharge.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1062860612450309">
<title>Revise discharge medication education process</title>
<p>With the short LOS and substantial changes in the patient’s medication regimens, comprehensive medication education is essential to prevent delayed discharges and early readmissions.</p>
<p>A new medication education process was developed that uses cards, complete with pictures of the dosage form, doses, and dosing schedule. Using the patient’s discharge prescription bottles, which were obtained early post transplant, and under direct supervision, the discharge nurse has the patients prepare their medications using the medication cards. Patients and caregivers can practice the new regimen with the actual bottles they will use once discharged. The nurse and transplant team can assess the patient’s and caregiver’s ability to follow this new medication regimen. Finally, before the patient leaves the hospital, a review of all medications is completed by the transplant pharmacist to ensure the accuracy of the final discharge medication orders.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Although kidney transplantation has been performed for more than 4 decades with excellent patient and graft survival, there have been changes in the environment that directly affect clinical practice. These include an increasingly older pool of recipients with diabetes who spend a longer time on dialysis and often receive less-than-optimal (expanded criteria donor) kidneys.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1062860612450309">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1062860612450309"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1062860612450309">8</xref></sup> Concomitantly, newer immunosuppressive medications have lowered acute rejection rates but led to an increased incidence of new-onset diabetes after transplant, higher cost, and difficult logistics of administering multiple doses of intravenous induction agents.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1062860612450309">6</xref></sup> These changes require transplant programs to assess patient safety, efficiency of care, and the financial viability of the program on a continuous basis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1062860612450309">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1062860612450309">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1062860612450309"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1062860612450309"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1062860612450309"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1062860612450309">12</xref></sup> This study demonstrated that a multidisciplinary continuous quality improvement initiative focusing on improving the root causes of delayed discharges and early readmissions can produce sustained augmentation in clinical outcomes for kidney transplant recipients. Although similar initiatives have been applied successfully in other areas of medicine, there are limited data about such an application in a large cohort of kidney transplant patients with long-term follow-up.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1062860612450309">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1062860612450309">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1062860612450309"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1062860612450309">12</xref></sup> There are very few patient populations that can match the medical complexity of a combination of diabetes, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia with the addition of a recent unplanned major surgery and immunosuppressive medications. It is particularly challenging in a patient population with low health literacy and, not infrequently, low patient and family involvement.</p>
<p>This continuous quality improvement project was innovative in a number of ways. First, the sheer scope of this task was large and involved health care professionals across a wide variety of disciplines. Their ability to work in a collaborative and patient-centric fashion was a key feature of this project and undoubtedly was one of the most important factors for its success. Additionally, because of the complexity of this project, rollout occurred over the course of nearly 2 years, and therefore, we needed a large amount of follow-up data to determine the true outcomes of this project. Another innovative aspect of this study was the demonstration that a close review of discharge medication regimens by clinical pharmacists could be directly correlated to a decreased medication discrepancy rate and a notable decrease in medication errors and ADEs; the currently available literature demonstrating similar results involves smaller numbers of patients with shorter follow-up and does not include kidney transplant recipients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1062860612450309">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1062860612450309"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1062860612450309"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1062860612450309"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1062860612450309"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1062860612450309">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>We feel that most, if not all, of these initiatives have applicability toward most patient populations in a variety of care entities. Medication use and safety are important aspects of providing care across all health care systems. Studies have demonstrated that medication errors are common and a significant cause of morbidity for both inpatient and ambulatory patients. The initiatives described here, which in a general sense include standardizing care through the use of clinical pathways and protocols, improving patient medication education, involving other disciplines to autonomously manage key comorbidities, and providing early follow-up care after discharge, are all applicable to a large share of patient types. For example, we have implemented the medication delivery and education process within the pediatric hospital. Additionally, we have implemented a medication review and close follow-up program by pharmacists for the adult heart failure population in an effort to reduce readmissions into the hospital for congestive heart failure exacerbations. All hospital systems that care for Medicare patients are required to participate in Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services quality metrics, and heart failure readmissions are a recent focus of this governmental quality program; this demonstrates how a program, such as the one described here, can be applied across the health care system to improve medication use and safety.</p>
<p>For transplant-specific applicability, we also have implemented several of the interventions examined here in our other solid organ recipients to improve patient safety and streamline the discharge process. Medication regimens are routinely altered dramatically during the hospitalization, and accurate, high-quality medication reconciliation is crucial to prevent medication errors and ADEs. Diabetes management during hospitalization and transition to the ambulatory setting is difficult because of changes in medication and disease state management that can dramatically influence doses of antiglycemic medications needed to control serum glucose.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1062860612450309">19</xref></sup> Detailed pharmacist review of medication regimens at the time of discharge should be universal for all hospitalized patients; ideally, a review conducted by a pharmacist during the follow-up clinic visit would ensure that patients understand discharge medication changes.</p>
<p>Kidney transplantation is the preferred treatment for qualifying patients with end-stage renal disease, but the complexities associated with a dramatic shift in the medication regimen and organ function lead to a challenging patient population during the perioperative period. In addition, short hospital stays with rapid patient turnover have the potential to result in serious medication errors at the time of discharge. It is important that transplant programs focus on safety and outcome issues beyond the current measurements of patient and graft survival. The successes of these initiatives require the full, unconditional involvement of all disciplines involved in the care of transplant patients.</p>
