<p>There could have been no better way to honour someone of Yogendra Singh’s stature than to present this seminal collection of articles, highlighting and exploring every aspect of globalization and its multidimensional impact on the global social, political and economic milieu. Professor Yogendra Singh has nurtured over three generations of scholars across the disciplines, who now serve different domains of the academic world today. This <italic>Festschrift</italic> is an appropriate intervention to advance the debate on the much fascinating subject of the era which for over the decades has engaged the intellectual community from every discipline in every corner of the globe. This book examines different features of modernization and globalization and their divergent outcomes in different parts of the world, both the developed and non-developed world. It tells that context plays a prominent role in the level of embrace of globalization and its rejection.</p>
<p>Globalization is a captivating term these days. It was a day dreamer delight to think of a global village, but gradually this dream and the fascination has begun to die down. This collection lays out a comprehensive new framework for the study of the economic and sociological impact, and explores the proposition that the East has negated the past proposition about Western dominance through globalization. The central beauty of the book lies in its comprehensiveness, its innovative ideas, its theoretical grounding and conceptual lucidity. It raises many question about the meaning of globalization for the poor, oppressed and marginalized.</p>
<p>Parmjit S Judge devotes a chapter to the study of sociology in the context of globalization. Globalization seems to be changing the institutional context of the discipline and acting as a threat to the discipline, including regional disparity, linguistic disparity and the gap between the centre and the periphery. Globalization has changed the research and teaching of sociology in a major way, making irrelevant the division between the elite and regional sociologist (p. 72). Sociology as a discipline is under threat, economic entrepreneurs are making inroads into higher education, and sociology is declining and seems to be losing its relevance as a discipline.</p>
<p>Other disciplines too will have to redesign themselves in order to adapt to or preserve their relevance in the face of globalization.</p>
<p>The relation between globalization and modernization is captured in a meticulous article by Devorah Kalekin-Fishman, who defines four major components of modernity. For her, modernity is nothing but an emancipating, democratizing, expansive and renovating project (p. 40). Others discuss this in terms of the wide range of reactions to globalization around the world. For instance, the Arab world has shown more cultural reaction, while in other parts, globalization has remained almost confined to the economic sphere. Unlike the open arms welcome to modernization, globalization has met with turbulent reception in some countries. This disparity in reception has always remained hostage to its historical, social, economic and political context.</p>
<p>Though there is a lack of scholarship on the impact and outcome of globalization on Indian rural society, this collection has devoted few chapters to study the Indian case. Indian society has responded in a way that has reflected Indian history and socialist patterns of socioeconomic development. Globalization has both winners and losers; winners are too distant and losers seems to be more proximate. The real impact of globalization can be gauged inside the rural parts of India which is passing through rapid social transformation in the wake of globalization. One can capture this impact by noticing the pace, level and intensity of the changes. Here Anand Kumar finds remedy in the togetherness of Gandhian philosophy. According to Kumar, Gandhi presents an alternative to the hedonistic modern world of the free market (p. 103).</p>
<p>Another study in this collection interrogates and examines the context of global economic integration for national economy in the context of interdependence and competition between the economies in the global market. The impact of globalization on rural areas is too visible to hide, and this is highlighted by Ishwar Modi, editor of the volume, in his article ‘Globalization, marginalization and social transformation: The context of Indian rural society’. The rural areas are witnessing multifaceted impacts, like other areas. Globalization has to be understood in the context of social development, and social development has to be inclusive. No sociology can advance without Dalits and Adivasis. Social development and marginalization are related to social transformation, and there can be no desired social transformation without the development of marginalized and excluded sections of the people.</p>
<p>One contributor cites the example of Germany and Japan, relatively more recent modernizing countries that evolved over decades to serve as models for other developed and developing countries. However, late modernization in Germany and Japan was associated with a bureaucratic and military state, and thus involved dynamics unlike those of past modernization since the fifteenth century, where private players were at the forefront.</p>
<p>This book is equally useful for those who wish to understand the philosophy of linkage between globalization and technology. Contributors argue that globalization has destroyed the feudal-like structure of the information system. They also argue that indigenous sociology and glocalization will have a persistent presence in this era. Part of this is traceable to technological globalization, which is reducing the distance between centre and periphery, and gradually the periphery itself is transforming into centre entities in a way that is unlikely to be reversed.</p>
<p>In addition, a major part of this book is dedicated to the subject of culture in the context of globalization. Initiating the debate on the relation between cultural changes and globalization, Yogesh Atal argues that the orientation to change has itself changed, so that now the social scientists start discussing change from the present to the future instead of from past to the present. While there may be worries that technological and economic progress would destroy the diversity of culture or depreciate it, too much concern over cultural retreat might force culture itself to go into a shell. In any case, the fact is that the globe is characterized by cultural heterogeneity, because the dynamics of give and take now occur at an unprecedented pace. On the other hand, fears of cultural imposition may cause a reassertion of indigeneity. But overall, there is still no basis to the claim that global free market capitalism has triumphed or that in such a world order one is left with no choice but Fukuyama’s ‘end of history’. Rather, there is great scope for multiculturalism and great resistance to homogenizing culture, people and religion. In addition, the very meaning of culture is itself changing. Today culture is no longer apolitical and innocent.</p>
<p>This book is a must-read due to its comprehensive scope, conceptual clarity and theoretical grounding. Ideas explored include the interchangeable worlds of globalization, modernization and westernization; responses to globalization; the role of technology; how academic culture is affected; regional variations; the rural–urban gap; and the elite–periphery gap. The book should be consulted for the wide range of issues raised and discussed so articulately.</p>
