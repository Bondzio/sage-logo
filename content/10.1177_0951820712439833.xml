<p>In this article the attempts made by Fergus Millar to undermine the authors' thesis concerning the ‘split diaspora’ are discarded altogether. Millar, who has elsewhere criticized the split diaspora thesis, has, the authors argue, contributed nothing that would change the view that Rabbinic lore in its different genres was not created by and did not exist in the Greek- and Latin-speaking Jewish Diaspora. On the contrary, he is found to be in agreement with the authors concerning the divide of the Jewish Diaspora in the first centuries of the Common Era into an eastern Hebrew/Aramaic and a Greek and Latin western one (with a third section in between that was more of a mixture of the two).</p>

<p>In 2011 Fergus Millar published an interesting article entitled ‘A Rural Jewish Community in Late Roman Mesopotamia, and the Question of a “Split” Jewish Diaspora’ (<italic>JSJ</italic> 42, pp. 351–74). Apropos to this important theme, Millar launched a mini-attack on our thesis concerning the ‘split Diaspora’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0951820712439833">1</xref></sup> We would like to show here that at the end of the day Millar actually agrees with our thesis and that his own arguments against one aspect of it can be disproved. In order for readers to understand the debate better, let us remind them of what our main thesis has been:</p>
<p>The enormous Rabbinic corpus which emerged during the second to fifth centuries includes hundreds of rabbis from the eastern part of the Jewish Diaspora (the Land of Israel included). None, except for a few <italic>dubious</italic> ones in this corpus, emanate from the western Jewish Diaspora. Western Jews were not part of this cultural and religious development. Whereas the eastern rabbis left an enormous oral heritage (which was written down much later), the western Jews left almost nothing. This <italic>gap</italic> was a fact, defined by us and described in the above-mentioned studies (see n. 1, above). But we also made an attempt to explain why this gap (the so-called split Diaspora) occurred. We came to the conclusion that it was the result of a language divide, Greek and Latin in Western Jewry and Aramaic and Hebrew in the Eastern Jewish Diasporas. Against this latter divide Millar tries to adduce his own arguments, arguments that will be refuted in what follows.</p>
<p>First, on p. 364 Millar claims that when he reviewed the evidence from the western Diaspora, ‘the author [i.e. Millar himself] has drawn attention to scattered items of evidence which suggest that Hebrew, and in one striking instance Aramaic, was not wholly unknown even in the “Greek” Diaspora’. This is <italic>exactly</italic> what we have said in our studies. Most of the examples that Millar adduces from the west are well known and we have studied them carefully. We referred only to some <italic>examples</italic>, claiming the occasional Hebrew on gravestones and other artifacts was a symbolic use by Jews but does not indicate a broad knowledge of Hebrew or Aramaic in the west. It also does not signify any literary (Rabbinic) output by the Greek- and Latin-speaking Jews. The remnants of Hebrew and Aramaic found in the western Diaspora are extremely scarce for such a long period (second to seventh century) and, where they exist, they are quite poor in style. It seems that Millar did not care to examine this sort of Hebrew and Aramaic style, remnants of which were found in the west. Be that as it may, from Millar's article one might deduce that we have ignored this evidence altogether; however, a careful reader of the above-mentioned articles and German book will see that we have taken it into account in our discussions.</p>
<p>Second, Millar is not aware of the very clear <italic>distinction</italic> that we have drawn between three zones of Jewish life. The first of these was the ‘pure’ west. Here, we maintain, Jews knew Greek and Latin but little, if any, Hebrew; probably only a few people knew some Hebrew, which was mainly used for symbolic reasons (such as the Hebrew used on gravestones). The second zone was the eastern one, where Hebrew and Aramaic (alongside some Greek), were dominant among Jews. (We never stated that Greek did not exist in the east; on the contrary, we bring evidence that in certain places, the Land of Israel included, Greek was used. Thus p. 365 in Millar's article supports our view quite firmly!) In between these two zones, as clearly indicated in a graphic manner on the map in our German book (on pp. 104–105), there was a zone in which Jews spoke Greek and, as we have assumed, there might have been some limited Rabbinic influence (and perhaps some knowledge of Hebrew and Aramaic). We repeated this very point in several places in the articles and in the above-mentioned book.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0951820712439833">2</xref></sup> This distinction between the three zones is important for understanding our argument, yet Millar completely ignores it. Instead, he claims that ‘while a remarkable Aramaic marriage-contract from Antinoopolis in Egypt, written in 417 <sc>ce</sc>, shows that, there at least, there existed within the Jewish community the capacity to compose a legal document in the Aramaic of daily life, marked by numerous Greek loan words’ (pp. 364–65). This he brings as proof for the knowledge of Aramaic and Hebrew in the east. First of all, he ignores our discussion in the ‘small letters’ (pp. 106–46) of the German book where we point to much stronger evidence for Hebrew, Aramaic and Rabbinics in Egypt in late antiquity,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0951820712439833">3</xref></sup> and adduces the one single Ketubah as evidence for the knowledge of Aramaic in Egypt. Does Millar really think that this Ketubah, and other fragmentary evidence (that we have adduced) actually point to a knowledge of Hebrew and Aramaic in Jewish circles in Egypt? Does he really believe that these remnants of Hebrew and Aramaic enabled the Jews there to under-stand Rabbinic material, let alone participate in its creation? Surely not! At present in every orthodox Jewish wedding an Aramaic Ketubah is read out to the participants (and is then kept in the home of the married couple). Does this mean that everyone in the Jewish world today knows Aramaic? It does not, and neither does this mean that all or even a sizeable number of the participants are ‘Rabbinic’. Ketubah as a phenomenon should be included in what we have defined as general Jewish symbols that were common and unified in the two or three zones of the Jewish world in antiquity.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0951820712439833">4</xref></sup> The same can be said about the scarce findings from elsewhere in the western world that Millar mentions. When we studied the ‘split Diaspora’ we were of course aware of most of these findings (and others not mentioned by either Millar or ourselves), but never thought that they indicated a broad knowledge of Hebrew or knowledge of Rabbinic lore in the regions where they were found.</p>
<p>Third, Millar, without any attempt at a serious discussion, discards our view—in which we follow Shaye Cohen—that ‘rabbi’ was a common honorary title which was used as a manner of speech and as a means of honoring a person (i.e. it does not necessarily denote a ‘real’ rabbi; such honorific use can still be found in Judaism today). He states: ‘But late Roman Jewish inscriptions from Italy and Spain do [use the term “rabbi”], and it seems over-cautious to argue that these persons (like those described as “rabbi” on Jewish inscriptions from Palestine) should not be seen as “real” rabbis. Why not?’ (p. 365). Let us assume for a moment that Millar is right, and that ‘rabbi’ is a title denoting a ‘professional’ rabbi. If so, we would like to raise the following question: How is it that of the hundreds of rabbis who formed the Rabbinic corpus there are perhaps only a few dubious ones who came from the west? Were all these ‘real’ rabbis, if we accept Millar's view, <italic>mute?</italic> Why is there no remnant anywhere of what they said on matters of Halacha, Agada or other issues? Thus, unless evidence turns up otherwise, Millar's assumption should be rejected altogether. The fact that a patristic writer used the expression <italic>legis doctor</italic>, a detail we considered when we wrote the articles and again when we wrote the book (and decided not to mention it; Severus himself is mentioned in <italic>Zweierlei Diaspora</italic> on p. 143), is of no consequence in this connection: there is nothing to suggest that Severus refers to a real professional rabbi.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0951820712439833">5</xref></sup> Moreover, if <italic>legis doctor</italic> refers to a real rabbi and if this should be regarded as being in line with Millar's false assumption that all people called ‘rabbis’ on the gravestones were real rabbis, we would have expected the Church fathers to mention not one but many such individuals. Be that as it may, there is nothing left from the western Diaspora in terms of Rabbinic lore in its different genres, either in independent corpora or in the traditional Rabbinic one.</p>
<p>Fourth—and this is crucial—Millar complains that we have not drawn a very clear demarcation line between the eastern and western Jewish Diasporas. Among other observations, he says:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>…Edrei and Mendels, in their article of 2007…which first highlighted the problem of the “split” Jewish diaspora, do (p. 92) speak of an eastern diaspora extending “from Transjordan to Babylonia”—but then never return to the question of this intervening area. As it happens, however, this passing (and anachronistic) reference to “Transjordan”, which we could reasonably take to mean the province now called “Arabia” (see above) is potentially quite significant. (pp. 366–67)</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>If Millar would have read the long quotation we bring from Mishnah <italic>Yadayim</italic> 4.3 in our article and book (about Transjordan) he would not have used the expression ‘anachronistic’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0951820712439833">6</xref></sup> But this is not the main argument. If we understood Millar correctly (he is not always clear), he claims that we have not drawn a clear line of demarcation between the Diasporas. He probably had in mind a sort of Maginot line or some other political border. However, both the map in our German book and what we say in the articles and book show exactly the opposite. We refuse to propose a very clear borderline line since the gap was linguistic as well as conceptual, and such gaps never have very clear borders. As we repeatedly say in our above-mentioned studies, there were indeed ‘islands’ of Hebrew in the western part as well as the same for Greek in the eastern part. In the grey area in between there was perhaps more of a mixture but one language was always dominant, as for instance in Alexandria (Greek). From the eastern Diaspora, and only from there (this includes Mesopotamia, the subject of Millar's article, as well as the Land of Israel), Rabbinic lore emerged, whereas from the west there is no evidence for anything like that at all. The so-called new Judaism of the period emerged in the east without the participation of western Jewry.</p>
<p>In fact, Millar himself admits on p. 366 that he agrees with the basics of our thesis. He says:</p>
<disp-quote>
<p>It goes without saying that these scattered items of evidence for the use of Hebrew or Aramaic, and for the presence of religious teachers, among Jewish communities in the Greek-speaking, and eventually the Latin-speaking areas of the Empire, do not disprove the hypothesis of a fundamental linguistic split between the interconnected worlds of Palestine and Babylonia on the one hand, and the Mediterranean Diaspora on the other.</p>
</disp-quote>
<p>It is not clear to us why Millar finds it necessary to rehearse much of what we have said about the scattered evidence for the exceptions. In any case, following this statement, he refers to the Mishnah with quite a sweeping argument, to which we will react now.</p>
<p>Fifth, Millar quite understandably does not react to some of our main arguments for the split (this is not the main topic of his article). This is to be regretted. But we will now refer to one of the arguments he does mention in passing. He refers to the possibility that the Mishnah ‘once embodied in written form (whenever that was, which is of course a highly controversial question), might not have been of interest even in the Graeco-Roman Diaspora, and might not have found there scholars who could understand and expound it’ (p. 366). We should like to remind our readers that the question of orality that we have raised is not the main argument for our thesis. Even if this corpus was written down early on, it remains a fact that it had no influence whatsoever on the west and the Jews there did not contribute to it even one single piece of knowledge. However, the orality of the Rabbinic corpus, which has been proven very decisively by two great Talmudic scholars, Y. Sussmann and S. Naeh,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0951820712439833">7</xref></sup> <italic>helps</italic> to understand why the corpus did not migrate to the west. These two studies of Sussmann and Naeh, one should emphasize, were widely accepted by scholars and so far have not encountered any serious objection. To translate an oral corpus, and in particular such a difficult one, was unimaginable. Also, Millar and others did not turn their attention to the fact that the Hebrew Bible completely disappeared in the west as a common ‘document’ of the Jews, whereas in the eastern Diaspora it was very much in use since the rabbis constantly quote most of it (as it was available); in fact, the first complete Hebrew Bible was found in the east. The extensive use of the Bible by the rabbis may have brought about its physical disappearance also in the east—a process that happened to many documents of great importance.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0951820712439833">8</xref></sup> The Hebrew Bible may have been lost in the west early on because the Jews did not know any Hebrew, while the LXX and Vulgate became necessary substitutes.</p>
<p>In sum, we think that Millar quite agrees with the substance of our work, but has felt an urge to be critical of our thesis in some fashion. However, until new evidence emerges, we think that our thesis remains valid.</p>
