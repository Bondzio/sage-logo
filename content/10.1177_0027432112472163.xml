<p>Since early times, human beings have searched for spiritual experiences that provide connections to their hearts and souls. People sometimes find these connections through experiencing music—perhaps the last remaining ubiquitous spiritual experience in Western culture. And yet, material values rule our world, even in music education. Do we teach music in our schools in ways that empower students to conduct this search with integrity and judgment?</p>
<p>To illuminate the way music is presented in Western education, I borrow the Greek myths of Psyche, Hermes, and Orpheus. As the first story is told, Psyche was a mortal woman of extraordinary beauty, truth, and goodness who was married to Eros but was commanded not to look at his face. Overcome with curiosity, Psyche disobeyed, lost Eros, and was given four tasks in order to be reunited with him. These included sorting a room full of seeds, obtaining a golden fleece, and filling a glass from the waters of the River Styx. Finally she had to go to Hades to retrieve a beautiful box. In some versions, she opens this box and is again forced to wander. I see her still wandering through Western culture as a symbol of the loss of spiritual values and the qualities of the soul.</p>
<sec id="section1-0027432112472163">
<title>The Concept of the Soul</title>
<p>In ancient Greece, the soul was referred to as a combination of breath, spirit, and mind and was associated with the transformational symbol of the butterfly.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0027432112472163">1</xref></sup> Aristotle saw the soul as the entirety of an organism’s active functioning—the totality of its being. Olympian religion never spoke of the soul through dogmatic formulas, but rather as a vital force in everything—the collective soul of the world, known as <italic>anima mundi</italic>. Perhaps if we could rediscover the soul within contemporary society, our current anima mundi, the rediscovery would have significant implications for intercultural understanding and reconciliation.</p>
<p>The polytheism of the ancient Greeks allowed for a flexible view of the interaction of various divinities with human beings. This developed into the three-in-one view of God in monotheistic Christianity. Over time (as with other religions), dualisms such as soul/body developed within this belief system, often with connotations of good and bad. As seen in the writings of figures such as the twelfth-century abbess Hildegard von Bingen, music played a key role in spiritual and religious belief systems.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0027432112472163">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Eventually, religion in Europe lost much of its power. The arts became secularized and demoted to mere entertainment, reinforcing the body/mind dichotomy implicit in numerous branches of Christian thought. At the end of the nineteenth century, Friedrich Nietzsche declared God dead, and the anima mundi became a component of culture rather than of religion. Nietzsche saw theatre, particularly tragedy, as a way to integrate the separate elements of body and mind. He believed that theatre offered a transcendent quality to this integration—a quality that inspired dramatists, artists, and musicians.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0027432112472163">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>When the Greek concept of anima mundi became related to human motivation rather than to the spiritual realm, the unity within the Greek pantheon (personified in Psyche) of the Good (morality), the True (the authentic), and the Beautiful (the objective) was fractured. Music lost its ancient Greek function of fusing the Good, the True, and the Beautiful. Our music education curricula were focused on the Western classical tradition with its notions of being value-free (no longer concerned with the Good) and objective, though the prevailing concept of Beautiful was often culturally limited. Subjectivity became marginalized. Musicology developed as a discipline that concentrated on looking at works of art without reference to their emotional impact. The spiritual was therefore often dismissed as superstition. But, the musical experience in its totality has the capacity to explore mind and body, the personal and universal, the mysterious and the rational. The musical experience can be seen as the last remaining place for exploration of the self-actualized soul in Western society.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0027432112472163">4</xref></sup> The concept of self-actualization is familiar to educators as a component of psychologist Abraham Maslow’s hierarchy of human needs; Maslow included the peak experience as a precursor to self-actualization with its inclusion of characteristics once associated with the soul. These characteristics included an intense experience of the present, concentration, self-forgetfulness, a lessening of defenses and inhibitions, empowerment, trust, spontaneity, and a fusion of a person with the world. <sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0027432112472163">5</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0027432112472163">
<title>The Soul in Western Education</title>
<p>So what of Psyche have we lost? We need look no further than the Descartes statement, “I think, therefore I am.” Neuroscience professor Antonio Damasio describes this as an error, separating thinking from the body; he proposes thinking as a consequence of being, which is the essence of our humanity.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0027432112472163">6</xref></sup> Even so, this principle has governed the development of Western education.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0027432112472163">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>Guy Claxton, professor of learning sciences at the University of Winchester, identifies four characteristics that might define the restoration of the psyche to our educational experience. The first is an unusually strong sense of <italic>aliveness</italic> characterized by a heightened sense of vitality, clarity, and strength of perception. The second quality he calls <italic>belonging</italic>, or a sense of being at home in the world, which might be considered a restoration of anima mundi. Claxton writes that when these two characteristics are present, “attitudes of suspicion or competition are replaced with what appears to be an unforced inclination towards kindliness and care . . . compassion, love.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0027432112472163">8</xref></sup> This would challenge the place of competition in the world of music-making and hint at the restoration of the True (values) to music-making. Philosopher Nel Noddings similarly calls for an “ethic of care,” an attempt to restore notions of the Good into education and to counter a culture of competition.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0027432112472163">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>The third quality Claxton suggests as necessary to restore Psyche is an affinity with <italic>mystery</italic>, a state in which security in opinions and beliefs is replaced by an interest in the paradoxical nature of truth.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0027432112472163">10</xref></sup> When confronting mystery, creativity becomes as important as success with its sense of delight and heightened sense of trust and spontaneity. Fourth, Claxton identifies an enhanced <italic>peace of mind</italic>, or the shedding of mundane anxiety and confusion.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0027432112472163">11</xref></sup> The musical experience can transport us to this qualitatively different, fulfilling, and inherently meaningful mode of engagement.</p>

<sec id="section3-0027432112472163">
<title>Psychagogia</title>
<p>We can pursue this search further through the lens of the Greek figure Hermes, who, according to many stories, was the inventor of the lyre and the originator of <italic>psychagogia</italic> (literally, “the leading of the soul”), a process of developing human understanding and empathy. Psychagogia was often facilitated through reflection on Greek tragedy, and Plato associated it with good rhetoric wherein the speaker or actor uses words to facilitate understanding and empathy. In theatre, psychagogia was associated with change in the psyche of the spectator through a process of reflection.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0027432112472163">12</xref></sup> Theatre was part of the treatment at the sanctuary of Asclepius, where it was seen as expanding the mind through dreaming.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0027432112472163">13</xref></sup> Aristotle held that education was the art of leading people to a dialectical examination of the Good.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0027432112472163">14</xref></sup> The end of education was to enable this Good to come from within the person rather than from an external authority. Through experiences in the theatrical art, an educated person would have developed <italic>ethos</italic> and its component <italic>mythos</italic> with focus on the metaphysical, intuitive, and spiritual. This broad concept of education continued in Europe until the rationalism of Descartes and Darwin pushed it aside.</p>
<p>In my concept of the spiritual, the psyche is restored to its meaning of integrating conscious and unconscious, rational and intuitive—the Good, the True, and the Beautiful. School curricula often emphasize such rational elements of music as theory and history. Music education philosopher Bennett Reimer even defined the “practical, religious, therapeutic, moral, political and commercial” aspects as nonmusical.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0027432112472163">15</xref></sup> Broader approaches to the philosophy of music, including pragmatist philosopher Richard Shusterman’s <italic>somaesthetics</italic><sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0027432112472163">16</xref></sup> (having to do with the use of one’s body as the location of the sensory experience of beauty), have called for a holistic music education that views musical experience as a combination of numerous interacting parts, including the spiritual aspects of music.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0027432112472163">17</xref></sup> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0027432112472163">Figure 1</xref> illustrates this metaphor: Each circle represents the wanderings of Psyche through the environment of music education. If she fails to see the overlaps among the circles, she continues to wander aimlessly. If she recognizes the overlaps, the wandering can become purposeful.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0027432112472163">18</xref></sup> If we are to investigate how music teachers might become modern-day psychagogues, I believe that recognition of the overlaps in this diagram can help facilitate this process.</p>

<title>The Four Domains of the Musical Experience</title>
<sec id="section5-0027432112472163">
<title>Materials</title>
<p>Music is the organization of concrete materials drawn from the human body and the environment. In music curricula, this domain often stays at the level of technical skill and production. When this is the case, the embodied experiences described by music educator Carl Orff and ethnomusicologist John Blacking are frequently ignored.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0027432112472163">19</xref></sup> Furthermore, the close relation of musical experience to the natural world is similarly ignored.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0027432112472163">20</xref></sup> We could transform ecological understanding at a stroke if we taught all our violin students to open their instrument cases and honor the tree that gave its life for the instrument. In traditional societies, the process of making an instrument involved a reverence toward, for example, the tree that gave its wood for the making of the drum, and the player would regard himself or herself as continually in relationship to that tree every time the instrument was played.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0027432112472163">
<title>Expression</title>
<p>The exploration of musical expression is where the subjectivity of composer/performer and listener intersect to provide facets of the True. Whatever the intention of the composer (the music’s intrinsic meaning) may have been, those who listen and perform the work bring extrinsic meaning to the music. This extrinsic meaning often arises from associations with certain life experiences and enculturation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0027432112472163">21</xref></sup> Though these extrinsic meanings have been frequently downplayed by classical theorists,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0027432112472163">22</xref></sup> they are where the hidden aspects of Psyche reside. As philosopher Ruth Westheimer wrote, “What I do know is that the hopelessness I felt was so deep, I could admit it only in song.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0027432112472163">23</xref></sup> Musical expression includes identity, feelings, memories, imagination, and most important of all, empathy. We might think of a ten-year-old girl who reflects on the African prayer she sings each night: “I felt close to the people in Africa whose prayer we sang. Now I continue to sing it and think of them.”</p>
<p>In our curricula in England, this domain features most often in our curricula for the youngest children. But it often disappears as pupils get older. Here is an area where insights from music therapy can be used as a means of deep inner self-exploration rather than therapeutic attendance of the participants’ psychopathological needs.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0027432112472163">24</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0027432112472163">
<title>Construction</title>
<p>It is in domain of construction that our curricula concentrate in their pursuit of the Beautiful. But the concept of the Beautiful is often limited and confined to particular traditions and cultures. Improvisatory elements with their delight in spontaneity, play, and the carnivalesque<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0027432112472163">25</xref></sup> have been marginalized. The notated traditions and the freer traditions need to be brought together in the curriculum.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0027432112472163">
<title>Values</title>
<p>The domain of values reflects a search for the Good. Classical Greek literature is filled with stories embodying the potential ethical power of music, but theorists such as Reimer have often preferred to see individual works of art dislocated from their social context.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0027432112472163">26</xref></sup> However, the sounds of music can serve, express, challenge, and create cultures.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0027432112472163">27</xref></sup> The structure of the classical orchestra and choir, for example, reflect the European cultures that produced them and their rule by benevolent dictators now embodied in a conductor. Philosophers like Rose Rosengard Subotnik and Heidi Westerlund<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0027432112472163">28</xref></sup> have attempted to restore the cultural dimension of values to music education, seeing the imperative for music and musicians to attend to the ethical dimensions of the social situations created by and for music.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0027432112472163">29</xref></sup></p>
<p>But where in our curricula is this domain discussed? Where do we discuss community building through music? A ten-year-old boy began his written reflections as a participant at a musical concert with “It was like peace on earth. Everyone did their own thing but it all fitted together.” Teachers often comment on music’s ability to develop community-building skills in improvisation. One teacher has commented, “I saw [the children] supporting one another and encouraging other schools in their work. This is unusual for our children whose poverty often makes them quite self-centered.”</p>
<p>The area of values also has intrinsic and extrinsic elements. Creative processes such as jazz and improvisation provide opportunity to focus on the intrinsic values of reciprocity, community, and care. Extrinsic values can be examined through such performance characteristics as venue selection and ticket pricing. Many community musicians today are very explicit about their value systems. Indeed, the growth of the community choir movement in the United Kingdom can be seen as a challenge to the dominant, elite value systems of institution-bound classical music. Musicians working in the area of cultural fusion look toward music as a route to justice and peace. In my own compositions, I create opportunities for people to actively interact with the musical creation through the placement of non-notated “holes” in the score. I hope that the performers will then use their own particular principles of construction to realize the score.</p>
<p>Psychiatrist Anthony Storr, in his book <italic>Music and the Mind</italic>, described the creation of community as the main reason for the presence of music in world cultures.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0027432112472163">30</xref></sup> The climate in some school systems is of a tightly controlled bureaucracy that limits the scope of the curriculum. This is frustrating for those teachers who see their role as one of a psychagogue.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0027432112472163">
<title>Spirituality</title>
<p>Where does this lead us? To spirituality. Why? Spirituality occurs in the moments when fusion occurs between the four domains of materials, expression, construction, and values.</p>
<p>Philosophers like Catherine Ellis have provided insight about the ethnomusicological relationship between spirituality and Western classical music traditions. Ellis distinguishes among three levels of learning: informal, formal, and spiritual/visionary.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0027432112472163">31</xref></sup> Poet Ian Dunmore dramatically illustrated the spiritual experience of music:
<disp-quote>
<p>For the first twenty-five minutes I was totally unaware of any subtlety . . . whilst wondering what, if anything, was supposed to happen during the recital. What did happen was magic! After some time, insidiously the music began to reach me. Little by little, my mind all my senses it seemed—were becoming transfixed. Once held by these soft but powerful sounds, I was irresistibly drawn into a new world of musical shapes and colours. It almost felt as if the musicians were playing me rather than their instruments, and soon, I, too, was clapping and gasping with everyone else. . . . I was unaware of time, unaware of anything other than the music. Then it was over. But it was, I am sure, the beginning of a profound admiration that I shall always have for an art form that has been until recently totally alien to me.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0027432112472163">32</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Spirituality represents the reintegration of the body (materials), the emotions (expression), the intellect (construction), and the culture (values). These moments can include experiences that are described with terms such as <italic>flow</italic> (as when dealing with creativity), <italic>ecstasy</italic> (often associated with idea of “the holy” coming from the religious/spiritual literature), <italic>trance, peak experiences, religious experiences, spiritual experiences</italic>, and what some researchers call <italic>liminality</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0027432112472163">33</xref></sup></p>
<p>When spirituality is heightened, composers, performers, or listeners enter a different time/space dimension, leaving everyday reality for another world. Anthropologist Victor Turner refers to this as the “liminal space” wherein there is direct experience of a sacred, invisible, or supernatural order.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0027432112472163">34</xref></sup> This space is potentially transformative, recalling the Greek image for Psyche: the butterfly. Turner also discussed its quality of <italic>communitas</italic>, or the bond that develops between participants. Turner concentrates on a communal sense of intimacy and a feeling of being united with the universe, other beings, and the natural world.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0027432112472163">35</xref></sup> Spirituality represents a way of knowing that is different from everyday, propositional knowing.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0027432112472163">36</xref></sup> Spirituality embraces a “both/and” logic where a central feature is paradox. In spirituality, the mysterious is made present as the whole person or community experiences the reintegrating of themselves. Anima mundi is restored.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0027432112472163">
<title>Understanding Music’s Power</title>
<p>We come to the last of the Greek myths. The myth is of Orpheus, the father of song who joined song with the lyre of Hermes to charm the birds, fish, and wild beasts; coax the trees and rocks into dance; and divert the course of rivers. Can we encourage such ecological knowing in our classes?</p>
<p>My argument here is that we can restore Psyche to our music education by adopting a philosophy that includes the totality of the music experience. The inclusion of the domains of value and expression gives us the potential for reintegration of the very deepest aspects of our being—simultaneously personal and communal—like the psychagogues in drama. This means revisiting the tight link between politics and education<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0027432112472163">37</xref></sup> that often governs our curricula and keeps us wedded to a well-trodden but limited view of human beings, the cosmos, and musicking. It means rethinking education as process not product, as a series of strategies rather than government-imposed curricula and published programs of study that may not fit particular circumstances or the needs of our students.</p>
<p>Estelle Jorgensen similarly calls for a musical pedagogy related to lived life and asks for matters of character, disposition, value, personality, and musicality to feature in pedagogical training so that teachers may “think and act artfully, imaginatively, hopefully, and courageously toward creating a better world.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0027432112472163">38</xref></sup> This does not mean abandoning all that we have taught in the way of skills. Rather, it is about teaching in a way that associates skills with emotional and cultural awareness so that students will be empowered to make well-informed choices about their uses of music in the process of living. Music education therefore becomes a process of leading our students into a greater understanding of the power of music, through which they have potential to construct identities that are truly their own.</p>
<p>Late capitalism has invented many underworlds to keep people trapped in cultures of consumerism, inequality, addiction, and control. If we can grasp the totality of music’s potential for our pupils, they may have some strategies of resistance that will give them autonomy, identities of integrity, and hope.</p>
