<p>This useful reader (sadly lacking an index, making reference much harder) sees an international editorial team gather fifteen original papers on radio’s modern role in multiple nations. They were originally developed for the first conference organized by the radio research section of the European Communication Research and Education Association, a conference held in Cyprus three years ago. The papers appear in three main sections. None hark back to some “golden age,” but seek to describe a wide variety of audio medium approaches very much in the present or recent past.</p>
<p>The first part, “Convergence,” sets the tone with studies of French interactive radio, Spanish talk radio station websites, Portuguese Internet radio, and radio as the voice of a local community. These are of interest for their centering on the relationship between Web and broadcast services. Part two, “Content,” covers an Italian radio “mockumentary” program, news strategies of Spanish talk radio networks, music radio alternatives, and a case study of the Catalan context for radio music in Spain. The final part, “Community,” discusses online community radio, new technologies and facilitation of audience participation, small community radio in the Flemish community in Belgium, the origins of Slovenian community radio, and examples of community radio in Africa. Here a chief appeal is the places studies—not on the usual well-beaten path.</p>
<p>Collectively, these papers are valuable not only for their varied countries of coverage, but for their record of how many radio operations are embracing social media. Gazi (who was the chief organizer of the conference) is a visiting lecturer on media psychology at the Cyprus University of Technology; Starkey is professor of radio and journalism at the University of Sunderland and author of several earlier radio books; and Jedrzejewski is professor of sociology of media and social communication at the John Paul II Catholic University in Lublin.</p>
