<abstract>
<p>The geography of Internet access places is constructed by the interaction of the stakeholders, not only by the negotiation of local regulatory policies but also by the uses of these technologies. It differentiates urban space, contributes to urban fragmentation and the fragmentation into archipelagos of social groups, in a relationship which is not one-to-one. The new socio-technical practices of the city in interaction with infrastructures linked to mobility and accessibility produce urban forms which intensify social fragmentation. This work is based on field surveys conducted in China combining face-to-face questionnaires and in-depth interviews with operators (of cybercafés, local managers, etc.) and their users.</p>

<body>
<p>Urban areas are changing at an increasingly rapid pace and these changes are altering the ways in which people live and work there, create wealth, interact and connect with the places which make up the urban space. Nowadays, these changes are having an impact on dimensions such as the relations between transport and telecommunications, between virtual communities and those rooted in a territory, between mobility tools and urban spaces, between the organisation of the city and cyberspace. Cyberspace does not refer to a virtual space that is independent of geographical space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0042098011410333">Dodge and Kitchin, 2004</xref>) but to the networking of places via the Internet, its infrastructures, its services, its content, and also its uses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0042098011410333">Graham and Marvin, 1996</xref>). It is therefore a social construction and not just a technical construction, with an intersection of physical and virtual space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0042098011410333">Graham and Marvin, 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0042098011410333">2001</xref>), like the digiplaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0042098011410333">Zook and Graham, 2007</xref>). This networking of places equipped with information and communication technologies (ICT), socio-technical systems, such as cybercafés, differentiates space and therefore contributes to the production of urban geography.</p>
<p>This paper is part of the global approach to understanding how cities and their inhabitants interact with socio-technical systems based on ICT, how new urban forms emerge and how cyberspace is created in the city. Rejecting any direct or ‘loose’, technical or social causal plan and faced with the impossibility of separating ‘technical reality’ from ‘social activity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0042098011410333">Castoriadis, 1992</xref>), we have decided to analyse the permanent interactions between technology and society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0042098011410333">Flichy, 1995</xref>). Accordingly, we have used the concept of socio-technical systems to study ‘cybercafés’, places ‘equipped’ with ICT—hybrid spaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0042098011410333">Couclelis, 1996</xref>) relying on diverse configurations and emerging user dynamics. Public Internet access points do not exist in China, or at least only symbolically. ‘Cybercafés’ are operated by private actors; they designate all venues equipped for Internet access, even those without computers.</p>
<p>Our research project relies in particular on the thesis advanced by Manuel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0042098011410333">Castells (1997)</xref> and Stephen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0042098011410333">Graham (2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0042098011410333">Graham and Marvin, 2001</xref>). In this approach, the thesis advanced is that the dissemination of ICT is accompanied by polarisation movements which fragment space and reinforce the notions of limits and separation.</p>
<p>The concept of urban fragmentation, as used by us, refers to the dynamics of the interdependence and division between social groups or between their relations with the urban territory. The concept of segregation relates to the composition of urban territories and is sensitive to notions of homogeneousness and separation. In this paper, the two notions refer to degrees in a process characterising a space. Thus, when we refer to the recent trend towards fragmentation in Beijing, we are referring to the transition from a less fragmented state to a more fragmented state of urban space, but we refrain from discussing the absolute degree of fragmentation.</p>
<p>These dynamics of fragmentation reveal the connection between activities and the places where the activities take place. However, with ICT, activities can, more so than in the past, be dispersed, be carried out in different places and at different times: at the office, at home, in a ‘third place’ or on a mobile basis. The standard connection between an activity and its conditions is becoming more flexible, making the activity, time and space more flexible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0042098011410333">Kwan, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0042098011410333">Lenz and Nobis, 2007</xref>). As regards networked services offered by ICT, the fact of differentiating the service provided, creating a situation of inequalities with regard to access and uses, contributes to a reduction in pre-existing socio-spatial solidarity, especially in a context of the weakening of the ‘comprehensive ideal’ of urban planning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0042098011410333">Graham and Marvin, 2001</xref>). These authors note that today the regulation of access to the Internet is increasingly governed by the workings of market forces and is <italic>de facto</italic> reserved for certain social groups, segmenting the market and fragmenting urban space: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0042098011410333">Graham and Marvin (2001)</xref> refer to “splintering urbanism” (2001). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0042098011410333">Lenz and Nobis (2007)</xref> emphasise that social groups do not have the same fragmentation potential: their ‘mobile computer fragmenters’, operating in all fields of activities, are very sensitive to mobility. David <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0042098011410333">Mangin (2004)</xref> refers to franchised cities, characterised by the development of areas which are not or are no longer under the control of the public authorities but are subject to the private logic of market-driven unintentional development (MUD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0042098011410333">Mars, 2008</xref>; and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0042098011410333">Hornsby, 2008</xref>). Obviously, the city is essentially composed of somewhat fractured spaces and urban fragmentation is not a recent phenomenon, but its spatial organisation develops according to a logic of permanent changes linked in particular to technological and social changes following a movement which can be segregative or contribute to integration.</p>
<p>However, the dissemination of ICT is accompanied by additional homogenising effects; this ‘pervasive’ technology converges with pre-existing spatial structures and is being disseminated everywhere. Nature and technology interact closely, linked by new, increasingly invisible technologies which define the positioning of people and property (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0042098011410333">Sloterdijk, 2004</xref>). Software programmes write the city and ‘the technological subconscious’ would appear to shape urban practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0042098011410333">Thrift and French, 2002</xref>). Thus, numerous researchers have highlighted the smoothing of limits, between the city and the countryside (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0042098011410333">Secchi, 1984</xref>), between private and public spaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0042098011410333">Viard, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>The thesis advanced here is that the geography of Internet access points is co-constructed by an interaction between stakeholders (central government, local stakeholders, etc.), both as regards the negotiation of local regulatory policies and uses of these technologies. In return, this geography of ‘cybercafés’ differentiates the urban space, contributes to urban fragmentation and the splintering of its social groups, in a relationship which is not one-to-one since there is a co-construction process. The new socio-technical practices of the city in interaction with infrastructures linked to mobility and accessibility produce urban forms which reinforce social fragmentation. So the differentiation of mobility—the speed as well as the ‘width’ of access (for example, the possibility of connecting more freely to foreign sites)—is the basis of the territorial differentiation of Internet access points in Chinese urban areas and increases the degree of territorial fragmentation. These processes which are relatively obscure are transforming cities, places, public spaces and the relations between inhabitants and space.</p>
<p>The presentation of our research work is based around the following sections. Section 1 presents a research model based on field surveys, followed by section 2 on the dynamics of the co-regulation of the cybercafés market. Section 3 discusses the uses and appropriation of ICT, the geography and diversity of the urban forms of ‘cybercafés’ and the paper ends with a discussion.</p>

<title>1. A Research Model Based on Field Surveys</title>
<p>Some statistics are available on the question of Internet access points in China, showing that in 2007 cybercafés represented one of the main Internet access points (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0042098011410333">CNNIC, 2007</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0042098011410333">1</xref></sup> However, little research has been undertaken into the question of the dynamics of the adoption and appropriation of Internet access systems in China (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0042098011410333">Guo, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0042098011410333">Hwang, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Two waves of field surveys underpin our research.</p>
<sec id="section2-0042098011410333">
<title>1.1 An Exploratory Survey</title>
<p>The first field survey focused on Starbucks in Beijing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0042098011410333">Puel <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>). The limited sample of 30 people aged from 20 to 60 provides only an exploratory insight into the profiles of users of these places. In the absence of objective data on the individuals who use these spaces, we relied on pure observation in order to construct a sample combining characteristics such as gender, geographical origins and social profiles.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0042098011410333">
<title>1.2 Empirical Analysis of the Construction of Internet Offerings Based on Face-to-face Interviews</title>
<p>For the second wave, three empirical studies covering five urban areas (Beijing, Shanghai, Dalian, Tianjin and Chóngqìng) carried out in 2007 to analyse how the interaction between the national regulatory policy and local stakeholders shapes local markets of Internet cafés by using marketing segmentation: it corresponds to different cybercafé models corresponding to value proposals adapted to each targeted market segment. Thus, this segmentation process assumes a special form in that it is the result of co-construction between the state, the regions and private entrepreneurs. Yet the supply thus constructed will encounter demand which does not correspond to Internet ‘consumers’ but to technology ‘users’. However, ICT such as the Internet is unique in that, because of its ‘equivocal’ character, it can be used in a very wide range of ways according to the relevant social context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0042098011410333">Orlikowski, 1992</xref>). The very different ways in which the Internet is appropriated and used will further the transition from a marketing segmentation reality to an urban fragmentation process. The urban geography of Internet cafés is the socio-spatial expression of stakeholder interactions which demonstrates the considerable influence of users in this process.</p>
<p>We selected cities based on their place in the urban hierarchy of the Chinese Internet: Shanghai and Beijing in the first two rows, Tianjin and Dalian Range 10 and Chongqing in the back row (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0042098011410333">Wang, 2006</xref>). For each of the cities, comparable test zones were selected according to pre-established socio-territorial variables (presence of a student population, ‘ordinary’ residential district and ‘central’ district—with a strong commercial activity).</p>
<p>The surveys were conducted mainly in Mandarin and covered 94 managers of cybercafés and 235 users. The methodological approach combined in-depth interviews with the operators of cybercafés and face-to-face questionnaires with users. The objective of the interviews was to establish three main sets of information: first, the sector’s overall dynamics—long-established cybercafés, those which have recently been created and those which have disappeared; secondly, the entrepreneurship of the owner or manager—the type of ownership, management, profitability, investments, costs, turnover, profits and catchment area; and finally, a typology of cybercafés—choice of location, quality of the equipment, snapshots of the organisation of the premises and standard consumption attitudes, observation of what happens over one or two days at different times of the day, consultation of the browsing history of users.</p>

<sec id="section4-0042098011410333">
<title>1.3 Analysis of Uses</title>
<p>The questionnaires were distributed in simplified Chinese taking into account cultural differences. The data collected include socioeconomic characteristics (age, gender, level of education, places where the respondents live and work, profession, etc.) and variables relating to Internet usage (usage reasons, opinions on the services offered, uses, etc.) and the practices of access points (frequency, duration, reason for their choice, type of social interaction, etc.). This corpus was statistically processed and analysed and cross-tabulated with other studies. This work is part of a research project carried out by a multidisciplinary Franco-Chinese team, in the socioeconomic area. It relies on the support of a scientific partnership with the University of Chóngqìng.</p>
<p>This paper summarises these first survey waves (the main statistical results are presented in the <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0042098011410333">Appendix</xref>). The following section presents our analysis of the processes of the co-construction of the dynamics of the regulation of cybercafés. The idea advanced is that the established top–down policies are resisted on the ground and compromised with the local stakeholders in their enforcement (circumventing the law, spatial forms of resistance such as clandestine cybercafés, etc.). The dynamics of the co-construction of regulation shape the local market of Internet cafés and mould forms of access (systems, contents, uses, etc.) as well as the urban dynamics.</p>

<title>2. The Dynamics of the Joint Regulation of Cybercafés</title>
<p>China had become at the end of 2007 the world’s leading country in terms of the number of Internet users. In January 2008, the number of Internet users in China was 210 million people (excluding the Special Administrative Regions). Nevertheless, the Internet remains above all an urban phenomenon, concentrated on developing eastern China. Beijing, Shanghai and the province of Guangdong are the undisputed capitals of the Chinese Internet, being the focus of domain names, IP addresses, Internet sites, host computers and Internet users. Concentrating infrastructures, services and users, they have penetration rates above 30 per cent. These digital inequalities simply reflect the profound development inequalities of contemporary China on which they are superimposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0042098011410333">CNNIC, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0042098011410333">Douzet, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0042098011410333">Liu <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0042098011410333">Puel, 2009</xref>). According to the CNNIC, Internet users tend to be male (55 per cent), urban (77 per cent), educated and young (77 per cent are aged under 30; only 13 per cent are aged over 40). They are often single (58 per cent); they are often students (36 per cent); and 52 per cent earn less than €100 a month; peasants users are exceptional (0.4 per cent).</p>
<p>The development of Internet cafés can be explained in particular by the relatively low number of households that have an Internet connection (20 per cent in rural areas and 50 per cent in cities) and the insufficient number of access points in universities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0042098011410333">CNNIC, 2007</xref>). Barely 61 per cent of Internet users have unlimited connection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0042098011410333">CNNIC, 2007</xref>), whereas cybercafés, driven by fierce competitive pressures, continually invest in increasing the power of their bandwidth and the size of their computer fleet in order to remain attractive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0042098011410333">Zhang, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, and above all, types of utilisation (addiction to on-line games, IP telephony, information searches and social interaction) seem to be the other determining variable. Even if the Internet is used in its traditional form as a communication tool (mail, messaging, etc.) and as a life helper or for life assistance (a concept which covers uses such as on-line shopping, job searches, stock market transactions, etc.), two uses clearly dominate the Chinese Internet: entertainment and information searches (more than one in two users told us that they consult blogs “to keep up with the news”—i.e. independent news). Thus, the entertainment function of the Internet is universal in China: according to CNNIC data, the most frequent Internet uses, in order, are music, on-line videos and on-line games, with utilisation rates considerably higher than the American benchmark (68 versus 34 per cent for music). And CNNIC figures considerably underestimate the reality.</p>
<p>The structuring of supply is based on a multilevel method of governance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0042098011410333">Hooghe and Marks, 2001</xref>) which creates layers of actors, and the layers interact with each other in two ways: vertically across different levels of government and horizontally among other relevant actors at the same level. Thus, three levels can be distinguished.</p>
<sec id="section6-0042098011410333">
<title>2.1 The State’s Regulatory Policy</title>
<p>The rapid take-off in the number of users of the Internet and its related markets, including Internet cafés, has attracted the interest of numerous operators seeking to capitalise on this boom. Virtually all of China’s public Internet access systems belong to the private sector. They offer either Internet access linked to a computer, often combined with services (drinks, meals, library, etc.), or Internet access combined with services but without a computer. Since 1998, the central government has been attempting to stabilise, under its supervision, the business sites of Internet access services (<italic>hulianwang shangwang fuwu yingyechangsu</italic>). This is a legal term introduced in 2002 and which designates ‘business sites such as <italic>Internet cafés</italic> and <italic>computer lounges</italic>’. Netbars, <italic>wangbàs</italic> or cybercafés are synonyms, but ‘cybercafé’ is a generic term used to designate any Internet access place (sometimes offering neither coffee nor computers!).</p>
<p>In its regulation of cybercafés, the government is attempting to strike a balance between several strategic options: the development of Internet technology among the population, the construction of a national market and the controlling uses by controlling machines, information, citizens and places. However, this strategy is meeting with strong opposition. The process of controlling Internet access, in the same way as access to all other media, can be analysed as a form of social construction in which numerous stakeholders play a role, often rooted in local territories, but falling to a large extent within the scope of the macro system.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0042098011410333">
<title>2.2 Local Public Policies</title>
<p>In agreement with Linchuan and Liunung (2005), we consider that there is not one set of regulations but local regulations of business sites of Internet access services whose focus varies according to the balance of power and spatial scales, since what may be true at national level is not necessarily true at provincial and local levels. If this conflict between central government and local authorities falls within the scope of traditional issues of multilevel governance, it is not specific to the Internet and is amplified by a distance effect due to the immensity of China</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Between the two spheres (central and local) of real power … there is a lot of administration but not much authority (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0042098011410333">Shue, 1988</xref>, p. 152).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>A series of administrative or criminal penalties to be imposed on officials who fail to apply the state’s policy have not been enforced to date (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0042098011410333">Tran Dai, 2007</xref>). The multiplication and obscure nature of legal texts is another characteristic. While the penalties against cybercafé operators range from the confiscation of equipment to the confiscation of their licence, and even criminal charges, the enforcement of sentences depends on the ‘nature of the wrong caused’ (<italic>qingjie yanzhong de</italic>) without any other explanation. Likewise, non-adults are not allowed in cybercafés, but interpretations vary from under 14, to 16 or 18 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0042098011410333">Xu, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>To establish its control over the sector, the Ministry of Culture has been promoting, since 2003, a model based on national chains of cybercafés. The 10 authorised chains all have connections with ministries or state interests at the highest level and chains established at provincial or local level have all been excluded. However, the local authorities blocked the attempt</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>In some cases, such as the Guangdong, officials announced that none of the 10 national licence-holders would be authorised to operate in the province because they had a duty to protect local industry. In other cases, the Xinxiban (Municipal Computerisation Office) deliberately disregard the instructions of the provincial authorities of the Ministry of Culture to promote the chain model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0042098011410333">Linchuan and Liuning, 2005</xref>, p. 286).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0042098011410333">
<title>2.3. The Strategies of Private Operators</title>
<p>To open a cybercafé, an operator must have a licence and must therefore submit a return to numerous supervisory authorities. The manager is legally responsible for complying with legal obligations regarding the control of information: the Internet café’s equipment must be ‘secure’ (that is to say, the pages visited by Internet users must be stored in the computer’s memory), the identity of Internet users must be controlled and their particulars must be kept, filtering software must be installed, etc. Cybercafé owners must transmit to the public security office a list of the Internet sites which Internet users have attempted to access. However, most of these requirements are only implemented to a limited extent; a number of minors visit cybercafés (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0042098011410333">Zhang, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0042098011410333">Xu, 2007</xref>) and numerous operators do not have a licence. However, as some operators hinted to us, the <italic>guanxi</italic> (local social network) often enables them to receive advance warning of these raids or to reduce the penalties. Attempts to encourage operators of cybercafés to assume more responsibility for self-regulation remain very limited, therefore, especially as the number of participants reduces the scope of these efforts and operators often benefit from the protection of local authorities. Moreover, they are subject to pressure from their users.</p>
<p>Finally, it should be borne in mind that the application of increasingly burdensome regulations continually increases the economic constraints on operators and encourages a large number of them to resort to illegal operations. Only the biggest operators can recoup costs, which benefits the other participants in the chain: software publishers, computer manufacturers, the encryption industry, etc. More closely integrated in the <italic>guanxi</italic>, they purchase compulsory software from the various local regulatory authorities but refrain, as we have often noted, from installing it so as not to slow down computers and upset their users by reducing the quality of access, while storing them carefully in case of an inspection</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Who pays the money? Customers! Civil servants in Beijing levy ever increasing amounts of taxes … as regards the other [i.e. local civil servants] it’s the same thing! But at least they let us work … we have to come to an arrangement (manager in Shanghai).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The connivance between operators and the local authorities can be explained by the community of economic interests which they share and which threatens the government’s policy.</p>
<p>Linchuan and Liuning compare the national regulatory policy to a structure without roots</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The local execution of the national policy has long been a challenge for the central government, given the size of the country, internal differences and the relatively weak level of standardisation of administrative operations. This is a crucial point … since the vast majority of Internet cafés produce local operations, by locals and for locals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0042098011410333">Linchuan and Liuning, 2005</xref>, p. 274).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>As reported by a manager of a <italic>Xinxiban</italic>, “National and provincial regulators give only the policy, but not money”. And operators of local <italic>netbars</italic> are better placed to benefit from their relations with the <italic>guanxi</italic> to evade regulations with which they do not agree and which threaten their profitability. The owner of a cybercafé gave us this example: “If the water is not of a good quality, it’s pointless to check the tap too often”. Here, the water is the content and the tap is the cybercafé. However, certain Internet users (the silent majority) and pressure groups (parents and teachers) are also important stakeholders as regards cybercafés or the provision of the Internet services more generally. They play an effective intermediary role for the central state, which slightly modifies Lichuan and Liuning’s assertion.</p>
<p>Despite regulation at national level, owners/managers therefore have considerable leeway to create their own value proposal and the related business model of their cybercafé according to the type of customers they target.</p>

<title>3. The Geography and Diversity of Urban Forms of Cybercafés: Uses and Appropriation of ICT</title>
<p>The surveys reveal several urban forms of public access corresponding to different business models consistent with the socioeconomic spaces where these cybercafés are installed and shaped by the way in which their particular groups of users appropriate the Internet. We distinguish three models: the Starbucks models (model 1), neighbourhood cybercafés (model 2a), the multiservices model (model 2b), the ‘community’ model (model 2c) and alternatives (model 3). Of the five cities studied, we construct a model of the geography of cybercafés at work in Chinese cities by eliminating the contingent aspects: Tianjin, located into Beijing’s orbit, or Chongqing with its specific internal geography and low rate of foreigners, for example.</p>
<sec id="section10-0042098011410333">
<title>3.1 Urban Centres and Pericentres</title>
<p>There are absolutely no cybercafés in the core of the city; however, it does have several Starbucks and up-market Chinese cafés. All have a wi-fi connection and are used by expatriates and affluent Chinese citizens who work in this district; they go there with their laptop, their mobile phone and connect to the Internet while talking with friends over a cup of coffee. Thus, the Starbucks occupy the urban space of premium users. The selection determined by the very high prices<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0042098011410333">2</xref></sup> and the strong symbolism offers individuals roaming access, a third access point between their office and home, where professional and/or private interactions remain uninterrupted or simultaneous. This nomadism is the result of a provisional but intentional immobility within mobility, popular with businessmen</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Every morning, I start by coming and having a coffee, even though I have of course had one at home; I don’t stay long, just long enough to organise my day, then I generally come back after lunch and at that time I manage to make a business appointment. On Fridays, I come at the end of the day, to relax and meet my colleagues or some customers.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This territory, a strong symbol of the American way of life in China, represents a spatial form that is renewing the urban landscape and a territorial extension of the globalised economy, in the image of luxury hotels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0042098011410333">Sanjuan, 2001</xref>), a ‘census agora’ to which the local and foreign social élite flock, often travelling long distances.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I come here because it’s a good place; there are Starbucks nearer my office and I sometimes go there to work. But I come here with friends and it’s really popular. It’s clean. … I like the atmosphere.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Yet it was a European woman who declared that the place ensured that she saw</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>respectable and clean Chinese people … not like those in the street. Here, this is the real China, a lot of artists, people from the film industry or television.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Starbucks are accessible and visible: as they are not considered cybercafés, they are not subject to the regulations. Starbucks has become a trendy place adapted to the very high spatial capital (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0042098011410333">Lévy, 2003</xref>) of members of the local élite and expatriates</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Along my route I visited Jianguo Gate, the Parkson Store, Financial Street, the HQs of the biggest Chinese banks, and then I visited the western commercial district of Xidan … The reason I wanted to visit all the Starbucks was that I wanted to see the city. Starbucks helped me to choose the best spots in the city. Their market research is excellent. Anywhere there’s a Starbucks you can be sure of two things:</p>
<p>—there’s a pool of good customers (managers or tourists)</p>
<p>—the location offers a good view of the city</p>
<p>… Just look at a map, and you’ll see it’s true (Wang Jianshuo; quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0042098011410333">Puel <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>, p. 40).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Their carefully selected situation in a space of flows is proof that geography matters, especially as the logic behind their location leads to a geographical concentration which impacts on the production of urban space and which is the focal point of the spatial habits of inhabitants. Generally speaking, in Chinese cities, central areas inhabited or used by affluent social groups are the territories marked by the free wi-fi access of trendy places (62 per cent come here for social interaction and 90 per cent use the Internet as a ‘communication tool’) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0042098011410333">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>Everything around the pericentre where the Chinese middle classes live is dominated by the emerging model of multiservices cybercafés backed by the chains and large organisations.</p>
<p>Halei, created in July 2005 in Dalian, has 300 flat-screen computers with webcams. The 10-megabyte Chinatelcom and Chinanet double optical fibre network provides rapid and stable Internet access. Yet it offers far more elaborate services than a simple cybercafé; it has a bar, a restaurant, an electronic games room and a billiards room. This type of cybercafé is the trend in Dalian as in other Chinese metropolises: the idea is to multiply services, to create a space where all customers can find what they are looking for. The aim of this positioning is to attract more customers than traditional cybercafés based on a multiservices approach. However, they also require a far more substantial financial standing.</p>
<p>However, competition is fierce and is increasing with the development of major bar groups that are opening premises near the most profitable cybercafés; these bars (such as those owned by the Hoju chain) also offer a free wi-fi service to customers with their own laptop and base their business model on the consumption of related products, adapting the Starbucks model. Some expatriates from Beijing told us that they sometimes visit these places in order to view certain websites to which access has been temporarily blocked by the authorities in the embassy district in which they work.</p>

<sec id="section11-0042098011410333">
<title>3.2 Intermediate, University and Residential Districts</title>
<p>The second district, where research centres, most of the universities and a high-tech industrial zone are located, is the area where the city’s cybercafés are concentrated: their customers are virtually all students. It should be remembered that the massive presence of cybercafés contributes to the Chinese education system. Despite the efforts made by universities, network infrastructures are inadequate. As all students are housed on campuses within the universities, those who do not have an Internet connection or want more freedom opt for a neighbourhood cybercafé. Their criticisms concern the lack of speed due to sharing bandwidth with numerous users, but also the restrictions on the scope of access due to a shortage of computers, limited access hours and the surveillance to which they are subject. It is in ‘student’ cybercafés that information-related uses and social interaction are the lowest (see the <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0042098011410333">Appendix</xref>); entertainment and mostly games (81 per cent) dominate.</p>
<p>The third district is a popular district where ‘ordinary’ citizens live. It has three times fewer cybercafés, but these satisfy the basic needs of local residents. As a general rule, the quality of service that they provide is superior to that of the student district. The decoration is more elaborate and the environment is also more welcoming. They tend to be located in the hubs where population flows are concentrated, such as shopping malls. These intermediate districts (residential or student areas) stand out for their diversified offering linked to the user area, combining neighbourhood services, places dedicated to games or social interaction, and sometimes they even affect the cybercafé’s organisation. Thus, the Ming Ren Jin Dian is sub-divided into four areas, plus VIP rooms. One area, the ‘reserved’ area, is devoted to entertainment, the second to games, one to chat and the last one to downloading</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I am trying to offer multiple services while creating a venue that is welcoming and comfortable for everyone. Also I have to make optimum use of the equipment and avoid disputes between customers.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Obviously, the biggest area is that reserved for games.</p>
<p>It is also in these urban territories that very localised and community niche markets are developing as community cybercafés. Cybercafé operators adapt to market dynamics and to their catchment area—that is to say, to the characteristics of their territory.</p>
<p>Tian Xi is a Korean cybercafé in the university district in Tianjin; access is not restricted but, as the computers are in Korean, it is used solely by Koreans. Its services are fairly comprehensive with a rest room (with a notice board allowing the exchange of information, news, offers, etc.), a payphone room (the lines are, of course, connected only to Korea), mobile phone chargers and evening newspapers; an ‘after-sales service’ option even offers customers a computer home-repair service. The majority of customers are members: there is a high degree of social interaction even if they come for the games, the chat, information searches, the stock market and films (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0042098011410333">Xu, 2007</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section12-0042098011410333">
<title>3.3 The Urban Fringe</title>
<p>Finally, in the urban fringe areas, there are, on the one hand, traditional neighbourhood Internet cafés and, on the other hand, clandestine places specialising in games. It is difficult to gain access to these places for our research for obvious reasons. In the face of the recent tightening of regulatory controls</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>a section of Chinese youth falls back on clandestine gaming rooms, sometimes installed in cars abandoned in car parks of apartment blocks in Beijing.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0042098011410333">3</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The strict application of the regulations is very expensive and therefore almost impossible for independent operators; as a result, they have no choice other than to join a chain, sell their licence on the Black market, or go underground and specialise in the on-line gaming market. This market integrates in a highly competitive and global framework, alongside real players, urban students working in small units located in the urban fringe or in farms. Brokers sell the gaming elements that they collect to mainly North American and European ‘players’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0042098011410333">Ge, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>At international level with multinationals and at national level, these forms of resistance are officially prosecuted, with recurring campaigns for the development of a ‘healthy Internet’, but at local level such action is limited, except in very specific cases where the political interaction of local stakeholders involves responding and reacting to an incident for the sake of appearances.</p>
<p>These case studies clearly demonstrate the extent to which the government’s strategy of control and homogenisation is handicapped by the problem of the social practices of users. Contrary to the indications of the empirical studies on uses observed in Europe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0042098011410333">Puel and Vidal, 2004</xref>), Chinese users do not hesitate to travel long distances to circumvent this technocratic territorialisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0042098011410333">Xu, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0042098011410333">Zhang, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0042098011410333">Linchuan and Liuning, 2005</xref>). Some are interested only in high-speed access (for leisure activities), secure access (for stock market transactions), a community goal (for social interaction) or unsupervised access (to read or disseminate information), but many others simply want a public place, a meeting place. The existence of common interests shared by local authorities and users is the key favourable element. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0042098011410333">Guo (2004)</xref>, this does not exist in small towns. On the contrary, in Italy, where the new regulation making it compulsory since 11 September 2001 to present an ID card is applied, communities of illegal immigrants have disappeared from cybercafés which have had to diversify the services offered (VOIP, money transfers, fax, photocopies, etc.) or close (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0042098011410333">Thiam, 2009</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section13-0042098011410333">
<title>4. Discussion</title>
<p>Over and above the contextual differences between five major cities, a form of model can be detected and a number of points emerge.</p>
<p>First of all, according to the operators, the cybercafé sector is apparently still promising because of the extremely rapid breakthrough of the Internet in society and the addiction to certain uses (games and information), combined with the ever-increasing attraction of cybercafés as a public space for social interaction (37 per cent of Internet users declared that they used them in 2007 versus 27 per cent in 2005; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0042098011410333">CNNIC, 2008</xref>). This industry has become fiercely competitive. Thus the 2007 government ban on any new cybercafé openings has fuelled the development of a Black market for the resale of licences which has become highly speculative. It is subject to a process of consolidation encouraged by the government and its regulatory policy, which is ushering in major change: a decline in traditional cybercafés and the elimination of clandestine cybercafés in the pericentre where new models are emerging, combining a technological offering, related services and increasingly refined opportunities for social interaction.</p>
<p>In this ecosystem under (re)construction, the central government is assembling behind it a network of allies composed of national and foreign ICT-sector stakeholders (computer manufacturers, game software publishers, encryption specialists, Internet and telecoms operators, etc.), major cybercafé operators and certain pressure groups (parents, teachers, etc.).</p>
<p>However, this model is encountering the reservations of local authorities, operators that wish to retain control over the cybercafés and the misgivings of users who want an open Internet. These protean alliances of opponents, combining small operators, the chains and local authorities, users who want an open Internet, ‘minors’ and the underground economy, are resisting and constructing a system of public Internet access which, although official, is not subject to national regulations on the one hand, with alternative urban forms in the urban fringe on the other hand.</p>
<p>The resultant segmentation of public Internet access points goes hand-in-hand with the fragmentation of an increasingly segregative urban space.</p>
<p>On the one side, a first universe of cybercafés corresponds to the new social controls that the government wants to impose: these supervised spaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0042098011410333">Lianos, 2001</xref>) are frequented by users who, irrespective of whether or not they are informed of the real access conditions, are either not really bothered (they view the Internet as a range of opportunities to improve their own life), or support the values defended by the authorities (the Internet must be ‘safe and healthy’) and defend them actively (as proven by the success of the campaign to denounce criminal acts committed on the Internet). Their success is also based on the strong desire for social interaction and the sign of high social distinction that it represents. On Sundays and certain weekend evenings, these places are frequented by the ‘chiburbanites’ who live in walled urban enclaves (compounds, villa communities for the most affluent, or other gated communities). The social practices of this type of cybercafé add to the fragmentation of the city into archipelagos, into networks of places cut off by material or symbolic barriers</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The chiburbanite goes from one specific location to the next inside a car. There is no contact with the transition—with the city itself. This is only a time gap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0042098011410333">Hornsby, 2008</xref>, p. 206).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In these intermediate spaces, the different forms of access have in common low social diversity and therefore a high segregative value. According to our surveys, cybercafés, whether they are community models or among the most refined models, lock down customers, whether the barriers are the price, keyboard design or language or uses. Even neighbourhood cybercafés, despite the fact that they focus on the needs of customers in their catchment area, are threatened by the urban transformation which is leading to the disappearance of <italic>siheyuans</italic> and their social mixity.</p>
<p>At the other end of the scale, there are ‘fringe’ spaces, clandestine or semi-legal places (sometimes temporary), frequented by young people, ‘non-adults’ or students, and individuals who aspire to an open Internet. The main characteristic of these places is perhaps their spatial fluidity, eluding the control of the authorities and constantly on the move. They differ fundamentally from other illegal premises, such as those of the sex industry (karaoke bars, massage parlours or hairdressing salons), which are found everywhere in the city, because they are directly controlled by the authorities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0042098011410333">Farrer, 2008</xref>). In compensation for this spatial precariousness, types of uses there are freer and access costs are lower. These ‘low-cost’ access points contribute in a two-fold way to the dynamics of mobility: on the one hand, thanks to the spatial capital<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0042098011410333">4</xref></sup> of their users, they are fully integrated into the globalised cyberspace of players; on the other hand, they interact with the urban space, switching continuously to free territories, the underworld of the Internet, driven away by urbanisation and regulation to be reborn elsewhere, in the image of temporary dwellings and floating villages. Beyond the periphery, far more rare, they mix with non-permanent and semi-legal dwellings, continually pushed back by urban extension. Their low societal diversity (young and students or ‘<italic>mingongs</italic>’) is another of the characteristics that they share with wi-fi territories.</p>
<p>The latter, which escape most of the restrictions—since regulation of them is more flexible and technological monitoring tools less effective—continue to be reserved for the foreign or local urban élite, the ‘premium users’. Although the range of access there is wider (in particular with regard to foreign sites), they are frequented by the ‘right kind of people’, with the selection process being based on price, social codes and social capital. If they share with other places of consumption, such as trendy restaurants and designer boutiques, similar social codes and related representations (effects of belonging and exclusion), they differ from them by their high degree of social interaction.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0042098011410333">
<title>5. Conclusion</title>
<p>Several forms of reasoning seem to intertwine the dynamic of urban fragmentation favoured by cybercafés in China: those of planners and public authorities, those of operators and the market, and finally those of inhabitants and their uses.</p>
<p>The state’s strict Internet controls lead to cybercafé models which target wealthy customer segments (the obligation to hold an operating permit and other restraints which increase the cost of the cybercafé business model; the official channels charge high rates). Another consequence is the location of illicit cybercafés on the outskirts of cities because that puts them ‘out of reach’ of state agents. Another consequence is an emerging need among users for a ‘free’ Internet.</p>
<p>Yet state regulation is losing its power at local levels, which enables private operators to meet the latent demands of users by diversifying cybercafé business models: the value offered is not Internet access but a range of ‘Internet’ services and therefore diverse Internet uses. The different offerings correspond to a marketing segmentation targeting different geographical areas of the city and therefore contribute to the city’s geography. The social groups, among whom there is a strong demand for differentiated urban practices and uses, in turn reinforce the fragmentation movement: geographical and social fragmentation, because it is furthered by forms of social homophily.</p>
<p>The socio-spatial fragmentation trend which we have noted in the case of cybercafés corresponds to a more general but recent territorial differentiation movement in China (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0042098011410333">Chang, 2006</xref>). The social diversity which characterised all districts is becoming less perceptible. The geography of cybercafés follows the MUD, increasingly separating the rich from the poor as Chen Xiaofeng<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0042098011410333">5</xref></sup> underscores. “Communist China has been converted into a bastion of individuals fending for themselves.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0042098011410333">6</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Thus Chinese metropolises appear as successions of networks of places appropriated by social groups that create differences and are segregative. Socio-technical systems, such as the cybercafés studied here, supplement these networks and possibly even reinforce them. They correspond to a two-fold absence, the public place as a place of contact and privacy,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0042098011410333">7</xref></sup> and serve as a bridge, ensuring continuity in the urban space of the élite.</p>

<p>The CNNIC is a government agency which operates under the supervision of the Ministry of Information. Every six months, it publishes a statistical report on the Internet in China. Its methodology corresponds to international standards. To collect data it uses metrology software, on-line questionnaires and telephone surveys. The latter data collection method is undoubtedly the most distorting because the Internet users are identified: thus it underestimates the users of games, victims of moral disapproval who often take refuge in illegal activities. An Internet user, according to the CNNIC is a Chinese citizen aged over six who uses the Internet at least one hour a week or (since the June 2007 survey) a Chinese citizen who has used the Internet in the past six months.</p>
