<p><italic>Agewise: Fighting the New Ageism in America</italic> by Brandeis University-based age critic Margaret Morganroth Gullette takes on the ubiquitous decline narrative of ageing, inviting us to shift our perspective to a view of the whole life course and its sanctity. Through the lens of a redefined progress theory, Gullette makes a case for the profound value of one’s own life. To the observer, life may appear to be rendered fragile through the infirmities of old age but, it is nevertheless our own, and only life. By opening the definition of progress to notions of a continuum, and contextualizing decline as a human invention, she expands the boundaries of counter gerontology discourse. Gullette moves on to deconstruct the current ‘successful ageing’ narrative, a story that places peppy, silver-haired, athletic people as the new poster images of ageing. She replaces it with a story that reconnects with humanity’s heritage and the whole spectrum of ageing.</p>
<p><italic>Agewise</italic>, though set in the USA, could be anywhere in the western First World where hate speech like ‘greedy geezers’ and ‘sexless old bag’ are thrown out thoughtlessly, and rationing of healthcare to third agers is becoming a fact of life. She compares the ‘burgeoning army of the old’ rhetoric to the moral panic surrounding HIV and AIDS in the 1980s, an apt analogy. First and foremost, Gullette is a scholar, and her ability to weave together a work that ranges from literary analysis to studies on cosmetic surgery resisters, is seamless and in-depth.</p>
<p>Gullette’s rich and wide-ranging text starts with the oft-repeated but false myth of the noble Eskimo who voluntarily is set adrift on an ice flow because life is no longer of consequence or value. She recounts the Hurricane Katrina disaster as emblematic of contemporary ageism but one that is all too real for those ageing New Orleans natives who were shuffled to the bottom rung of priorities during and after the rescue efforts. By addressing western culture’s attributed value to old age in the opening chapters of the book, Gullette brings together some of the core undercurrent of prevailing discourse – old people should uncomplainingly fade away (the Eskimo myth) and if they are in the way, they should be ignored (Hurricane Katrina).</p>
<p>Composed in three parts, each section builds on the next with a strong theme of respect for the whole of the human life course and, how the current discourse is eroding our understanding of life from beginning to end. That said, there is a counter-current throughout the book that describes resistance, understanding and a valuing of life. Bio-medicalization, sexuality and caregiving receive surprisingly fresh analyses. Her sections on memory or, forgetfulness and dementia are the most striking, since this is where the steady drip, drip of toxic ageism applies it most effective grip and is internalized. The lost word is named a ‘senior moment’ when 10 years earlier it would have been just been a forgotten word. We are constantly looking over our shoulder for signs of ageing, and this is coming at a younger and younger age. Gullette names it ‘ageing past youth’. This is at the core of her thesis which employs an interdisciplinary approach to the problem. Her turn from mind, as the producer of memory, to the holder of a myriad range of qualities from ethical reasoning and emotional intelligence to judgement and intuition, reminds us that we are whole people rather than a symptom cluster waiting to pounce as we age. The book brings forward the insidiousness of the current old age story and the connection with capitalism’s dead-eyed focus on creating desire, need and a problem saturated narrative of ageing bodies in order to sell us youth and image. ‘Uglification’ is what Gullette rightly names it. <italic>Agewise</italic> exposes the democratic way that ageism in its many guises affects both men and women. As we take on board these messages, we distance ourselves from those older people around us creating an ‘other’. This is, of course, not new think, but as Gullette tells the story, there is new dimensionality to its reading. At the same time as Gullette describes ‘other’, she has the uncanny ability to invite the reader to step close to the ageing bodies and souls and, then, reminds us that we cannot slide into another’s life course; can never wrap ourselves in their experience of ageing. It is this insight and her keen ability to turn a phrase that makes <italic>Agewise</italic> both excellent scholarship and a deeply readable and provoking book. Over and over again, Margaret Gullette reminds us of our intrinsic value as human beings proceeding on our life courses and each time the reader encounters this, it feels like a deepening revelation.</p>
<p>The book is not without its problems. At times, her narrative tips too close to dualistic thinking as she makes her case for a progression story of age. Her analysis of some events may be a bit skewed to fit her thesis but all is forgiven as the book as a whole presents new ways of thinking about the latest onslaught of ageist discourse that is, perhaps, only just heating up.</p>
