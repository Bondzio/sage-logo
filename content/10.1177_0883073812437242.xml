<abstract>
<p>Pitt-Hopkins syndrome is characterized by marked intellectual impairment, hyperventilation episodes, and dysmorphic facial features. This article reports a boy who presented with developmental delay, facial dysmorphism, microcephaly, hypotonia, and areflexia. He was initially diagnosed with Charcot Marie Tooth disease type 1A based on family history and genetic testing. However, severe mental impairment was atypical of Charcot Marie Tooth disease type 1A. Over the next few years he developed characteristic breathing abnormality, hand stereotypies, seizures, and marked constipation. The evolution of these manifestations coupled with the characteristic facial appearance suggested the additional diagnosis of Pitt-Hopkins syndrome, which was confirmed by the genetic defect of the transcription factor 4 on chromosome 18. This case demonstrates the rare co-occurrence of 2 genetic disorders in the same individual.</p>

<p>In this report we present the rare co-occurrence of 2 autosomal dominant disorders (Pitt-Hopkins syndrome and Charcot Marie Tooth disease type 1A) in the same child and how the evolution of the clinical phenotype of Pitt-Hopkins syndrome led to the final diagnosis.</p>

<title>Case Report</title>
<p>A 20-month-old boy was seen in the pediatric neurology clinic for developmental delay. He was the second-born child of nonconsanguineous white parents. He was born at term without any complications. His birth weight was 2.7 kg but head circumference was unknown. He had marked delay in all sectors of development including gross and fine motor skills, language, and cognition and was functioning at the level of 6 to 7 months when we saw him first at 20 months of age. There was no regression of developmental milestones. There was a strong family history for Charcot Marie Tooth disease in the father, paternal grandmother; 2 of 4 paternal uncles and 1 paternal cousin also had Charcot Marie Tooth disease. There was no history of developmental delay or seizures in the family. Genetic testing confirmed duplication of the peripheral myelin protein-22 gene, thus establishing the diagnosis of Charcot Marie Tooth disease type 1A. However, the diagnosis of Charcot Marie Tooth disease did not explain the patient’s global developmental delay. He was also noted to have microcephaly and dysmorphic features. We initiated further workup to determine the cause of developmental delay. He had normal blood counts, blood chemistry, lactate, amino acids, and urine organic acids. Genetic testing at that time included chromosomal analysis (46, XY), subtelomeric fluorescent in situ hybridization, and fragile X DNA test, lysosomal enzyme panel, chromosomal microarray, and methylation studies for Angelman and Prader-Willi syndromes, as well as Angelman UBE3A sequence analysis, which were all unrevealing. Over the next couple of years the patient slowly acquired some gross and fine motor skills (although significantly delayed) but his language lagged far behind. He developed prominent stereotyped movements in the form of hand clapping and flapping. This was followed by the development of hyperventilation episodes lasting from a few seconds to a minute, which were provoked by excitement. At age 6, during 2 such prolonged hyperventilation episodes, he developed generalized tonic–clonic seizures. Functionally he was able to ambulate short distances with a walker and self-feed with some assistance. He could only say “mom” and “dad” without other intelligible speech. Review of the systems was positive for significant constipation requiring daily laxative. </p>
<p>Examination revealed microcephaly (&lt;3rd centile), short stature (height &lt;5th centile), and weight around 15th centile. Facial dysmorphic features included broad nasal tip, wide mouth, full cheeks, cherry red lips, high arched palate, and widely spaced teeth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0883073812437242">Figure 1</xref>). He had a transverse right palmar crease, bilateral fifth finger clinodactyly, and second to third toe syndactyly without any polydactyly. There was bilateral pes cavus and palpable and thickened ulnar and common peroneal nerves. On neurological examination, he was a happy child. His cranial nerves were normal without any nystagmus. On motor examination, distal legs were slightly atrophic. He was hypotonic with hyperextensible joints especially at the knees and ankles. He moved all extremities symmetrically with good antigravity strength. He had generalized areflexia with flexor plantar response. Sensory and cerebellar examinations were normal.</p>

<p>Electroencephalography showed generalized spike and wave discharges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0883073812437242">Figure 2</xref>). The constellation of global developmental delay without regression, marked language impairment, microcephaly, dysmorphic features, prominent stereotypies, episodic hyperventilation, and prior negative workup led us to consider the possibility of Pitt-Hopkins syndrome. Transcription factor 4 sequence analysis on chromosome 18 showed a heterozygous mutation on exon 18 confirming the diagnosis of Pitt-Hopkins syndrome. Review of the patient’s brain magnetic resonance image (MRI) showed features that were consistent with previous reports of Pitt-Hopkins syndrome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0883073812437242">Figure 3</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The diagnosis of our case was perplexing because of confounding factors. There was a strong family history of Charcot Marie Tooth disease, and the child had significant motor delay, hypotonia, pes cavus, and areflexia; genetic studies confirmed a diagnosis of Charcot Marie Tooth disease type 1A. There are reports of various types of Charcot Marie Tooth disease with brain involvement, such as Charcot Marie Tooth disease type 2 with mitofusin 2 mutations, Charcot Marie Tooth disease X, Charcot Marie Tooth disease 4D, and hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0883073812437242">7</xref></sup> Patients with early-onset Charcot Marie Tooth disease with mitofusin 2 have a higher frequency of both gray and white matter involvement, whereas the brain lesions in Charcot Marie Tooth disease X, Charcot Marie Tooth disease 4D, and hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsy patients are confined to the white matter.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0883073812437242">7</xref></sup> However, clinically significant language or cognitive impairment has not been reported in those cases. There are no reports of radiological or clinical central nervous involvement in patients with Charcot Marie Tooth disease type 1A.</p>
<p>In medicine, clinicians always try to fit the different clinical manifestations into a unifying diagnosis. Clearly, this was not possible in our case despite the genetic confirmation of Charcot Marie Tooth disease type 1A. We searched for other genetic and metabolic causes for global development delay, but our search was inconclusive until recently. Over the course of time it became clear that the patient’s language skills were affected out of proportion to his motor skills; he developed significant hand stereotypies followed by spells of hyperventilation and generalized tonic–clonic seizures. The evolution of the above clinical features coupled with dysmorphic features led us to consider the diagnosis of Pitt-Hopkins syndrome, confirmed later by specific genetic test.</p>
<p>The facial hallmarks of Pitt-Hopkins syndrome are bitemporal narrowing, squared forehead, deep-set eyes, upslanting palpebral fissures, arched eyebrows, broad nasal bridge with pointed tip and flaring of nostrils, short philtrum, wide mouth with a tented upper lip, a full lower lip with a thick vermilion border, and widely spaced teeth. Other facial characteristics include full cheeks, a protruding lower jaw, high arched palate, and cup-shaped ears with a thick helix.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0883073812437242">8</xref></sup> The typical facial features as described above may not be obvious early in life but become more apparent as the child grows, as noted in our case. In addition, a majority have microcephaly and short stature, also noted in our patient. Patients with Pitt-Hopkins syndrome have tapering fingers, clinodactyly, fetal pads, and sometimes single palmar creases and absence of flexion creases of fingers, particularly of thumbs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0883073812437242">8</xref></sup> Many of these features were present in our patient.</p>
<p>These patients have severe psychomotor delay and language impairment sometimes to the extent of absent speech. Marangi et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0883073812437242">8</xref></sup> described the behavior of their patients as quiet with happy predisposition, as seen in our patient too. Epileptic seizures occur frequently and can be severe; electroencephalographic pattern is often characterized by frontal slow and sharp wave discharges.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0883073812437242">9</xref></sup> Our patient had generalized tonic–clonic seizures, and electroencephalopathy showed generalized sharp and slow wave discharges. His seizures were well controlled with valproate. Marangi et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0883073812437242">8</xref></sup> noted subtle neurological abnormalities on brain MRI in 79% of their patients, consisting mainly of hypoplastic corpus callosum, enlarged ventricles, and thin hindbrain. Other MRI features described with this syndrome are bulging caudate nuclei and small hippocampus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0883073812437242">3</xref></sup> Our patient had hypoplastic corpus callosum, mildly dilated ventricles, and bulging caudate nuclei.</p>
<p>This syndrome is characterized by a particular breathing pattern that appears in midchildhood and manifests as paroxysms of hyperpnea followed by apnea and occasionally cyanosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0883073812437242">3</xref></sup> Similar breathing abnormality has been noted in Rett syndrome (a pattern that usually abates during the second decade of life but persists in Pitt-Hopkins syndrome); Joubert syndrome (usually manifesting during infancy and associated with ataxia and extraocular movement abnormalities like nystagmus and oculomotor apraxia); and Ondine curse, Haddad syndrome, or congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (characterized solely by hypoventilation, unlike Pitt-Hopkins syndrome, which has characteristic hyperventilation sometimes followed by apnea).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0883073812437242">3</xref></sup> Stereotypies are frequent, mainly involving hands and mouth, and consist of bruxism, hand flapping, clapping, biting, fist beating on the opposite palm, and repeated hand–mouth movements, which are noted in about 86% of patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0883073812437242">8</xref></sup> Immotivate laughing episodes, or hand-wringing stereotypies, as observed in Angelman and Rett syndrome, respectively, are uncommon in this condition.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0883073812437242">8</xref></sup> Our patient had hand stereotypies noticed in the form of clapping and flapping.</p>
<p>Motor incoordination, varying from severe ataxia to unstable broad-based gait or difficulties in self-feeding due to incoordination of hand–mouth movements, is very common in this disorder. This could explain some of the motor disabilities in our patient.</p>
<p>The most common extraneurological manifestation of Pitt-Hopkins syndrome is constipation, which may be significant and require medications, as noted in our patient. These patients can have ocular abnormalities in the form of strabismus, myopia, and astigmatism.</p>
<p>Angelman syndrome appears to have the highest degree of overlap with Pitt-Hopkins syndrome, and Takano et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0883073812437242">10</xref></sup> recently found transcription factor 4 mutation in 2 of 86 patients suspected of having Angelman syndrome. In our patient, Angelman syndrome was strongly considered in the initial differential but was ruled out by genetic test.</p>
<p>Before 2007, only a few cases of Pitt-Hopkins syndrome had been reported. Following the identification of the causative gene, many new cases have been reported. The different mutations reported in those patients include large chromosome deletion encompassing the whole transcription factor 4 gene, partial gene deletion, point mutation of exons 2 through 19, frameshift mutation (including premature stop codon), splice site mutation, missense mutation, and balanced translocation. Our patient had mutation in exon 18 of transcription factor 4 gene, which is one of the mutations commonly described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0883073812437242">8</xref></sup> Transcription factor 4 is expressed in several tissues during human development, particularly in the central nervous system involving telencephalon, diencephalon, or cerebellum. Extraneurally, this gene is expressed in the peribronchial and kidney mesenchyme. It is also expressed in the limb and genetic buds, the splanchopleural mesenchyme, and the sympathetic, parasympathetic, and enteric ganglia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0883073812437242">11</xref></sup> Tissue specificity of the transcription factor 4 gene expression and its interaction with other basic helix-loop-helix proteins may explain the characteristic clinical manifestations of this disease, like typical dysmorphism, incoordination, constipation, and breathing abnormalities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0883073812437242">8</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>There is no specific therapy for Pitt-Hopkins syndrome. Physical and occupational therapy are helpful for motor incoordination and ataxia. Speech therapy and communication devices may help in communication with the caregivers. Symptomatic treatment for epilepsy and constipation is recommended. Our patient receives physical, occupational, and speech therapies, and his seizures and constipation are well controlled with medications.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Pitt Hopkins syndrome is a syndromic cause of severe intellectual impairment. This syndrome should be considered in a child presenting with global developmental delay, motor incoordination, breathing abnormalities (hyperpnea followed by apnea), stereotypies of the hand and face, and seizures with distinct facial dysmorphic features. However, it should be borne in mind that not all of the manifestations in this disease appear simultaneously; rather, they usually evolve over time. Our patient has the rare co-occurrence of 2 genetic disorders (Pitt-Hopkins syndrome and Charcot Marie Tooth disease type 1A), which has not been previously reported and highlights the challenges we faced in making the final diagnosis as the phenotype evolved over time.</p>
