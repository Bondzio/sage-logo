<abstract>
<p>This study reports on the pedagogic rationale, didactic design and implications of an AHRC-funded doctoral training scheme in collaborative and digital multimedia in the humanities. In the second part of this article we discuss three areas of provision that were identified as particularly significant and/or controversial. These include (1) desktop publishing and information design for academic posters, (2) quantitative, corpus-based approaches to text analysis, and (3) a discussion of the affordances and constraints of ‘collaborative’ Web 2.0 based research as reflected by participants and relevant theory.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1474022211428897"><title>1. Introduction: background and rationale</title>
<p><sc>on 26 january</sc> 2008, Richard E. Miller, Chair of English at Rutgers University, posted a video clip on <italic>YouTube</italic>, entitled ‘The Future Is Now’. It emphasizes the importance of digital humanities in a ‘read/write world’ and shows how creative writing students at Rutgers collaborate on digital multimedia artefacts in a ‘collaboratory’, a learning and teaching space equipped with an interactive whiteboard and PCs on all writing desks. The desks themselves provide spaces for small groups of writers to co-create and discuss their multimedia compositions, whilst the interactive whiteboard allows students to enact cooperative creative writing by drag &amp; drop, point &amp; click and other touchscreen operations.</p>
<p>One of the main rationales behind such digital collaborative study spaces is to prepare students in the humanities, which employ scholars that typically though not exclusively engage in solitary research, for the ‘read/write world’ we live in today. This read/write world is characterized by ‘the wisdom of crowds’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1474022211428897">Surowiecki, 2005</xref>), the ‘wikification of knowledge’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1474022211428897">Dvorak, 2005</xref>) and a number of ground-breaking changes in the communicative uses of digital media: a shift from publishing to participation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1474022211428897">O’Reilly, 2005</xref>) and from a largely extractive type of interactivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1474022211428897">Lunenfeld, 1993</xref>) to ‘registrational interactivity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1474022211428897">Lister et al., 2009</xref>: 23), in other words ‘writing back’ by generating, linking, evaluating and sharing of individual knowledge and expertise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1474022211428897">Warschauer and Grimes, 2007</xref>). This happens by means of a combination of Web 2.0 applications and off-line software for creating and editing multimodal information. After all, ‘to compose successfully in the 21st century you have to not only excel at verbal expression and written expression, but you also have to excel in the use and manipulation of [still and moving] images’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1474022211428897">Miller, 2008</xref>). This is not to say that words no longer matter, but rather that what is traditionally thought of as writing has fundamentally changed. The nature of composition is much more complex and includes multimedia elements. It involves, on the one hand, industry-standard desktop publishing (DTP), animation and podcasting software, but also, equally importantly, software that facilitates and expands the possibilities of conventional text analysis, by adding both multimodal and quantitative analytical mechanisms.</p>
<p>The final point made by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1474022211428897">Miller (2008)</xref> is that creativity is the defining element of twenty-first-century humanities, and the essential contribution made by academia to the read/write world is ‘sustained study and deep understanding’. Thus, collaborative digital multimedia has to be seen as a seminal component of contemporary academic training in the humanities, which are at a risk of falling behind other sciences unless they too learn to utilize new media technologies to facilitate and enhance existing research methods.</p>
<p>This article reports on the implications of a project that was inspired by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1474022211428897">Miller’s (2008)</xref> address. ‘CEDAR’ (an acronym adapted from ‘Collaborative Digital Research in the Humanities’) was a 24-month doctoral training scheme in digital and collaborative multimedia in the humanities, funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC, ref. no. S/08/06) and run collaboratively by the Universities of Bangor and Aberystwyth (Wales) from October 2008 to September 2010. The scheme highlights the importance of digital and collaborative multimedia in contemporary humanities research and was coordinated and implemented by experienced New Media instructors from various British and international institutions: Bangor, Aberystwyth and De Montfort University, The Oxford Internet Institute/Chemnitz University of Technology (D), University College London and Hedmark University College (NO). The training sessions were held at Bangor, Aberystwyth and De Montfort and co-taught by the program leaders (Ensslin and Slocombe) and various New Media scholars from the above partner institutions.</p>
<p>First and foremost, the CEDAR scheme aimed to develop a core web-based resource offering a wide range of digital humanities research tools and methods, and to establish a vital training network for humanities doctoral students, whose engagement with innovative digital technology has ‘enormous potential to transform research practices and research outcomes’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1474022211428897">Anderson, 2007</xref>: 7; see also the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1474022211428897">British Academy (2009)</xref> panel discussion, ‘Are Today’s Researchers Equipped for the Digital Future?’). The scheme had three main objectives: (1) to further the understanding and expertise of doctoral students in the humanities in the use of hypermedia and other digital humanities research tools; (2) to bring together humanities doctoral students in a way that will ensure current and future peer-led development in this area; and (3) to offer examples of good practice and innovation in the use of new technologies in the humanities. In so doing, the project sought to establish and consolidate doctoral student interest and engagement with digital multimedia technologies, providing a resource for current and future humanities doctoral researchers. The scheme further aimed to explore the diversity of multimedia usage and its potential, to offer platform-specific training, to create a peer-led doctoral network that can service the future needs of UK doctoral students entering the global humanities community, and to provide a resource in the form of training models that will be available beyond the period of the project. The long-term objectives include continued collaboration and information exchange between project team members, who will be able to use the outcomes of the project to inform future doctoral training at their own institutions and at a national level.</p>
<p>In what follows, we shall first outline the didactic methodology and syllabus underlying the CEDAR training scheme. Following a critically reflective pedagogy, feedback questionnaires were integrated at the end of each training session, the results of which informed the planning of the following sessions. Section 3 then provides a brief overview of student responses. Finally, Section 4 highlights three focal areas of provision identified by students and instructors and discusses some of their methodological and philosophical implications for arts and humanities research. Importantly, the insights delivered by this report are based on a small sample of learners and can therefore only be of an illuminative rather than exemplary or representative nature.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1474022211428897"><title>2. Methodology and syllabus</title>
<p>The CEDAR syllabus was composed with a broad view of arts and humanities research in mind. Today’s humanities scholars use a range of research methods spanning from archival and text analytical through ethnographic to corpus-based and statistical approaches. In order to meet the diversity of specializations and the resulting needs that were to be expected from the CEDAR applicants, a wide range of tools and teaching methods were selected. Furthermore, the multimedia-enhanced <italic>presentation</italic> of research, which was to exceed the somewhat restrictive boundaries of MS PowerPoint and Publisher, was considered to form an important component of the syllabus.</p>
<p>In the first instance, a Drupal-based collaborative website was created (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cedar.bangor.ac.uk">http://cedar.bangor.ac.uk</ext-link>), which allows registered users access to information and documents covered in the course of the project, and to post comments and materials themselves. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1474022211428897">Figure 1</xref> shows a selection of resource tags created by participants and displayed in the form of a glossary. Since the beginning of the project, this site has constantly been monitored and administered by a Bangor-based doctoral student and the project leaders.
<fig id="fig1-1474022211428897" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Screenshot from the CEDAR website listing a number of resource tags created by participants. The menu on the left gives users access to the details of each training session.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1474022211428897-fig1.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The training sessions were co-taught by a number of digital media scholars. Methodologically, they combined theoretical introductions with hands-on IT workshops. Student feedback given after the first session suggested that more time than originally scheduled was needed for discussion and reflection, mostly to enable participants to articulate and explore how the tools and materials taught might be applicable to their own research. Therefore, individual teaching units in the ensuing sessions were interspersed with student discussions, thus allowing participants to appropriate the material and to contextualize it with their own backgrounds. The timetable for all six training sessions is presented below.</p>

<p>To give participants an opportunity to showcase their own personalized uses of the digital tools taught on the CEDAR program and beyond, a final doctoral symposium was held in September 2010. It featured a keynote lecture by Claire Warwick, Reader in Digital Humanities at University College London, which outlined her view of the present and future of digital humanities. In their presentations, participants discussed the benefits and drawbacks of using specific digital tools in their research, such as Google Sites for a project on Arthurian literature, academic blogging for audience research in adaptation studies, Xara Xtreme for creating posters in corpus linguistics, and using the virtual world of <italic>Second Life</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1474022211428897">Linden Research, 2003</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1474022211428897">2011</xref>) for academic conferences.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec21-1474022211428897"><title>3. Student responses</title>
<p>The CEDAR participants came from as wide a range of subject areas as corpus linguistics, discourse analysis, bilingualism, cultural studies, English literature, American and French studies, philosophy, games studies, adaptation studies, film production and creative writing. Their previous knowledge and skills differed widely – from basic word processing and browsing to elaborate multimedia production and web design skills<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1474022211428897">1</xref></sup>. These discrepancies created a ‘digital (skills) divide’ for the training scheme which, coupled with the above-mentioned diversity of humanities subject areas and their accompanying research methods, posed specific challenges to the training team. As a result, the training materials and methods had to be fine-tuned to students’ individual needs, which turned out to be feasible due to relatively small class sizes (fewer than ten students). Similarly, the CEDAR curriculum was designed so as to allow for sufficient didactic flexibility in order to accommodate a large variety of previous exposure, technicity levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1474022211428897">Dovey and Kennedy, 2006</xref>: 16–17) and research trajectories.</p>
<p>Participant feedback on the tools taught and teaching methods was recorded by means of a short questionnaire after Sessions 1, 2 and 3, with a view to informing the design and execution of future provision. The feedback questionnaire contained questions about learning outcomes, appropriateness of teaching methods, and the areas of expertise and skills the postgraduate students wished or needed to be covered in remaining sessions. Without exception, either ‘rather high’ or ‘very high’ learning outcomes were noted by participants following Sessions 1 and 2, whereas the responses to Session 3 were considerably more mixed, perhaps because what had been announced as a training session on the De Montfort Creativity Assistant (‘CA’) turned out to be a research project conducted by the CA team to test the software on the participants, which some respondents did not find relevant to their own needs. In retrospect, more emphasis could have been placed on discussions of different notions and ramifications of creativity, why creative processes are important for the development of ideas, how such processes operate, and whether and how they might be translated into the logic of computer software.</p>
<p>Positive comments made to support the self-evaluated learning outcomes after each session included:
<disp-quote>
<p>‘I’ve been introduced to tools I will try to use in the future, and formed connection with other people working with digital humanities’. (P5, Session 1)</p>
<p>‘I particularly enjoyed working with Xara Software but Pliny also useful. Great to network with other PGs’. (P2, Session 1)</p>
<p>‘particularly interesting to get insight into wikis and online information’. (P2, Session 2)</p>
<p>‘I found the session on blogging and the section on Google Docs, Google Sites and Zoho Show very interesting and the concepts and practical tools that I have taken from these sessions I can see becoming used on a daily basis, therefore changing the way that I work on a fundamental level’. (P8, Session 3)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>‘Px’ refers to individual participants. Participants seem to have benefited particularly from the networking aspects of the project, from exploring and appropriating online and offline applications they had not been familiar with previously yet which they found suitable to their needs, and from the enjoyable experience of working with such user-friendly tools as Xara and Google applications.</p>
<p>Participants’ negative and constructive feedback was directed mainly at needing more time and practice to familiarize themselves with individual tools (such as Xara), at the controversies surrounding online collaboration, and the need for more discussion, personalization and appropriation. On the one hand, these issues point to the difficulty of pitching the material and level of detail at a diverse range of needs and preferences. Some participants seemed eager to learn ‘from scratch’ such seemingly straightforward phenomena as document sharing via Google Docs or blogging, and demanded step-by-step user guides for deep learning. Others, however, felt overwhelmed by the apparent density and plethora of information, as well as the insecurities around cybercrime and intellectual property. There were also discrepancies in participants’ ability and willingness to think creatively with respect to personalized software usage.</p>
<p>Another crucial point that was raised concerned the controversial nature of collaboration in academia and beyond, and some participants would have liked to see a more extensive debate about the downsides of working with peers online, and the risks involved in negotiating and sharing intellectual property. Section 4.3, below, will go into more theoretical detail about this issue.</p>
<p>The question about the appropriateness of the teaching methods elicited many positive comments about what they perceived to be an effective combination of theoretical and practical methods, the possibility of exploring software tools in hands-on sessions, the time dedicated to debate and discussion, the friendly environment and engaging software tools. More specifically, they highlighted the effective ways in which corpora were taught as a quantitative and qualitative research tool within and beyond linguistics.</p>
<p>Critical comments were again directed at an initial lack of time for discussion and debate, with one student requesting a greater focus on creativity and literacy (Session 3), and the technological insufficiencies encountered in one of the learning venues, where the broadband connection did not work appropriately. Not all participants felt comfortable with the idea of blogging publicly about their research and raised concerns relating to intellectual property and mutual trust between researchers.</p>
<p>The feedback questionnaire allowed students to list skills and areas of theoretical knowledge that, in their opinion, should be covered in more or less detail in future. A number of areas were raised more often than others: once again, the need to apply the tools learnt to specialist research areas<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1474022211428897">2</xref></sup>, the need for more theoretical underpinnings, and more time to look at individual software applications such as Xara Xtreme, Google Docs and Google Sites. With this in mind, the three sessions conducted in the second CEDAR year (October 2009–September 2010) repeated the Xara and Google introductions with more time given for participant exploration and learning, and more theoretical engagement was integrated through instruction and discussion.</p>
<p>Answers to the final, ‘any further comments’, question reinforced the previous comments and general enthusiasm. Interestingly, the Creativity Assistant was singled out as a thought-provoking technology. However, not every student agreed with the underlying concept, which seems to presuppose automated and quasi-universal thought and inspiration processes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec22-1474022211428897"><title>4 Focal areas of provision</title>
<p>We now go on to discuss three focal areas of provision highlighted by participants as either particularly innovative and useful (Xara desktop publishing and information design for academic posters and corpus tools for text analysis) or found to be particularly controversial (digital collaboration).</p>
<sec id="sec23-1474022211428897"><title>4.1 Desktop publishing and information design for academic posters</title>
<p>The poster as a form of academic presentation at conferences has not (yet) taken hold across all humanities. Embraced and endorsed as it is by scientific disciplines, at the time of writing it has been adopted mostly by humanities disciplines that consider themselves at least to some degree as <italic>social</italic> sciences – for instance, linguistics and media studies. Humanities which favour archival and philological methods of research and analysis still show a clear tendency towards full-length, one-to-many papers as an exclusive style of presentation at conferences, rather than short and summative, one-to-few poster presentations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1474022211428897">D’Angelo, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1474022211428897">Hyland, 2000</xref>). Even the Graduate Junction Poster Competition (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.graduatejunction.net/posters">http://www.graduatejunction.net/posters</ext-link>), which attracts similar numbers of entries in science, social sciences and arts and humanities, has existed for only two years.</p>
<p>Hence, it does not come as a surprise that, although some CEDAR participants work in areas akin to social sciences (such as corpus linguistics), none of them were familiar with designing, creating and presenting posters as a form of condensed delivery of research material, despite its advantages: small groups of interested viewers–readers–listeners are likely to follow up with extended dialogue and feedback which tend to be considerably more detailed, profound and reflective than can be achieved in the mostly short and often generalistic question-and-answer sessions following full-paper presentations.</p>
<p>As academic posters – much like their cognates in advertising – have to be both eye-catching and reasonably straightforward to grasp within a short period of time, they have to display a well-balanced mixture of images and text, whereby the latter should be kept to a minimum and designed for quick reading and understanding. Successful poster designs therefore tend to depict processes, sequences and constellations of various types by means of graphs, tables, screenshots and other illustrative means. Similarly, text is usually displayed in concise paragraphs or bullet point lists, and bibliographies tend to be either brief, if displayed on the poster itself, or comprehensive, if printed on a separate A4 handout for those attending to take home.</p>
<p>Clearly, it is a skill to reduce a complex topic to only one page – albeit of poster size – of clearly structured information, the essence of which will need to be comprehended by viewers in considerably less time than in the case of a multi-page essay-type document. That said, PhD students often struggle with precisely that exercise: their background reading tends to be comprehensive, and the sheer multitude of ideas they tend to think about often detracts from their ability to distil and present the actual core of their research.</p>
<p>Admittedly, condensing a whole PhD thesis and/or research monograph into one poster is not normally what presenters at conferences are asked to do. They are rather more likely to submit an abstract covering one aspect or chapter of their work, which is evidently more straightforward to sketch out on a poster-size document. For this reason, CEDAR participants were asked to bring both written and graphical materials in digital form with them to Session 1, and during the three-hour introduction to the vector-graphics-based desktop publishing program Xara Xtreme (‘Xara’), they had an opportunity to design and start compiling posters displaying aspects of their individual research projects.</p>
<p>Following a short exemplary poster session, in which participants viewed and discussed two successfully presented humanities posters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1474022211428897">Ensslin, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1474022211428897">Ensslin and Muse, 2009</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1474022211428897">3</xref></sup>, they were introduced to poster design techniques and the software itself. They were then taught how to work with shapes, lines, colours, text and special effects, and how to insert and edit their own materials. Afterwards, they spent the remaining hour working on their own, with regular instructor feedback.</p>
<p>It became clear that, whilst most participants took to the software with great enthusiasm and ease, some found it more difficult to learn the basics. Consequently, the progress made by individual participants during the training session differed somewhat, and some of them requested follow-on sessions to revise and practise the tools and methods. For this reason, a revision strand was subsequently built in to give both new and existing participants an opportunity to learn Xara (again) from scratch. Another lesson we learnt was that provision needs to be in place for those less familiar with DTP principles more generally, which may be granted by a longer exercise and practice period, and a team of at least two instructors.</p>

<sec id="sec24-1474022211428897"><title>4.2 Online corpus software for conceptual and statistically informed text analysis</title>
<p>Corpus approaches to text analysis have become increasingly popular in scientifically oriented humanities over the past ten years, and scholars in a number of – mostly linguistic – disciplines such as stylistics, syntax, morphology, pragmatics, phonology, sociolinguistics, discourse analysis, language acquisition and historical linguistics have increasingly made use of a combination of quantitative and qualitative analytical methods with a view to painting a more representative and statistically significant picture of language use than was previously achievable (for a comprehensive overview, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1474022211428897">Lüdeling and Kytö (2009)</xref>). More recently, scholars from other humanities disciplines such as historiography and performance, cultural and media studies have started using corpus approaches and are now developing sophisticated methodologies, software and tagsets to be used in, for example, multimodal interaction analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1474022211428897">Carter and Adolphs, 2008</xref>) and musicology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1474022211428897">IMEMS, 2011</xref>). By the same token, corpus analytical tools such as WordSmith Tools, MonoConc, COSMAS and ParaConc have come into wide usage yet often require substantial training for novices. They offer facilities such as concordancing, keyword and frequency lists, as well as sophisticated annotation, search and statistical mechanisms to find out linguistic patterns (e.g. collocations) and predominant as well as under-represented stylistic and grammatical features in any chosen number of digitized text documents.</p>
<p>To facilitate the process of induction to the most straightforward corpus analytical processes, CEDAR students first received a theoretical introduction to the purposes, methods and tools of corpus linguistics. To make it relevant to their diverse backgrounds, a range of examples were discussed which pointed to the increasing significance of corpus approaches across humanities. This was followed by a discussion in which participants were given the opportunity to reflect on ways in which corpora might come in useful for their own research. Finally, an extended period of hands-on practice allowed students to explore the online corpus tools W-Matrix and Wordle.</p>
<p>Unlike most run-of-the-mill corpus tools, W-Matrix – developed by Paul Rayson from Lancaster University – has a Web interface. It offers standard corpus analytical tools such as annotation facilities, concordances and frequency lists. Participants were given an example, in which the instructor ran comparative frequency counts over ‘Genesis 1’ and Milton’s <italic>Paradise Lost</italic>, which then produced lists of lexical items most frequently occurring in these texts. This triggered a lively discussion about Milton’s focal thematic areas as opposed to those foregrounded in the Old Testament. Without previously reading the texts, students were thus allowed to investigate their lexico-semantic emphases and even to suggest gender-theoretical approaches arising exclusively from word counts.</p>
<p>Of particular interest to the creative writers on the program was an introduction to Wordle, an even simpler free online corpus tool, which displays words in aesthetically pleasing clouds according to relative frequencies. Users can choose between a range of cloud designs and visualize aboutness in innovative and aesthetic ways. One creative writing student on the program was somewhat taken aback when she ran Wordle over her PhD research blog, which drew her attention to the themes and issues that this document was – statistically speaking – most concerned with, namely ‘I’, ‘You’, ‘PhD’, ‘Commentaries’ and ‘Digital Fiction’. She has meanwhile embedded a similar tag cloud in her blog.</p>

<sec id="sec25-1474022211428897"><title>4.3 Critical engagement with digital collaboration</title>
<p>Students showed considerable interest in and concern about the strengths and weaknesses of digital collaboration. Time for reflective exercises – discussions of the controversial nature of collaborative research online and offline, and indeed the strengths and weaknesses of collaboration more generally – was therefore increasingly integrated into the training sessions. Students were asked to read a number of publications on collaboration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1474022211428897">Elliott, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1474022211428897">Four Groups Blog, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1474022211428897">Schneider, 2007</xref>), which would give them some background concepts to begin with and further develop. Florian <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1474022211428897">Schneider (2007)</xref>, for example, mentions the often ‘unsystematic mode of collective learning processes’ and the fact that, despite being commonly recognized as a seminal way of knowledge generation, ‘there is very little research and theoretical reflection on [collaboration]’. Schneider compares and contrasts the concepts of collaboration and cooperation, and dates their origins in an educational context back to the 1970s, which saw an emergent constructivist agenda featuring ‘joint learning activities’ and ‘project based learning’.</p>
<p>Schneider points to the weaknesses of collaboration, which include wrong decisions made by overly confident teams, as well as ‘hoarding’ and ‘stockpiling’, and highlights the creative nature of collaboration, which often occurs ‘in rather unpredictable and unexpected ways’. This is borne out by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1474022211428897">Four Groups Blog (2008)</xref>, where it is argued that large organizational mechanisms frequently inhibit collaborative mechanisms because, ‘more often than not, … . the organisation is not accustomed or prepared for these instances, [and] the potential benefits are lost in the organisational machine’. Schneider further argues that in autonomous learning environments, a collaborative classroom ‘flattens the hierarchies’ between teacher and learner and between star students and ‘scrapers-through’.</p>
<p>Mark <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1474022211428897">Elliott (2006)</xref> establishes a deliberate link between collaboration and Web 2.0 participatory culture. His paper on ‘stigmergic collaboration’ draws on Pierre-Paul Grassé’s 1950s exploration of self-organization processes in termite nests, which happen ‘due to the collective input of large numbers of individual termites performing extraordinarily simple actions in response to their local environment’. Grassé’s theory has been applied to processes occurring on the Internet, and Elliott defines stigmergy broadly as ‘a method of communication in which individuals communicate with one another by modifying their local environment’. Collaboration via stigmergy, according to Elliott, applies particularly to large groups of people (over 25 individuals). Smaller groups, on the other hand, benefit largely from social negotiation and creative output. In fact, Elliott suggests that ‘the ideal size for collaborating groups (where technology is not being used in any way) is 2–8’ (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1474022211428897">Lipnack and Stamps, 2000</xref>: 180–1) as face-to-face negotiation is possible here.</p>
<p>Collaboration in large groups depends on stigmergy because the complexities of interaction encourage contribution and co-authoring rather than social negotiation and mutual acquaintances. On the Web 2.0, the loci for stigmergic collaboration are encoded specifically to form a nexus for collaborative ventures. Wikis represent only one example of such connective environments for large groups of like-minded individuals. Bearing this in mind, it was indeed not surprising to see that the wiki created in Session 2 (see Section 2, above) for and by a comparably small group of diversely interested scholars did not come to be used independently by CEDAR participants beyond that training session.</p>
<p>As was reflected in some participants’ comments, the Web 2.0’s participatory culture cannot simply be taken for granted or embraced unreflectingly. Doctoral students deal with a considerable amount of delicate intellectual material. To most of them, the PhD forms their first comprehensive, book-length project, and unless they manage to publish chapters of their project in peer-reviewed publications prior to PhD submission, they are bound to feel exposed to scholarly piracy when sharing fledgling research ideas. Therefore, collaborative efforts and platforms need to be used cautiously in order to facilitate peer learning without simultaneously neglecting or jeopardizing intellectual rights to creative and academic property.</p>

<sec id="sec26-1474022211428897"><title>5. Concluding remarks</title>
<p>In our current Web 2.0 paradigm, collaborative and digital humanities research tools form an important element of postgraduate and, in particular, doctoral training. That said, the sheer diversity of humanities subject areas and research methods, coupled with a large ‘digital (skills) divide’, poses specific challenges to designers of doctoral training schemes. As a matter of fact, so-called ‘convergent’ technological processes, i.e. the general trend of hardware and software becoming increasingly similar in appearance and utility (for instance contemporary mobile phone technology), clash with the diversity of academic practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1474022211428897">Storsul and Stuedahl, 2007</xref>) and the resulting need for highly specialized research tools. By the same token, the increasing diversification of doctoral students’ cultural, personal and academic needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1474022211428897">Taylor and Beasley, 2005</xref>), even within humanities alone, requires a fine-tuned and flexible training syllabus that caters to the individual’s learning pace and offers space for critical debate and subject-specific appropriation. Indeed, postgraduate information, literacy levels and research needs within and beyond the humanities differ so widely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1474022211428897">CARET, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1474022211428897">Dingley, 2010</xref>) that an appropriate training scheme needs to offer a matching diversity of tiered training levels and educational content. Arguably, currently evolving mobile, customizable technologies such as smart phones and tablet computers might develop into sophisticated academic platforms that allow students to add applications from a vast library of tools and therefore build portals that are specific to them. So, increased effort was made in CEDAR to enable students to appropriate – in discussion and debate – the digital tools covered, so as to make them as relevant as possible to their individual research frameworks.</p>
<p>In conclusion, this report has sought to showcase how collaborative digital research tools and methods might be taught in as diversified a context as the humanities doctoral classroom and what kind of theoretical, logistic and ethical issues might have to be considered to make it a worthwhile experience for students.</p>
