<p>We study collaborative and noncollaborative projects that are supported by government grants. First, we propose a theoretical framework to analyze optimal decisions in these projects. Second, we test our hypotheses with a unique data set containing academic publications and research funds for all academics at the major university engineering departments in the United Kingdom. We find that the type of the project (measured by its level of appliedness) increases the type of both the university and firm partners. Also, the quality of the project (number and impact of the publications) increases with the quality of the researcher and firm, and with the affinity in the partners’ preferences. The collaboration with firms increases the quality of the project only when the firms’ characteristics make them valuable partners.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In the past three decades, universities have enlarged their entrepreneurial activity in many dimensions, including patenting and licensing, creating science parks, promoting university spin-offs, investing equity in start-ups, and collaborating with industry in research projects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0891242412472535">Mowery, Nelson, Sampat, &amp; Ziedonis, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0891242412472535">Siegel, 2006</xref>). The industry considers university–industry collaborative links through joint research, consulting, or training arrangements as important channels of knowledge transfer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0891242412472535">Cohen, Nelson, &amp; Walsh, 2002</xref>). As a result, research contracts and joint research agreements are widespread (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0891242412472535">d’Este &amp; Patel, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Collaborative projects have important benefits both for industry and academia. They give firms access to highly qualified scientists, and help them keep up-to-date with new ideas and to explore the applications of new scientific discoveries. Academics provide assistance with experimentation, access to the analytic skills of the university, or the use of equipment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0891242412472535">Veugelers &amp; Cassiman, 2005</xref>). Academic researchers may also benefit from the access to new questions and research funds. In addition, research partners can exploit economies of scale and scope in the generation of R&amp;D and benefit from the synergies related to the exchange of complementary know-how.</p>
<p>In terms of production of research output, however, collaboration with industry has ambiguous effects. On one hand, industry involvement might delay or suppress academic publication, endangering the intellectual commons and the practices of open science (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0891242412472535">Dasgupta &amp; David, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0891242412472535">Nelson, 2004</xref>). Industry collaboration might also skew the type of research projects toward more applied contents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0891242412472535">Florida &amp; Cohen, 1999</xref>). On the other hand, faculty participating in knowledge and technology transfer activities claim that industry collaboration improves research outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0891242412472535">Lee, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>This article studies the research output of university–industry research collaborations supported by government grants. We first provide a theoretical framework describing the process that leads to the outputs of collaborative and noncollaborative research projects. The process includes the negotiation of the type of project in which partners will work on, as well as the investment levels each partner devotes to the project. Our theoretical framework makes predictions on the characteristics of the outputs, such as type and quantity of publications, as a function of the characteristics of the partners, such as efficiency and preferences. We then test our model and measure empirically the impact of the characteristics of the partners on the outcome of each specific project.</p>
<p>In our theoretical framework, project outcomes are defined by type (degree of basicness or appliedness) and quality (quantity and impact of the publications). Typically, university researchers and laboratories prefer projects of a basic nature. Firms, in contrast, expect higher benefits from projects that can be more easily applied. In a noncollaborative project, the researcher makes decisions taking into account his or her preferences only. In collaborative projects, the partnership decides on a type of project taking into account the interests of both participants. Through the investment decisions, the characteristics of the partners affect the quality of the research output. Both partners boost their investment when they place more value on the output and when their technical and scientific levels are higher. Investment is also increased when their interests are more aligned.</p>
<p>We expect a noncollaborative project to focus on more basic ventures than a collaborative project. In fact, the type of collaborative project is a weighted average of the preferences of the project participants. The scientific level of the participants should not affect the type of project, but only its quality. The quality of collaborative projects is not necessarily greater than the quality of noncollaborative projects. On one hand, the quantity and impact of the output in collaborative projects should be higher because more partners invest. On the other hand, there are costs associated with the collaboration, in particular because university researchers and firm employees often have difficulties working together. Therefore, we expect the collaboration with firms to improve the final outcome when the firms’ characteristics make them valuable partners, while it might be detrimental otherwise.</p>
<p>To test our theoretical findings, we construct a data set containing academic research output (publications) and collaborative research funds for all academics employed at the major engineering departments in the United Kingdom. We concentrate on the engineering sector, as it has traditionally been associated with applied research and industry collaboration and it contributes substantially to industrial R&amp;D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0891242412472535">Cohen et al., 2002</xref>). We measure the research output of projects that receive funding from the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC), the U.K. government agency for funding research in engineering and the physical sciences. The EPSRC evaluates projects based on their scientific content, as well as on their potential impact on the current or future success of the U.K. economy.</p>
<p>For each EPSRC project in which the engineering academics participated, we identified all articles in the ISI Science Citation Index (SCI) published between 2008 and 2010 that cite EPSRC as a funding source. We take both the normal count and the impact-factor weighted count of publications as measures of the quality of the project. As a measure of type, we use the Patent Board classification, version 2005, developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0891242412472535">Narin, Pinski, and Gee (1976)</xref>, which classifies journals according to their general research orientation. As proxies for the partners’ characteristics, we use the average basicness–appliedness type and the number and impact of their publications in the period 2002-2007. Our final, representative sample includes 487 research projects, 187 of which are collaborative and 300 are noncollaborative.</p>
<p>Our data set allows us to take into account not only the effect of the existence or the number of industrial partners but also the type of firms with which university researchers collaborate. Moreover, it allows us to directly measure the impact of the collaboration with industry on the outcome of a specific research project.</p>
<p>First, we regress the project’s output type with respect to the type of the researchers and the firms. In line with the results in our theoretical exercise, we obtain that the appliedness of the output is increasing in the appliedness of both the university and firm partners. Also, the type of project is not influenced by the scientific level of the researchers or the firms.</p>
<p>Second, we consider the output of the project measured in terms of number of publications and their impact factor. As expected, funding has a positive and highly significant effect on the number and impact of publications. More efficient academic researchers also significantly improve the quality of the research output. In contrast, the effect of the publications of the firms is more complex: The intercept is negative and the slope is positive. This indicates that, as suggested by the theoretical model, collaboration with firms with poor publication records (which may indicate a low level of scientific knowledge and a low absorptive capacity) leads to lower scientific output than a project developed by researchers alone. However, as the publications of the industry partners increase, the quality of the project improves and it becomes higher than that of noncollaborative projects. Finally, our regression confirms that the quality of the project is higher when the interest of the researcher and the firm are more aligned.</p>
<p>The rest of the article proceeds as follows. In the Literature Review section, we do a brief literature review. The Theoretical Framework section presents our theoretical framework, which develops the hypotheses concerning the type of project and the output as a function of whether or not the project involves an industry partner. We describe our database and test our predictions in the Empirical Evidence section. In the final section, we conclude.</p>

<title>Literature Review</title>
<p>Our theoretical framework is related to the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0891242412472535">Pereira (2007)</xref>. She proposes a model to analyze the type of project that is decided in a collaborative agreement. Her objective is to emphasize that the characteristics of partnership agreements are the result of an optimal contract between partners when informational problems are present.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0891242412472535">1</xref></sup> She shows how two different structures of partnership governance—centralized and decentralized—may optimally use the type of project to motivate the supply of noncontractible resources. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0891242412472535">Lacetera (2009)</xref> builds a model to study whether it is optimal for a firm to conduct some research activities in-house or to outsource them to academic organizations. He focuses on the potential value of the commitment due to the outsourcing of the activity and on the discrepancy between the scientific and economic value of the projects.</p>
<p>In terms of evidence, survey studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0891242412472535">Blumenthal, Gluck, Louis, Stoto, &amp; Wise, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0891242412472535">Gulbrandsen &amp; Smeby, 2005</xref>) report that the choice of research topics of academics whose research is supported by industry were biased by their commercial potential.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0891242412472535">2</xref></sup> Some articles have tried to find evidence for this negative (so-called skewing) effect indirectly, by measuring the effect of industry collaboration on researcher publication patterns. Some articles use patenting and licensing as measures of industry collaboration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0891242412472535">Azoulay, Ding, &amp; Stuart, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0891242412472535">Breschi, Lissoni, &amp; Montobbio, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0891242412472535">Hicks &amp; Hamilton, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0891242412472535">Thursby &amp; Thursby, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0891242412472535">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0891242412472535">van Looy, Callaert, &amp; Debackere, 2006</xref>), whereas others use collaborative research agreements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0891242412472535">Banal-Estañol, Jofre-Bonet, &amp; Meissner, 2010</xref>). On the other hand, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0891242412472535">Veugelers and Cassiman (2005)</xref> also find evidence of a change of behavior in the other side: Collaboration with universities leads firms to more basic oriented research.</p>
<p>The literature has also studied the effect of industry collaboration on the quantity and impact of academic research output. In their report for the National Academy of Sciences, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0891242412472535">Merrill and Mazza (2010)</xref> conclude that the majority of studies have not found evidence of negative effects of industrial collaboration (or commercially related faculty activity) on the publication counts and citation counts. Survey studies suggest that industry involvement is linked to higher academic productivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0891242412472535">Gulbrandsen &amp; Smeby, 2005</xref>). Using patenting and licensing as collaboration measures, empirical articles find that patenting either does not affect publishing rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0891242412472535">Agrawal &amp; Henderson, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0891242412472535">Goldfarb, Marschke, &amp; Smith, 2009</xref>) or that the patenting and the quantity and impact of research output are positively related (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0891242412472535">Azoulay et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0891242412472535">Breschi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0891242412472535">Calderini &amp; Franzoni, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0891242412472535">Fabrizio &amp; DiMinin, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0891242412472535">Stephan, Gurmu, Sumell, &amp; Black, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0891242412472535">van Looy et al., 2006</xref>). Using collaborative research as a measure of industry involvement, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0891242412472535">Manjarres-Henriquez, Gutierrez-Gracia, Carrion-Garcia, and Vega-Jurado (2009)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0891242412472535">Banal-Estañol et al. (2010)</xref> uncover an inverted U-shaped relationship between industry collaboration and academic research output. The negative effect of high-collaboration levels is also consistent with the survey results in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0891242412472535">Blumenthal et al. (1986)</xref> and the empirical evidence on NASA-funded academic researchers in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0891242412472535">Goldfarb (2008)</xref>.</p>
<p>Although our objective is not to evaluate the EPSRC program, we do obtain some conclusions on the outcome of the program. In this sense, our article is related to the literature that evaluates projects and programs in terms of creation of knowledge, measured by the publications obtained by the researchers involved (see, for instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0891242412472535">Cozzens, Popper, Bonomo, Koizumi, &amp; Flanagan, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>Recent studies emphasize the importance of knowledge creation for the emergence of entrepreneurship. The contributions by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0891242412472535">Audretsch, Keilbach, and Lehmann (2006)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0891242412472535">Acs, Braunerhjelm, Audretsch, and Carlsson (2009)</xref> propose the knowledge spillover theory of entrepreneurship in which the creation of new knowledge expands the technological opportunity set. An important implication of this theory is that an increase in the stock of knowledge is expected to positively affect the degree of entrepreneurship. They also empirically test the theory and show that entrepreneurial opportunities are not exogenous, but they are created by a high presence of knowledge spillovers. Therefore, programs like the one offered by the EPSRC not only contribute to an increase in the level of knowledge and publications but also indirectly to the emergence of entrepreneurial activity. In this sense, our study contributes to a better understanding of programs that help increase university entrepreneurship.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0891242412472535">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Our article highlights that the level of firms’ scientific publications has a strong positive influence on the outcome of the research programs. In their influential article, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0891242412472535">Cohen and Levinthal (1990)</xref> argue that a firm’s absorptive capacity is critical to its innovative capabilities and influences its innovation decisions, in particular concerning the participation in cooperative R&amp;D ventures. The past record of publications of a firm is a clear signal of its absorptive capacity and also of its ability to contribute to a research program. According to our results, this ability is crucial not only for the firm but also for the university researchers involved in collaborative projects.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0891242412472535">
<title>The Theoretical Framework</title>
<p>To analyze the output of research projects that have received government financing, we introduce a simple framework to analyze the participants’ decisions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0891242412472535">4</xref></sup> The projects are aimed at financing research; therefore, we focus on the decisions leading to academic publications. We abstract from other outputs, such as patents or transfer of know-how.</p>
<p>We focus on two characteristics of the project: type and quality. The <italic>type</italic> is defined as the level of appliedness (or alternatively basicness) of the research developed in the project. The difference between a basic project and an applied one is not its scientific content or its originality, but the potential applicability of the results. Typically, academic researchers are more inclined to solve general puzzles, whose potential application for the industry, at least in the short run, is small (basic research). Industry, and by consequence, firms that are involved in research tend to be interested in more applied questions. The <italic>quality</italic> is related to the level of the research developed in the project. We will measure the quality of the project through both the count of the publications obtained in the project and their impact factor.</p>
<p>We address two questions: (a) Which type of project did the partners choose? (b) How high is the quality of the project? We first consider projects that involve university researchers only and then those that include both academic researchers and firms.</p>
<sec id="section4-0891242412472535">
<title>Noncollaborative Projects</title>
<p>Let us consider a university researcher (or a team of university researchers) that we denote by <italic>U</italic>, who has obtained funding <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>M</italic></sub> for a research project on his or her own. The benefits that <italic>U</italic> obtains from the project depend on its type and quality through the impact of the results of the project in his or her CV and academic career, or the consideration by peers in his or her field.</p>
<p>The type of project, that is its level of appliedness, can be represented by a parameter <italic>x</italic>. Researchers may have different preferences over this dimension. We denote <italic>U</italic>’s most preferred type by <italic>x</italic><sub><italic>U</italic></sub>. Projects have less value for <italic>U</italic> if <italic>x</italic> is different from <italic>x</italic><sub><italic>U</italic></sub>; the larger the distance between the type <italic>x</italic> and his or her most preferred type <italic>x</italic><sub><italic>U</italic></sub>, the larger the loss in value.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0891242412472535">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>We represent the quality of the project by an index that reflects both the number and the impact of the publications derived from the project. Resources can be devoted to increase this index. The quality depends on the effort allocated by the researcher as well as on the amount <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>M</italic></sub> obtained from the government. The effort can refer to the level of involvement of the researcher, the possible additional financing by the research lab, and so forth. Moreover, the quality of the project also depends on the efficiency (or ability) of <italic>U</italic>.</p>
<p>In terms of predictions, the researcher selects the type of project that best suits his or her interest, <italic>x</italic><sub><italic>U</italic></sub>. Moreover, we predict that the level of the researcher’s dedication to the project is increasing with the value he or she allocates to the output, with his or her scientific level and with the level of government financing <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>M</italic></sub>.</p>
<p>We now state the testable hypotheses on the type and quality of a noncollaborative project:</p>
<list id="list1-0891242412472535" list-type="simple"><list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 1</italic>: The type of a noncollaborative project is more applied as the level of appliedness of the researcher increases.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 2</italic>: The quality of a noncollaborative project increases with the scientific level of the researcher, as well as with the amount of the grant.</p></list-item></list>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0891242412472535">
<title>University–Industry Collaborative Projects</title>
<p>Consider now a project with government financing <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>M</italic></sub> led by a researcher <italic>U</italic> in collaboration with a firm <italic>F</italic>. We denote <italic>F</italic>’s most preferred type of project by <italic>x</italic><sub><italic>F</italic></sub> and we consider that firms’ preferences are more applied than that of the universities: <italic>x</italic><sub><italic>F</italic></sub> &gt; <italic>x</italic><sub><italic>U</italic></sub>. A firm values the quality of the project because it reflects the know-how or applied knowledge acquired during the research that leads to the publications. Firms, as academic researchers, suffer a cost from moving from their ideal point in terms of research. The firm may invest in the project in several ways, including financial resources as well as firm’s researchers’ effort. The level of investment may depend on the technical and scientific level of <italic>F</italic>, its absorptive capacity, the level of its human capital, and so forth.</p>
<p>The participants in a collaborative project must agree on a type <italic>x</italic>. One expects that they will compromise on a project less applied than <italic>x</italic><sub><italic>F</italic></sub> and less basic than <italic>x</italic><sub><italic>U</italic></sub>, and agree on the one best suited for the partnership. The type chosen will be a weighted average of the optimal types for the researcher and the firm, where the weights depend on the value the partners allocate to the outcome of the project and also on the difficulties encountered when moving from the ideal project.</p>
<p>The partners must also reach an agreement as to the level of their investment.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0891242412472535">6</xref></sup> At the optimal agreement, their investment is increasing at their technical and scientific levels and they are decreasing in the distance between the most preferred types of project (<italic>x</italic><sub><italic>F</italic></sub> − <italic>x</italic><sub><italic>U</italic></sub>).</p>
<p>Hypotheses 3 and 4 state the testable effect of changes in the exogenous parameters on the type and quality of collaborative projects.</p>
<list id="list2-0891242412472535" list-type="simple"><list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 3</italic>: The type of a collaborative project is more applied as the level of appliedness of the firm and the researcher increases.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 4</italic>: The quality of a collaborative project increases with the scientific and technical levels of the firm and the university researcher, as well as with the amount of the grant, and decreases with the distance between the level of appliedness of the researcher and that of the firm.</p></list-item></list>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0891242412472535">
<title>Research Outcomes in Collaborative Versus Noncollaborative Projects</title>
<p>According to our previous discussion, it is immediate that collaborative projects are more applied than noncollaborative ones. There are no reasons for <italic>U</italic> to deviate from his or her most preferred type in a university undertaking while the type of project in a collaborative agreement reflects the interest of both the university researcher and the firm.</p>
<p>The analysis of the comparison of the quality of collaborative and noncollaborative projects shows a trade-off. On one hand, there are two reasons that suggest that collaborative projects should be more productive. First, both partners invest in a collaborative project while only the researcher works on a noncollaborative one. Second, both partners are interested in the project, which increases the value of each publication. On the other hand, researchers and firms often encounter difficulties when they work with each other. Indeed, there is evidence that research collaboration often carries coordination costs due, among others things, to differences in culture, priorities, and values of universities and firms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0891242412472535">Champness, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0891242412472535">Cummings &amp; Kiesler, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0891242412472535">Dasgupta &amp; David, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0891242412472535">Lacetera, 2009</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0891242412472535">7</xref></sup> This tends to decrease the academic researchers’ investment.</p>
<p>Therefore, we should expect the quality of a collaborative project to be higher than that of a noncollaborative project whenever the research level of the firm is high enough and/or its interest in basic research is strong enough. In fact, if the interest of the firm in basic research is strong, then we expect the quality of a collaborative project to be always higher. However, the quality may be lower when the collaboration costs are high and the firm’s scientific ability is low.</p>
<p>Hypothesis 5 states the expected relationship between the types of collaborative versus noncollaborative projects. Hypotheses 6 and 7 reflect the two possibilities with respect to the comparison between the qualities of the two types of projects.</p>

<title>Empirical Evidence</title>

<title>Data and Descriptive Statistics</title>
<p>Our research projects are based on grants given by the EPSRC, the main U.K. government agency for funding research in engineering (amounting to more than 50% of overall funding of engineering department research projects). EPSRC supports excellent, long-term research and high-quality postgraduate training in order to contribute to the economic competitiveness of the United Kingdom and the quality of life of its people. One of the main missions of the EPSRC is promoting an enterprising culture of adventure and excitement in which people seize opportunities and make things happen.</p>
<p>Some of the EPSRC grants include one or more firms as industry partners and are considered collaborative grants. As defined by the EPSRC, Collaborative Research Grants are grants led by academic researchers but may involve other partners. Partners generally contribute either cash or “in-kind” services to the full economic cost of the research. The EPSRC encourages research in collaboration with the industry. As a result, around 35% of EPSRC grants presently involve partners from industry.</p>
<p>Our starting point is the uniquely created longitudinal data set in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0891242412472535">Banal-Estañol et al. (2010)</xref>, which contains information on all researchers employed at the engineering departments of 40 major U.K. universities between 1985 and 2007. We identify all their articles in the SCI that acknowledged the EPSRC as a funding source. The Web of Knowledge has been systematically collecting information on funding sources from the acknowledgments since 2008. We consider only those articles that specify the grant number codes. Of course, some publications have been funded by multiple EPSRC funds and some EPSRC projects generate more than one publication.</p>
<p>We analyzed the articles that acknowledge an EPSRC project as a funding source in the period 2008-2010. We use the normal count of publications as proxy of the project’s research output. We do not discount for the number of EPSRC funding sources of each publication, as we do not have funding information about non-EPSRC sources. As a second measure, we also consider the impact-factor-weighted sum of publications, with the weights being the impact attributed to the publishing journal. To compute it, we use the SCI Journal Impact Factor (JIF), a measure of importance attribution based on the number of citations a journal receives to adjust for relative quality. Though not a direct measure for quality, the JIF represents the impact attributed to a particular journal by peer review. As the JIF of journals differs between years, and journals are constantly being added to the SCI, we use the closest available to the date of publication.</p>
<p>As an indicator of the type of publication, we use the Patent Board (formerly CHI) classification (version 2005), developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0891242412472535">Narin et al. (1976)</xref> and updated by Kimberley Hamilton for the National Science Foundation. Based on cross-citation matrices between journals, it characterizes the general research orientation of journals, distinguishing between (a) applied technology, (b) engineering and technological science, (c) applied and targeted basic research, and (d) basic scientific research. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0891242412472535">Godin (1996)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0891242412472535">van Looy et al. (2006)</xref> reinterpreted the categories as (a) applied technology, (b) basic technology, (c) applied science, and (d) basic science; and grouped the first two as technology and the last two as science. Following their definition, we define the level of appliedness of a set of articles as the number of publications in the first two categories divided by the number of publications in the four categories. Some of the articles were published in journals that had not been classified and are therefore discarded in the calculation of level of appliedness.</p>
<p>Our data set consists of projects with at least one classified publication in the project output, at least one in the university input, and at least one in the firm input. This left us with a final sample of 487 research projects, 187 of which are collaborative (involving at least one industrial partner), and 300 are noncollaborative. For ease of comparison, we keep the same sample throughout the article. (See <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0891242412472535">Banal-Estañol et al. (2011)</xref> for further details on the descriptive statistics of the project.)</p>
<sec id="section9-0891242412472535">
<title>Project output</title>
<p>We measure the type of the project defined in the theoretical framework using the type of the publications in the basic-applied space. The quality of the project is measured with the number and impact factor of the publications.</p>
<p>Our final sample set of publications citing at least one of the 487 EPSRC projects up to December 31, 2010, contains 1,286 publications. The average number of publications in a research project in the period 2008-2010 is 2.64, but the dispersion is high, with a standard deviation of 3.35. The most prolific project generated 47 recorded publications. If we take the sum of the impact factors of the journals in which the publications are published, projects have an average of 7.91, but again dispersion is high. Projects contain on average a nonnegligible amount of publications in each of the four categories. Categories 2 and 3 have the highest number of publications (0.79 and 0.67 on average) and Category 1, the lowest (0.17 on average). The average level of the measure of appliedness of the project’s outcome is around 0.52, 0.62 on average for the 187 projects that include firms and 0.45 for the 300 noncollaborative projects.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0891242412472535">
<title>University input</title>
<p>As a proxy for the type and scientific level of the 1,066 matched researchers, we use the type, count, and impact-factor-weighted sum of their publications in the last 6 years of the database (2002-2007).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0891242412472535">8</xref></sup> The average researcher in our database published 22.98 articles over the 5-year period, with a total impact factor over 56. The average publication of the average researcher is more applied (0.58) than the average publication coming out of the project (0.52). This is probably due to the fact that past publications might also contain outputs from contract research and other collaborative projects with industrial partners.</p>
<p>We consider the average of the researchers in each project because we do not have information about some of the researchers in the project (they are not in the data set because they might be from other universities or from fields outside engineering). However, the number of missing researchers per project is small: The average number of researchers in our sample is 2.18, whereas it is 2.37 if we would also include those for whom we do not have information.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0891242412472535">
<title>Government funding and firm input</title>
<p>We also match our database with that of the EPSRC. The EPSRC database contains information on start year and duration of the grant, total amount of funding, names of principal investigators and coinvestigators, and names of the (potentially multiple) partner organizations. Most of the partner organizations are private companies, but in some cases they can also be government agencies or other (mostly foreign) universities. We consider the private companies only.</p>
<p>We collected information on all articles published by the employees of these companies between 2002 and 2007. We consider again the total number of publications, the impact-factor-weighted sum of publications, and the total number of publications of each orientation category. For each of these variables, we also compute the average of all the industrial partners in each project. We use the same measure of type for the project partners as the one we use for the project output and for the researchers.</p>
<p>We have 187 projects that include at least one firm research partner. Of those, the average number of partners is more than three. In each project, the average number of publications of the firm partners over the 5-year period is more than 1,000. If weighted by the JIF, the number is above 3,000. The quality of the research output of the firm is a combined measure of firm size and scientific level of the average researcher in the firm. The publications of the firms are less applied than those of the researchers (0.56 vs. 0.58). This may be due to the difficulties that industry researchers face to publish their most applied work because of a requirement of secrecy. The appliedness index of the publications of the researchers involved in collaborative projects is 0.63, superior to the ones running noncollaborative projects (0.55).</p>

<p>As predicted by Hypotheses 1 and 3, the appliedness of the output is increasing in the appliedness of both university and firm partners. Both effects are highly significant. The effect of the researcher is not significantly different in collaborative and noncollaborative projects. In particular, the last two results also support Hypothesis 5: Collaborative projects are indeed more applied than noncollaborative ones. The addition of the coefficients of the type of the researcher and the firm is close to one in column 2, which is in accordance with the prediction of the theory since the type of the project is a weighted average of the types of researcher and firm. We can also see that the effect of the appliedness of the researcher is stronger, which suggests that the results are more valuable for the universities than for the firms, that the firms are more flexible than the universities, and/or that the index of the researchers is more accurate than that of the firms. In the regression in logs, we can see that an increase in one percentage point in the appliedness of the researchers increases the appliedness of the project by 0.71 percentage points. The same increase in the appliedness of the firms increases the appliedness of the output by 0.2 percentage points.</p>
<p>As a robustness check, we perform the same regression using the number of publications in Category 1 with respect to the total classified number of publications. Again, the appliedness of the output increases with the appliedness of both the university and firm partners. The effects are less strong, but all except one are still highly significant. Using this measure, the effect of the researcher is significantly stronger in collaborative projects. For the same change in the level of appliedness of the researcher, the output is more applied.</p>
<p>Finally, we also show that the type of project is not influenced by the quality of the researchers or the firms. In the last two columns, we regress the level of appliedness of the output on the normal count of publications of the researchers and firms in the project. None of the variables appear as significant independently if we consider basic publications those of Categories 1 and 2 or Category 1 only.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0891242412472535">Table 2</xref> provides the results on the quality of the project. Using both the normal count and the impact-factor weighted count of publications, we regress the count of publications of the project on the total funding, on the average count of publications of the researchers, and on the total count of publications of the firm partners. We allow for an intercept on the number of publications of the firm to separate collaborative with noncollaborative projects (noncollaborative projects are the only ones that have a zero publication number).</p>

<p>As predicted by Hypotheses 2 and 4, the effect of funding is positive and highly significant in all the regressions in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0891242412472535">Table 2</xref>. More efficient university researchers also significantly improve the quality of the research output. In the regression in logs, we find that an increase in 1% in the publication researcher record increases the count of publications by 0.066 percentage points and the weighted count by 0.247 percentage points.</p>
<p>The effect of the publications of the firms is curvilinear, as the intercept is negative and the slope is positive, in accordance with Hypothesis 4. The effects are highly significant in the four columns except for the case in which we take logs in the normal count of publications. As a result, having firms with poor publication records is worse than having no firm partner at all. However, as the publications of the firm partners increase, the quality of the research output improves (the slope of the total account, or total weighed account, of firms’ publications is significantly positive). Therefore, our empirical results support Hypothesis 7 and reject the alternative Hypothesis 6. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0891242412472535">Figure 1</xref> plots the predicted values for the count of publications as a function of the publications of the average researcher and the firm.</p>

<p>In the third block of columns of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0891242412472535">Table 2</xref>, we include the number of firms as an additional regressor. The linear effects of the scientific level of the researchers and firms are similar. Here, the intercept is still negative but insignificant, but the new continuous variable of the number of firms is negative and highly significant. The interpretation of this result is that, for a given number of publications of the firm partners, collaborating with less would be better. This is again consistent with our theory, which would suggest higher costs if a researcher collaborates with more firms.</p>
<p>In the last two columns of <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0891242412472535">Table 2</xref>, we include the distance between the level of appliedness of the firm and that of the researchers in the project. Independently of the use of logs or not, the coefficient is negative and significant. Therefore, the empirical results support the last prediction in Hypothesis 4: Larger differences between the collaborating partners decrease the quality of the output coming out of the project.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In this article, we provide both a theoretical analysis and empirical evidence on the type and the quality of university–industry collaborative projects. Our theoretical framework posits that the project type takes into account the interests of both university researchers and firms. It also stresses that investment of the project is increasing the partners’ technical and scientific levels and the affinity of their interests. Through the investment decisions, the characteristics of the partners affect the quality of the research output.</p>
<p>According to our theory, university researchers should produce more basic outputs if they do not collaborate with industry. But, the effect of industry collaboration on the project’s quality of the research output can have two opposite effects. On one hand, collaboration increases investment levels, both because partners bring resources and because the academics have more incentives to invest. On the other hand, having collaborative partners increases the cost of the project because they might find difficulties in working together. Industry partners therefore improve project outcomes only if they are valuable partners.</p>
<p>The empirical evidence supports the theoretical predictions. More basic researchers generate more basic output and more applied firms generate more applied output. We find no difference on the effect of researchers in collaborative and noncollaborative agreements. We also find that the projects, in which more prolific researchers and more prolific firms work, generate more and better publications.</p>
<p>Again consistent with the theory, our empirical evidence shows that firm partners with low publication records decrease the quality of the project output, whereas those with high levels of publication records improve project outcomes. According to our linear model, collaborating with firms that have publication records below the mean is worse than not collaborating with any firm. This means, taking our empirical model at face value, that collaborating with 80% of the firms in our sample decreases the number of publications of the project. Collaborating with firms, of course, can also have other advantages besides the impact on the publication record.</p>
<p>One of the main contributions of this article is to emphasize the importance of taking into account the type of firms with which university researchers collaborate, and not only the number of firms. Emphasizing collaboration with the right type of firm should be a beneficial policy. Our empirical analysis suggests that collaborating with firms that have a high average scientific level and that have similar interest to the researchers improves the research output of government grants. Therefore, in the evaluation of research proposals, policy makers and managers of programs that fund research may want to take into account not only the scientific level of the university researchers and the interest of the project but also the scientific level of the firms, as measured in particular by their past record of publications, and the affinity of the partners’ past publication records.</p>

<p>As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0891242412472535">Dasgupta and David (1994)</xref> pointed out, the goals and incentives received from institution scientists work to shape their preferences in terms of research. The links with the industry, while they have many positive consequences for the economy, have also raised concerns about the detrimental effects that more market-oriented activities may have on pure scientific production. The interests of the industry may divert university researchers from their main duty, and some voices have pointed out that the increased secrecy and shifts in research interests may be an important concern.</p></fn>
