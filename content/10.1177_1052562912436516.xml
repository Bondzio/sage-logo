<abstract>
<p>Courses designed specifically to develop students’ managerial skills began to emerge in the 1980s, in response to criticism of the theoretical and quantitative orientation of business school coursework. Since then, a number of management textbooks focusing on skills-based learning have been published, and many instructors have become acquainted with both the benefits and challenges of adopting these approaches in their classrooms. This article reviews the literature on teaching managerial skills, including its history, foundation in learning theory, course design issues, and unique challenges. The overall purpose is to provide a comprehensive guide for instructors interested in offering a managerial skills course for the first time or those seeking to refresh an existing one.</p>

<p>The recommendation that management educators should be teaching students <italic>how</italic> to manage, that is, managerial <italic>skills</italic>, and not just theories and concepts of management, emerged approximately 30 years ago. Since then, authors and management instructors have accepted this charge, writing textbooks geared specifically to developing managerial skills and designing stand-alone courses with this focus. In the context of business education, managerial skills refer to “the behaviors resulting from application of theories, techniques, and behavioral guidelines, which, if applied properly, will enhance a manager’s practice” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1052562912436516">Bigelow, 1995</xref>, p. 306). A review of management education journals (<italic>Journal of Management Education, Management Learning, Academy of Management Learning and Education</italic>, and <italic>Journal of the Academy of Business Education</italic>) reveals that after a flurry of attention to managerial skills development courses in the 1980s and 1990s, with a few exceptions there has been relatively little written specifically on this subject in more recent years. Much of the attention in the literature appears to have turned toward a variety of “real-world” active learning innovations, with service learning (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1052562912436516">Gallagher, 2011</xref>), client-based consulting projects (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1052562912436516">D. F. Robinson, Sherwood, &amp; DePaolo, 2010</xref>), and student entrepreneurship ventures (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1052562912436516">Strempek, 2008</xref>) being just three recent examples. Although managerial skill development may be an outcome of these approaches, it is not their explicit focus. Still, the continued popularity of skills-based management texts and anecdotal feedback from colleagues in the Organizational Behavior Teaching Society suggest that the managerial skills course remains popular. Thus, the time may be right to revisit this topic and review what has been learned over the past 30 years, with the objective of deriving some implications for effective teaching. First, though, the history of managerial skills teaching, validity evidence, and its foundation in learning theory are briefly presented.</p>
<sec id="section1-1052562912436516">
<title>The Case for Skills Training in Management Education</title>
<p>In an oft-cited <italic>Harvard Business Review</italic> article, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1052562912436516">Mintzberg (1975)</xref> proffered the following criticism of management education: “Our management schools have done an admirable job of training the organization’s specialists— management scientists, marketing researchers, accountants, and organizational development specialists. But for the most part they have not trained managers” (p. 61). He went on to recommend that training in managerial skills, such as resolving conflicts, motivating subordinates, and making decisions, should take place alongside more traditional “cognitive” learning. Shortly thereafter, the American Assembly of Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB) picked up this theme, suggesting that business education should cover competencies, that is, skills and abilities, in addition to knowledge. The AACSB undertook a multi-year research project that included delineating the cognitive and noncognitive areas (the latter relabeled skills and personal characteristics, or SAPCs) that business school graduates should master. Twenty SAPCs were subsequently trimmed to eight, including decision making, written communication, delegating, and controlling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1052562912436516">Albanese, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1052562912436516">McEvoy &amp; Cragun, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1052562912436516">L. W. Porter, 1983</xref>). Criticism from outside academia contributed to the increased attention to the need for managerial skills training. For example, a sizable majority of surveyed CEOs, senior corporate executives, and HR vice presidents responded that business schools did not focus enough on behavioral skills training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1052562912436516">L. W. Porter &amp; McKibbin, 1988</xref>). The popular media joined the chorus of critical voices; a <italic>Time</italic> magazine cover story reported some executives’ views of MBAs as “arrogant amateurs, trained only in figures and lacking experience in both the manufacture of goods and the handling of people” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1052562912436516">Friedrich, 1981</xref>, p. 58). In sum, a compelling case was being made from multiple quarters that the problem with management education was an imbalanced focus on theory and quantitative analysis, at the expense of practically relevant skills training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1052562912436516">Whetten &amp; Cameron, 1983</xref>). Indeed, L. W. Porter observed in 1983 that “teaching managerial competencies is quite likely to be one of the major issues—perhaps <italic>the</italic> major issue—facing business/management schools in the last half of the 1980s” (p. 8). The spotlight on management skills training culminated in a 1983 special issue on the topic in <italic>EXCHANGE: The Organizational Behavior Teaching Journal</italic>, in which several authors explored the learning theory foundation, pedagogical application, and potential shortcomings of this approach to management education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1052562912436516">Bradford, 1983a</xref>).</p>
<p>Has the perceived imbalance between management theory and analytical technique on the one hand, and practical skills training on the other, been resolved in the ensuing 30 years? Several texts dedicated to management skills training, most using similar pedagogy, have been published over this time period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1052562912436516">Bigelow, 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1052562912436516">1995</xref>). A sample of 237 management faculty generally agreed it is appropriate to teach managerial skills and educators should be doing more of it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1052562912436516">Albanese, 1990</xref>). Research evidence from the 1990s suggests that continuing attention to this topic is warranted. For instance, one study reported that almost two thirds of business graduates surveyed said “they used their MBA skills marginally or not at all in their first management assignments” and more teaching in “soft skills” was singled out as a needed improvement in business education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1052562912436516">L. A. Hill, 1992</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1052562912436516">Shipper (1999)</xref> explored whether the increased attention to managerial skills in MBA education in the 1990s was effective by comparing MBA graduates in middle management with non-MBAs. In general, he failed to find a substantial advantage in managerial skills among the MBAs.</p>
<p>More recently, the AACSB’s Management Education Task Force noted in its <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1052562912436516">2002</xref> report, “Management Education at Risk,” that management skills such as communications, interpersonal skills, negotiation, and change management continue to be cited by many alumni and recruiters as the greatest deficiencies of business education. Henry Mintzberg, who is partly responsible for drawing attention to the lack of practical relevance in management education through the aforementioned <italic>Harvard Business Review</italic> article, continues to be a vocal critic. In his 2004 book, <italic>Managers, Not MBAs</italic>, his central thesis is that business schools are teaching the wrong people in the wrong way. On the latter point, wrong way, he characterizes the coverage of management competencies as “limited and even haphazard” (p. 258). Other recent critics have noted “an increasingly widely shared indictment of MBA curricula that produce a simplistic faith in rational analysis in complex settings” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1052562912436516">Miles, 2005</xref>, p. 214) and “what business schools teach doesn’t always correspond to what managers value” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1052562912436516">J. Porter, 2007</xref>, p. 2-2). In a similar vein, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1052562912436516">Bennis and O’Toole (2005)</xref> indicted B-schools for defining academic excellence based solely on the scientific rigor of faculty scholarship, while failing in their mission to prepare future management practitioners with practically relevant knowledge and skills. Finally, a recent study found that the behavioral competencies rated as most important by managers, managing human capital and decision making, were among the least represented in business school curricula (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1052562912436516">Rubin &amp; Dierdorff, 2009</xref>). In sum, it seems that a significant emphasis on teaching managerial skills to business students continues to be justified.</p>

<title><italic>Are</italic> Managerial Skills Teachable?</title>
<p>Identifying a continuing need for practically relevant skills training in management education begs the question—<italic>Can</italic> students learn management skills in a classroom? Validity evidence from the university setting is limited. One of the more ambitious attempts at a competency-based approach occurred at the Weatherhead School of Management at Case Western Reserve University, beginning in 1990. A revamped MBA curriculum included a focus on more than 20 competencies empirically related to managerial performance, forming three clusters: goal and action management, people management, and analytical reasoning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1052562912436516">Boyatzis, Leonard, Rhee, &amp; Wheeler, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1052562912436516">Boyatzis, Stubbs, &amp; Taylor, 2002</xref>). The theoretical foundation underlying the program was intentional change theory. Applied to competency development, intentional change theory involves students crafting of a personal vision and learning agenda, practicing new behaviors, and receiving guidance and support from a teacher/coach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1052562912436516">Boyatzis, 2008</xref>). Although the results from a single program redesign need to be viewed with caution, assessment of the competency-based curriculum versus the old MBA program yielded positive outcomes. Full-time students improved on 71% and part-time students improved on 81% of the measured competencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1052562912436516">Boyatzis et al., 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>Other, more modest validity studies for a single course and/or for a very limited number of competencies have been reported. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1052562912436516">Clark, Callister, and Wallace (2003)</xref> drew parallels between the “softer, nontechnical skills” that critics of management education have said are underemphasized and the dimensions of emotional intelligence. Using a pre- and posttest design with a control group, they found that 121 undergraduate students in a managerial skills course improved their emotional intelligence scores over the course of the semester, whereas the control group did not. In another study, two sections of an undergraduate organizational behavior (OB) course were compared, one featuring managerial skills training modules based on behavior modeling pedagogy and the other a more traditional class using canned experiential exercises, for example, “Subarctic Survival.” Measurement of skills learning at the end of the course revealed that students in the behavior modeling section outperformed the other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1052562912436516">McEvoy &amp; Cragun, 1987</xref>). These results were replicated for two of three skills learning measures in a nearly identical follow-up study using a superior research design (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1052562912436516">McEvoy, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>As alluded to above and explored further below, methods for teaching management skills in the classroom often follow techniques similar to behavior modeling training (BMT), which was widely used in industry beginning in the 1970s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1052562912436516">Decker &amp; Nathan, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1052562912436516">McEvoy, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1052562912436516">J. C. Robinson &amp; Gaines, 1980</xref>). Evidence of BMT’s efficacy has been reported in individual studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1052562912436516">Burnaska, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1052562912436516">Latham &amp; Saari, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1052562912436516">Moses &amp; Ritchie, 1976</xref>) and through meta-analysis, which found BMT to be superior to other forms of training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1052562912436516">Burke &amp; Day, 1986</xref>). There are generalizability concerns in drawing parallels between training employees in the workplace and teaching business students in a university classroom, and most of the BMT research is now more than 30 years old. Thus, the validity findings summarized here from academia and industry may be most appropriately viewed as offering cautious encouragement for those desiring to incorporate skills training in their classrooms. Attention now turns to the theoretical underpinning for skills-based pedagogy and the learning model typically used in management education.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1052562912436516">
<title>Theoretical Foundation and Learning Model</title>
<p>Most managerial skill-building courses in universities, as well as BMT in industry, have their theoretical foundation in social learning theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1052562912436516">Bandura, 1977</xref>). Social learning theory places emphasis on imitative learning that occurs through observing others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1052562912436516">Davis &amp; Luthans, 1980</xref>). For skill development, this process takes the form of watching a model performing the behavior, trying it oneself, and experiencing the consequences. In BMT, a basic four-step process is typical: presentation of behavioral guidelines, demonstration of their application, learner practice, and feedback on performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1052562912436516">Goldstein &amp; Sorcher, 1974</xref>). In some cases, this basic method has been imported intact into university coursework (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1052562912436516">Knippen, 1989</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1052562912436516">Cameron and Whetten (1983)</xref>, however, were the first to elaborate on this basic learning model to create a comprehensive managerial skill-building program for use by instructors in the classroom. Their textbook, <italic>Developing Management Skills</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1052562912436516">Whetten &amp; Cameron, 1984</xref>), now in its eighth edition, established the basic pedagogy that many subsequent skills text authors have adopted, with some variations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1052562912436516">Bigelow, 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1052562912436516">1995</xref>). Although some instructors may have designed their skill-building courses independent of a textbook, it seems safe to assume most use one that provides a general framework similar to the Whetten and Cameron model.</p>
<p>The components, then, of a managerial skill-building course typically follow this general sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1052562912436516">Albanese, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1052562912436516">Bigelow, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1052562912436516">Cameron &amp; Whetten, 1983</xref>):</p>
<list id="list1-1052562912436516" list-type="order"><list-item><p>Pre-assessment</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Conceptual learning</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Modeling</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Practice with feedback</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Application</p></list-item></list>
<p>A skill module begins with a pre-assessment activity to sensitize learners to their current level of competency. This pre-assessment may take the form of a paper-and-pencil survey, targeted reflection questions, or even a role play. A conceptual learning segment follows, in which behavioral principles and the research-based theories and concepts that support them are presented. This step often involves assigned readings coupled with lecture/discussion and bears the most similarity to a traditional OB course. Third is the modeling step, termed <italic>skill analysis</italic> by Cameron and Whetten. Cases are often used here to illustrate positive and negative applications of the relevant behavioral principles. Videos, movie segments, student-created role plays, and live modeling by the instructor and/or students are other options (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1052562912436516">Bigelow, 1983</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1052562912436516">1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1052562912436516">McEvoy, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1052562912436516">Waters, Adler, Hartwick, &amp; Poupart, 1983</xref>). Some instructors prefer to use only demonstrations of desirable behaviors (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1052562912436516">Knippen, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1052562912436516">McEvoy, 1998</xref>), whereas others see value in showing both competent and incompetent performance (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1052562912436516">Bigelow, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1052562912436516">Cameron &amp; Whetten, 1983</xref>).</p>
<p>In the fourth step, students have an opportunity to practice the skills they observed. Activities include managerial simulations, in-basket exercises, role plays, team projects, and many other types of individual or group exercises. A critical aspect of this step is providing students with feedback on their performance of the skill, verbally, via written critique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1052562912436516">Hess, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1052562912436516">Knippen, 1989</xref>), or using a behavioral guideline checklist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1052562912436516">Bigelow, 1995</xref>). Feedback sources may be self, instructor, peers, or invited observers. A formal approach is to assign one student the “coach” role in a triad or quartet; he or she would not take part in the practice session but instead observe and prepare feedback for the participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1052562912436516">Bigelow, 1983</xref>). A more in-depth feedback technique, suitable for skill practice that takes place in team settings, is to have team members rate their leaders’ skill performance on a provided evaluation form and then prepare a written critique consistent with the principles they have learned for giving effective feedback (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1052562912436516">Hess, 2007</xref>). Another creative variation is to video record the students practicing the skill, enabling a more thorough feedback session (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1052562912436516">DiStefano &amp; Howell, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1052562912436516">Knippen, 1989</xref>). In a classroom setting, as opposed to skills training in industry, performance feedback inevitably overlaps with evaluation for grading purposes. As evaluation is a particularly challenging issue in a skill-building course, it is covered in greater depth in a later section of this article.</p>
<p>Finally, as with any training, application of the newly learned skill outside the classroom is the critically important final step. A variety of assignments may be used here. For instance, students who are employed or hold positions in student organizations can be asked to try to apply the new skill in their own personal work/organization setting and evaluate their performance in a reflection paper. Instructors with students who are not working or involved in campus organizations, or otherwise do not have an immediate context for personal application, will need to be creative. Suggestions include asking the student to teach the skill he or she has just learned to someone else, or to observe and report on another person’s effective or ineffective use of the behavioral principles in a “live” setting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1052562912436516">Cameron &amp; Whetten, 1983</xref>). Transfer-of-training is one of the most challenging aspects of managerial skills teaching, and so this issue is given further consideration in the concluding section of this article.</p>
<p>Before leaving this examination of the managerial skills teaching model, it may be useful to compare it briefly with other prominent approaches for skill building. As mentioned earlier, the learning model described above is quite similar to BMT in industry. There are some key differences, however. First, the approach developed by Cameron and Whetten adds pre-assessment as an initial activity to help students recognize their current competency level, expose the areas in which they need to improve, and stimulate their motivation to learn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1052562912436516">Cameron &amp; Whetten, 1983</xref>). Perhaps more significantly, this model has a strong conceptual or cognitive component, compared with BMT. Indeed, this component addresses a resistance point to skills teaching by some educators, namely, that it is noncognitive, atheoretical, vocational, or just plain not “academic” enough (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1052562912436516">Albanese, 1989</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1052562912436516">1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1052562912436516">Bradford, 1983b</xref>). In contrast, in Step 2 of the model presented above, considerable time is devoted to grounding behavioral guidelines and principles in research-based theories and concepts. The inclusion of cognitive learning prior to skill modeling and practice also distinguishes this skill-building approach from experiential learning, which has long been popular in OB education. Experiential learning is based on a process of concrete experience, observation and reflection, abstract conceptualization, and testing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1052562912436516">Kolb, Rubin, &amp; McIntyre, 1971</xref>). Classroom applications of experiential learning are inductive in nature; students participate in an activity and then through debrief are guided toward its key learning takeaways. In contrast, the managerial skill-building approach is deductive in orientation. Conceptual material in the form of theories, empirical evidence, and behavioral principles are presented first, and then students practice their application in class activities and later in meaningful contexts relevant to their work or personal lives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1052562912436516">Bigelow, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1052562912436516">Cameron &amp; Whetten, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1052562912436516">McEvoy, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, comparison with the pioneering ability-based curriculum at Alverno College in Milwaukee, which dates back to the 1970s, warrants mention. Alverno expects that students “should be able to do something with what they know” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1052562912436516">Wagner, 2009</xref>, p. 7) and facilitates this by integrating eight ability areas (e.g., problem solving, communication, social interaction) with the “knowledge” content of all courses in its liberal arts curriculum. There are no letter grades given at Alverno; instead, evaluation occurs through narrative feedback to students on their performance, for example, in presentations, demonstrations, and written work. Indeed, “assessment-as-learning” is a key feature of this innovative program, with feedback occurring continuously and from multiple sources throughout the curriculum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1052562912436516">Crossen, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1052562912436516">Hakel, 1997</xref>). Although it is clearly more ambitious in scope, similarities exist between Alverno’s approach and the managerial skills teaching model presented above. Namely, primary emphasis is placed on students actually demonstrating acquired skills, and feedback on performance is a key part of the learning process. The Whetten and Cameron approach, however, appears to more specifically delineate skill application outside the classroom as a distinct component, and self-assessment is framed as a required preliminary step to gauge current skill strengths and areas for improvement.</p>

<title>Course Design Issues in Managerial Skills Teaching</title>
<p>Having reviewed the history of the managerial skills teaching movement, validity evidence, foundation in learning theory, and the model common to many classroom applications, attention now turns to two primary course design issues instructors will face in offering a skills course. The first question instructors naturally will confront is, “What managerial skills should form the subject matter of the course?” and the second is, “How can I evaluate skills learning for grading purposes?”</p>
<sec id="section5-1052562912436516">
<title>Scope of Skills Coverage</title>
<p>If there is one observation most teachers experienced in the skill-building approach agree on, it is that using this method limits the course’s topical scope significantly compared with a traditional OB class (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1052562912436516">Albanese, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1052562912436516">Bigelow, 1983</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1052562912436516">1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1052562912436516">Cameron &amp; Whetten, 1983</xref>). Pre-assessment, conceptual learning, modeling, practice, and application simply take more time than covering a topic through lecture, discussion, and perhaps a group exercise. Therefore, a central concern in course design is selecting the set of skills the instructor can realistically cover.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, a great deal of research has been devoted over the years toward identifying the competencies related to effective management (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1052562912436516">AACSB, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1052562912436516">Berdrow &amp; Evers, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1052562912436516">Boyatzis, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1052562912436516">Cameron &amp; Whetten, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1052562912436516">Dunnette, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1052562912436516">Rubin &amp; Dierdorff, 2009</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1052562912436516">Boyatzis (1982)</xref> identified competency categories including leadership, human resource management, goal and action management, and directing subordinates. The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1052562912436516">AACSB (1987)</xref> specified oral and written communication, decision making, and delegation as among the skills needed for managerial competence. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1052562912436516">Cameron and Whetten (1983)</xref> studied more than 400 managers who were rated as highly effective and interviewed them to identify the skills associated with successful performance. Integrating their findings with previous typologies, they identified nine common behaviors: self-awareness, managing stress, problem solving, communication, motivation, delegation, gaining power and influence, conflict handling, and group decision making. In a separate analysis of commonalities across competency typologies, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1052562912436516">Shaw, Fisher, and Southey (1999)</xref> found problem solving, strategic thinking, decision making, team skills, communication, and leadership as consistent themes. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1052562912436516">Berdrow and Evers (2011)</xref> specified 17 skills in four categories: managing self, communicating, managing people and tasks, and mobilizing innovation and change. From the sample above, it is clear that there is significant overlap among the various lists of managerial skills; communication, leadership, delegation and managing teams are among the skills that show up repeatedly. Researchers looking for clusters among the proposed skills have observed that they tend to fall into two groups—self-management/intrapersonal and relationship-oriented/interpersonal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1052562912436516">Boyatzis et al., 2002</xref>)—with textbook coverage placing more emphasis on the latter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1052562912436516">Bigelow, 1995</xref>). The widely used Whetten and Cameron text (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1052562912436516">2011</xref>) groups skills into personal, interpersonal, group, and specific communication skill categories.</p>
<p>How, then, should an instructor determine the managerial skills to include in his or her skill-building course? A simple approach would be to review skill-building texts on the market and cover the selected author’s choices, but even this may leave the instructor with too many skills to address effectively in a single course. Some criteria recommended for choosing among skills include behavioral specificity, teachability in the classroom as opposed to on-the-job and immediate applicability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1052562912436516">Bigelow, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1052562912436516">Cameron &amp; Whetten, 1983</xref>). For instance, as noted above, “leadership” typically shows up in managerial skill taxonomies. In designing a managerial skills course, however, it can be difficult to break leadership into specific, trainable behavioral skills. Also, portions of this competency are picked up in other skill areas, such as delegation and communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1052562912436516">Albanese, 1990</xref>). With regard to teachability, “gaining power and influence” is an example of a management skill usually acquired in situ over a relatively long time period and, as such, may not be as conducive to classroom training as other options (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1052562912436516">Albanese, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1052562912436516">Waters, 1980</xref>). Regarding applicability, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1052562912436516">Bigelow (1983)</xref> noted that he eliminated stress management from his skills course, due to his perception that it lacked immediate relevance for students. His view is that only later in students’ professional careers will stress management be of critical concern to them, and by that point what they learned in class will be forgotten. As a final point, instructors may want to give consideration to the sequencing of skills coverage. For instance, the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1052562912436516">Whetten and Cameron (2011)</xref> text places personal skills (e.g., developing self-awareness) before interpersonal skills (e.g., managing conflict), which seems to be a wise progression. Also, it is advisable to cover supportive communication and feedback skills early in the course, as they underlie many others and peer feedback after skill practice is a key component in most skill development courses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1052562912436516">Bigelow, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1052562912436516">McEvoy, 1998</xref>).

<p>As a final note in closing this section on scope of coverage, a review of the literature reveals that self-directed learning (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1052562912436516">Boyatzis, 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1052562912436516">1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1052562912436516">Boyatzis et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1052562912436516">Powers, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1052562912436516">Stansfield, 1996</xref>) or learner-centered learning (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1052562912436516">Berdrow &amp; Evers, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1052562912436516">Sluijsmans, Dochy, &amp; Moerkerke, 1998</xref>) approaches, which emphasize student assessment to identify specific needs, represent an alternative approach for selecting content for a managerial skills course. Rather than the instructor prescribing a set of skills to be learned, learning activities are customized to the individual student. For instance, one application of this model begins with students taking a managerial skills self-assessment inventory. Then they select a subset of their weaker skills, develop goals and a detailed improvement plan for them, and later write a reflection paper on their progress. Materials are collected in a “skills portfolio” that documents their learning activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1052562912436516">Berdrow &amp; Evers, 2011</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1052562912436516">
<title>Evaluating Skills Learning</title>
<p>Along with skills coverage, a second primary concern in designing a managerial skill-building course is how students’ performance will be evaluated for grading purposes. Problems with evaluating skills learning have been recognized since the early days of BMT in industry (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1052562912436516">Moses &amp; Ritchie, 1976</xref>). Indeed, this is perhaps the most vexing aspect of skills teaching in the academic setting, with its focus on grading, and may be a major obstacle limiting the widespread implementation of managerial skills courses in business schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1052562912436516">Albanese, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1052562912436516">Cameron &amp; Whetten, 1983</xref>). Clearly, although written tests and homework assignments can be used to evaluate learning of concepts and behavioral guidelines as one would do in a traditional course, additional methods will be needed to measure student achievement in skill acquisition. Instructors have tried a number of different approaches, and a review of the literature suggests trial-and-error characterizes many instructors’ experiences with evaluation tools. Some suggestions can be derived from what they have learned the hard way.</p>
<p>The most straightforward grading method is to convert the behavioral guidelines presented prior to modeling and skill practice into a checklist used for evaluating skill mastery. Such a checklist can be used for assessing students’ performance in role plays, interviews, or other types of managerial simulation exercises, either at the end of each skill module or for groups of skills. See <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1052562912436516">Table 2</xref> for an example of one instructor’s evaluation form for the managerial skill of “disciplining” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1052562912436516">Knippen, 1989</xref>). Video recording the evaluation activities can improve evaluation accuracy and the quality of feedback to students. Multiple raters are recommended to enhance grading accuracy. Raters may include self, peers, instructor, and outside observers, such as invited guests from the local business community. Although the <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1052562912436516">Table 2</xref> example uses conventional letter grading to indicate quality of student performance, other options are also available. For instance, presence/absence or frequency rating scales have been recommended, as they are perceived by students as more objective than “how well was this skill performed?” type measures. This may be especially important if relatively inexperienced raters are used, such as student peers. Also, the kind of feedback implicit in a presence/absence or frequency scale, that is, “do more of this behavior,” may be more helpful for student improvement than “do this behavior better” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1052562912436516">Cameron &amp; Whetten, 1983</xref>). A more elaborate variation of the checklist method, beyond the relatively simple form shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1052562912436516">Table 2</xref>, involves differential weighting of individual behaviors within each skill area, coupled with a global skill assessment rating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1052562912436516">Waters et al., 1983</xref>).</p>

<p>A more complicated method of evaluating skills involves the use of a comprehensive end-of-term exam, dubbed a behavioral, practical, or “action exam” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1052562912436516">Bigelow, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1052562912436516">DiStefano &amp; Howell, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1052562912436516">Waters et al., 1983</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1052562912436516">Bigelow (1983)</xref> described a process through which he met with individual students during finals week, running them through scenarios that required them to display skills covered in the course. Student performance was rated using a checklist like the one described above. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1052562912436516">McEvoy (1998)</xref> used a similar approach, with 5-minute role plays testing randomly selected skill areas. A variation involves the student selecting a card at random from a collection of stimulus scenarios, reading the managerial situation described therein, and after some time to reflect on it, providing his or her behavioral response to the problem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1052562912436516">Waters et al., 1983</xref>).</p>
<p>A particularly ambitious application of the action exam, developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1052562912436516">DiStefano and Howell (1990)</xref>, involves the student analyzing an assigned case, preparing an action plan for dealing with the issues contained in it, and then conducting a video-recorded, 20-minute meeting in which the student plays the manager’s role. The student turns in a brief written statement of the meeting’s objectives and planned approach just prior to his or her performance. The instructor or a third party takes the subordinate role in the meeting and completes an evaluation immediately afterward, based on criteria such as the appropriateness of the student/manager’s objectives for the meeting and how well the subordinate’s needs were dealt with. Subsequently, a qualified third party, ideally an individual with professional experience in HR, reviews the videotape and rates the student’s performance against predetermined criteria. Although it is quite logistically challenging and requires additional instructor effort to locate appropriate cases, this approach has an advantage over simpler methods in the opportunity it presents to assess students’ ability to apply and integrate multiple skills in addressing a complex problem. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1052562912436516">Mumford (2009)</xref> describes a similar approach in which students video record themselves role-playing performance management scenarios, such as conducting a performance review meeting or terminating an employee. To facilitate accurate assessment of learning, students submit for evaluation purposes two performance videos: the first is a pre-assessment or baseline performance, and the second is prepared and recorded after the relevant behavioral principles are taught in class.</p>
<p>An issue that comes up in evaluating skill performance, as compared with grading cognitive learning, is that instructors may need to calibrate their evaluation standards based on the sequencing of students’ opportunities to demonstrate mastery of the focal skill. That is, depending on how the instructor conducts evaluation sessions, students who go later may benefit from observing earlier students’ performance and hearing their feedback. “Raising the bar” for later students will likely be necessary to maintain equity. Likewise, rotating the sequence in which students perform over the course of the term is advisable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1052562912436516">Knippen, 1989</xref>).</p>
<p>Other grading methods instructors have experimented with include student journals in which they reflect on their skill performance in class and application activities outside of it, and written assignments involving library research, through which they explore the relevancy of certain skills, conditions under which they are appropriate or inappropriate, and so on (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1052562912436516">Bigelow, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1052562912436516">Cameron &amp; Whetten, 1983</xref>). A way to inject some fun every so often into a skills course is through a “skill meet,” in which student teams compete to see which team’s representative most effectively handles a given managerial scenario (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1052562912436516">Bigelow, 1996</xref>). Points are awarded to the winning team, with extra ones for the team’s representative.</p>
<p>Finally, although the preceding methods that require skill performance (e.g., role plays, action exams, skill meets) have higher face validity, traditional written exams may be necessitated by large class sizes or used as a supplement to one of the above methods. For instance, students can be asked to read a description of a management dilemma and then write out their plan for dealing with it, including the specific behavioral steps they would use (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1052562912436516">McEvoy, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>In concluding this discussion of evaluation methods, it should be noted that rating students’ skill proficiency does not replace conventional testing of cognitive learning. As explained earlier in the presentation of the general skill-building model, research-based theories and concepts supporting behavioral principles are an important part of most managerial skill development courses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1052562912436516">Albanese, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1052562912436516">Bradford, 1983b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1052562912436516">Cameron &amp; Whetten, 1983</xref>). As such, testing students’ knowledge of this course material needs to be balanced with evaluating their skill learning. Given the significant challenges associated with the latter, however, a concern is that instructors may overweight cognitive learning and traditional testing methods over skills evaluation in course grading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1052562912436516">Bigelow, 1995</xref>). Students will be motivated to learn what they perceive they will be rewarded for learning. For them to take skill-building and the role plays, cases, and exercises associated with it seriously, it is critically important that instructors give substantial emphasis to skills testing in their grading protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1052562912436516">Bigelow, 1993</xref>).</p>
<p>Determining the scope of coverage in a skill-building course, and especially developing valid, feasible methods for evaluating students’ skill learning, are two primary design issues for instructors contemplating teaching one. There are some other challenges unique to this kind of course; a few of the more prominent ones from the literature are considered next.</p>
</sec></sec>
<sec id="section7-1052562912436516">
<title>Additional Challenges in Managerial Skills Teaching</title>
<p>Skill-building courses present more planning and logistical challenges, compared with traditional courses. Most obviously, developing students’ familiarity and comfort level with new skills, so that they become ingrained and will actually be used later on, is very time intensive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1052562912436516">Albanese, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1052562912436516">Bigelow, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1052562912436516">Hess, 2007</xref>). Devoting enough time to skill practice is essential; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1052562912436516">Knippen (1989)</xref> estimates a ratio of 1 hour spent teaching and modeling behaviors to 2 to 3 hours for students’ skill practice and feedback. Additionally, as is evident by the previous discussion of evaluation methods, grading is considerably more time consuming than in a typical course. Preparing behavioral checklists, locating and training external raters, and conducting skill evaluation sessions take more time than grading tests, quizzes, and homework assignments. Overall, although skills textbooks such as the popular <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1052562912436516">Whetten and Cameron (2011)</xref> text provide many resources for skill learning, practice, and application activities, instructors are likely to find preparation and evaluation time to be substantially longer, with some trial-and-error experimentation to be expected along the way. As well, teaching a skills course may require breaking out of the convention of 50-minute, 75-minute, or even 3-hour class sessions to allow for skill practice exercises of different durations, video-recording sessions, action exams, and to accommodate the involvement of outside raters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1052562912436516">Albanese, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1052562912436516">Bradford, 1983b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1052562912436516">Cameron &amp; Whetten, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1052562912436516">DiStefano &amp; Howell, 1990</xref>). Smaller class sizes, relative to a traditional OB course, seem advisable as well.</p>
<p>Another issue raised in the literature on skills teaching is potential student resistance to the method, at least initially (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1052562912436516">J. Hill &amp; Houghton, 2001</xref>). Students accustomed to more passive forms of learning may be uncomfortable practicing sensitive interpersonal behaviors in front of others, for example, conflict handling. They may feel stressed by being “put on the spot” to perform in a role play or action exam (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1052562912436516">Bigelow, 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1052562912436516">1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1052562912436516">Knippen, 1989</xref>) and may express displeasure about their performance being rated by peers or external invited guests. Some of these qualms, such as discomfort with practicing skills in front of others, may naturally ebb with time as students gain experience with these initially unfamiliar methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1052562912436516">Knippen, 1989</xref>). Instructors also can take proactive steps to mitigate students’ concerns, for example, by explicitly acknowledging the negative emotions that may accompany skill development activities and making these emotional reactions the subject of reflective exercises and discussions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1052562912436516">J. Hill &amp; Houghton, 2001</xref>). As well, a supportive, safe classroom climate should be established early on by providing feedback on skill practice sessions that communicates that mistakes are part of the learning process. Sequencing skills coverage to allow for some early successes with some of the more straightforward skills, for example, supportive communication guidelines or delegation principles, may build students’ efficacy and help overcome initial misgivings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1052562912436516">Bigelow, 1996</xref>). As well, at the start of the term, instructors will want to stress the usefulness of managerial skill-building for students’ future careers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1052562912436516">Bigelow, 1983</xref>), perhaps by recounting a little bit of the history behind the development of the skills-based approach summarized at the beginning of this article. Guests from the local business community can be recruited to lend credibility to the course’s goals by discussing their perceptions of the skill needs of new managers or by serving as external raters in the evaluation phase. Regarding the last point, careful attention should be paid to developing accurate evaluation methods to ensure their perceived validity by students.</p>
<p>Finally, management educators writing about skills teaching have debated the questions of <italic>where</italic> in the curriculum behavioral skills should be taught and by <italic>whom</italic>. Some suggest sequencing the skills course as a second one for management students, following a foundational OB course covering theories and management principles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1052562912436516">Cameron &amp; Whetten, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1052562912436516">Waters et al., 1983</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1052562912436516">Cameron and Whetten (1983)</xref> also recommend situating the skills course late in the curriculum, close in time to students entering jobs in which they will have an opportunity to use the new skills. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1052562912436516">Bigelow (1983)</xref> would make the skills course a prerequisite to a managerial sense-making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1052562912436516">Weick, 1995</xref>) course. Another option is to embed behavioral skills training throughout the curriculum as a programmatic element, to increase students’ exposure to the skills and the likelihood they will apply them in their larger life context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1052562912436516">Bigelow, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1052562912436516">Bradford, 1983b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1052562912436516">Brownell &amp; Chung, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1052562912436516">J. Hill &amp; Houghton, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1052562912436516">McEvoy, 1998</xref>). Also, some have questioned the assumption that OB faculty are the best qualified in the university to teach all the different kinds of managerial skills, with communication and presentation skills offered as examples of skills for which other departments may be more competent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1052562912436516">L. W. Porter, 1983</xref>).</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Two final considerations in this review of managerial skills teaching are the question of current relevancy of this course in business schools and specific criticisms that have been leveled against this teaching approach. Suggestions for addressing these criticisms are also discussed below.</p>
<sec id="section9-1052562912436516">
<title>Is the Managerial Skills Course Still Relevant?</title>
<p>As noted in this article’s introduction, teaching managerial skills in business schools was the subject of a considerable degree of interest in management education journals in the 1980s and 1990s but has drawn significantly less attention in the ensuing 20 years. One can only speculate as to some possible reasons for this change. Perhaps the skill-building approach was never widely adopted and remains a marginalized pedagogy, or those that initially tried this format encountered obstacles that caused them to abandon it, or more optimistically, instructors are using it successfully and it has become a mature teaching method that no longer garners much interest among those writing for publication. Although it would be necessary to do a systematic analysis to answer the question conclusively, anecdotal feedback from a query recently posted on an Organizational Behavior Teaching Society blog revealed some interesting observations from faculty who are currently, or have in the past, taught a skills course.</p>
<p>In response to a question about whether or not managerial skills teaching is still popular, several instructors expressed surprise at the question itself, stating they were indeed teaching management courses devoted solely to skill-building and citing newly released skills-based textbooks as evidence of its continuing relevance. Testimonies of success with the method were proffered, for example, “my students consistently state it is the most practical and valuable course in their entire coursework” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1052562912436516">Wall, 2011</xref>) and “students come away fundamentally different if they put the time in” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1052562912436516">Lund Dean, 2011</xref>). Negative comments centered on how labor and time-intensive these courses are to teach, how they require small class sizes that may not be economically justifiable, and the sometimes superficial nature of these courses, that is, they can be “a mile wide, inch deep.” Again, no definitive conclusions can be drawn from this limited, anecdotal feedback. Given that skills teaching was first popularized in the 1980s, it seems the time may be right for a formal, empirical analysis of the extent of use, delivery formats (e.g., “pure” skills courses vs. more traditional OB courses that include some skill-building content), and assessment of learning outcomes. Next, some issues critics have raised about attempting to teach management skills in the classroom are considered.</p>

<title>Criticisms of Managerial Skills Teaching and Responses</title>
<p>Three interrelated criticisms of managerial skill-building in the classroom need to be given their due. Probably the critique that appears most often in the literature is that managerial skills teaching is overly simplistic. That is, presenting and practicing managerial behavioral guidelines may end up promoting a “one best way” approach that does not reflect the complex, contingent, and interactive nature of managerial work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1052562912436516">Bigelow, 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1052562912436516">1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1052562912436516">Bradford, 1983b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1052562912436516">Waters et al., 1983</xref>). A second, related issue is the lack of skill integration in many skill-building courses. That is, individual skills are often covered sequentially, one by one, following a conventional textbook approach to topic coverage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1052562912436516">Bigelow, 1983</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1052562912436516">1993</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1052562912436516">Vaill (1983)</xref>, for one, questions this “list-like nature” of managerial competency studies and training (p. 51). From these two perceived faults with skills teaching comes a third, more significant and troubling implication: perhaps what is learned in a managerial skill-building course never leaves the classroom (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1052562912436516">Albanese, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1052562912436516">Bigelow, 1995</xref>). Students may perform as they need to for the purposes of achieving a desired course grade, proving they have learned the skills to the instructor’s satisfaction. The realities of the manager’s job they confront later on, however, do not match very well the clear prompts they responded to in role plays and simulations used in class (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1052562912436516">Bigelow, 1995</xref>). As a result, graduates may fail to see opportunities to apply the managerial skills they practiced in class, and instead rely on reflexive, intuitive behaviors in real-life work situations. These three concerns, to the extent they are valid, damage the credibility of the skill-building approach to management education.</p>
<p>What should those of us teaching management skills classes, or others involved in developing curricula at a program level, do, then, in response to these concerns? <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1052562912436516">Mintzberg (2004)</xref> argues that we need to reexamine who are student audience should be. He asserts that business schools are training the wrong people—“management education should be restricted to practicing managers” (p. 243). His view is that managers cannot be created in business school, but existing managers can create a “rich arena for learning” in the classroom. They do this by bringing their experience to bear on analyzing cases, considering theory, and simply sharing how they practice competencies effectively, and less so, in their jobs. His argument is well reasoned and may, in a few isolated cases, spur a review of MBA program admission requirements. It seems unlikely, however, that the majority of graduate business classes will be populated exclusively with seasoned managers in the near future. As well, undergraduate business programs, often filled with college-age students with little or no work experience, will remain popular. Should we give up on attempting to teach management skills to these students, even though we know many of them will be entering jobs directly after graduation that require them, for example, to communicate, delegate, and manage conflicts?</p>
<p>A review of the literature reveals some potential solutions to the problems critics have cited concerning skills teaching. Beginning with what may be the most serious concern—students may never apply their newly learned skills beyond the classroom—numerous ideas for skill application assignments are available, as summarized earlier in the discussion of the final step of the learning model. Two additional suggestions for addressing the transfer-of-learning problem are considered in greater depth here. First, instructors can assign as part of the course requirements the development of an individually tailored application plan and hold students accountable for implementing it and evaluating its results. An example of such an assignment is found at the end of each chapter in the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1052562912436516">Whetten and Cameron (2011)</xref> text. Part 1, written and turned in during the first month of the course, involves identifying one cluster of management skills from the text that the student wants to work on outside of class during the remainder of the term. Students fully describe the real-life setting for their personal application plans, including when, where, and who else will be involved. They then operationalize their plans by describing the specific behaviors they will employ, consistent with the principles from the relevant text chapter, and the indicators or measures they will use to gauge success. Part 2, due at the end of the course, is the evaluation step in which students report the results of implementing their plans and what they have learned through the exercise, for instance, what they would do differently in a similar situation in the future.</p>
<p>The author has used the personal application plan assignment in a managerial skill-building course and found students were able to create a wide variety of innovative, individually meaningful plans for transferring course learning outside the classroom. As one example, a student wrote a plan for improving his skills in fostering team development and performance; his application context was an Honors Program Council in which members’ attendance and willingness to volunteer for tasks were distressingly low. Another student chose creative problem-solving as the skill area most relevant for him in his role as fraternity treasurer. He set a specific goal of requiring two different problem definitions and five different alternative solutions for each problem he faced as treasurer during the term. He kept a written record of his actual performance versus these goals, and also whether or not the problems he faced were indeed effectively solved by generating more problem definitions and alternatives.</p>
<p>Another technique for facilitating skills transfer is through a journal assignment. As compared with the application plan, journaling allows for a more informal, but more comprehensive in terms of skill coverage, consideration of personal application opportunities. One example for structuring a journal assignment in a skill-building course is to require an entry for each skill chapter that addresses three straightforward questions: “what,” “so what,” and “now what?” That is, what self-insights have the students gained as a result of the assessment and skill practice activities completed for that chapter, what are the implications of this now and in the future, at work, school, or in other contexts, and what do they need to do going forward as a result of this learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1052562912436516">McEvoy, 2011</xref>)? Requiring students to turn in their journals frequently, as opposed to once at term end, encourages frequent and ongoing consideration of the outside-of-class application of the skills they are working on during the course.</p>
<p>Next, with regard to the criticism of the artificial nature of teaching skills one-by-one without sufficient integration, a “skills layering” approach has been suggested. One might view this as “you have to start somewhere.” That is, discrete, primary skills need to be taught first as a foundation, before students can be expected to integrate them to tackle complex problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1052562912436516">Bigelow, 1983</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1052562912436516">1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1052562912436516">Waters et al., 1983</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1052562912436516">Bigelow (1996)</xref> likens this to physical skills training; one learns the basics and then progresses to more sophisticated skill combinations. Applying this idea to management skills training, students might learn basic communication and active listening skills, for instance, before progressing to more advanced skills, such as conflict handling and negotiation, and then apply what they have learned in a realistic simulation that attempts to reproduce the competing issues endemic to management problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1052562912436516">Bigelow, 1996</xref>). The previously discussed case-based final exam developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1052562912436516">DiStefano and Howell (1990)</xref> is a concrete example of how this layering approach might work. A related technique involves breaking up a management skill area into several component “micro skills.” For instance, “active listening” may be drilled down into components including paraphrasing, using clarification probes, and asking open-ended questions. After students master the micro skills, they can be combined with others to serve different purposes, such as solving problems or managing conflicts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1052562912436516">Hunt &amp; Sorenson, 2001</xref>). Still another creative approach for promoting skill integration is the “business skills laboratory,” or BSL. This ambitious endeavor involves creating within the classroom environment a fictitious business in which students are employees who must handle an ongoing series of dilemmas over the course of the term, ranging from day-to-day issues such as dissatisfied customers and employee absenteeism to crisis management and ethical challenges; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1052562912436516">Blaylock, McDaniel, Falk, Hollandsworth, and Kopf (2009)</xref> for an extensive discussion of this innovative, scenario-based pedagogy. As a final point here, it should be noted that some skills texts provide exercises and homework assignments specifically geared toward skill integration as well as holistic role plays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1052562912436516">Bigelow, 1993</xref>). Skill integration activities, given their more realistic nature, may have the added benefit of increasing the likelihood students will carryover learning to post–graduation contexts because these activities will more closely mirror situations experienced on the job.</p>
<p>Finally, regarding the concern that the message “there is one best way to manage” may be implicitly communicated to students through skills training, this outcome can be avoided through framing the presentation of behavioral principles as “one good way for many situations,” allowing for individual differences and refinements, instead of “this is the one best way” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1052562912436516">Waters et al., 1983</xref>, p. 38). Another suggestion is to communicate to students that a variety of approaches are often possible for handling a given dilemma; within some overarching guidelines, there is room to create alternatives that suit one’s personal style and situational conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1052562912436516">Bigelow, 1993</xref>). Additionally, some instructors deliberately emphasize both the pros and cons of different behavioral choices, provide models that show both stronger and weaker examples, and use multiple student role plays of the same task or scenario (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1052562912436516">Bigelow, 1993</xref>).</p>
<p>To improve the effectiveness of managerial skills teaching, then, several concluding recommendations emerge from this review. One, as observed earlier in discussing the unique challenges of skills teaching, substantial time needs to be consistently devoted to skills practice, so that students can achieve a comfort level with new skills that makes it more likely they will actually use them outside of class. Two, assignments should be made that specifically focus on broadening students’ awareness of the current and future real-life applications for the skills they are learning; see the application plan and journaling assignments, above, for two examples. Three, attention needs to be paid to the final skill layer—providing opportunities for students trained in individual skills to apply them in an integrative way. Several suggestions were provided regarding this objective. Four, instructors should be sure to acknowledge the need for flexibility and context-appropriate management responses when presenting and discussing behavioral principles with students.</p>
<p>Although the literature review presented in this article uncovered a rather substantial number of challenges and concerns associated with managerial skills teaching, it seems appropriate to end by noting that it also revealed a theme of educators’ excitement, fulfillment, and continuing dedication to this approach. To wit: “These methods . . . have enormously enriched our lives on both a personal and professional level,” “We have . . . seen ever more clearly the intimate links between theory and practice, concepts and skills” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1052562912436516">DiStefano &amp; Howell, 1990</xref>, p. 12), “One thing about it—I <italic>never</italic> get tired of teaching that course” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1052562912436516">Bigelow, 1983</xref>, p. 34), and “More than before, I feel I am facilitating enduring developments in students’ skillfulness” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1052562912436516">Bigelow, 1995</xref>, p. 324).</p>
