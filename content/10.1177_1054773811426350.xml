<p>The purpose of study was to examine relationships between social support and anxiety in pregnant and postpartum women. Hypotheses were that there will be an inverse relationship between social support and anxiety in pregnancy and the postpartum. The sample consisted of 177 women. The Personal Resource Questionnaire (PRQ) 85—Part 2 and the State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) were used. The STAI demonstrated coefficient alphas from 0.90 to 0.93; 0.87 and 0.93 for the PRQ. All five hypotheses were supported—social support and state anxiety in pregnancy (<italic>r</italic> = −.308, <italic>p</italic> = .000) and trait anxiety (<italic>r</italic> = −.420, <italic>p</italic> = .000) and postpartum (<italic>r</italic> = −.497, <italic>p</italic> = .000) and social support and state anxiety in the postpartum (<italic>r</italic> = −.375, <italic>p</italic> = .000) and trait anxiety (<italic>r</italic> = −.276, <italic>p</italic> = .013). Findings are relevant to advance nursing theory, science, and practice. Nurses must understand these complex processes to effectively intervene.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Social support and anxiety are important concepts in nursing research. A pregnant woman’s lack of perceived support or the presence of maternal anxiety can affect the pregnant patient and her fetus, as well as all members of the entire family system. Furthermore, it has been found that many factors including satisfaction with social support and maternal anxiety may significantly influence a woman’s ability to recover during the postpartum period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1054773811426350">McVeigh, 2002</xref>). Factors interfering with this process of recovery could impede newborn care, self-care, and the nurturing of other family members and relationships.</p>
<p>Social support and anxiety are well-developed concepts which have been explored in the nursing literature as well as that of related disciplines. Social support and anxiety have been theoretically defined. Social support has been defined as the six categories of relational provisions: attachment, social integration, the opportunity for nurturance, a reassurance of worth, a sense of reliable alliance, and the obtaining of guidance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1054773811426350">Weiss, 1974</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1054773811426350">Spielberger (1966)</xref> defined anxiety as both subjective feelings of apprehension and activation of the autonomic nervous system and, in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1054773811426350">Spielberger, 1983</xref>), as a nonobservable subjective experience that is unpleasant, uncomfortable, and characterized by feelings of dread, apprehension, and tension. Anxiety is comprised of both state and trait anxiety. State anxiety (A-State) is conceptualized as a transitory emotional state or condition that is characterized by subjective, consciously perceived feelings of tension and apprehension and heightened autonomic system activity, whereas trait anxiety (A-Trait) refers to relatively stable individual differences in anxiety proneness or differences between people in the tendency to respond to situations perceived as threatening in A-State intensity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1054773811426350">Gaudry &amp; Speilberger, 1971</xref>).</p>
<p>This secondary analysis of longitudinal data was part of a larger study which explored a variety of concepts relevant to pregnant and postpartum women, some of which have been previously published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1054773811426350">Aktan, 2010</xref>). In this study, social support was operationally defined by the Personal Resource Questionnaire (PRQ-85 Part 2). Anxiety was operationally defined by Spielberger’s State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). The aims of the present study were to test the theories of the Roy adaptation model by examining the relationships between social support and state and trait anxiety in a sample of healthy pregnant and postpartum women.</p>
<p>The theories from Roy’s adaptation model have been used as the conceptualization of this study, as well as the primary one, and were previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1054773811426350">Aktan, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1054773811426350">Roy, 1984</xref>). According to Roy’s theory, the four adaptive modes are interrelated (physiologic, self-concept, interdependence, role function) and behavior in one mode may have an effect on or act as the stimulus for one or all of the other modes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1054773811426350">Roy &amp; Andrews, 1986</xref>). The theoretical underpinnings of the present study were founded on the basis that social support reflect Roy’s interdependence mode whereas anxiety reflects the self-concept mode. Therefore, the interrelationship between interdependence and self-concept is evident as each will affect the other as the individual adapts effectively through the process of role transition from pregnancy to the postpartum period. However, an inability by the individual to adapt effectively will impede optimal functioning by the new mother, as well as by the infant and the entire family system. Roy’s adaptation model, a systematic framework to guide nursing activities, serves as a basis for knowledge development as it guides nursing practice as well as nursing research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1054773811426350">Roy &amp; Andrews, 1999</xref>) and was an appropriate theoretical framework for this study.</p>
<p>The existing literature describes the importance of evaluating perceived social support and anxiety in pregnant and postpartum women. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1054773811426350">Mercer and Ferketich (1988)</xref> studied the effect of social support on anxiety in a sample of 153 high-risk and 218 low-risk women during the 24th to 34th week of pregnancy and found that support predicted 26.25% of anxiety in low-risk women and 10.04% on high-risk women. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1054773811426350">Norbeck and Anderson (1989)</xref> studied the effects of social support and anxiety from mid to late pregnancy in a sample of 190 low-income women. Results demonstrated that low partner support was associated with the highest anxiety.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1054773811426350">Tulman, Fawcett, Groblewski, and Silverman (1990)</xref> explored family variables, in the form of support, during the first 6 months following childbirth on a sample of 87 new mothers. Results revealed the significance of several family variables—greater quality of the relationship with husband, maternal perception of father’s participation in child care, and support from friends and family. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1054773811426350">McVeigh (1997a)</xref> reported that 42% of respondents received no extra help from family and friends after childbirth and 38% of those who received help cited their partners as the most supportive in a sample of 132 new mothers.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1054773811426350">Liabsuetrakul, Vittayanont, and Pitanupong (2007)</xref> assessed anxiety and social support on depression during pregnancy and the postpartum. In a sample of 400 women during 36-40 weeks of gestation and 6-8 weeks postpartum, the authors found that during pregnancy a significant predictor of postpartum depression was anxiety and postpartum significant predictors were anxiety and social support. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1054773811426350">Zachariah (2009)</xref> explored social support and anxiety among 111 low-income women in early and late pregnancy and the relationship of these to complications. The most important discriminating factors for prenatal complications were state anxiety and social support.</p>
<p>In summary, a review of the literature suggested that significant relationships exist between the concepts of social support and anxiety in pregnant and postpartum women. This literature review did not incorporate an exploration of postpartum depression. Postpartum depression is a unique concept. This study focused on healthy pregnant and postpartum women. The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1054773811426350">Liabsuetrakul et al. (2007)</xref> study was included in the literature review it incorporated both concepts of interest in this present study—social support and anxiety, which made it relevant to the relationships to be explored.</p>
<p>It is, however, apparent that this review demonstrated a gap in the recent literature of nursing and related disciplines as much of previously published studies were conducted quite some time ago. Much of this research focused on pregnancy, not the postpartum, and none have explored the relationships between these concepts in healthy pregnant and postpartum women. Therefore, further inquiry to examine the relationship between social support and anxiety in pregnant and postpartum women today was needed as the unique needs of women and their families have evolved significantly in recent times.</p>
<p>Specifically, an evolution in social supportive networks is one reason to reinvestigate these concepts. In a study conducted on the discussion networks of Americans over the past two decades it was found that the number of participants reporting there is no one with whom they discuss important matters nearly tripled and that respondents now report having no confidant and that both kin and nonkin networks were lost (McPherson, Smith-Lovin, &amp; Brashears, 2006). This societal change demonstrates a need to further explore the relationship between social support and anxiety throughout the transition from pregnancy to the postpartum.</p>
<p>The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between social support and anxiety during pregnancy and the postpartum periods as no recent study has explored these concepts throughout this period of role transition—from pregnancy and into the postpartum period. The study findings can be applied to advance nursing theory, science, and practice.</p>

<sec id="section3-1054773811426350">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>The primary researcher recruited participants from three sources—childbirth preparation classes held at a local hospital, during prenatal visits at a private obstetrical/gynecological office, and from a local community women’s organization. Institutional Review Board approval was obtained, as well as letters of permission from both the private physician practice and the community organization’s president. After participants signed informed consent, demographic data information and baseline data on the STAI and PRQ-85 Part 2 were obtained.</p>
<p>The sample of convenience consisted of healthy pregnant and postpartum women with no known prenatal or postnatal complications attending childbirth preparation classes or prenatal visits or who are members of or were referred by a local community women’s organization. Pregnant women in their third trimester of gestation meeting the criteria for study comprised the sample of convenience and the sample was delimited to pregnant women who can read and comprehend English. Nonprobability sampling was used after a power analysis was performed a priori to determine and ensure the recruitment of an adequate sample size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1054773811426350">Aktan, 2010</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1054773811426350">
<title>Instruments</title>
<p>The PRQ-85 Part 2 and the STAI have both previously demonstrated acceptable reliability and criterion-related construct and content validity as reported by a variety of authors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1054773811426350">Aaronson, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1054773811426350">Aktan, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1054773811426350">Brandt &amp; Weinert, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1054773811426350">Long &amp; Weinert, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1054773811426350">Spielberger, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1054773811426350">Weinert, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1054773811426350">Weinert &amp; Brandt, 1987</xref>). The PRQ 85-Part 2, a 7-point Likert-type format, is composed of 25 items. Higher scores indicate increased social support (total scores ranging from 25 to 175).</p>
<p>The STAI is a self-report scale with the S-Anxiety scale consisting of 20 statements that evaluate how one feels “right now, at this moment,” whereas the T-Anxiety scale is comprised of 20 statements that assess how respondents generally feel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1054773811426350">Spielberger, 1983</xref>). Higher scores indicate higher anxiety (total scores ranging from 20 to 80 for each). There has been a great deal of literature published to support the tool’s reliability and construct validity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1054773811426350">Aktan, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1054773811426350">Spielberger, 1983</xref>). Baseline data on state as well as trait anxiety were collected. This was done as it was determined to be equally important to determine how the pregnant women felt at the moment they completed the questionnaires, as well as how they generally felt.</p>
<p>During the second phase of data collection which took place at approximately 6 weeks postpartum, the women received the mailed instrument packets with completion instructions in their homes along with postage paid return envelopes. Participants were asked to include their delivery date on the completed packet to ensure their completion took place at the appropriate postpartum time period. The participants were asked to complete the State Version of the STAI and the PRQ-85 Part 2 during this time period.</p>
<p>As was previously reported, descriptive statistics were used to characterize the study variables and the sample and coefficient alpha reliabilities of the instruments used to measure the study variables were assessed. Using a two-tailed test, the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient was used to test the hypotheses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1054773811426350">Aktan, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Two hundred forty-four pregnant women were approached and agreed to participate in the first part of the study and of these, 177 women (73%) completed the entire study. The final sample of 177 women ranged in age from 19 to 40 years (<italic>M</italic> = 32, <italic>SD</italic> = 4.138). Of these, 107 (60.5%) were first time mothers, 55 (31.1%) were having their second child, 13 (7.3%) were having their third child, 1 (1.0%) was having her fourth and fifth child, respectively. One hundred and forty-eight women (83.6%) were White, 7 (4.0%) were Asian, 3 (1.7%) were African American, 14 (7.9%) were Latino, 4 (2.3%) reported other and 1 (1.0% did not report race). Twenty (11.3%) of the respondents were high school graduates, 12 (6.8%) had associate degrees, 86 (48.9%) had a bachelors degree, 51 (28.8%) had a masters degree, 6 (3.4%) had beyond a masters degree, and 2 (1.1%) did not report educational background. One hundred and thirty-three of the participants (75.1%) reported their husband as the primary source of support, 4 (2.3%) reported themselves, 4 (2.3%) reported boyfriends, 2 (1.1%) each reported partner or other, and 32 (18.1%) did not answer the question. Ninety-one women (51.4%) reported intent to breastfeed, 16 (9.0%) reported intent to bottle feed, 51 (28.8%) reported both, 16 (9.0%) were not sure, and 3 (1.7%) did not report.</p>

<p>As was reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1054773811426350">Aktan (2010)</xref>, for the STAI, which measured state-trait anxiety, scores ranged from 20 to 72 (<italic>M</italic> = 35.34, <italic>SD</italic> = 9.91) for Time 1 Form Y-1 (state anxiety), from 20 to 77 (<italic>M</italic> = 33.47, <italic>SD</italic> = 10.27) for Time 2 Form Y-1, and from 20-61 (<italic>M</italic> = 35.17, <italic>SD</italic> = 8.34) for Form Y-2 (trait anxiety). On the PRQ85—Part 2, which measured social support, the scores ranged from 100 to 175 (<italic>M</italic> = 152.83, <italic>SD</italic> = 14.24) for Time 1 and from 30 to 175 (<italic>M</italic> = 153.11, <italic>SD</italic> = 19.67) for Time 2. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1054773811426350">Table 1</xref> represents a summary of these findings.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The purpose of this study was to examine the relationships between social support and state and trait anxiety in women during both pregnancy and the postpartum periods. It was hypothesized that there would be an inverse relationship between social support and state and trait anxiety in pregnancy and the postpartum. These inverse relationships between the concepts of interest were demonstrated by the previous theoretical and empirical literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1054773811426350">Liabsuetrakul et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1054773811426350">McVeigh 1997a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1054773811426350">Mercer &amp; Ferketich, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1054773811426350">Norbeck &amp; Anderson, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1054773811426350">Tulman et al., 1990</xref>) and, in the present study, as all five hypotheses were supported.</p>
<p>This study incorporated the theory of The Roy Adaptation Model. In this theory, Roy’s adaptive modes are interrelated and family variables such as social support reflect the interdependence mode and anxiety reflects the self-concept mode (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1054773811426350">Roy, 1984</xref>). Adaptation problems in any of these areas may interfere with the one’s ability to adapt, or maintain health. This directly relates to the need for nursing interventions to be based on sound theoretical underpinnings supported by empirical findings. This study, a secondary analysis of longitudinal data, aimed to explore the theoretical underpinnings of Roy’s adaptation model.</p>
<p>Nursing process guides nursing practice. Nurses are responsible for the assessment of a client’s available social support and levels of state and trait anxiety so they can intervene accordingly. Nursing interventions include education on the importance of supportive networks and strategies to reduce anxiety throughout pregnancy and the postpartum, as well as to educate partners on the importance of providing support and encouraging new mothers to seek out other sources of support, as well as other means of reducing anxiety, to ensure a healthy pregnancy and postpartum period.</p>
<p>Some methodological limitations of the present study exist are described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1054773811426350">Aktan (2010)</xref>. Overall, the sample was relatively homogenous as they were predominately White, married, and educated. Disproportionate numbers of the women in the sample worked, were first time mothers, and cited their husband as the primary person of support. Therefore, these factors limit the ability to generalize the study findings to the general population of pregnant and postpartum women. It is therefore recommended that future studies include samples of more diverse research participants to address this limitation.</p>

<title>Conclusions and Implications</title>
<p>This study aimed to test the theories of the Roy adaptation model by examining the relationships between social support and state and trait anxiety in healthy pregnant and postpartum women. The study incorporated findings from existing published studies that indicate that greater quality of the relationship with husband and maternal perception of the fathers’ involvement influence a woman’s ability to recover during the postpartum period and that the most important discriminating factors for prenatal complications were state anxiety and social support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1054773811426350">McVeigh, 1997b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1054773811426350">Tulman et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1054773811426350">Zachariah, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Theorists and previous researchers have linked social support to anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1054773811426350">Mercer &amp; Ferketich, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1054773811426350">McVeigh 1997a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1054773811426350">Norbeck &amp; Anderson, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1054773811426350">Tulman et al., 1990</xref>). Even most significantly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1054773811426350">Liabsuetrakul et al. (2007)</xref> found that during pregnancy a significant predictor of postpartum depression was anxiety and postpartum significant predictors were anxiety and social support. Further exploration on the relationship between concepts of interest—social support and state and trait anxiety is recommended to support this conclusion as the present study was limited to healthy pregnant and postpartum women.</p>
<p>However, more research on the inverse relationship between social support and state and trait anxiety in pregnant and postpartum women, as was conducted in this study, is needed. In this study, all five hypotheses were supported. It, therefore, can be concluded that the results of the present study indicate and confirm what previous researchers have told us that a significant inverse relationship between social support and state and trait anxiety in pregnancy and the postpartum exists. This knowledge precludes that nurses must adequately assess for a woman’s perceived levels of support as well as for the presence of state and trait anxiety using reliable and valid instruments such as those described to fully understand the complexity of these processes and to facilitate and implement effective nursing interventions.</p>
<p>Building on previous works, the present study aimed at testing relationships between social support and anxiety in pregnant and postpartum women. Previous work has demonstrated that higher levels of anxiety will impact a new mother’s effective resumption of previous role functioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1054773811426350">Aktan, 2010</xref>). Nurses are responsible for the assessment of a client’s level of anxiety and perceived social support, as well as for educating them on the importance of supportive relationships and positive strategies for reducing their levels of anxiety.</p>
<p>Educational programming, forming and facilitating support groups, and other nursing interventions should also then include how anxiety could have adverse effects on the infant and the family, possibly interfering with the process of maternal-infant bonding. It is recommended that these types of health promotion strategies take place during every patient and family encounter and can include assisting new mothers in the importance of decreasing their levels of anxiety. They could do so by learning to manage tasks adaptively and seek help and support when necessary.</p>
<p>The theoretical and empirical findings of this study provide for the direction of future research. The results demonstrate a need for further inquiry into the relationships between the concepts of social support and state and trait anxiety in pregnant women and throughout the postpartum period. Some additional recommendations to guide the research process include: the replication of the present study using a random sample of socially and culturally diverse pregnant and postpartum women and to consider the inclusion of other more diverse groups of women and families as presented in the limitations of study. Further replication studying families of single pregnancies versus those delivering multiples would further add to the depth and breadth of this current body of knowledge as this was not explored in the present study.</p>
<p>These important factors for future exploration will truly enrich the knowledge to be gained from additional inquiry into these essential relationships. This evidence is applicable to nursing professionals engaged in working directly with the population of interest as well as those working with clients in a variety of settings who may encounter pregnant and postpartum women and their families.</p>
<p>Overall, this study demonstrates that a significant inverse relationship between social support and state and trait anxiety in pregnancy and the postpartum exists. Nurses must assess for anxiety and social support, as well as to educate clients on the importance of supportive relationships and strategies for reducing anxiety. This will promote an effective role transition through these stages of development, facilitating adaptation. Further inquiry into the relationships between social support and state and trait anxiety during these stages of development is needed.</p>
