<abstract>
<p>This paper examines the experiences of secondary victims of wrongful conviction, including the children of appellants and those families suffering bereavement following homicide. Most wives, mothers and children affected by miscarriages of justice continued to suffer from symptoms associated with post-traumatic stress disorder despite the appellant’s quashed conviction and release from the Court of Appeal (Criminal Division). In cases where the victim of crime (where alive) and defendant come from the same family the trauma experienced by the appellant and family can be catastrophic, leading to broken relationships and prolonged trauma. This paper will examine the consequences of families’ victimisation and consider those factors that contribute further to their pain. The article will conclude that most secondary victims continue to suffer from their traumatic experiences and that the children of appellants suffer particularly from the injustice of learning to cope with the wrongful conviction and imprisonment of a parent.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0004865812470384" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>In November 1999 Sally Clarke was wrongly convicted of the murder of two of her sons at Chester Crown Court in the United Kingdom. The prosecution case was that Clarke had smothered her children. The convictions were upheld at appeal in October 2000 but were quashed by the Court of Appeal (Criminal Division) in January 2003. Following her successful appeal, Clarke returned to the family home and was supported by her husband and extended family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0004865812470384">Batt, 2005</xref>). Despite this, Clarke was never able to fully recover from her experiences and developed psychiatric problems, including alcohol dependency. Clarke died of acute alcohol intoxication in 2007 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0004865812470384">Shaikh, 2007</xref>) leaving a husband and young son to cope with her death. This case is illustrative of other cases involving victims of wrongful conviction and their families. The experience of being convicted and imprisoned for an offence they did not commit can lead to many victims suffering from symptoms associated with post-traumatic stress syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0004865812470384">Grounds, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0004865812470384">Simon, 1993</xref>). The psychological and emotional trauma can similarly affect the family of appellants including their children. Families continuing to reside in the locality where the offence took place can feel stigmatised by their local community. Some express concern that neighbours and work colleagues distance themselves from them. The children of many families routinely have to leave their local school because of anxiety and bullying. Marital relationships suffer, with many released appellants indicating they are either divorced or estranged from their spouse within two years of their release despite the quashing of the conviction. An additional challenge for some secondary victims concerns those cases where the ‘victim’ comes from the same family unit as the appellant. In cases where the victim is the spouse, child or other close family member, the defendant and other family members have to negotiate a difficult pathway through the criminal justice system. The process of grieving can mean that coping with the investigation and their immediate circumstances become even more problematic for the defendant and their family.</p>
<p>This paper will explore the traumatic experiences of secondary victims of wrongful conviction in England and Wales. The particular focus of the paper is on the negative effects experienced by the wives and children of appellants during imprisonment and post-release. Most children indicated that they continued to suffer from depression and anxiety as a direct consequence of their experiences, particularly when the wrongfully convicted person was a parent. During imprisonment and post-release the secondary victims experienced additional challenges including that the conviction and release of the appellant sometimes led to split allegiances within the primary and extended family. The article builds on an earlier research project which took three years to complete leading to the award of PhD in 2011. The original thesis examined the dynamics of pressure groups campaigning against miscarriages of justice in England and Wales and involved participant observation and interviews with activists, judicial practitioners and with appellants and their families. The research methods used also included the analysis of documentary evidence. The project involved data collection with 132 participants including 27 primary victims of wrongful conviction. The participants were observed over three years and during the course of the study 55 of these participants were interviewed regularly over a two-year period. Most secondary victims interviewed or observed were women as they constituted the leadership of most campaign groups. Later interviews were conducted with victims of crime (n = 17) and with 13 children of a released parent and victim of wrongful conviction. The children (eight boys and five girls) were aged between 12 and 17 years old and were interviewed with a parent in attendance.</p>
<p>The participants chose to refer to themselves as ‘victims’ of wrongful conviction regardless of whether they were a primary or secondary victim. Most remained active in campaigning against miscarriages of justice, despite the conviction having been quashed. They did not view their activities or personal identification as that of ‘passive’ victim, but as victims actively protesting against injustice. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0004865812470384">Walklate (1993)</xref> suggests that although the argument is sometimes framed in oppositional terms it is possible to see ‘victim’ and ‘survivor’ as denoting different aspects of the existential journey of the individual. In situations where individuals have experienced a traumatic event they might be ‘active or passive victims’ or ‘active or passive survivors’ depending on their own path to recovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0004865812470384">Walklate, 2004</xref>: 54). For the purposes of this paper participants will be referred to as ‘victims’ of wrongful conviction. Throughout the paper the ‘wrongful conviction’ of participants denotes that the conviction has been quashed by the Court of Appeal (Criminal Division). All primary victims of wrongful conviction stated they were factually innocent of the crimes for which they had been imprisoned. The paper, however, makes no comment on the factual innocence of any participant. Throughout the trial process the defendant is accorded the ‘presumption of innocence’ whereby they are assumed ‘innocent until proven guilty’ and the ‘standard of proof’ required to convict is guilt ‘beyond reasonable doubt’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0004865812470384">Ashworth and Redmayne, 2005</xref>). During appeal proceedings the appellant and defence do not have to ‘prove innocence’ as this is not the purpose of the appeal and as such the term is rarely used in court (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0004865812470384">Nobles and Schiff, 2002</xref>). The appeal court considers itself the ‘court of review’ and its role is only to determine whether a conviction is ‘safe’ or ‘unsafe’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0004865812470384">Hungerford-Welch, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>An important aspect of the research which generated this article is that it was conducted by a researcher engaged in research with a community of which they are a member. I was wrongly convicted of murder and served six years imprisonment of a life sentence before my conviction was quashed by the Court of Appeal (Criminal Division) in 2004. In February 2006 (following two retrials) I was formally acquitted, having experienced three murder trials (two at the ‘Old Bailey’ in central London); a two-year investigation by the Criminal Cases Review Commission and two appeals at the Royal Courts of Justice in London. During my incarceration I campaigned against my conviction and worked with legal teams, private investigators, investigative journalists, forensic experts and supporters, including family and friends. I was contacted by pressure groups campaigning against miscarriages of justice including INNOCENT, Miscarriages of Justice UK, United against Injustice, the Miscarriages of Justice Organisation and Anarchist Black Cross. After my release from imprisonment and following my decision to conduct doctoral research, I approached both primary and secondary victims to discuss their involvement in a study which aimed to further understanding into miscarriages of justice, victims discourse and the criminal justice system. Conducting reflexive ‘insider’ research presented methodological challenges during the study and research strategies were employed, including the triangulation of data to ameliorate against possible research bias. An unexpected consequence of the study was that friendship groups developed between the researcher and researched participants, usually after conducting interviews and observation in participants’ family homes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0004865812470384">Jenkins, 2012</xref>). The families appeared to regard me as a friend and victim of miscarriages of justice and not principally as a social scientist. Despite the challenge of negotiating between the dual roles of researcher and ‘victim’ of miscarriages of justice, the study produced data that was ‘thick’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0004865812470384">Geertz, 1973</xref>) and which provided insight into the experiences of participants campaigning against wrongful conviction. The process of engaging with the subject of wrongful conviction and investigating previous locations and experiences of trauma similarly contributed to my own recovery as a survivor of wrongful conviction and provided the participants with opportunities to reflect on and re-assess their own beliefs, preoccupations and attitudes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0004865812470384">Jenkins, 2012</xref>: 11–13).</p>

<sec id="sec2-0004865812470384"><title>Victims’ perspectives: The trauma of wrongful conviction and imprisonment</title>
<p>The families of appellants, often the spouse, children, sibling or parents, indicated that they had suffered significant trauma following the appellant’s wrongful conviction and imprisonment. Wives and partners stated that coping with family life during the period of wrongful imprisonment was distressing, particularly in relation to supporting their children. Most families had experienced extreme financial hardship due to loss of income (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0004865812470384">Braman and Wood, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0004865812470384">Noble, 1995</xref>), with some families being forced to sell or leave the family home. Twenty-three wives or partners indicated that any disposable income was used to pay solicitors’ fees and to initiate and support the family’s campaign against conviction. Partners and wives suggested they had experienced relational difficulties in the workplace and in their local community. The wife of an appellant convicted of murder commented:<disp-quote>
<p>After he was convicted I couldn’t walk out … shopping was hard as I knew people were whispering about me … work was no better … sometimes I was ignored … if it wasn’t that I was called names behind my back. (Secondary Victim of Wrongful Conviction: Participant 3)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0004865812470384">Howarth and Rock (2000)</xref> examining the impact of serious crime on the relatives of offenders suggested that many were not accorded sympathy and could not change others’ negative perceptions regarding their status following the offence. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0004865812470384">Condry (2007)</xref> similarly examines the issue of ‘family blaming’, whereby the family of offenders become targets of societal disapproval leading to stigmatisation. It appeared that some viewed the relatives of ‘offenders’ as being less than wholly innocent. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0004865812470384">Goffman (1963: 3)</xref> defined stigma in his eponymous book as ‘ … an attribute that is deeply discrediting’. Most families, including their children, shared that they had been labelled, stereotyped and discriminated against because of their family’s experience of wrongful conviction. The sister of an appellant since released by the Court of Appeal commented:<disp-quote>
<p>Now things are good but when he was convicted it was like we had contributed to him doing it … my mother was treated as if she was responsible … people in my area even blamed me for starting up his campaign. (Secondary Victim: Participant 1)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0004865812470384">Morris (1965)</xref> found that feelings of stigma were experienced primarily by wives whose husbands were imprisoned for the first time and usually at the beginning of their imprisonment. Fourteen wives or partners in this study, however, suggested that their feelings of stigmatisation continued throughout the imprisonment, leading many to exchange previous friendship groups and familiar places for locations where they were not known and to associate with others similarly affected by miscarriages of justice. Some wives and mothers found that their experience of being stigmatised receded following the appellant’s referral back to the Court of Appeal via the Criminal Cases Review Commission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0004865812470384">Keirle, 2010</xref>). A referral back to the Court of Appeal appeared to persuade friends and neighbours that the protestations of innocence by the appellant and family must have some merit as so few appeared to be referred following the loss of their first appeal. A mother who had been the target of insults following her son’s conviction for murder commented:<disp-quote>
<p>It’s always been hard for us but when we heard the CCRC were sending him back [to the Court of Appeal] then it did change for us … people wished me luck and said positive things … it made a difference. (Secondary Victim: Participant 49)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>The wives, mothers and girlfriends of victims suggested, however, that although their lives had improved in terms of feeling less stigmatised following the appellant’s referral back to Court of Appeal, most indicated that their lives actually ceased being their own from the moment of conviction, and that since the quashing of the conviction their lives continued to be negatively affected by their experience of victimisation.</p>
<p>In relation to the discourse of innocence, secondary victims indicated that belief in the innocence of the appellant had sustained them through disappointments and setbacks while fighting the conviction. The families in all cases did not believe that their son, father or husband might be guilty and could not understand why, having reviewed the evidence, a jury had convicted. The families regarded factual innocence as axiomatic to notions of wrongful conviction and were usually supported by support groups who similarly stressed that their purpose was to support people campaigning for wrongfully convicted ‘innocent’ appellants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0004865812470384">London against Injustice, 2012</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0004865812470384">Quirk (2007</xref>: 776) examining the concept of innocence suggests that ‘ … despite the moral and political impact of innocence cases … it is imperative to resist allowing the criminal justice debate to degenerate into competing claims of guilt versus innocence’. Quirk’s argument is that in most cases it is impossible to know if a defendant is factually innocent and that raising the threshold by which appellants have their convictions quashed would result in poor justice and the abrogation of fundamental due process safeguards. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0004865812470384">Roberts (2003)</xref> likewise suggests that focusing on innocence could undermine the administration of due process and unwittingly lead to more miscarriages of justice. For the released victims of wrongful imprisonment and their families, however, the issue of innocence was of paramount importance and reflected not only on their campaign but how they conceptualised their sense of identity and notions of ‘self’. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0004865812470384">Goffman (1963</xref>: 5), examining issues of personal identity in public institutions (including prisons), suggests that some individuals ‘possess … an undesired differentness’ and that this can lead to such persons seeking ways to adjust to their situation. For some participants their sense of identity appeared to be ‘spoiled’ following the charge and conviction, and their campaign of innocence appeared to represent an opportunity to transform their perceptions of self.</p>

<sec id="sec3-0004865812470384"><title>Children of the appellant and wrongful conviction</title>
<p>For children caught up in the criminal justice system, when a parent is wrongfully convicted the consequences are similarly traumatic and distressing. At a recent demonstration in London on 9 October 2010 organised by activists campaigning against miscarriage of justice, a significant number of children attended the march from Trafalgar Square to Parliament. The effects, however, of imprisonment generally on children are difficult to assess as it involves examination of related features that include involvement with the criminal justice process and imprisonment, as well as poverty and social exclusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0004865812470384">Travis and Waul, 2003</xref>). Similarly, the experiences of individual children suggest that a range of viewpoints needs to be considered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0004865812470384">Boswell, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Although studies indicate that in neighbourhoods with high imprisonment rates children might feel less stigma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0004865812470384">Schwartz and Weintraub, 1974</xref>), the sense of injustice and misunderstanding concerning wrongful conviction can sometimes place additional strains on the families of appellants. Despite the difficulties posed in assessing the negative effects of imprisonment on children, certain characteristics suggest that the imprisonment of a parent feels like ‘bereavement’, with children exhibiting behaviours and emotions linked to the processes of grieving (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0004865812470384">Van Nijnatten, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>Children suffer many problems as a consequence of a parent being imprisoned, including depression, aggressive behaviour, regression, eating disorders and poor school performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0004865812470384">Boswell and Wedge, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0004865812470384">Sharp and Marcus-Mendoza, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0004865812470384">Stanton, 1980</xref>). Other psychological consequences include withdrawal, detachment, low self-esteem and behavioural problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0004865812470384">Eddy and Reid, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0004865812470384">Johnston, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0004865812470384">Philbrick, 1996</xref>). Some children blame themselves, particularly if they are not present when the parent is first arrested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0004865812470384">Mazza, 2002</xref>). Alternatively children sometimes suffer from the consequences of being present at the parent’s arrest leading to feelings of shock, stress, confusion and instability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0004865812470384">Van Nijnatten, 1998</xref>). A participant aged 15 years old commented:<disp-quote>
<p>It was the worst day of my life … they arrived early in the morning and arrested him and took him away from me … I was in the room when they handcuffed him … I thought for years I should have done something to stop them. (Secondary Victim: Participant 128)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>While it is difficult to assess the level of suffering felt by children, research suggests that the experience of parental imprisonment does generate negative consequences (Boswell and Wedge, 2001). While many of the negative consequences of long-term imprisonment are experienced by the rightly and wrongfully convicted alike, the victim of wrongful conviction and their family appear to suffer the pains of injustice leading to ‘chronic feelings of bitterness’ and ‘unresolved feelings of loss’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0004865812470384">Grounds, 2004</xref>: 170). Many families spoke of the resentment they felt against criminal justice agencies and that their lives had changed irrevocably despite the quashing of the conviction. For the children of appellants, the wrongful conviction of a parent sometimes resulted in them breaking criminal laws, leading to confrontation with the police. The teenage son of a victim of wrongful conviction commented that his life started to disintegrate after his father lost his first appeal:<disp-quote>
<p>It hit me hard when he went to prison because I always knew he hadn’t done it … I thought the Court of Appeal would see that … when he lost his appeal I went off the rails … got into trouble … I wanted to hurt the police because of what they’d done to my dad … it was all madness. (Secondary Victim: Participant 141)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0004865812470384">Murray and Farrington (2005)</xref> highlight the effects of parental imprisonment on boys’ anti-social behaviour, arguing that imprisonment leads to risk factors for delinquency. While <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0004865812470384">Sack’s (1977)</xref> study of eight boys with fathers in prison suggested that the boys had mimicked their fathers’ criminality, the children of wrongfully convicted appellants appeared to engage in anti-social behaviour as a means of challenging authority, particularly against criminal justice agencies. Two girls and five boys from wrongfully convicted families had engaged in serious anti-social behaviour leading to censure either from their school or the police, but the children indicated that their behaviour was a direct response to their father’s wrongful conviction and their family’s suffering. The 16-year-old daughter of a released appellant commented:<disp-quote>
<p>For us it was hard because they’d taken my dad like he was something bad … I wasn’t being told to do this and that as if life went on normally … everything changed for us so I didn’t cooperate with anyone. (Secondary Victim: Participant 53)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Thirteen children of appellants were interviewed for this study and nine indicated that they had been bullied and suffered from the stigma associated with a parent’s conviction and imprisonment. Most had been teased at school and three children had been harassed by the local media. All the children indicated that their experiences had led to profound unhappiness, culminating in depression and loss of confidence, with some reporting that they had lost friends and access to important social circles.</p>
<p>During the period of wrongful imprisonment, the children chose to visit their parent and indicated that they enjoyed the experience despite finding the visiting procedures, including the use of closed visits (behind glass) stressful, as articulated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0004865812470384">Boswell and Wedge (2002)</xref>. The children suggested that visits were often highly emotional affairs, with the visitors and appellant crying or oscillating between extreme sadness and exhilaration. At the close of the visit 11 children stated that they suffered from emotional fatigue which often lasted for several days afterwards. The young participants indicated, however, that the visits were an important means of demonstrating to their imprisoned parent that they believed in their innocence. Some indicated that visiting their parent was an opportunity for them to contribute to the campaign against conviction. As one interviewee stated:<disp-quote>
<p>I couldn’t do a lot during our campaign but visiting dad was my way of saying I’m fighting for you. (Secondary Victim: Participant 67)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Ten children indicated that involvement in their parent’s ‘campaign of innocence’ (Secondary Victim: Participant 4) was a crucial aspect of how they viewed their identification with their imprisoned parent and how they remained resilient during the period of imprisonment. The teenage daughter of an appellant since released by the Court of Appeal commented on the arrival of the Statement of Reasons from the CCRC outlining the Commission’s decision to refer back to the Court of Appeal:<disp-quote>
<p>I was so happy when it arrived … we read it together as a family and we read it all night … afterwards my mum put it on the mantelpiece so we could all look at it … it was like a symbol of dad’s innocence … it stayed there until he was free. (Secondary Victim: Participant 41)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>A particular concern for six children was coping with the strain of knowing that their parent was being pressurised by prison staff to accept responsibility for their ‘offence’, despite protesting their innocence. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0004865812470384">Naughton (2005: 2)</xref> argues that the Prison Service ‘ … does not allow for the possibility that some life prisoners might be innocent of the crimes for which they were convicted’. Eight appellants indicated they were unwilling to participate in their annual life sentence planning meetings and were not prepared to cooperate with the prison service, including psychology staff. This act of resistance placed additional strain on the appellant which was then discerned by the appellant’s family during prison visits or telephone calls. An interviewee who was ten years old at the time of his father’s wrongful conviction commented:<disp-quote>
<p>My dad got really upset with them persuading him to say he’s guilty … when we saw him on visits he got really quiet afterwards … I got badly upset afterwards as well. (Secondary Victim: Participant 91)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>For the appellants, too, visits from the family, particularly their children, were an important means of bonding and symbolically demonstrating the family’s need to ‘stick together’ and ‘fight the conviction’ (Secondary Victim: Participant: 64). The desire of the family, including the children, to campaign was a feature of many families’ lives. Some family members were similarly involved in direct action strategies to contest the conviction of an appellant, including demonstrations and attendance at retrials and appeals to support other members of the miscarriages of justice community. Five children had become politicised through campaigning and protesting, and as young adults had now become seasoned activists. A mother discussing her daughter commented:<disp-quote>
<p>She’s always been interested in things around her but when her father was convicted she just threw herself into the campaign and that led her joining other groups. (Secondary Victim: Participant: 71)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0004865812470384">Codd (2008: 63)</xref>, discussing the impact of imprisonment on children, argues that it ‘ … does not fit into neat categories’, particularly as the impact of imprisonment will be interlinked with other ‘life circumstances’. As such the research literature indicates that children can experience ‘ … some, any or all of a range of consequences’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0004865812470384">Codd, 2008</xref>: 78). In relation to the experiences of children who have suffered the trauma of a parent being wrongfully convicted, the question remains whether their ordeal of parental imprisonment differs from that of other children of imprisoned parents? While it is the case that the children interviewed in this study shared many characteristics with other children coping with a parent’s imprisonment, an important difference appears to be their association with pressure groups, protest activities and campaigns against injustice. Most children had become politically engaged through their parent’s campaign against conviction and attended demonstrations, campaign meetings and family events ‘remembering’ the appellant. Four children attended legal meetings with their mother and were familiar with the nomenclature of the legal profession and criminal justice system. Three children had joined other protest groups concerned with issues of social justice, in addition to campaigning against wrongful conviction. The families viewed their campaign and ‘activism’ as a form of political engagement against the criminal justice system and against agencies operating in the system. For many ‘new’ campaigners, the wrongful conviction of a parent consumed their lives particularly during the initial process of familiarisation with the criminal justice system and with the miscarriages of justice community. What was significant was that through the process of recovery some families began to see the wrongful conviction more in terms of systemic error and with those processes and procedures that lead to errors in justice. For some participants wider political engagement contributed to their sense of ‘empowerment’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0004865812470384">Savage et al., 2007</xref>: 19) and ultimately to their recovery as secondary victims of wrongful conviction. The children shared in the process of campaign and from feeling isolated at school and in their local community were able to identify with another community, namely the miscarriages of justice community through campaign and pressure groups. Although the children indicated that campaigning and attending campaign meetings had empowered and supported them while their parent was imprisoned, the return of the parent to the family home continued to frustrate the equilibrium of the family.</p>
<p>Sixteen primary victims of wrongful conviction stated that they continued to suffer from symptoms associated with post-traumatic stress syndrome. During their imprisonment their feelings of despair had been assuaged by the belief that the conviction would eventually be quashed. The release of the appellant, however, following the quashed conviction, often generated other problems regarding adjustment both for the appellant and their family. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0004865812470384">Grounds (2004: 172)</xref> found that some released appellants suffered from ‘lost time’. They had become ‘dislocated in time’ and often thought of themselves psychologically as feeling the age they were at the time of their conviction. This created problems when mixing with peers who had progressed to ‘different stages of life’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0004865812470384">Grounds, 2004</xref>: 172). For some wrongfully imprisoned participants the distress of being separated from their children was the hardest aspect of imprisonment. On their release, most victims of wrongful imprisonment had difficulty rebuilding relationships with their children, some of whom were now young adults.</p>

<sec id="sec4-0004865812470384"><title>Release and adjustment following wrongful imprisonment</title>
<p>The victims of wrongful conviction indicated that on their release they suffered with issues of adaptation, particularly in relation to adapting to home life and living with family members. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0004865812470384">Grounds (2004: 171)</xref> found that at a psychological level, released victims of wrongful conviction had coped with their prison suffering by ‘blocking off painful feelings’ and isolating themselves from the prison regime. The desire of many victims of wrongful conviction to ‘prove their innocence’ often leads them to focus wholly on their cases and evidential matters during imprisonment and to cut themselves off emotionally from partners and family, and although back with their families they continued to adopt the same strategies of ‘withdrawal, self-isolation and uncommunicativeness’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0004865812470384">Grounds, 2004</xref>: 171). This often had the effect of creating tension and upset in the home as family members struggled to understand their behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0004865812470384">Jamieson and Grounds, 2005</xref>: 45). While some successful appellants indicated they had difficulty post-release with various practical skills such as using a mobile telephone or driving a car again, 13 stated that engagement with close family relationships was their principal challenge. True feelings and concerns had been hidden from their families during their imprisonment in order to protect them from further worry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0004865812470384">Jamieson and Grounds, 2005</xref>). The emotional intimacy they had known before imprisonment had now been lost. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0004865812470384">Jamieson and Grounds (2005: 54–58)</xref> in their re-evaluation of the ‘prison effects’ literature concluded that while their empirical data focused on the wrongfully convicted it similarly resonated in prison effects literature more generally. Although these ‘general’ effects can be seen to apply to the lives of the wrongfully convicted post-release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0004865812470384">Grounds, 2004</xref>: 178), this study suggests that the injustice experienced by victims of wrongful conviction and their families creates psychological and emotional problems that are particularly severe and long lasting. Specifically, 32 participants, including secondary victims, felt unable to heal while the State refused to acknowledge their injustice by offering an apology. Other participants indicated that despite receiving psychotherapy and rebuilding their lives, they continued to return to past memories and remained bitter and resentful that they had been convicted for an offence they did not do. The accompanying sense of injustice meant that the victims of wrongful conviction did not feel able to ‘let it go’ (Victim of Wrongful Conviction: Participant 11). They desired emotional healing but were unable to move on and forget about the injustices perpetuated against them.</p>
<p>Although many problems experienced on release have their roots in the negative consequences of wrongful conviction and imprisonment, some relational problems appeared to be associated with tensions concerning the continuance of the appellant’s campaign to either reopen the investigation or pursue claims against the investigating police force. Eighteen released victims of wrongful conviction were unable to cease campaigning, and for some the experience of protest seemed to provide a moral career and opportunities to contextualise their experiences. Although some families understood the appellant’s need to engage with others challenging criminal justice agencies, 11 families believed that the bitterness and resentment felt by the appellant actually undermined the family and their ability to begin the process of recovery and healing. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0004865812470384">Rock (1998: 47)</xref> stated that survivors associated with victim groups ‘ … are exceptionally prone to divorce’. Eight released appellants interviewed for this study had divorced or separated from their spouse or partner within two years of the appellant’s return to the family home. Fifteen wives or partners stated that on the appellant’s return they had displayed negative personality traits including irritability, moodiness, uncommunicativeness, lethargy and detachment. Some suffered from insomnia, nightmares and flashbacks of their prison experiences. Their ‘obsession’ with the case and other evidential matters appeared to undermine their relationships, leading to some released appellants becoming estranged from their campaign team, usually led by a spouse, parent or sibling.</p>
<p>The reactions of secondary victims to wrongful conviction and imprisonment post-release were varied with participants displaying reactions and behaviours that were sometimes markedly different from other victims who had also experienced a miscarriage of justice. Families suffered in contrasting ways with some feeling unable to respond to their situation due to lethargy, while others chose to fight through involvement with protest groups. Any analysis of the harm caused by victimisation through wrongful conviction needs to recognise that victims are not one homogenous group and that different people react in contrasting ways to victimisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0004865812470384">Savage et al., 2007</xref>). There is no one response to a trauma, and while it is possible to discern patterns of behaviour for the purpose of understanding victimisation, it can never be assumed that a particular crime or experience will generate a specific or stereotypical response from a victim (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0004865812470384">Walklate, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0004865812470384">Wolhuter et al., 2009</xref>). A related issue raised by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0004865812470384">Wortman (1983)</xref> is that different victim responses can elicit contrasting reactions from those people around them. Anger and bitterness from the victim can sometimes generate negative responses from friends and family, and this in turn might influence the victim’s emotional recovery. The challenges faced were often severe and impacted on every aspect of their lives. Twenty-six families stated they had received little or no psychological or emotional support, other than meeting other secondary victims attending support groups concerned with miscarriages of justice.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-0004865812470384"><title>Divided families: Appellants and ‘victims’ from the same nuclear family</title>
<p>Most secondary victims described a range of negative feelings and physical symptoms associated with wrongful imprisonment. These, however, were often more extreme when the victim of wrongful conviction and the victim of crime both came from the same nuclear family. The trauma experienced by people over the death of a spouse or child is particularly acute, with survivors often sharing that ‘ … in a single instant, their lives were fundamentally changed’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0004865812470384">Wortman et al., 1997</xref>: 109). This level of secondary victimisation is often severe, with the survivor feeling confused, emotionally damaged and helpless (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0004865812470384">Rando, 1993</xref>). In cases where the death is the responsibility of someone, feelings of anger and rage are often directed against the perpetrator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0004865812470384">Rock, 1998</xref>). These feelings of intense anger last for long periods, which in turn drain the victim emotionally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0004865812470384">Parkes, 1993</xref>). Participants convicted of murdering their spouse or other close family member indicated that they continued to experience nightmares, headaches, depression and profound sadness. A consequence of the severity of their experiences is that most continue to suffer from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), which is regarded as ‘the most common and severe type of post-trauma mental health problem that can occur’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0004865812470384">Freedy and Donkervolt, 1995</xref>: 9). During the early stages of the criminal investigation the defendant and other secondary victims are inevitably coming to terms with their loss. At a time when the family are grieving the death of a family member and coping with bereavement they then have to negotiate their way through the criminal justice system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0004865812470384">Walklate, 1989</xref>). In addition to the suffering experienced by victims of crime, there has been a growing awareness that some victims might experience secondary victimisation through involvement with the procedures and processes of the criminal justice system, leading to what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0004865812470384">Dunn (2007: 267)</xref> refers to as ‘re-victimisation’. This might involve the emotional impact of giving evidence in court (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0004865812470384">Rock, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0004865812470384">Dunn and Shephard, 2006</xref>); insensitive questioning by the police (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0004865812470384">Zedner, 2002</xref>) or the adversarial system of justice, which by focusing solely on the defence and prosecution might undermine the needs of victims (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0004865812470384">Sanders and Jones, 2007</xref>). The adversarial system involves cross-examination which is considered one of the most significant forms of secondary victimisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0004865812470384">Soothill and Soothill, 1993</xref>). Most victims of wrongful conviction and their families indicated that their experiences of the criminal justice system had contributed to undermining their self-confidence and ability to recover from their experiences.</p>
<p>For secondary victims campaigning for and supporting an appellant who has been convicted of murdering a family member, the experience felt like a double trauma. The wife of an appellant convicted of murdering his wife’s mother commented:<disp-quote>
<p>I stuck by him because I knew he was innocent but being there for him and trying to stay strong and coping that mum had been murdered was more than I could cope with … I had a nervous breakdown … terrible days. (Secondary Victim: Participant 101)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Another secondary victim was similarly devastated when her partner was wrongfully convicted of manslaughter for the death of her child. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0004865812470384">Rock (1998: 30)</xref> comments on bereavement after homicide and suggests that the homicide of children is ‘especially disturbing’ and that ‘ … it is a mode of bereavement probably quite unlike the “normal” grieving process’. The participant described her feelings of profound loss following the death of her son which resulted in her receiving psychiatric intervention and counselling to cope with depression and anxiety. Immediately following the conviction the mother of the victim used avoidance techniques whereby reminders of the trauma (places, people, sounds and smells) were evaded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0004865812470384">Freedy and Donkervolt, 1995</xref>). After the conviction of her partner the participant continued to support his campaign for justice and worked with the appellant’s parents to campaign against his conviction. The conviction has since been quashed. The mother and interviewee commented:<disp-quote>
<p>It’s been such a long and dreadful journey that I don’t know how to begin talking about it … my life feels like it’s on hold until I die … nothing can ever, ever be the same again. (Secondary Victim: Participant 122)</p></disp-quote>The psychological and emotional strain of coping with bereavement following the death of her child and coping with the incarceration of her partner was to have serious implications on her emotional equilibrium, leading to her later hospitalisation.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0004865812470384">Lepore, Silver, Wortman and Wayment (1996)</xref> found that the intensity felt by some victims’ suffering bereavement from the death of a spouse or child generated feelings of guilt, despair and restlessness and in some cases to physical illness. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0004865812470384">Rock (1998: 40)</xref> examining self-help groups supporting those suffering bereavement after violent death similarly uses the language of post-traumatic stress disorder to describe the impact of their situation arguing that the bereaved can feel ‘ … numb, shocked, anxious, enervated, breathless … they may have impaired memory, palpitations, headaches, panic attacks … nightmares, hallucinations and wild imaginings’. Following release and the return of the successful appellant to the family home, personal relationships often came under pressure through deterioration in communication, intimacy and sexual function. As one interviewee commented:<disp-quote>
<p>When he came back he found it difficult to talk … he was silent for lots of the time … we felt like strangers to one another … eventually we stopped sleeping together … we decided to split up last year. (Secondary Victim: Participant 52)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Three participants who had been wrongfully convicted of murdering their spouse returned to their parents’ home. These ‘victims’ of wrongful conviction indicated that they sometimes found annual reminders of the deceased such as anniversaries and birthdays or other events that triggered shared memories distressing. These experiences often kindled a desire for the presence of the deceased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0004865812470384">Rando, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0004865812470384">Rock, 1998</xref>) and the continuation of the trauma through ‘the survivor’s life cycle’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0004865812470384">Herman, 1992</xref>: 211). An interviewee wrongfully convicted of murdering his girlfriend commented:<disp-quote>
<p>She was my life when we were together … certain days are really hard for me … our anniversary and her birthday … but there are so many memories … good ones but they still leave me feeling devastated. (Victim of Wrongful Conviction: Participant 46)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Eleven families were recovering from the ordeal of a serious crime committed against a son or daughter, including murder, manslaughter or sexual offences, where a member of the family had been wrongfully convicted for the offence but subsequently released by the Court of Appeal. In these circumstances the trauma experienced by the family was extreme and often led to fractions and estrangement when the appellant was released. During a participant’s campaign to fight her husband’s conviction, they had remained together to ‘clear the family’s name’ but the experience of wrongful imprisonment and stigma associated with the offence, contributed to the couple’s later estrangement. The wife of the appellant commented:<disp-quote>
<p>It was just too much for us … bad memories about everything about the case … when I was home the memories of everything just flooded in … We reached the point where we had nothing left to give each other. (Victim of Wrongful Conviction: Participant 49)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>In terms of the reactions of men and women to the death of a child, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0004865812470384">Wortman, Battle and Lemkau (1997: 122)</xref> suggest that marriages sometimes become strained because men and women ‘often grieve differently’. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0004865812470384">Walklate (1993)</xref> points out that societal attitudes to crying might similarly impact on victims’ response to victimisation, with crying deemed more ‘acceptable’ in some cultures, and for women more so than men. Some family members, including the sons of appellants, found situations where their father cried or ‘sobbed’ disconcerting. Four boys stated they had never witnessed their father crying before and that the act of watching their father openly ‘grieve’ in the family home was ‘difficult to cope with’ (Secondary Victim: Participant 138).</p>
<p>The reaction of other male participants was markedly different. Socialised into refraining from shows of emotion brought on by painful feelings, 12 released victims of wrongful conviction prioritised staying busy. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0004865812470384">Riches and Dawson (1996)</xref> suggest that men often prefer to stay busy as a coping mechanism when dealing with family distress. Women on the other hand tend to be more expressive and often find solace in talking about the tragedy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0004865812470384">Wortman et al., 1997</xref>: 122). The complication for the marriage is if the woman interprets her partner’s lack of expression, and desire to engage in work-related tasks, as indifference towards the tragedy. This is consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0004865812470384">Charman and Savage (2009: 9)</xref> who cite <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0004865812470384">Martin and Doka’s (2000)</xref> findings of the ‘intuitive’ griever (focusing on the vocalising of emotion and feeling) and ‘instrumental’ griever (with its emphasis on problem-solving rather than sharing emotional placement and feelings). This literature suggests that gender role socialisation not only impacts on notions of societal expectation regarding how women and men can react to tragedy, but similarly influences the coping strategies adopted by the two sexes. Women, rather than finding consolation through work-related activities often engage in ‘personal investigation into the circumstances relating to the loss’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0004865812470384">Charman and Savage, 2009</xref>: 9) or through a ‘search for meaning’ (2009: 10). The differential response of men, however, does not mean that they suffer less from the loss but that their response is often ‘more private and internalized’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0004865812470384">Charman and Savage, 2009</xref>: 9; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0004865812470384">Wortman, 1983</xref>). The focus, however, in these circumstances should be on the psychological harm caused by the trauma itself and not on the personal characteristics of the survivor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0004865812470384">Wortman et al., 1997</xref>). Most women in this study did engage with activities that enabled them to search for meaning and understanding, often through working with other women associated with pressure groups concerned with injustice. The men, however, whether released victims of wrongful conviction or male secondary victims, sought more private forms of release, either through engagement with work or hobbies. Those appellants who continued to campaign usually sought to do so privately and without the support of other protest groups.</p>
<p>An associated complication for five families where the victim and appellant came from the same nuclear family concerned the level of familial support the appellant and secondary victims received from other family members. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0004865812470384">Rock (1998: 47)</xref>, examining victim groups, suggested that when the victim and the offender come from the same family ‘ … relations will … be riddled by divided allegiances, feuds, and moral ambiguities’. A participant convicted of a sexual offence (later quashed at the Court of Appeal) against a woman from his own extended family indicated:<disp-quote>
<p>They wanted to support me but they had split loyalties about that too … my family knew what I was going through but they also knew that supporting me was like saying they didn’t believe her. (Victim of Wrongful Conviction: Participant 51)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Relationships between appellants and members of their campaign team were sometimes strained as the appellants tried to cope with the loss of their spouse, a close family member or false allegations made by a member of their family. A complication for these appellants is that most campaigns and support networks are set up and managed by the family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0004865812470384">Charman and Savage, 2009</xref>). Where the deceased victim or secondary victims are part of the ‘primary family’ this can create major obstacles to family cohesiveness which undermine the resilience and motivation of some family members to support the released appellant. It also creates relational difficulties between the families as each attempt to cope with the dilemma of wanting to support the defendant while also supporting the victim of the offence (where alive) or other secondary victims. For the children of a parent wrongfully convicted of an offence against a family member the parent’s release from imprisonment is never straightforward. Eight children interviewed found the arrival of the released parent to the family home stressful. Others found communicating with the parent difficult, despite having visited them regularly while in prison. The children were aware that their parents’ relationship was under strain and indicated that family arguments, usually between their parents, left the family feeling emotionally bruised. One boy aged 17 years old at the time of the interview suggested that his father’s return left him feeling angry about ‘all the trouble’, despite knowing that his father was not responsible for the offence or his imprisonment. The interviewee commented:<disp-quote>
<p>I couldn’t get my head around everything that had happened to us … it was bad enough going to the prison but at least we got back home and could get on with things … my dad back home was like really stressful … there was no let up. (Secondary Victim: Participant 91)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>The pains of wrongful conviction and imprisonment affected the victims psychologically, physically and financially. Most indicated that their family life had been decimated and that the ability of the released appellant to recover from their experiences was significantly affected by the quality of support they received individually and as a family. Forty-seven participants interviewed in this study continued to suffer psychologically from their experiences, and those who had suffered bereavement from the death of a spouse, child or other close family member indicated that their feelings of loss had not receded, and, in some cases, their pain was just as severe. In these circumstances their pain and inability to recover appeared to be exacerbated by their sense of injustice; and, that a member of their family had been wrongfully convicted for the offence.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-0004865812470384" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>For the victims of miscarriages of justice and their families the moment of arrest and criminal charge, leading to wrongful conviction, was a defining moment in their lives. The participants could remember the minutia of the moment in detail. Sixteen appellants interviewed for this study were not ‘career criminals’ and were not emotionally prepared for the trauma of being falsely accused, arrested and charged. Although 16 participants indicated they had problems coping with life post-release, others suggested that their primary problems were adapting to family life following imprisonment. Eight victims of wrongful conviction stated that they had divorced or separated from their spouse or partner within two years of release. For other appellants the loss of their spouse or partner during imprisonment contributed to their being classified as homeless within six months of release. Five appellants chose to use night shelters or sleep on friends’ or acquaintances floors. Two appellants chose to sleep rough because local day centres reminded them of prison. The result of leading nomadic lives, moving from room to room, encouraged some appellants to distance themselves from support networks. This level of detachment appeared to be the result of their imprisonment and associated feelings of marginalisation and alienation.</p>
<p>For the families of appellants counted as secondary victims, the trauma was often just as distressing. Many families had suffered financial loss following the arrest and conviction. Their lives had to adjust to their new circumstances, particularly as many mothers now had the sole responsibility for bringing up their children. A significant financial burden for most wives and partners was in initiating and managing the appellant’s campaign against the conviction. A variety of expenses were discussed including solicitors’ fees, travel to and from the legal team, prison visits and travel to other locations where the secondary victims could network and seek support. Twenty-four families indicated they had experienced the stigmatisation associated with a family member being convicted of a serious offence. Seven families had moved to other parts of the country or had changed jobs due to being harassed by work colleagues. Others moved closer to the appellant’s prison.</p>
<p>Most family members indicated they had suffered psychologically (anxiety, depression, panic attacks) and physically (headaches, irritable bowel syndrome). The children of appellants had also suffered. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0004865812470384">Matthews (1983: 15)</xref> has described prisoners’ children as the ‘forgotten victims’ of crime. All the children interviewed for this study described their experiences with candour and sadness that their lives had been injured. Many acknowledged they had suffered psychologically, with nine participants stating in interviews that they had received counselling sessions organised by their mother or through their local school. Most had chosen to move schools regularly and this had also impacted on their school performance and ability to join friendship groups. The children indicated they had visited their father while imprisoned and that these meetings had usually been enjoyable and comforting. Despite the joy of seeing their father released from the Court of Appeal, eight children stated that their ability to communicate with their father had deteriorated since his return to the family home. The wives and partners of released appellants similarly indicated that their relationship had suffered since the imprisonment. While the reasons for estrangement were often complex, many wives and partners believed the breakdown in the relationship was caused by the wrongful conviction and imprisonment of their husband or partner. Fifteen women indicated that their relationship was not able to recover, despite both parties attempting to heal from their experiences. In some cases it was the appellant who had left the family home. Most campaigns and support groups for the appellant had been managed by the appellant’s wife or partner. When the victim of wrongful conviction was released, five stated that they needed to be removed from people, locations and places which reminded them of their experiences. For many successful appellants this involved people who reminded them of their arrest and conviction, including ‘past’ solicitors and supporters. In some cases it also included their partner, particularly if they had organised the campaign and liaised with the legal team. When the victim of crime (where alive) and the defendant both come from the same nuclear family then the consequences on the defendant and their family can be catastrophic. Following the conviction many families disintegrated while they tried to come to terms with their losses. Others continued to support the appellant, believing them to be innocent of the offence. Most suffered severe symptoms associated with post-traumatic stress syndrome, including feelings of hopelessness, anger and detachment. Secondary victims in this study indicated that they continued to suffer from the trauma of their losses. For the children, their experiences had literally changed their lives forever.</p>
