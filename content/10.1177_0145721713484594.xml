<title>Purpose</title>
<p>The purpose of this study was to determine the feasibility of an Internet-based intervention, targeting very low-income minority patients with a high risk for not engaging in diabetes self-management, to increase diabetes self-management and improve diabetes outcomes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0145721713484594">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>Patients with diabetes followed in a community clinic were enrolled in the 13-month trial. Participants were requested to test blood sugar and upload glucometer data every day and login to the program at least once every second day. Feasibility data included process measures; diabetes outcomes consisted of changes from baseline to follow-up for levels of glycosylated hemoglobin (A1C), LDL, HDL, triglyceride and total cholesterol, and health-related quality of life using the SF-36.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0145721713484594">
<title>Results</title>
<p>Only 22% of participants had health insurance. Participants had an average of 4.39 comorbidities and 7.06 prescriptions. Participants uploaded glucometer data at least twice each week and logged into the application at least once each week. Participants demonstrated reductions statistically or clinically important changes in A1C, LDL cholesterol, total cholesterol, and triglyceride levels. Participants engaging in more frequent chat messages and interactive activities demonstrated greater reductions in LDL cholesterol levels; however, engaging in more frequent chat messages also was associated with increased triglyceride levels. Participants rated fewer role limitations from physical health problems at follow-up.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The intervention produced good outcomes; however, an alternative platform may be a less expensive approach.</p>

<title>Background</title>
<p>African Americans have a greater risk for diabetes,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0145721713484594">1</xref></sup> are more likely than other groups to have worse diabetes outcomes,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0145721713484594">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0145721713484594">3</xref></sup> and are more likely to have poor measures of diabetes control, such as glycemic level<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0145721713484594">4</xref></sup> and blood pressure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0145721713484594">5</xref></sup> An important consideration with managing diabetes and preventing its complications is that more than 95% of diabetes care is accomplished by the patient,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0145721713484594">6</xref></sup> requiring an extraordinary amount of disease self-management. Furthermore, inadequate self-management behavior increases therapeutic clinical inertia,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0145721713484594">7</xref></sup> in which the physician fails to treat the patient to control by applying evidence-based practice standards.</p>
<p>Self-management requires people with diabetes to know how to take care of themselves and understand how diabetes affects them. However, taking the steps required to self-manage diabetes requires people with diabetes to perceive that they are capable of doing the tasks required to take care of themselves—to have adequate self-efficacy. Self-efficacy represents an individual’s confidence for implementing behavior change based on efficacy beliefs and outcome expectations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0145721713484594">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0145721713484594"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0145721713484594"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0145721713484594">11</xref></sup> Because diabetes self-management incorporates behavioral, personal, and environmental factors into daily performance of recommended activities, increased self-efficacy for participating in diabetes self-management is associated with increased self-management of diabetes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0145721713484594">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0145721713484594"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0145721713484594">14</xref></sup> Similarly, reduced self-efficacy for participating in diabetes self-management contributes to less self-management and poorer diabetes outcomes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0145721713484594">15</xref></sup> However, patients with limited capabilities for engaging in diabetes self-management, including economic resources, health literacy, and self-efficacy, are less likely to participate in appropriate self-management and more likely to experience poor diabetes outcomes. Furthermore, self-efficacy is a critical factor that links health literacy and numeracy with diabetes outcomes as measured by glycemic control.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0145721713484594">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>The quality of the doctor–patient relationship significantly affects the processes and outcomes of chronic disease management including patient satisfaction,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0145721713484594">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0145721713484594"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0145721713484594">19</xref></sup> patient adherence,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0145721713484594">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0145721713484594">20</xref></sup> improved disease outcomes in general,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0145721713484594">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0145721713484594"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0145721713484594"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0145721713484594"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0145721713484594">24</xref></sup> and improved diabetes outcomes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0145721713484594">25</xref></sup> In a representation of the doctor–patient relationship as a “working alliance,” Fuertes and colleagues demonstrated the significantly positive relationship between construct of working alliance and patients’ beliefs about being able to adhere to treatment (adherence self-efficacy).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0145721713484594">26</xref></sup> Furthermore, patients characterized by strong beliefs in their self-efficacy are more likely to be satisfied with their doctor–patient relationships.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0145721713484594">27</xref></sup> Among African American males, the quality of the doctor–patient relationship was identified as representing the singularly most important variable contributing to increased treatment adherence.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0145721713484594">28</xref></sup> Poor therapeutic relationships predict patient nonadherence.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0145721713484594">29</xref></sup></p>
<p>Information technologies may enhance communication among health professionals and patients, thereby strengthening the doctor–patient relationship, increasing self-efficacy for diabetes self-management, and improving diabetes management.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0145721713484594">30</xref></sup> Use of technology helps to eliminate barriers that prevent individuals from accessing health care services, including distance, costs and missed work time.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0145721713484594">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0145721713484594">31</xref></sup> Additional reasons for Internet delivery include low cost from the potential for scaling-up an intervention to larger populations, increased convenience for users, potential reduction of health services costs, reducing potential isolation among users, and rapid dissemination of information to large numbers of people.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0145721713484594">32</xref></sup></p>
<p>Preliminary research that we had conducted among patients belonging to the target population suggested that the target population experienced inadequate clinical management of their type 2 diabetes, engaged in inadequate diabetes self-management, experienced low self-efficacy for diabetes self-management, and experienced poor clinical relationships with their primary care providers. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine the feasibility of this Internet-based intervention that targets very low-income minority patients who are not likely to engage in diabetes self-management activities and to determine whether utilization contributes to increased participation in diabetes self-management and improved diabetes outcomes.</p>

<title>Research Design</title>
<p>An Internet-based suite of applications was developed in collaboration with a technology partner, designed to be a patient-centered “relationship management” tool, not clinician centered or a “diabetes management” tool. The suite of tools was packaged as HEAT-IT-UP in Overtown, or the Health Education and Access Through Information Technology Utilization Program in Overtown. Overtown is a micro-community in this urban community in which our community-based clinic is located and where the majority of the target population lives. The conceptual framework for HEAT-IT-UP is guided by social cognitive theory (SCT). SCT suggests that beliefs and competencies are established and altered by social influences and structures within the environment. Constructs within SCT include self-efficacy and social networks. Self-efficacy represents an individual’s confidence for enacting behaviors such as implementing behavior change based on efficacy beliefs and outcome expectations;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0145721713484594">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0145721713484594"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0145721713484594"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0145721713484594">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0145721713484594">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0145721713484594">34</xref></sup> self-efficacy strongly predicts health behavior<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0145721713484594">33</xref></sup> and is likely influenced by one’s social network and environment. Social networking is a process of interacting between environment and person variables occurring across time.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0145721713484594">35</xref></sup> This is not the social networking of virtual communities such as Facebook, but the process by which a defined group of people interact with each other and adjust behaviors to reflect the behavioral norms that they discern from repeated exposure to group interactions. As a relationship manager, the package was designed to improve diabetes outcomes and reduce preventable hospitalizations by influencing the mediator variable, working alliance, and intermediate outcomes, health-related quality of life, and self-efficacy for engaging in diabetes self-management. The conceptual framework is illustrated <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0145721713484594">Figure 1</xref>.</p>

<title>Sample and Recruitment</title>
<p>An a priori decision was made to limit the number of patients recruited for the feasibility trial to 24 because of the anticipated need for user support, considering the lack of familiarity with computers and the Internet among patients in the target population. Consequently, 24 low-income patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus were recruited to participate in the trial during the recruitment and training period, from September through December 2009. Eligibility included at least 21 years of age, established patient in the target facility for at least 12 months, seen at least once for management of type 2 diabetes mellitus during the previous 12 months, most recent glycosylated hemoglobin (A1C) level ≤ 10%, last A1C within 6 months. Patients were excluded if they did not speak English, had an emergency room discharge or hospital admission for a diabetes-related complication during the 6 months before recruitment, were homeless or did not have control of the given living situation, had significant cognitive impairment or psychological distress in the opinion of clinical staff, and had known substance or alcohol abuse.</p>
<p>Patients who consented to participate were given training to increase computer literacy and application-specific training. Participants completing both training experiences were given the following resources to use for the duration of the 13-month trial: desktop computer, glucometer and test strips, Internet connectivity in their home, periodic refresher training, and telephone user support. Participants who completed an initial login within 2 days of completing the training programs were considered to have been enrolled in the trial.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0145721713484594">
<title>Intervention Activities</title>
<p>Participants were requested to check their blood sugar levels using the glucometer provided to them and upload glucometer data to a web-based personal health record (Microsoft® HealthVault) each morning, according to a script that was offered to them as a guide. They were also asked to log into the diabetes relationship management package at least once every second day. As patients log into the patient relationship manager, their credentials link to their HealthVault credentials to retrieve the most recent blood glucose value.</p>
<p>Upon logging in, context specific information based on presupplied business logic is provided to the participant in the form of educational and motivational messages. These messages provide positive feedback if the blood glucose value is within the desired range, or specific instructions for urgently lowering or raising blood glucose if the value is out of range. All messages were framed by evidence-based behavior change theory and written in language that was both culturally syntonic and easy to read for individuals with limited educational attainment. The masthead design and colors throughout the application were intended to replicate a prominent mural in the center of the community in which the target population lives, painted by Purvis Young, a resident of Overtown who went on to acquire an international reputation. The login page is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0145721713484594">Figure 2</xref>.</p>

</fig>
<p>The package included applications to facilitate web-based access to health care providers for educating, communicating, peer networking to address topics specific to diabetes self-management, and accomplishing specific health care tasks such as scheduling appointments and refilling prescriptions. A chat application offered participants the opportunity to engage in live, web-based chats with registered nurses. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0145721713484594">Figure 3</xref> illustrates the chat application embedded within the package. A messaging application provided templates with which to assist patients to communicate with an interdisciplinary team of providers about specific questions or needs. Other applications included monitored discussion boards, availability of patient-centered and culturally aligned diabetes educational materials, and regularly scheduled questionnaires to measure health-related quality of life and obtain user feedback. The HEAT-IT-UP model, however, was designed to go beyond the virtual networking capabilities of this Internet approach and includes a peer network component designed to bring participants together on a regular basis. Social norms that are communicated through a peer network represent a construct within SCT, called social networking. A different diabetes self-management campaign was communicated via the web-based package every 3 months, targeting a topical issue suggested by a panel of patients as being relevant to them, including influenza vaccinations, holiday eating, New Year blues, and physical activity. Each campaign was accompanied by patient education materials available for download and at least 1 in-person event at the clinic or in a community-based setting. Registered nurses had their own dashboards, providing them with the following patient-specific data: biographical information and a picture for each individual, trends of self-management data consisting of blood glucose levels from glucometer data, and trends of clinical data, including A1C and cholesterol levels. Nurses were also able to view patients’ electronic medical records to support specific patient needs and histories while chatting with patients.</p>

<title>Outcome Measures and Data Collection Procedures</title>
<p>Data with which to evaluate the clinical outcome from this feasibility trial consisted of levels of A1C, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, triglyceride, total cholesterol, and blood pressure from patients’ medical records. Weight and height were measured at the initial application-training session and recorded in the study database. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated from weight and height. Self-management and participation data collected included frequency of uploading blood glucose data, frequency of logging into the site, frequency of engaging in chats with registered nurses, and frequency of generating messages to nurses. Patient-self-reported health-related quality of life (H-RQOL) measures were collected using the SF-36.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0145721713484594">36</xref></sup> The SF-36 is a self-administered generic health status questionnaire with well-documented psychometric properties that measures H-RQOL in 8 domains: physical function, role limitations, physical vitality, general health perception, bodily pain, social function, role limitations–emotional, and mental health. The 8 factors scores are summarized with 2 summary component scores: physical health and mental health. Scores for each domain can range from 0 to 100, with lower scores indicating poorer function. Patient-reported measures were collected on a quarterly basis. Participants were not disenrolled due to nonparticipation; for self-reported data to describe H-RQOL, patients who did not continue to participate online were contacted periodically by telephone.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0145721713484594">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>Baseline data were compared with follow-up data to calculate changes; follow-up data included the last measure collected. Patients not completing the final SF-36 or user satisfaction questionnaires that had been posted online were contacted by telephone by the registered nurses in an effort to get completed data sets. Repeated measures <italic>t</italic> tests were used to examine changes between baseline and follow-up clinical measures. Change scores were created for health outcomes by subtracting follow-up values from baseline values. To compare the magnitude of change between intervention and control groups, <italic>t</italic> tests were used</p>
<p>Correlations were used to examine relationships between clinical measures and self-management activities. Process measures, indicating the extent to which participants engaged in self-management by using different components of the web-based package, were quantified using frequencies and descriptive statistics. Process measures include frequency that glucometer data were uploaded to the Internet, frequency that participants logged into HEAT-IT-UP, frequency of generating chats, number of mail messages generated by participants, and frequency with which participants contributed to discussion boards. The application aggregated counts of various interactions to define a summary measure, called value-added events (VAEs). VAEs represented efforts to interact with the health care system via the nurse coordinator to engage in activities related to self-care, such as requesting a prescription refill, scheduling a visit, or communicating with the nurse for the purposes of exchanging information via the internal messaging system, sending an instant message (chatting) of any length, generating an instant message dialogue, or posting comments to message boards. SF-36 factor scores were compared to those that Norris identified as norms for people with diabetes from a meta-analysis of 118 studies with 71 161 patients with diabetes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0145721713484594">37</xref></sup> This feasibility trial was approved by the institutional review boards for the university and hospital with which the clinic is affiliated.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>From the 24 patients recruited, 21 were enrolled by having met enrollment requirements. One patient with type 1 diabetes mellitus was disenrolled. The mean age of participants was 54.36 (SD = 4.09) years; 33.3% of participants were male, 77.8% were black. The majority of participants, 77.8%, had no health insurance and were financially coded by the hospital as self-pay, suggesting limited personal financial capabilities. Participants had an average of 4.39 chronic comorbidities (SD = 1.72; range, 1-7), 0.61 mental health comorbidities (SD = 0.78; range, 0-3), 1.78 diabetes prescription medications (SD = 1.00; range, 0-4), 5.28 nondiabetes prescription medications (SD = 2.7; range, 1-11), and a total of 7.06 prescriptions (SD = 3.17; range, 2-15).</p>
<p>Participants uploaded glucometer data to the Internet an average of 105.12 times (SD = 89.20; range, 1-359), or an average of about 2 times per week during the 13-month trial. They logged into the application an average of 76.06 times (SD = 109.40; range, 2-470), or about once each week. Participants generated 59.18 chat events (SD = 69.36; range, 1-212) and 11.50 mail messages (SD = 14.88; range, 1-59). Discussion boards were used 43 times. Participants recorded an average of 56.28 activities categorized as VAEs (SD = 68.63; range, 0-213).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0145721713484594">Table 1</xref> illustrates baseline and follow-up clinical measures. Participants demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in A1C levels, from 7.54% to 6.92% (<italic>t</italic> = 2.24, <italic>df</italic> = 15, <italic>P</italic> = .041). Statistically significant increases in triglyceride levels, from 92.69 mm dL to 113.69 mm dL (<italic>t</italic> = −3.00, <italic>df</italic> = 12, <italic>P</italic> = .011) were also observed, although the average remained below 150 mg dL, the cutoff for borderline high set by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI), for the duration of the intervention. Although statistically significant changes were not observed for other clinical measures, participants experienced clinically important changes for LDL cholesterol, from 111.08 mm/dL at baseline, which is above the NHLBI’s threshold for an above optimal level of 100 mg/dL, to 95.38 mm/dL at follow-up (<italic>t</italic> = 1.76, <italic>df</italic> = 12, <italic>P</italic> = .104)—within the optimal range defined by the NHLBI. Clinically significant changes for total cholesterol were also observed, from 182.15 mm/dL at baseline, which approaches the NHLBI’s borderline-high threshold of 200 mg/dL, to 166.69 mm/dL at follow/up (<italic>t</italic> = 1.61, <italic>df</italic> = 12, <italic>P</italic> = .135), well within the desirable range. There were no appreciable changes apparent for HDL (<italic>P</italic> = .178), systolic blood pressure (<italic>P</italic> = .304), diastolic blood pressure (<italic>P</italic> = .804), or BMI (<italic>P</italic> = .542).</p>

<p>In a comparison of SF-36 factor scores at baseline and follow-up, compared to those that Norris identified as norms among people with diabetes, we found that, for the most part, participants in this trial started with lower SF-36 scores but ended with higher scores. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0145721713484594">Figure 4</xref> shows that trial participants started out with 7 out of 8 scores that were lower at baseline compared to baseline scores in Norris’s meta-analysis (role physical, role emotional, bodily pain, vitality, social functioning, physical functioning, and general health). Nevertheless, feasibility trial participants completed the intervention with 6 out of 7 scores that were either higher than or similar to (within 5.0 points) postintervention scores in Norris’s meta-analysis (role physical, role emotional, bodily pain, vitality, physical functioning, and general health).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The patient population of people with diabetes targeted by this feasibility trial may be characterized as predominantly low income and African American with severe multimorbidity whose health care is managed by a primary care clinic affiliated with a tertiary hospital in an urban area. Most of the patients presenting to this clinic are either black (African American or Haitian American) or Latino.</p>
<p>Minority populations such as that enrolled in this trial are disproportionately affected by type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0145721713484594">38</xref></sup> The age-adjusted incidence of diagnosed diabetes in 2009 was 8.5 per 1000 among whites compared to 11.7 per 1000 among blacks. Compared to non-Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic blacks have a 77% higher risk of diagnosed T2DM. This disproportionate burden of diabetes among minority populations is partially attributed to the social determinants of disease, such as poverty, low educational attainment, and environment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0145721713484594">39</xref></sup> Social determinants are also responsible for challenges when attempting to reach these populations for disease prevention and health promotion programs. There is, in fact, an inverse relationship between T2DM and education, occupation, and income, with income as the more powerful predictor.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0145721713484594">40</xref></sup> Thus, low-income, minority populations such as that which is targeted by this feasibility trial may particularly benefit from public health risk reduction and self-management promotion efforts such as this. Bringing their diabetes closer to being controlled by increasing their understanding of their self-management responsibilities and their capabilities to engage in self-management may also reduce the costs of managing complications of diabetes among this very high-risk population.</p>
<p>The purpose of this trial was to investigate the feasibility of an intervention designed to help very low-income patients whose diabetes was moderately uncontrolled (A1C ≤ 10%), to increase participation in diabetes self-management and improve diabetes outcomes using the framework of SCT. Our clinical experiences and interactions with this patient population suggested to us that opportunities to develop improved working alliances that are perceived by participants as more supportive and patient centered would motivate them to increase their participation in managing their diabetes, thereby potentially contributing to better diabetes outcomes. Theoretically, a more cost-effective, scalable, and patient-centered approach could be realized by moving the communications and patient feedback interactions to the Internet and out of the physical clinic, and by incorporating physician extenders in the form of registered nurses with access to patients’ electronic medical records. Use of the Internet for a risk reduction intervention such as this also has the potential for improving access to health care, an impediment to seeking health care when needed that is often experienced by the target population.</p>
<p>The sample of patients with T2DM participating in this trial was predominantly black (77.8%) and poor (77.8% had no health insurance). This was also a very sick population, with the average participant having 4.39 chronic disease diagnoses at baseline and prescribed 7.06 medications. Perhaps not surprisingly, these patients suggested a worse H-RQOL at baseline, compared to other people with diabetes participating in diabetes interventions considered in Norris’ meta-analysis: they had lower scores on 6 out of the of 8 SF-36 factors. The sample was purposely limited to patients whose diabetes was only moderately out of control because severely uncontrolled patients (ie, A1C &gt; 10%) ought to be more intensively managed by physicians.</p>
<p>Patients participating in the trial demonstrated quite good diabetes outcomes, with a statistically significant reduction in A1C (−0.62%, <italic>P</italic> = .041) and clinically significant reductions in LDL cholesterol (−15.7 mm/dL) and total cholesterol (−15.46). Changes in HDL cholesterol and total cholesterol of these magnitudes, along with the decrease in A1C are also likely to reduce risks for cardiovascular events.</p>
<p>Patients were asked to check their blood sugar at least once each day, in the morning upon awaking, to upload glucometer data immediately afterward, again at least once each day, and to engage with the web-based diabetes relationship manager by logging-in at least once every second day. Our experience suggests that a common barrier to measuring blood glucose levels among the target population is the cost of test strips. We sought to eliminate cost as a barrier for the purposes of this feasibility trial by providing unlimited test strips without charge. We also knew that most of the participants did not have Internet connectivity in their homes, so we underwrote the costs of those services. From the study data, we don’t know the frequency with which patients measured blood glucose levels, but we do know that they uploaded glucometer data to their web-based personal health record only about twice each week and logged-into the diabetes relationship manager application about once per week. These average utilization rates, which may also be considered adherence to the protocol, suggest an inadequate utilization of the application; however, drilling down by examining the associations between patients who adhered with the protocol more frequently than those who did not suggests that those who used the application more frequently experienced better diabetes outcomes.</p>
<p>This trial required a significant investment in resources to enable people in the target population to participate, including equipment and supplies, services and personnel. Equipment and supplies included: OneTouch® glucometers and USB cables to connect glucometers to PCs and unlimited blood glucose test strips. Refurbished PCs including monitors, keyboards and mice were provided by Per Scholas. Services included computer literacy training, provided by the City of Miami, Internet connectivity for the 13-month period of the trial, technical support for the PC and web-based applications. PC repair and servicing was also provided by Per Scholas. We anticipated that study personnel effort would consist of providing application training, tracking patient engagement and communications with patients to remind them to complete questionnaires; however, our anticipated level of effort didn’t take into consideration the numerous demands upon staff time that would arise due primarily to the environment in which participants lived and their limited resources. For example, we failed to take into consideration the fact that Miami has 3 Internet providers, and that we had to engage with each of those providers on behalf of participating patients, some of whom had accounts that had been closed due to nonpayment prior to study enrollment. We had to become familiar with the systems employed by each of those providers and, in the case of delinquent payments, bring patients up to date with providers or risk nonparticipation. Most participants experienced “user issues” that required study staff to visit them in their homes, providing in-person assistance. Examples include participants without transportation who needed to have their equipment repaired by Per Scholas technicians. One participant burned the PC motherboard because the electrical cord for a kitchen appliance was spliced into the PC electrical cord due to a limited number of electrical outlets in the home. The patient may not have known to buy, or may not have had the cash with which to purchase, a grounded power-strip. Another participant, without personal transportation to bring her computer to Per Scholas for repair, returned her computer to study staff for troubleshooting after it failed to start. It is suspected that the malfunction had been caused by an electrical short generated by a cockroach infestation within the computer case. These and other examples of user issues are difficult if not impossible to predict beforehand. These experiences suggest that an intervention of this nature that targets this high-need population would benefit from a different platform, such as a smart phone, and additional staff time than was originally expected for user support issues.</p>
<p>The outcomes of this feasibility trial suggest that an information technology intervention that targets this very high-risk and high-need population, designed to improve the therapeutic relationship, the working alliance, for the purpose of improving diabetes outcomes through an increase in diabetes self-management activities has merit. Although participants did not upload glucometer data to the Internet nor did they log-in to the HEAT-IT-UP site as frequently as they had been requested, however, they did engage with the program on a regular basis by uploading glucometer data about twice per week and logging-in to use HEAT-IT-UP resources about once each week. Furthermore, anecdotal feedback from participants during the course of the project, including when investigators visited patients’ homes to observe their use of the resources and at the conclusion of the program when the site was shut down, suggested that participants highly valued the opportunity to chat with the nurses and receive expedited feedback from their health care providers. One patient said, “I feel like I have my doctor in my living room.” Another cried at the end of the program, confessing to a feeling of abandonment.</p>
<p>Utilization data, combined with the feedback we received and the extent to which participants remained engaged with the program for the duration of the 13-month trial, suggest to us that there is a significant need for an approach such as this for patients in this population. Furthermore, patients in the same demographic with other chronic diseases could potentially benefit from using a similar “relationship manager” for strengthening the working alliance.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, utilization data and estimates of the costs required to support the program suggest that a different platform is more likely to yield greater use of the application by more participants, thereby generating diabetes improvements for a greater proportion of participants. An alternative platform that may be more amenable to this patient population and that may eliminate a large portion of user issues and training needs may be a mobile device such as a smart phone or tablet.</p>
<p>What is unknown from this trial is the true cost effectiveness of the intervention or whether any cardiovascular events were averted; however, these questions were beyond the scope of our funding for examining the feasibility of the intervention and measuring direct outcomes experienced by participants.</p>
