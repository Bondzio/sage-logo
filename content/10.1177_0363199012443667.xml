<abstract>
<p>The historical study of the intergenerational transmission of surnames in the areas ruled by the crowns of Castile and Portugal, peninsular and colonial, reveals a nearly universal sixteenth-century system of surname transmission that antedates the use of permanent hereditary surnames. Great flexibility in surname transmission allowed a child’s selection of a surname from among those of the extended pedigree, both maternal and paternal, demonstrating that Hispanic society did not, and does not, view the extended family in the patrilineal, male-dominated fashion of Anglo society. In the Iberian perspective, the entire extended family, back on all sides to the third and even fourth generation, is viewed as personally relevant.</p>

<p>Following the initial phase of the conquest of Mexico, Andres de Tapia, a chief captain under Hernán Cortez, returned with him to Spain in 1527. While there, Tapia married Isabel de Sosa from Toledo and later brought her back with him to New Spain. During the ensuing years in Mexico she gave birth to four children, known by the following names:<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0363199012443667">1</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<list list-type="simple">
<list-item>
<p>Cristobal de Tapia</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Alonso de Sosa</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Pedro Gomez de Cáceres</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Ines de Tapia</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>The derivation of the surnames Tapia and Sosa used by the children of Andres and Isabel is obvious. What remains unclear in published historical sources is the origin of the surname Gomez de Cáceres.</p>
<p>This pattern of surname derivation within a single sixteenth-century family was not unique to the Tapia Sosa children. A multigenerational genealogical study of a prominent Costa Rican family living two generations later and in a different colony offers greater insights into the seemingly random selection of surnames transmitted from one generation to the next. At the age of twenty-two, Francisco de Ocampo-Golfin y Carillo de Figueroa left Extremadura, where he was born in 1574, to settle in what is now Costa Rica. There he fathered and gave names to seven children. Six were legitimate, borne by his wife Ines Benavides Solano. Those children appear in the historical records as:</p>
<list list-type="simple">
<list-item>
<p>Juana de Figueroa Moscoso</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Maria de Sandoval</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Ines de Benavides Solano</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Diego de Ocampo Figueroa</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Alonso de Sandoval</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>Jose de Sandodval Ocampo</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>His one illegitimate child carried the name Gaspar de Rojas.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>Only two of these children carry the Ocampo surname, although Ocampo-Golfin is a well-known and powerful noble family in Extremadura. Three use Sandoval, the other surname of their paternal grandfather, Alonso Sandoval de Ocampo. Another uses Figueroa Moscoso derived from Francisco’s maternal grandparents Alonso Sanchez Figueroa and Costanza Mendoza Moscoso.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0363199012443667">2</xref>
</sup> One daughter carries the entire name/surname combination of her mother, Ines. This homonym pattern of using the complete name and surname of an ancestor is a sufficiently recurring phenomenon in Spanish speaking societies to make the term <italic>homonimo</italic> a household word in Spain.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0363199012443667">3</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>These surname transmission patterns evidence concepts of familial identity that also underlie what one might describe as a Spanish obsession with genealogies. For example, when Ynes Mas wanted to marry her military beau, Captain Manuel Ordoñez, in the Spanish African city of Ceuta in 1792, she first had to demonstrate that, beyond her personal reputation, she had noble ancestors for at least three generations on all lines. Like thousands of other women who married Spanish military officers before 1832,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0363199012443667">4</xref>
</sup> she offered proof—in her case in over one hundred pages of testimony—that her ancestors on all family lines were of good reputation, free of the blood of heretics, Moors and Jews.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0363199012443667">5</xref>
</sup> The production of three or four generation pedigrees was an important part of official Spanish life during the colonial years. Appointment to many positions in Spanish society—military, ecclesiastical, and civil—required that the applicants provide pedigrees extending back three or even four generations on all lines, paternal and maternal. In the Spanish dioceses of Zamora and Valladolid in the eighteenth century, even the simple acts of marriage listed the names of all the grandparents of the brides and grooms.</p>
<p>Likewise, when Joaquin Varea de la Raga wished to become the local representative or familiar of the Holy Office of the Inquisition in Tuejar, Valencia in 1776, he joined over ten thousand men who, applying for appointment to that position under the Valencia Inquisition, were required to file pedigrees showing that their ancestry on all family lines was without stain from Jewish, Moorish, or heretic ancestors.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0363199012443667">6</xref>
</sup> To verify his allegations of purity of blood as well as his personal worthiness, the Inquisition sent out an investigator to take testimony from a minimum of six witnesses. In Joaquin’s case, all of the witnesses testified that his ancestors were old Christians without stain. Each further testified to his general worthiness while expressing concern about Joaquin’s regular and obviously well-known late night visits to the home of a town widow. Interestingly, and related to the concept of familial identity, each witness discussed how one of his cousins had several years earlier killed another cousin.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0363199012443667">7</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Each of these disparate incidents and accompanying pedigrees offers evidence of a broad, more encompassing perspective of family identity inherent in Spanish society in the early modern age. Each is also better understood in light of that encircling perspective of the family that permeates and predominates in Spanish life.</p>
<sec id="section1-0363199012443667">
<title>Previous Surname Studies</title>
<p>Most scholarly studies written about surnames have focused on the origin of surnames from patronymics, geographic places, occupations, nicknames relating to personal characteristics, and so on.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0363199012443667">8</xref>
</sup> In <italic>Hispanic Surnames,</italic> the most complete book-length study in English, author Lyman Platt limits his analysis to such origins and the frequency of specific surnames in Latin American countries.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0363199012443667">9</xref>
</sup> Some, looking back to the time of the Roman <italic>gens patriae,</italic> have viewed how surnames have associated individuals with a particular family and its honor.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0363199012443667">10</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Many authors have recognized the identity roles that names have. These can be summarized in the words of Andrew Veneer:<disp-quote>
<p>A personal name designates an individual with unique features and a singular biography. Although people on occasion share the same combination of given and family names, within their respective environments that combination is a guarantee of their individuality. In identifying a particular individual, a name becomes an integral part of his or her identity. At the same time, names, especially surnames, are not exclusively individualistic; they also carry ethnic, national, social, religious and professional [and I would add familial] connotations. A name may serve as a signifier for membership in a larger collective and may even endow a member, in his or her own eyes or those of others, with certain traits associated with that group. In this sense, names not only identify their holders but also may express their cultural values, social standing, ethnic identity and political loyalties.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0363199012443667">11</xref>
</sup>
</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Of all the articles and books that discuss surnames and identity, however, only two appear that dealt with the historical development of crucial cultural phenomenon discussed in this article: the transmission of surnames from one generation to the next. In the first, “The Production of Legal Identities Proper to States: The Case of the Permanent Family Surname,” James C. Scott, John Tehranian, and Jeremy Mathias discuss the creation of an identity based on surnames:<disp-quote>
<p>Like place-names, permanent surnames help to chart the human topography of any region. Names play a vital role in determining identities, cultural affiliations, and histories; they can help fracture or unify groups. They represent an integral part of knowledge power systems.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0363199012443667">12</xref>
</sup>
</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>As the State acquires more power, it must exercise greater control and order by imposing uniform naming systems on persons and places. The authors see permanent hereditary patronyms as the final step in an historical process of surname transmission development in which they view<disp-quote>
<p>surnames as a social construct—a system of knowledge spun in the webs of power. . . . Through a comparative analysis, [they] argue that the use of inherited familial surnames represents a relatively recent phenomenon intricately linked to the aggrandizement of state control over individuals and the development of modern legal systems and property regimes. In particular, the creation and diffusion of inheritable surnames represented a critical tool in the power struggle between local and outside authorities in the development of the modern nation-state, the emergence of ethnonationalist identities, and the imposition of credible private property systems.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0363199012443667">13</xref>
</sup>
</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>As discussed below, this process describes well the environment in Spain and at least some of her former colonies during the nineteenth century when the double surname system gains dominance. Nevertheless, The Scott–Tehranian–Mathias focus on what they call State-making/State-naming processes fails to look at the importance of local and regional naming patterns in developing cultural and familial identities and the possibility of regional or national cultural norms or identities existing before the imposition of State-making/State-naming processes. Furthermore, they do not mention once the Spanish experience, ultimately leaving us without anyone who has analyzed identity issues in the creation of a system or systems of intergenerational transmission of surnames within the context of Spain and her colonies during the early modern age.</p>
<p>Others have discussed the social and cultural impacts of certain characteristics of Spanish surname usage, in particular that of the female surname.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0363199012443667">14</xref>
</sup> In this last case, there is a recognition that surname usage can be a key to understanding the society to which an individual belongs and its way of viewing individual, family, and gender identity. In modern American society, for example, at least one hundred years after the legal identity of a woman is no longer subsumed in that of her husband at marriage, we still retain a name system which totally subsumes her familial identity by dropping her surname and adopting his.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0363199012443667">15</xref>
</sup> By contrast, most women in Hispanic societies do not adopt their husbands’ surnames but instead retain their birth surnames throughout life. While this salient characteristic of modern Hispanic surname usage often confuses Anglos, for the Spanish woman it expresses her unique identity as a person and as a member of the family into which she was born—identities not changed by marriage, but hers from birth until death in all aspects of life.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0363199012443667">16</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The best treatment on intergenerational transmission of surnames in Spain was never widely disseminated. In the traditional format of Academies in Europe, Jaime de Salazar y Acha, current president of the Real Academia Matritense de Heráldica y Genealogía, delivered a paper to that organization in 1991 upon being named a fellow thereof. That paper was subsequently published as a small pamphlet, a copy of which can be found in the National Library in Madrid.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0363199012443667">17</xref>
</sup> Salazar y Acha begins by observing that most historians and genealogists fail to recognize that surname rules and customs have changed over time, and therefore apply surnames to persons who never used them during their lifetimes. He then traces the development of surname usage in Spain, first used to distinguish an individual from others in the same locality, trade or even family. In this early stage, beginning in the last part of the ninth century among the upper classes, the system of patronymics develops where the individual is distinguished by identifying him with his father. This followed Jewish and Moorish tradition, but instead of using the<italic> ibn</italic> or <italic>ben</italic> of those cultures added “ez” or “es” to end of the given name of the father; hence the origins of surnames such as Martinez, Ramirez, and Sanchez.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0363199012443667">18</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>According to Salazar y Acha, next came lineage names that associated individuals with specific families, in some cases even without their acquiescence. These at first often were associated with places of origin or service. This lineage name still functioned to distinguish an individual from others, not as the name of an entire family. In many cases, siblings in the same nuclear family used different lineage names. At each of these steps, he develops examples from the upper classes and only briefly mentions the common people, usually with a sentence or phrase indicating that a century or two later the common people followed that upper-class pattern.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0363199012443667">19</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Finally, Salazar y Acha sees the surname becoming synonymous with a family name, used by the individual and passed on to his descendants. For him, the final step in this historical process takes place with the adoption of civil registration in 1870, which “brought down a centuries old tradition of individual freedom in adopting a surname and obligated Spaniards to have to choose a surname the would from that moment be that of their descendants forever.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0363199012443667">20</xref>
</sup> In short, what occurred is what Scott, Tehranian, and Mathias would describe as a State-making/State-naming function that finally locked in a system of permanent hereditary patronyms, although with the uniquely Spanish twist that recognized maternal as well as paternal elements.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0363199012443667">21</xref>
</sup> Thus, in the flow of his discussion Salazar y Acha mentions each of the factual findings set forth below, but most often in terms of the Nobility and based primarily upon personal observation as a genealogist and not through any type of demographic analysis. Furthermore, for his audience made up primarily of genealogists he limits himself to descriptive analysis and does not deal with issues of identity.</p>

<title>Results of This Study of the Intergenerational transmission of Surnames</title>
<p>All of the literature on surnames agrees that surnames are key factors, among others, in establishing an individual’s identity, potentially including familial, ethnic, national, social, religious, and professional dimensions. The passing of surnames from one generation to the next should, therefore, be a cultural process that is a starting point in the process of defining individual and familial identity. Understanding that process and its parameters and potential for flexibility in the early modern age in Spain will assist in genealogical, biographical, and historical research involving male as well as female identity and family connections.</p>
<p>The historical study of the intergenerational transmission of surnames in Spain and her colonies summarized in this article, based on over thirty years of genealogical and historical research in Spain and her former colonies, shows a nearly universal system of surname transmission in the sixteenth century that antedates the use of permanent hereditary patronyms in the areas, peninsular and colonial, ruled by the crowns of Castile and Portugal. That system exhibited a great flexibility in surname transmission allowing selection of the surname to be used from among those of a child’s extended pedigree, both maternal and paternal. From these findings emerges the conclusion that Hispanic society did not, and does not, view the extended family in the patrilineal, male-dominated fashion of Anglo society. In the Hispanic—and one could, to clearly include Portugal, even say Iberian—perspective, the entire extended family, back on all sides to the third and even fourth generation, is viewed as personally relevant and a potential source for surname usage. It offers a personal identity as a member within an extended family with all of the cultural values, social standing, ethnic identity, and familial loyalties such a name may entail, as well as, in most areas on the Iberian Peninsula, the potential for honor or shame.</p>
<p>To reach that conclusion requires a review of surname usage patterns in Spain and her colonies during the last 400 years, starting with three fundamental constructs of modern surname usage: the double surname, female birth surname retention throughout life, and the creation and use of composite surnames, and then tracing the patterns of surname usage implemented during the last 400 years. These patterns will not only show that the current permanent hereditary patronym or double surname system is of recent origin but also that all of the surname transmission systems used historically in Spain and her colonies point toward a salient feature of Hispanic culture—an inclusive perspective of familial identity that encompasses the entire extended family.</p>
<p>The following specific factual findings will emerge while reviewing historical surname usage patterns:</p>
<list list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>The current use of the double surname originates in the Basque region and with the Castilian upper class and is transferred to other segments of society in Old and New Castile gradually during the eighteenth century but does not achieve universal application in other parts of Spain and her then former colonies until the mid- to late nineteenth century;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>For at least two centuries prior to that time (including most of the American colonial period), most individuals in Spain and the colonies used only one surname, most frequently derived from the father;</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>In certain geographical areas of Spain, primarily Extremadura and Galicia, the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries are characterized by a different pattern in which male children adopt the surname of their father and many females adopt the surname of their mothers; and</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>The Spanish regional female surname systems marks a transition from the earlier and more geographically universal system visible in the sixteenth-century colonial period, when greater flexibility in surname usage was evident. During this time, parents apparently selected the surname to be used from among those of their extended pedigrees, both maternal and paternal.</p>

<title>Basic Surname Concepts</title>
<p>Essential to a discussion of the historical development of intergenerational surname transmission is a detailed understanding of three patterns of surname usage prevalent in Spain and her former colonies even to this day: female, double, and composite.</p>
<sec id="section4-0363199012443667">
<title>Female Surname Usage</title>
<p>Women in Iberian society have, since at least the fifteenth century, retained their birth surname throughout life. Unlike in Anglo society, females do not take the name of their husbands upon marriage. In thirty years of research reconstituting families in over 250 different parishes, a dozen diocesan archives, more than twenty provincial historical archives and numerous municipal archives in all regions of Spain, as well as all of the national archives covering time periods from 1450 to 1900, only two limited exceptions to this general rule has been found. In Catalonia during the eighteenth century, and in the Basque provinces before 1650, married women often appear in the records after marriage with their husband’s surnames, although in most cases this was accomplished by adding the husband’s surname and dropping one of the surnames from a double or composite birth surname.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0363199012443667">22</xref>
</sup> For over five hundred years, in all other regions of Iberian Peninsula as well as in all American colonies at least until independence, women have retained their birth surnames and not adopted their husbands’ surnames.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0363199012443667">23</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>This pattern of female surname usage is not limited to Iberian countries. A similar system exists in France and Italy as well, likely originating in neo-Roman law adopted in all of these countries during the birth of the Civil Law legal tradition in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. This concurs with the more extensive property and inheritance rights women held under the Civil Law legal tradition in these countries. Those rights include the ganancial, the right of the wife to one half of the husband’s earnings during marriage; the right to own, buy, and sell property as a married woman; and the right to transfer that property as an inheritance to children upon the woman’s death, even if the husband was still living.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0363199012443667">24</xref>
</sup> Women’s consistent retention of their birth surnames throughout life shows especially in Spanish culture—which is often viewed as excessively male-dominated—a surprising continuity of female involvement with the birth family that exists after marriage and even through death, including, as a part of that continuity, the retention of property and rights thereto. In proposing the adoption of the Spanish surname system in Anglo-American society, James Stodder recognizes that<disp-quote>
<p>A naming system can neither fully determine social values, nor be determined by them. [One author] notes that Iberian or Arab women who retain their natal surnames in marriage are not thereby assured more autonomy than women in the Anglo-American tradition. One must look at the whole culture, not just systems of naming or even descent.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0363199012443667">25</xref>
</sup>
</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Nevertheless, as he analyzed this cultural phenomenon of female surname usage, he concluded that Spain has had a relatively high degree of:<disp-quote>
<p>1) equal inheritance through the male and female line;… 2) female succession in a lineage if male heirs are lacking;… 3) considerable independence for some women; 4) social groupings maintained by endogamy; . . . and 5) hyperarticulation of relatedness and nobility. . . . The last two points are not obviously related to the other three, however, [Stodder argues] that they are a consequence of the first three and that all five imply a relatively high status for Spanish women.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0363199012443667">26</xref>
</sup>
</p>
</disp-quote>One need only to look at the works of David Gilmore and others dealing with the matrifocality in Spain and Portugal to see the complexity of issues raised in these statements.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0363199012443667">27</xref>
</sup> Much of that is beyond the focus of this article. For our purposes, what is relevant is that female surname usage lays a foundation for a stronger role for women in Spanish society and shows a propensity in that society, even beyond what occurs in France and Italy, to recognize women not only in terms of individual identity but also in terms of the familial identity of women and their children.</p>

<sec id="section5-0363199012443667">
<title>Double Surnames</title>
<p>Each person carries a name made up of two parts, which taken together identify him and generally distinguish him from any other person. While in English we refer to both of these as one’s “name,” in Spanish they are clearly differentiated. The first is the <italic>nombre</italic>, or <italic>nombre de pila</italic> (given name, Christian name, or first name), and the second is the <italic>apellido </italic>(surname). The <italic>nombre de pila</italic>, that name given at the baptismal font, identifies the person as a distinct and unique individual. The <italic>apellido</italic>, a direct descendant of the Roman <italic>nomen gentilitium</italic> (family name), identifies the individual as a member of a particular family and is usually transmitted from one generation to the next as a permanent hereditary patronym. Taken together, they identify that person as a unique individual in society, while defining his or her place in relation to a family.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0363199012443667">28</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Today the double surname system characterizes the intergenerational transmission of <italic>apellidos </italic>in Spain and Latin America (except in Argentina). The first surname a native of those countries carries is that of his father, the one that English-speaking people commonly use as their surname. The second surname is his mother’s surname, or what would be called her “maiden name” in English. For example, in the case of Francisco Lopez Ramirez, Francisco would be his <italic>nombre</italic> or given name. Lopez would be the surname of his father (<italic>apellido paterno</italic>), and Ramirez would be the surname of his mother (<italic>apellido materno</italic>). If Francisco married a girl named Maria Aguilar Gines (Aguilar being the surname of her father and Gines that of her mother), and they had a child called Daniel, his name would be Daniel Lopez Aguilar. Daniel would be his nombre; Lopez his <italic>apellido paterno</italic> (the surname of his father); and Aguilar his <italic>apellido materno </italic>(the surname of his mother).</p>
<p>Each Hispanic double surname serves as a miniature genealogical tree giving the mother’s as well as the father’s family name, and thereby more uniquely identifying the individual by identifying both families from which he or she descends. Culturally this double surname system represents a perspective of family that recognizes and encompasses more than the father’s family, as it includes the mother’s as well. Not only does a Hispanic woman not surrender her unique identity and birth family connection when she marries, but she passes on a part of that identification to her children. A new family formed by marriage encompasses both paternal and maternal family elements, as shown in the double surnames of the children. Note, however, that the surname that the mother passes to her children is her paternal surname rather than that of the female side. The emphasis thus is familial—not umbilical. Questions will be raised later as to the extent to which female self-identity (vs. identification with birth family) is encompassed in this modern surname usage.</p>

<title>Composite Surnames</title>
<p>Every appearance of two surnames together is not an instance of a double surname reflecting the paternal and maternal surnames. While only occasionally used today, composite surnames, defined as the use, usually for two or more generations, of two surnames as if they were a single surname, were common in the colonial period in Spain and at least among the upper classes in her colonies. Frequently, composite surnames appear as a way to distinguish one family with a common surname from others of the same surname. For example, when Meliton Gonzalez Trejo arrived in the United States in 1874, his paternal ancestors had used the composite surname “Gonzalez Trejo” for six generations, since the time of his third great-grandfather, Martin Gonzalez Trejo, born in 1694. (See the top or patrilineal line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0363199012443667">Figure 1</xref>) This composite surname had been created by adding to the familiar “Gonzalez” a second surname, “Trejo,” that of Martin’s maternal grandmother, Francisca Trejo.<sup>

<title>Historical Development of the Double Surname System</title>
<p>While most Spaniards today believe that their double surname system has been a part of Spanish culture since the Middle Ages, documentary evidence indicates this is not the case. Originating among the upper classes in Castile before the sixteenth century,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0363199012443667">31</xref>
</sup> the double surname system does not come into use among the common people of that region until the eighteenth century. Not until the last quarter of the nineteenth century does it become universal throughout Spain and her former colonies, except Argentina. Prior to that time, most records for common people used only one surname, either singular or composite. Establishing that fact is necessary to exploring previous systems of intergenerational surname transmission</p>
<p>The most effective records for studying the intergenerational transmission of surnames are vital records, especially the marriage records found in Catholic Church parishes. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0363199012443667">Figure 2</xref> shows the results of an analysis of double surname usage in the marriage records of the town of Presillas in the province of Santander. Such usage first appears in the 1730s and becomes nearly universal by 1800. This confirms observations made while researching in the Castilian towns of Cantalpino, Peñaranda de Bracamonte, Crespos, Muñogrande, Vita, Palacios Rubios, Mancera de Arriba, and other small towns on both sides of the border between the provinces of Avila and Salamanca. In these towns, grooms and even a few brides occasionally appear with double surnames beginning in the 1730s, although not universally until well into the last quarter of the nineteenth century.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0363199012443667">32</xref>
</sup> Similar patterns appear in wills and other documents drafted by notaries in these towns. Interestingly in Basque parishes and notarial records in Elgueta, Vergara, Anguiozar and other small towns of Guipuzcoa double surname usage appears as early as the 1630s.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0363199012443667">33</xref>
</sup> Is this area where anyone born is by definition a nobleman the possible source of the double surname system? Much more research needs to be done to explore that possibility.</p>

<p>This initial research in Castile and the Basque provinces clearly shows the original development of the double surname system antedates the implementation of State-making/State-naming actions inherent in Bourbon reform activities such as the Catastro de Ensenada (1750). This would preclude those activities from being the source of the growth of this system of permanent hereditary patronym/matronym, as one might have hypothesized based on the work of Scott, Tehranian, and Mathias. A century later, the adoption of civil registration and the mandatory implementation of the modern hereditary double surname system as described by Salazar y Acha<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0363199012443667">34</xref>
</sup> is a definitive example of such State-making/State-naming. No similar activities are happening in Spain during these early Bourbon years. Further research can be done on the causes underlying the development and expansion double surname usage, but for our purposes it is sufficient to know its origins lie in Castilian and/or Basque culture and it reflects key concepts of identity inherent in that culture.</p>
<p>Outside the Castillian and Basque regions, the use of double surnames does not appear in any significant amount until after 1860. A review of marriage records in several Extremaduran towns in the province of Caceres shows practically no use before 1860, and no consistent use of double surnames until after 1870.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0363199012443667">35</xref>
</sup> The marriage and birth records of the Civil Register of Fuengirola in the province of Malaga, which begin in 1870, show consistent use of double surnames for the parties involved.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0363199012443667">36</xref>
</sup> However, a significant number of grandparents in the birth records of the 1870s do not have a maternal surname in the first years of keeping these records, suggesting that the second surnames for those grandparents were not known because they had not been used regularly.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0363199012443667">37</xref>
</sup> In the 1841–1870 municipal civil registers of Ronda, in that same province, Baena in Cordoba province, and Jerez de la Frontera in Cádiz province, none of the entries show the use of double surnames.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0363199012443667">38</xref>
</sup> Likewise, family reconstruction research in several Galician parishes revealed practically no use of double surnames before 1870.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0363199012443667">39</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>To counter the argument raised by some historians with whom this article has been discussed, that the listing of only one surname in vital records merely indicates the “laziness” of the priests or registrars, military records were consulted, since these should utilize more precise and traditional record-keeping norms.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0363199012443667">40</xref>
</sup> During the 1950s a research team, under direction of Vicente Cadenas y Vicent, Spanish Cronista Real de Armas, assembled the nine volume <italic>Archivo General Militar de Segovia: Indice de Expedientes Personales.</italic>
<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-0363199012443667">41</xref>
</sup> For each file, the indexers listed the officer’s name/names surname/surnames, date of enlistment, and type of military unit. Research by this author in the original files from which this index was compiled confirms that the <italic>nombres </italic>and <italic>apellidos </italic>for each officer were copied from his personnel file just as they appeared on the <italic>hojas de servicios</italic> (compiled service records) and other records in the files, often covering several decades from the date of enlistment for each officer. Each entry in the index thus accurately reflects the surname usage by that officer during his lifetime.</p>
<p>This index to officers’ records in the military archives at Segovia shows only one surname for the majority of those enlisted before 1830. As an example, there are twenty-six individuals appearing with the single surname Murillo, sixteen of whom enlisted before 1850, the earliest in 1740. Of the eighty-two bearing a double surname with the first being Murillo, only sixteen are dated before 1850 and the earliest is 1806. Only two of the nineteen entries with the sole surname of Muñiz are from after 1810 and of the forty-two who carry Muñiz plus a second surname, only ten were from before 1830, with a mere two dating before 1810.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-0363199012443667">42</xref>
</sup> Similar results were found for the surnames Alvarez, Soler, Benitez, Torres, Taboada, Soliz, Vargas, Carreras, and Rueras. The charts in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0363199012443667">Figure 3</xref> show some of these results in graphic form for the surname Soler. These military records thus confirm that between 1800 and 1860 there was a dramatic shift from primary use of one surname to the nearly universal use of the double surname.</p>

<p>A different set of <italic>hojas de servicios</italic> compiled in the presidios of the American frontier again provide strong support for the preponderance of the use of single surnames before 1820. In the <italic>Secretaria de Guerra, Hojas de Servicios de América</italic>, an index to military service records of officers serving in the American colonies (which obviously has no records generated after 1820 when the colonies became independent), nearly all have only one surname. Of the 1,170 surnames beginning with M, only 102 are listed with two surnames.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-0363199012443667">43</xref>
</sup> Over half of those are connected with the word “de.” Forty-six are combined with Martinez and 10 with Muñoz—all indicating that these are undoubtedly composite surnames rather than double surnames. Assuming the Ms are typical, less than 5 percent of these military officers in the Americas used double surnames.</p>
<p>Surname usage in wills, another type of document one would expect to provide a full formal surname, again reveals the same pattern. The archivist of the Provincial Historical Archives in Cádiz notes in his introduction to the index to wills for the city of Cádiz that the use of surnames in preparing the index “presented the greatest problem because of the oscillation in the use of surnames within the same families, as well as the vacillating spellings, converting . . . [surnames] into something much more changeable than it would have seemed at first glance.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-0363199012443667">44</xref>
</sup> As a result, the decision was made to enter the surnames in the index just as they appeared in the documents. In that index, there are 689 surnames that begin with the letter A, from which only 184 have two surnames. Again, many are certainly composite surnames such as those using the word “de,” and combinations with common surnames of patronymic origin such as Alvarez. Furthermore, although over half of those who wrote testaments from 1740 to 1775 were born outside the province of Cádiz, there is no consistent pattern of origin for those who use two surnames.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-0363199012443667">45</xref>
</sup> Similar patterns appeared in notarial registers consulted by this author while doing family reconstruction work in the provinces of Avila, Salamanca, Madrid, Caceres, Oviedo, Santander, Malaga, La Coruña, Valencia, and Guipúzcoa.</p>
<p>All of these documentary evidences, as well as numerous other records from parishes and state archives consulted by this author throughout Spain, convincingly show that the double surname system, as it functions today, came into universal use in Spain and her former colonies only after 1850. Its adoption was part of the State-making/State-naming process of modernization and legal unification during the late nineteenth century, which took place in Spain under the label of economic and political liberalism in that time period.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-0363199012443667">46</xref>
</sup> Spain mandated the keeping of civil registration records at the municipal level for large municipalities (those with over 500 vecinos) in 1838 but did not set up a national civil registration system until 1870.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-0363199012443667">47</xref>
</sup> Salazaar y Acha affirms that the introduction of the national Civil Register by legislative act in 1870 solidified the use of the Castilian double surname system throughout Spain.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-0363199012443667">48</xref>
</sup> The original law makes no clear requirement that two surnames be listed. Article 48 only requires that the names and surnames of the parents and grandparents, paternal and maternal, be stated for each child registered. The interpretation of that requirement is the imposition of the double surname system as the way a permanent hereditary surname is to be recorded. Not until the Civil Register law of 1870 is replaced in 1957 is the double surname requirement codified.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-0363199012443667">49</xref>
</sup> All of this indicates an underlying cultural disposition that recognizes both paternal and maternal elements in the surname identity.</p>
<p>In Latin America, there was practically no double surname usage before 1850. What appears is for members of the upper class exclusively, and even for them there is no significant usage. Parish, notarial, and census records consulted in Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, Ecuador, Peru, and other Latin American countries show that until the late nineteenth century only one surname was used by most persons. Nevertheless, by 1900 the double surname is being used extensively in all Latin American countries except Argentina.</p>
<p>Civil registration was certainly a significant factor in the standardization of surnames and surname transmission in Latin America. Mexico became the first Hispanic country to enact a complete national civil registration law in 1859. The last three to do so were Ecuador (1900), Panama (1914), and Bolivia (1940). All other Latin American countries adopted civil registration legislation between 1865 and 1888.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50-0363199012443667">50</xref>
</sup> This is a period that could definitely be classified as State-making/State-naming under the Scott–Tehranian–Mathias model, although later in history than they appear to have contemplated. For example, during the Porfiriato period in Mexico, many State-making/State-naming activities took place, including judicial codification, railroad development, census taking, adoption of sanitation measures, publication of national geographical dictionaries, and adoption of civil registration of births, marriages, and deaths. Unfortunately, no one has yet explored, country by country, the legislative acts and accompanying regulations that created, implemented, and subsequently updated those civil registration systems to determine what legal or customary requirements dictated the adoption of the double surname system in all Latin American countries, except Argentina and Brazil.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn51-0363199012443667">51</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>What cultural factors motivated this nearly universal adoption of the double surname system? As Scott, Tehranian, and Mathias document, similar State-making/State-naming activities in England, the United States, and France resulted in the adoption of a permanent hereditary patronym, rather than the Spanish hereditary patronym/matronym double surname system. In much of Latin America at that time sufficient distrust of Spain and ambivalence toward Spanish heritage existed to discount any overt decision to follow the example of Spain. To understand the near universality of this adoption in Latin America requires looking not at nineteenth-century emulation of European standards but backward into the history of Spain and her colonies for the cultural roots that nourished this transformation.</p>

<title>Intergenerational Transmission of Surnames, 1650–1850</title>
<p>Hispanic single surname usage before 1850 does not culturally reflect the same patrilineal approach found in Anglo societies. The nearly universal adoption of double surnames, not only in Spain but throughout Latin America during the last two generations of the nineteenth century, would indicate a cultural predisposition to a view of the family encompassing both paternal and maternal elements. Women during the entire period from 1600 to 1800 consistently used their birth surnames throughout life. In Castile and the Basque provinces, the double surname system makes a gradual appearance and its use seems to spread, apparently readily accepted without any official decrees. In all parts of Spain, records of the period before 1800 show a flexibility of surname usage where an individual may appear with variant combinations of surnames during his or her lifetime. Manuel de Ravina, the Cádiz archivist and noted genealogist, referred to this flexibility as “oscillation in the use of surnames within the same families.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn52-0363199012443667">52</xref>
</sup> Regional variations on this flexibility even more strongly demonstrate the deeper cultural underlay.</p>
<p>In Portugal, greater flexibility as to the selection of surnames transmitted to a child indicates that this underlay might best be described as Iberian. Even today the Portuguese civil registration law allows for the transmission of any surnames that belong to either parent, even one that belonged to a grandparent and was not transmitted to the parent of the child being named.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn53-0363199012443667">53</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>While generally during the period 1650–1800 the single surname transmitted from the parents to the children was that of the father, in Galicia and Extremadura a different system was in use. In those two regions, male children generally received the surname of their father, but distinctively, females very frequently received that of their mother, resulting in the same surname passing down the descending umbilical or matrilineal line on the pedigree. Over twenty years of family reconstruction research in both of these regions has verified this phenomenon numerous times, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0363199012443667">Figure 1</xref>. Note that starting with Maria Curiel Rubio, the maternal grandmother of Meliton Gonzalez Trejo, her mother, grandmother, and great-grandmother running down the umbilical line all carry the surname Ximenez. Likewise the mother, grandmother and great-grandmother of Miguel Moreno de Tome, Meliton’s maternal grandfather, all used the surname Sanchez. Similarly, on the paternal lines, the surnames Sanchez and Lora Mirasierras appear in the previous three female generations.</p>
<p>Questions can and have been raised as to whether the double surname system is merely a recognition of the birth family, but still patrilineal in nature. Was (and is) there female identity (vs. identification with birth family) encompassed in that surname usage? Such questions cannot be raised as to the female surname system in use in Galicia and Extremadura before 1800. It was clearly umbilical, identifying the women with their mothers and grandmothers. In an attempt to statistically document this truly matronymic female surname transmission approach, marriage records from several parishes were studied. Two parishes came from the Extremadura region: Santo Domingo, a parish in the larger town of Trujillo, birth place of Francisco Pizarro, and Santa Catalina of Fregenal de la Sierra, a small town in the Badajoz province of Extremadura. From other regions, single parishes in small towns were selected: Presillas in the province of Santander; Muñogrande in the province of Avila; and the Basque parish of Elgueta in Guipuzcoa. Marriage records for the period 1600 to 1750 or 1800 were reviewed in each to determine:</p>

<p>Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0363199012443667">1</xref> through <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0363199012443667">3</xref> show the results of this survey. Consistent with other data accumulated doing family reconstitution work, in Extremadura the use of the double surname is practically nonexistent (between 5 percent and 7 percent) during this time period.</p>
<p>Several interesting other results appear. In the Santo Domingo (Trujillo) parish, of the 1,940 brides for whom parents’ names were given, only 104 (5 percent) used double surnames, with only 15 of those before 1720. Of the remaining number, 557 (29 percent) derived their surnames from their mothers, 920 (42 percent) from their fathers, and 359 (19 percent) from other sources. Of the 1,858 grooms for whom parents’ names were given, 115 (6 percent) used double surnames, averaging less than 4 occurrences per decade before 1700 with gradually increasing numbers after that. Ninety-one (5 percent) used their mother’s surname, 1,478 (80 percent) used their father’s surname, and 174 (9 percent) used a surname derived from another source.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn54-0363199012443667">54</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>In the Santa Catalina parish in Fregenal de la Sierra the results are similar, although more heavily weighted toward derivation from a source other than the father. Of the 213 brides for whom parents’ names were given, only 11 (6 percent) used double surnames, with only one of those appearing before 1720. The largest number, 87 (41 percent), derived their surnames from their mothers, 65 (30 percent) from their fathers and 50 (23percent) from other sources. Of the 209 grooms for whom parents’ names were given, 14 (7 percent) used double surnames (none before 1720), 161 (77 percent) their father’s surname, 17 (8 percent) their mother’s, and 17 (8 percent) a surname derived from another source.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn55-0363199012443667">55</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>In both of these parishes, transmission of a surname other than that of the father was common. A substantial number never used their father’s surname: 48 percent of all brides and 14 percent of all grooms in Trujillo, and 64 percent of all brides and 16 percent of all grooms in Fregenal de la Sierra. Each of these characteristics is also more predominant in the years before 1700.</p>
<p>Although skewed by the fact that earliest records did not regularly record the names of parents,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn56-0363199012443667">56</xref>
</sup> the Elgueta (Guipúzcoa) statistics stand in dramatic contrast to those for Extremadura. Double surnames are much more common, even in the earliest years of the seventeenth century. In Elgueta, 74 of the 185 grooms (40 percent) and 54 of the 157 brides (34 percent) used double surnames. No bride derives her surname from her mother nor from another source. Only 5 grooms of the 185 derive their surnames from the mother, and none from other sources.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn57-0363199012443667">57</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Clearly, in Extremadura for the time period from 1640 to 1760, the transmission of the mother’s surname to her daughters is predominant. In searching for the potential social causes of this phenomenon, a central question became whether there were different legal rights extended to women in Extremadura, either in law or in practice. The research yielded some interesting statistics concerning the ability of married women to transfer property upon deaths to their children or to charities related to the Church. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0363199012443667">Table 4</xref> summarizes a review made of the death records of the San Lorenzo parish in Garganta la Olla, Caceres between 1775 and 1800, with emphasis on testate versus intestate status on death. An astounding (for those of Anglo orientation) 52.5 percent of all women who died during this time did so testate and over one half of those were married (not widowed) at the time of death.<sup>

<p>To test the possibility that the priest in Garganta la Olla might have listed women as testate who made oral wills solely to have masses performed, a search of a collection of wills themselves was undertaken. Having available a nearly complete collection of data from the wills of the nearby town of Zorita for the period 1626–1668 allowed for compiling the statistics of wills actually written and by whom in an Extremaduran town, as well as giving the additional perspective of a different place and time. In thirty-seven annual <italic>protocolos</italic> (years 1626–1668), 182 wills appear. Of those, 109 (60 percent) were done by women, 61 of whom were widows, 36 married, and 12 single. Of the men, 22 were widowers, 48 married, and 13 single.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn59-0363199012443667">59</xref>
</sup> These wills, while regularly making children the residuary heirs, nearly always included bequests under customized charitable gift plans. Many made numerous specific bequests to family members and friends, generally from women to their daughters and other female friends and relatives.</p>
<p>Women in Extremadura during this time regularly passed on to their daughters and other family members more than simply a surname. They evidently had significant if not full testamentary power and sufficient control of their property to be able to actively pursue preparation and implementation of their own testamentary plans.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn60-0363199012443667">60</xref>
</sup> As is the case in most of Castile where partible inheritance patterns also persisted, the female children were treated equally with their brothers in all of the wills where children were the residuary heirs.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn61-0363199012443667">61</xref>
</sup> Furthermore, in the real property transfer documents found in those same <italic>protocolos,</italic> there is no pattern of prior-to-death transferring of real property to specific children, male or female.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn62-0363199012443667">62</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>This pattern of female participation in the transmission of wealth was not limited to Extremadura. The statistics for wills written in Madrid offer a comparison. In a study of wills from the middle 1500s to the late 1800s for those whose surnames start with the letter M, 30 percent of the wills were written by women.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn63-0363199012443667">63</xref>
</sup> In Cádiz during the years 1740–1774, women wrote 31 percent of the wills retained for persons whose surnames began with the letter A.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn64-0363199012443667">64</xref>
</sup> While the participation of women was not as large as that in smaller towns in Extremadura, this is still a significant percentage, showing the active part women played in defining the disposition by inheritance of their personal wealth. A similar study by Deborah A. Rosen in 2003 concluded that the women of New Mexico had more extensive rights under the Spanish colonial legal inheritance and property system than their sisters in colonial New York.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn65-0363199012443667">65</xref>
</sup> The women of Extremadura, and of Spain and her American colonies generally, were in a much better legal and economic position relative to controlling their wealth transfers than their Anglo sisters of the same time period.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn66-0363199012443667">66</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The comparative work of David Gilmour and others on the matrifocal nature of society in the villages and towns of Galicia and Portugal raises other interesting cultural questions. In Portugal, a person could, and to this day still can, select a surname from among those of immediate progenitors, paternal and maternal.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn67-0363199012443667">67</xref>
</sup> In Galicia, the female surname system was predominant until the early nineteenth century.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn68-0363199012443667">68</xref>
</sup> Both fit well with the concept of matrifocality. Not only did women dominate in the domestic realm, but in activities such as the selection of a postmarital residence they created a multigenerational matriarchy further evidenced by the passage of surnames to their female offspring. This suggests that the anthropological constructs centering on matrifocality posited by Gilmour and others have deeply rooted historical antecedents going back at least into the seventeenth century.</p>
<p>Although no one has written about matrifocality in Extremadura, the strong presence of the female surname system suggests it might exist in that region. At first glance, Extremadura seems to differ from Galicia and Portugal in societal patterns, more closely paralleling those of Andalucía described by Gilmour, primarily in the significant numbers of men who remain home for their vocations. However, other Extremaduran societal patterns differ from Andalucía. For example, in the Vera region in the north of Extremadura, the traditional construction of multistory homes with the corral and storage rooms on the ground floor does not exhibit the architecturally closed female world Gilmour describes in Andalucía.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn69-0363199012443667">69</xref>
</sup> Furthermore, as evidenced in photographs taken by Ruth Matilda Anderson and others early in the twentieth century, for at least the last hundred years the women of Extremadura have regularly gathered in the streets in front of their homes to sew and perform other chores; in the markets to both buy and sell goods; and in public work places to do chores in the company of women and men.<sup>

<title>Intergenerational Transmission of Surnames Before 1650</title>
<p>In working on family reconstitutions extending before 1650 throughout Spain and Latin America, but especially in Extremadura and Galicia, an initially disconcerting pattern occurs. The brides and grooms often appear with surnames different from either of their parents. In the Extremadura parish studied above, at least one-fifth (19 percent to 23 percent) of the brides and nearly one-tenth (8 percent to 9 percent) of the grooms had surnames different than either parent. This is even more evident in the Zorita wills discussed above, where 60 percent of the wills name at least one child of the testator with a surname different than that of the testator and the other parent. As an example, the 1632 will of Maria de Valencia, widow of Francisco Carrasco Pulido, lists as their children Alonso Carrasco Pulido, Martin de Valencia, Francisco Carrasco Pulido, and Ynes Nunez.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn71-0363199012443667">71</xref>
</sup> The 1646 will of Catalina Sanchez, widow of Alonso Sanchez Cavallero, names their children as Juan Cavallero, Ysabel Alvarez, Maria Ximenez, and Catalina Sanchez.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn72-0363199012443667">72</xref>
</sup> In that same year Maria Jil, widow of Bernal Sanchez, identifies their children as Francisco Jil, Maria Jil, Maria Martinez, and Pedro Martinez.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn73-0363199012443667">73</xref>
</sup> This is the same pattern as that followed by Francisco de Ocampo-Golfin y Carillo de Figueroa and Andres de Tapia when they gave names to their children born in Costa Rica and Mexico in the 1500s, as noted in the first two opening incidents of this article.</p>
<p>Examining a pedigree reconstituted in these areas illustrates well the variety of multiple surname transmission. Among the ancestors of Meliton Gonzalez Trejo—whose documented pedigree (part of which appears in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0363199012443667">Figure 1</xref> above) now extends, after thirty years of research, back on nearly all lines into the sixteenth century—the vast majority of men took their father’s surnames. Many of the women used their mother’s surnames. In the first five generations, beginning in 1844 and dating back to about 1685, only 1 female of the 62 ancestors has a surname different than either of her parents. Most before 1800 took their mother’s surname. In the next five generations back, 578 different individuals were identified as living between 1685 and 1550. Eleven had surnames different from either parent, and some men took their mother’s surname. Nearly all of these came from the paternal side of the family, which originates in the Extremaduran towns of Logrosan, Cañamero, and Zorita.</p>
<p>In a 1771 marriage dispensation in Cañamero, Bernardo Martin Ramos, the bishop’s representative from Plasencia, criticized the practice of giving surnames different from that of the father, as if it were a local idiosyncrasy of these towns. In referring to the problems found in tracing the grandparents of the bride, he stated, “All of the difficulty is born of the corrupt practice in the region of Logrosan, Zorita and other nearby towns in that the parents put on their children arbitrarily a surname, and if they have four or five [children], they give each a different one drawing from some laudable ancestor, however remote.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn74-0363199012443667">74</xref>
</sup> The previous statistical analysis of marriage records from the parishes of Trujillo and Fregenal de la Sierra and even in the handful of cases in Elgueta, Presillas, and Muñogrande shows that the practice of surname transmission was more widely dispersed than Bernardo Martin Ramos thought. This widespread, flexible practice apparently endured longer in that small region in the Plasencia diocese than elsewhere, making it seem to the priest more regionally idiosyncratic than it had been.</p>
<p>In Galicia, this apparent flexibility endured even longer, appearing 75 to 100 years later in time. The pedigree of Domingo Antonio Blanco de Lema, born in 1753 in Cee, La Coruña, shows three of his sixteen identified ancestors with surnames different than either parent.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn75-0363199012443667">75</xref>
</sup> An article published in 2002 in the <italic>National Genealogical Society Quarterly </italic>analyzes the methodology for finding the family of Juan Mourelle.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn76-0363199012443667">76</xref>
</sup> This same man appeared on the marriage record of his daughter Benita as Juan Varela Figueroa.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn77-0363199012443667">77</xref>
</sup> Subsequent research in the baptismal records of his children and his marriage record, as well as in land sale records, identified him as Juan de Mourelle.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn78-0363199012443667">78</xref>
</sup> In taking the surnames of Varela and Figueroa, he was using his mother’s surnames. His wife Benita used the surname “de Lema,” that of her maternal grandmother Maria de Lema, while Benita’s mother, Antonia Freyere de Andrade, uses the “de Andrade” surname of her maternal grandmother. This pattern of flexible surname usage is encountered throughout Galicia until nearly the end of the eighteenth century. While most women use the surname/surnames of their mothers, many Galicians, both men and women, draw surnames from elsewhere in their pedigrees, some even using different ones at different times in their lives.</p>
<p>In many cases, the practice of surname derivation from earlier generations is reflected in composite surnames. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0363199012443667">Figure 1</xref>, Martin Gonzalez Diaz Trejo derived the last part of the composite surname that his descendants would use for six generations from his mother’s maternal grandmother, Francisca Trejo. In the extended Gonzalez Trejo pedigree, there are several other instances where the second part of the composite surname is derived from a grandparent. Likewise, in a few Zorita wills, names of children that do not match those of their parents do match those of aunts or uncles.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn79-0363199012443667">79</xref>
</sup> In the case of Pedro Gomez de Caceres, son of Andres Tapia and Isabel de Sosa, a recently discovered genealogy found in a 1653 lawsuit in the Archivo Histórico Nacional in Madrid reveals that the parents of Isabel de Sosa were Pedro Gomez de Caceres and Isabel de Sosa and her great-grandfather was Alonso de Sosa. These are the sources for the names of her sons, Pedro Gomez de Caceres and Alonso de Sosa.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn80-0363199012443667">80</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>In each case where lines have been traced back into the sixteenth century, the surnames that seem to appear from nowhere are in reality drawn from a grandparent or great-grandparent. Even the priest who in 1771 viewed the Cañamero practice as a local idiosyncrasy stated that the names were derived from earlier progenitors. During this early time period, an individual apparently could use any of the surnames of his progenitors, rather than being restricted to those of his parents.</p>
<p>These practices of flexibility in the transmission of surnames were not limited to Extremadura and Galicia but appear to have been followed throughout much of Spain and her colonies in the period before 1600. Deficiencies in the extant documentation from this period increase the challenge of showing this. The marriage records in some parishes are preserved from at least the last part of the sixteenth century, but most often do not give the names of the parents of the bride and groom until after 1630, as was the case with Elgueta, Presillas, and Muñogrande. However, compiled genealogies from this period offer numerous examples. For instance, in colonial Mexico in the late 1500s, several of the children of Alberto Cantú, a founder of Saltillo, Mexico, took the surname of their maternal grandfather, Diego de Montemayor, founder of Monterrey, Mexico.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn81-0363199012443667">81</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Pre-1600 notarial records do sometimes give the parents of the parties. While most such records involve sales and powers of attorney for economic transactions, some, such as testaments and marriage inventories, do set forth parental or sibling relationships. Extracts of all such records from the earliest <italic>protocolos</italic> for the city of Mexico have been published. An analysis of these shows that out of the first one thousand such documents in volumes 1, 2, and 3, only twenty-three provide parental or sibling relationships. Of those twenty-three, twelve show children using a surname other than that of the father, or siblings with distinct surnames from each other. In four cases where the mother’s surnames were given, children appeared who used surnames different from either parent. While scant, the evidence indicates that this was a universal Iberian phenomena rather than merely a regional one limited to Galicia and Extremadura. At least four of those using a surname other than the father’s gave their places of origin.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn82-0363199012443667">82</xref>
</sup> All came from places outside of Extremadura and Galicia, from the cities of Salamanca, Ecija, and San Lucar de Barrameda. Even in fifteenth-century notarial records of Avila in Castile, references appear such as “Bartolomé Sánchez, hijo de Juan Fernández,” “Fernando Díaz, hijo de Esteban Sánchez,” “Blasco Muñoz, hijo de Blasco Fernández,” and “Miguel Sánchez, hijo de Juan Gonzalez de Barzones.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn83-0363199012443667">83</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The universality of these patterns of flexibility in the selection and transmission of surnames is clearly established throughout the crown of Castile and her colonies in the sixteenth century and in many areas for long after. What the Extremadura priest Bernardo Martin Ramos saw in 1771 as an arbitrary and corrupt practice and Manuel Ravina, the Cadiz archivist, confronted as a confusing oscillation in surnames used by a single family, Salazar y Acha best described in 1991 as a breadth of choice. In discussing the use of patronymic surnames during the sixteenth century, he observed:<disp-quote>
<p>We can say that each family enjoys a certain onomastic patrimony that consists of an ensemble of names (<italic>nombres</italic>) used by their parents, grandparents and aunts and uncles, equally from the paternal as from the maternal lines. . . . The family would utilize for the baptism of their children only, except in very rare circumstances, the names from this onomastic family heritage, giving to their children not only the names of their ancestors but also the patronymic that those [ancestors] used.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn84-0363199012443667">84</xref>
</sup>
</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Adding the word <italic>apellidos</italic> alongside <italic>nombres</italic> in this paragraph makes it a perfect description of the family-oriented surname transmission system used in the Iberian peninsula before 1600.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0363199012443667">
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>In the small town of Cañamero in the Spanish province of Caceres, in 1684 Catalina Diaz and Alonso Moreno, both widowed, wished to marry, but were impeded from doing so by an allegation raised by one man who claimed they were related in the fourth degree of consanguinity (blood relationship) or affinity (marriage relationship). While seeking a waiver or dispensation of that impediment, a lengthy investigation ensued, with testimony from six witnesses exploring the pedigrees of both bride and groom and their deceased spouses. The final conclusion was that they were not related and a dispensation was not necessary. One of the witnesses stated that Catalina Diaz “<italic>tiene el derecho al apellido Moreno pero no es de la misma familia que el Moreno</italic> <italic>del contrayente</italic>” (had the right to the surname Moreno but it was not the same family as the Moreno of the groom).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn85-0363199012443667">85</xref>
</sup> This right to use a surname of an ancestor is the key to understanding the overall concept of familial identification in Iberian society during and before the seventeenth century. This is what Salazar y Acha, and for that matter the contemporary Portuguese Civil Registration act, recognize as a family heritage from which a parent may draw when giving names and surnames to a child.</p>
<p>The right to derive a surname from anywhere within the extended family indicates that the family at that time was not viewed in the patrilineal fashion to which contemporary Anglo society is accustomed. Female surname transmission from mother to daughter for several generations likewise substantiates that conclusion, as does the practice of women retaining their surnames throughout life. Rather than a patrilineal, male-dominant model, as illustrated by the standard pedigree chart (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0363199012443667">Figure 1</xref> for an example of such a pedigree), consider a circular pedigree chart where the individual is in the center of his ancestral lines which radiate from him in all directions equally, without distinction for male or female. One could twist the chart in any direction and it would be the same. This perspective better illustrates the view of Iberian society toward the extended family. Each part of the extended family is of value, and a source not only for surname derivation but for that very important component of the Hispanic psyche, honor.</p>
<p>The concept of the role of the extended family’s honor in relation to one’s personal honor explains why, when Joaquin Varea de la Raga petitioned to become a <italic>familiar</italic> of the Holy Office of the Inquisition in Valencia in 1776, testimonies given by all of the witnesses discussed his regular late nocturnal visits to a town widow, as well as how one of his cousins had killed another cousin several years earlier.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn86-0363199012443667">86</xref>
</sup> Clearly, in addition to his own behavior, the activities of these cousins, drawn from distant connections in the family circle, cast a question on his worthiness because they were part of his extended family. Extended family honor—drawn equally from maternal and paternal lines—was a component in an individual’s personal honor.</p>
<p>This circular pedigree model for conceptualizing the view of the extended family resonates with and provides underpinnings for a number of circumstances and concepts found in Iberian societies:</p>
<list list-type="order">
<list-item>
<p>The ease with which the double surname system became universal as Spain and nearly all of her former colonies went through the State-making/State-naming processes of adopting civil registration, at the end of the nineteenth century. This system was wholeheartedly accepted because it expressed the already existing idea of the involvement of more than just the male line in one’s view of family.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>The fact that the Portuguese, in the face of State-making/State-naming pressures inherent in the adoption of civil registration, resisted the creation of a system of permanent hereditary patronymic surnames, opting instead for a system that gave parents traditional flexibility in selecting surnames from the ensemble of those used by their ancestors.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>The Spanish obsession with genealogies with their emphasis on all family lines, not just the male line, going back three or four generations in proofs associated with nobility status, marriage to a military officer, and purity of blood for government, Inquisition, and church service.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>The importance of finding a marriage partner of “buena calidad,” or good family and social status, not just for personal honor but because one’s children were to have that family as part of their extended family. One was literally marrying not just the spouse but the spouse’s family as well.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>The emphasis in inheritance-related documents and the law assuring that a woman’s property went to her children rather than to her husband, which reaffirms this view of the extended family, as does the concept of females retaining their surnames after marriage. The extended family, from female or male sources, was viewed on an equal footing—whether for surname derivation, wealth transfers, or as a source of honor.</p>
</list-item>
<list-item>
<p>The ease with which nephews or cousins of a male relative, often children of a sister, adopted his surname and even became his heirs when he had no children.</p>
</list-item>
</list>
<p>In <italic>Albion’s Seed:</italic> <italic>Four British Folkways in America,</italic> David Hackett Fischer sets out what he calls <italic>immediacy </italic>as a principal of historical analysis, observing that certain cultural traditions transcend the centuries and impact a community or region throughout its history, remaining as relevant in understanding of contemporary society as the society of several hundred years ago.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn87-0363199012443667">87</xref>
</sup> Flexibility in Iberian surname derivation reflects such immediacy from 1500 to 1900. The right to select from the ensemble of family heritage reveals a fundamental difference in the Iberian way of viewing the extended family and its relationship with each individual member. Family heritage is not patrilineal, but rather circular. This requires an increased sensitivity to the role of the extended family, on both male and female sides, in the evaluation and understanding of legal, social, and cultural phenomena in Ibero-American history.</p>

<p>In many societies, including two especially relevant for Spain—Hebrew and Arab, the Roman pattern of a family name was not followed, and instead a patronymic system was used. Vestiges of such a system in Spain can be found in the many Spanish <italic>apellidos</italic> ending in -ez, -es, or -iz. These endings signified “son of,” meaning that names such as Sanchez, Rodriguez, Fernandez, and Gonzales were originally son of Sancho, son of Rodrigo, son of Fernando, and son of Gonzalo. (For more detail, see Salazar y Acha, 15–20.) While the patronymic system can be found in the early noble and royal genealogies of Leon, Galicia, Portugal, and Castile, its general use in Spain had died out by the end of the Middle Ages. At the end of the Middle Ages, and therefore before the beginning of most record types, the use of <italic>apellidos</italic> as a means of identifying particular families became nearly universal, being derived for most of the common people from what was originally the patronymic of an ancestor or from some type of <italic>apodo</italic> (nickname), usually relating to their work, place of origin, physical attributes, or family characteristics.</p>

<p>In Argentina not only was the double surname system not adopted, but specific legislation prohibited married women from retaining their birth surname after marriage and forced them to take their husband’s surnames. When an earlier version of this article was presented at an academic conference in Buenos Aires, the debate which followed offered speculation as to the source of these significant cultural differences between Argentina and the rest of Latin America. Some argued it was the British influence; others the French, but no one offered definitive reasoning or evidence.</p>
