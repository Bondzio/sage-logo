<abstract>
<p>Trust in the police has emerged as a critical issue in China where the police have experienced a crisis of legitimacy. Only a small number of studies, however, have empirically assessed Chinese citizens’ trust in the police. Moreover, the effects of citizens’ participation in social and political activity on evaluations of the police have rarely been investigated. Using survey data collected from over 3,500 Chinese citizens in eight cities, this study examines the impact of social capital and political participation on trust in the police, controlling for demographic characteristics, sense of safety, and locality. Trust in the leaders of neighborhood committees increased the likelihood of trust in the police. A sense of safety also raised the odds of trust in the police. Citizens’ trust in the police is also predicted by trust in neighbors, participation in political activity, and gender. Trust in the police varies across cities and is explained by some common and distinctive variables.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0004865811431329" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Public trust in political institutions is a pivotal issue in any society because it signals citizen support essential for the legitimacy of the government. Citizens who trust the government are more likely to display compliance behavior toward policies, laws, and regulations, such as paying taxes and accepting dispositions of criminal justice practitioners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0004865811431329">Levi, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0004865811431329">Murphy, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0004865811431329">Tyler, 1990</xref>). ‘Such compliance is important… to the state, because it means that political authorities have less need to rely upon heavy-handed enforcement and politically expensive coercion to control citizens’ behavior’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0004865811431329">Brehm and Rahn, 1997</xref>: 1003). Lack of public trust and subsequently compliance can lead to serious political consequences. Recent unrest in the Middle East and northern Africa exemplifies how quickly government legitimacy evaporates when public trust in political figures and institutions are severely undermined by authoritarian rules and practices. Indeed, public trust in the police is imperative because how people conceptualize and evaluate the police can shape the way they respond to them, the political support and cooperation they render to them, and their willingness to participate in police and community anti-crime programs and efforts.</p>
<p>The primary purpose of this study is to assess Chinese citizens’ trust in the police. China has emerged as a global economic and political power and become arguably one of the more stable authoritarian regimes in the world. Nonetheless, the rapid social and economic transformations have resulted in a gradual erosion of the state’s coercive power in general and a legitimacy crisis of its social control apparatus in particular (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0004865811431329">Tanner, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0004865811431329">Wong, 2004</xref>). While public assessments of police have been the subject of a substantial number of studies in Western societies and research on law, crime, and justice in China has steadily increased over the past three decades, public trust in Chinese police has received relatively little attention. Only a handful of studies have investigated the issue, generating valuable information for a basic understanding of the general patterns and correlates associated with Chinese perceptions of the police (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0004865811431329">Cao and Hou, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0004865811431329">Lai et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0004865811431329">Wu, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0004865811431329">Wu and Sun, 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0004865811431329">2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Two additional reasons justify this research. First, while community-based networks and organizations have become important reference groups in the lives of the urban Chinese (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0004865811431329">Chen, 2000</xref>), the plausible connection between participation in various forms of social and political activity and evaluations of the most visible neighborhood-level government agencies, the police, have yet to be explored. Second, although recent studies found that Chinese college students’ satisfaction with police varied across cities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0004865811431329">Wu, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0004865811431329">Wu and Sun, 2010</xref>), possible city-level variation in trust in police has never been adequately assessed using the general population sample. This study takes variables of social capital, political participation, and locality into consideration.</p>
<p>Using survey data collected from over 3,500 residents of eight Chinese cities, this study addresses several fundamental and important questions: (1) what is the general pattern of Chinese trust in police; (2) does trust in the police vary across cities; (3) do social capital and political participation predict citizens’ trust in the police; and (4) is citizens’ trust in the police in each city accounted for by the same or a distinctive set of variables? This study will produce valuable information for political leaders, policy makers, and police administrators to understand better the current state and correlates of public trust in the police in China. For policing scholars, knowledge about assessments of the police in the Chinese context allows interesting comparisons to be made with theories and evidence based predominately on Western data.</p>

<sec id="sec2-0004865811431329"><title>Police–citizen relations in post-Mao China</title>
<p>Police–citizen relations entered a new era after China started its economic reform in the late 1970s. As in many transitional societies, China’s rapid social, political, and economic changes have been accompanied by a deteriorating relationship between police and citizens, causing a crisis of police legitimacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0004865811431329">Wong, 2004</xref>). Perhaps the most important factor that strains police–citizen relations is the much greater power the Chinese police have in performing their duty compared to their Western counterparts. For instance, Chinese police have the authority to impose administrative sanctions, ranging from fines to detention in police jails, on minor and public order offenders without any judicial review or approval (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0004865811431329">Leng and Chiu, 1985</xref>). Chinese police also do not need the court’s approval but only the police chief’s permission to conduct any kind of searches and seizures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0004865811431329">Ma, 2003</xref>). The awesome power given by the state created an unequal relationship between officers and local residents, with police as superiors and residents as subordinates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0004865811431329">Jiao, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>In China there is no independent, non-party oversight system to effectively prevent and punish police misconduct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0004865811431329">Sun and Wu, 2010</xref>). Governmental efforts to control police misconduct were largely ineffective; partly due to the lack of respect for the law in the police culture and partly to the over-reliance on monetary incentives to carry out police work in the market economy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0004865811431329">Dutton, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0004865811431329">Ma, 2003</xref>). As a result, illegal and corruptive cases involving police officers have been alarmingly on the rise since the early 1980s. From 1993 to 1997, more than 40,000 police officers were involved in over 33,000 criminal cases or disciplinary violations, with an average of 8,000 officers – or 6 percent of the total number of officers – investigated and punished annually (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0004865811431329">Wang, 2007</xref>). The extent of police misconduct has surfaced as, and continues to be, a serious social problem in China (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0004865811431329">Falkenheim, 1987</xref>).</p>
<p>Recent incidents involving police malpractice and abusive behavior toward detainees in detention centers have drawn widespread attention and public outcry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0004865811431329">Sun and Wu, 2010</xref>). It appears that the unwillingness of citizens to openly challenge authority in general, and the traditional superior–subordinate relationship between police and citizens in particular, have gradually altered. Specifically, a noticeable surge of disrespectful or resistant citizen behavior toward police authority has been observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0004865811431329">Wong, 2004</xref>). Such a development is evident in two interrelated national trends concerning the Chinese police.</p>
<p>The first trend is the widespread occurrence of mass incidents throughout the country. Public demonstrations have become better organized and increased dramatically in both number and size, multiplying by more than 2.5 times, from 8,700 in 1993 to 32,000 in 1999 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0004865811431329">Tanner, 2004</xref>). The total number of protests increased by over a quarter, from 56,000 in 2003 to 74,000 in 2004. During the first half of 2005, 341 organized and armed mass protests in 92 areas were documented. Among them, 17 involved over 10,000 protesters, 46 involved over 5,000, and 120 involved over 1,000, causing the deaths of 102 citizens and 55 police officers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0004865811431329">Mainland Affairs Council, 2005</xref>). The negative, confrontational nature of police–citizen contact in many of these mass incidents promotes hostile sentiments between the police and public.</p>
<p>A second development is the rise in the number of police officers killed on duty. Law enforcement has become a risky occupation in China. The average annual number of police deaths in the line of duty was low in early years, averaging 36 between 1949 and 1978, but has skyrocketed to 450–500 in recent years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0004865811431329">Tanner, 2004</xref>). According to the Ministry of Public Security, police deaths were up three years in a row, increasing from 443 in 2002, to 476 in 2003, and to 492 in 2004 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0004865811431329">Sun and Wu, 2010</xref>). Occupational risk of death may shape officers’ mentality in interacting with citizens and have a negative effect on police–community relations. Using survey data to compare Chinese officers’ occupational attitudes with those of the US police, a recent study found that Chinese police cadets were more likely than their American counterparts to favor the notion of ‘distrust of citizens’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0004865811431329">Sun et al., 2010</xref>). Indeed, the rise of mass incidents and police deaths may have taken a toll on Chinese policing with respect to officers’ attitudes toward citizens and police–community relations.</p>
<p>Despite these negative developments undermining police–community relations, the majority of Chinese citizens rated the police favorably. For example, more than 80 percent of respondents reported that the Chinese police did a good job in controlling crime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0004865811431329">Zhu et al., 1995</xref>). In two recent studies, one found that about 72 percent of Chinese citizens trusted police a lot or to a degree (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0004865811431329">Wu and Sun, 2009</xref>), and the other showed that 56 percent of Chinese college students were ‘very satisfied’ or ‘satisfied’ with the police (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0004865811431329">Wu and Sun, 2010</xref>). Comparative research on Chinese and American citizens’ attitudes toward the police reported mixed results. Two studies found that the Chinese were more critical of the police than their US counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0004865811431329">Cao and Hou, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0004865811431329">Wu, 2010</xref>), while another survey revealed the opposite information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0004865811431329">World Values Survey, 2010</xref>).</p>

<sec id="sec3-0004865811431329"><title>Social capital and political participation in urban China</title>
<p>Social capital is a complex concept and scholars have not reached a consensus on its definition. Nevertheless, the concept can be best captured through two components: objective associations and subjective ties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0004865811431329">Paxton, 1999</xref>). The former stands for ‘social networks’ or ‘formal and informal associations… formed and engaged in on a voluntary base’, whereas the latter refers to ‘norms’ or ‘trust and reciprocal feelings among individuals’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0004865811431329">Chen and Lu, 2007</xref>: 425). Both components represent valuable resources that facilitate the formation of collaborative and productive actions among individuals and subsequently increase the likelihood of achieving common or specific goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0004865811431329">Brehm and Rahn, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0004865811431329">Putnam, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>The post-Mao era of economic reform has contributed to the emergence of modern social capital in China. A large number of voluntary, informal organizations have been established, creating platforms for urban residents to participate in social, cultural, and economic activities outside the arena of the traditional government-sanctioned, formal organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0004865811431329">Chen and Lu, 2007</xref>). Such participation cultivates objective social networks and subjective mutual trust among individuals, especially urban dwellers.</p>
<p>Along with the explosive growth of voluntary and non-government organizations in China, research on social capital has increased over the past two decades. Scholars have investigated the effects of social capital on job search (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0004865811431329">Bian, 1997</xref>), democratic governance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0004865811431329">Chen and Lu, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0004865811431329">Hu, 2009</xref>), collective resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0004865811431329">Shi, 2008</xref>), and political participation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0004865811431329">Guo, 2007</xref>). What is less researched is the linkage between social capital and trust in police. Evidence from two lines of inquiry conducted in Western societies sheds some light on this possible connection.</p>
<p>The first vein of investigation reveals that social capital directly promotes higher levels of confidence in governmental institutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0004865811431329">Brehm and Rahn, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0004865811431329">Putnam, 2000</xref>). As police are an integral part of the political system, it is reasonable to expect that citizens’ evaluations of the trustworthiness of police are also influenced by their social capital. A recent study found that depleted levels of perceived neighborhood social capital contributed to higher levels of distrust in the police (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0004865811431329">MacDonald and Stokes, 2006</xref>). Further, researchers have distinguished between two types of community social capital – bonding and bridging capital (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0004865811431329">Brehm and Rahn, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0004865811431329">Uslaner, 2000</xref>), and argued for their differential effects on residents’ trust in police and perceptions of police legitimacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0004865811431329">Hawdon, 2008</xref>). It is proposed that bridging capital, referring to capital that extends beyond one’s immediate social circles, has a direct influence on one’s perceptions of police legitimacy and indirectly influences perceptions of procedural justice and willingness to cooperate with the police. Meanwhile, bonding capital, based on trust in one’s immediate social circles, has little influence on perceptions of police legitimacy, yet directly influences the effects of officers’ behavior on residents’ trust and perceptions of procedural justice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0004865811431329">Hawdon, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Based on social disorganization theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0004865811431329">Shaw and McKay, 1942</xref>), the second line of research links negative neighborhood structural characteristics (e.g. poverty, residential mobility, and racial heterogeneity) to weak social networks and control, and subsequently, high crime rates (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0004865811431329">Sampson and Groves, 1989</xref>). An elaboration of the theory connects the concept of collective efficacy (measured mainly by levels of cohesion and mutual trust among neighborhood residents) to less social or physical disorder and crime problems in neighborhoods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0004865811431329">Sampson et al., 1997</xref>), which may contribute to higher levels of satisfaction with police. Indeed, a recent study found that collective efficacy is positively related to Chinese immigrants’ global satisfaction with, as well as specific assessments of, the effectiveness, integrity, and demeanor of the US police (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0004865811431329">Wu et al., 2011</xref>). Other studies focused on a reverse relationship – the effects of perceptions of the police on neighborhood social capital. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0004865811431329">Silver and Miller (2004)</xref> found that satisfaction with the police is a significant source of neighborhood levels of informal social control, mediating the connection between neighborhood structural characteristics, including concentrated disadvantage and immigrant concentration, and levels of informal social control. Another study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0004865811431329">Scott, 2002</xref>) suggested that promoting police accessibility can help generate neighborhood cohesion, trust, and efficacy.</p>
<p>In this study, we assess the impact of both objective associations and subjective ties on trust in police. For objective associations, we focus on urban residents’ participation in various forms of social activities, including gatherings with fellow townsmen, old schoolmates, and military comrades and events organized by neighborhood Residents’ Committees (RCs), common interest groups, and voluntary organizations. These activities tend to enhance social capital by promoting information flows, mutual communication, and peer support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0004865811431329">Paxton, 1999</xref>). For subjective ties, we measure trust in neighbors and neighborhood RCs, arguably two of the most important reference groups for urban dwellers, given the decline of the role of work units (<italic>danwei</italic>) and the direct election of leaders of RCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0004865811431329">Chen and Lu, 2007</xref>). In urban China, the power of local governance and the locus of social activities have shifted from work units to neighborhood-based groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0004865811431329">Chen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0004865811431329">Shi, 2008</xref>), making the study of trust in neighbors and RCs highly relevant.</p>
<p> In addition to social capital, political participation is expected to have an impact on trust in the police. It should be noted that political participation, such as voting and volunteering for candidates, has been conceptualized as part of social capital by some scholars (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0004865811431329">Ladd, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0004865811431329">Putnam, 2000</xref>), whereas others consider it as the outcome of social capital – a concept that is facilitated by, yet distinguishable from, social capital (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0004865811431329">Paxton, 1999</xref>). Although China remains an authoritarian country tightly controlled by a single party, contemporary urban Chinese engage in an array of political activities, such as voting, expressing views to elected representatives and leaders, contacting and lobbying leaders, asking leaders to intervene in social affairs, and asking other citizens to exert influence on leaders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0004865811431329">Chen, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0004865811431329">Guo, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0004865811431329">Shi, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0004865811431329">Tong, 2003</xref>). Political participation in post-Mao China can be characterized as not only having more legitimate channels and opportunities for civic engagement, but also as involving more open-minded citizens who tend to be critical of politics and public policies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0004865811431329">Chen, 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Party membership has been a fundamental way for citizens to participate in politics. It carries different meanings in Western societies and China, however. Specifically, party membership entails obligation and voluntariness and bears little implication for social status in Western societies, while being a member of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) represents a privilege signaling greater power and better connections. One may thus expect that CCP members are more likely than non-CCP members to hold favorable opinions of the police because they perceive this social institution as critical and a scarce resource to which they are entitled and, more importantly, through which their interests and superiority are ensured.</p>
<p>In addition to traditional ways of participation in politics, two relatively new areas worthy of attention are filing complaints and legal sanctions against government officials and engaging in online discussion of political issues. As mentioned above, the recent decades have witnessed the gradual erosion of the state’s coercive power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0004865811431329">Tanner, 2004</xref>) and the surfacing of justice-oriented citizens who ‘struggle against injustice and pursue social equality’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0004865811431329">Heberer, 2009</xref>: 499). One would speculate that citizens who are willing to use formal petitions and legal channels to actively defend their rights and interests are more inclined to display less favorable attitudes toward the police.</p>
<p>Internet usage has increasingly become an essential element of urban residents’ life in China. Widespread participation in online discussion of political topics has been noted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0004865811431329">Hung, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0004865811431329">Zhou, 2006</xref>). While there is no empirical evidence to support a connection between participation in political discussion on the internet and trust in the police, one may speculate that those who are frequent internet users are more likely to read reports, discussions and comments about abusive and corrupt police behavior and thus have less positive evaluations of police.</p>
<p>While acknowledging the overlapping nature of social capital and political participation, we take the position of treating them as separate concepts. In this research, political participation is assessed through individuals’ CCP membership, participation in political activity, and engagement in online discussion of political topics. We examine political activity ranging from conventional civic engagement, such as expressing opinions about public-interest issues to the media and offering suggestions to political representatives, to non-conventional activity, such as visiting petitioning bureaus and suing the government. The inclusion of these indicators captures both traditional and more recent forms of political participation in urban China.</p>

<p>Data used in this study were collected by a large project conducted during the summer of 2009 in eight Chinese cities, including Shanghai, Tianjin, Guangzhou, Xian, Changchun, Jinan, Lanzhou, and Xiamen. The main purpose of the project was to investigate the effect of social networks on employment experience in urban China. Research teams comprised mainly of faculty and graduate and undergraduate students from eight universities, one from each sample city, conducted face-to-face survey interviews with the respondents. The survey instrument consists of over 100 items across six sections.</p>
<p>Stratified sampling techniques were used. On average, 30 to 50 neighborhood RCs were randomly selected from each sample city. Within each RC, 20 households were randomly chosen and then from each household, a resident who was at least 18 years old, had non-agricultural employment experience and whose birthday was the closest to July 1 was targeted for survey. Researchers surveyed a total of 7,102 citizens, asking them all questions in the first five sections of the questionnaire. The last section of the instrument is made up of two sets of different items. In Xiamen, respondents answered both sets of questions in the last section. In other cities, respondents only answered one set of questions in the last section. Specifically, even-numbered household residents (i.e. 2, 4, 6, 8, etc.) answered one set of questions and odd-numbered household residents responded to the other set of questions. The sample size for this study (n = 3,657), thus, was about half of the original sample size because questions about trust in police and other institutions were in the last section of the questionnaire. Cases with missing values were then dropped from the analysis, resulting in a final sample of 3,585 citizens. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0004865811431329">Table 1</xref> displays demographic and socio-economic indicators of sample cities. They are located at five different regions in China and vary greatly in population size, population density, percentage of migrant population, and GDP per capita.

<sec id="sec6-0004865811431329"><title>Variables</title>
<p>The dependent variable, trust in the police, is measured by a single item asking the respondents to evaluate their degree of trust in the police. The response categories include none at all (1), not very much (2), quite a lot (3), and a great deal (4). The variable was re-coded into a dummy variable (0 = none at all and not very much and 1 = quite a lot and a great deal) for binary regression analysis because the parallel lines assumption required for ordinal regression is violated.</p>
<p>The independent variables are divided into two groups, social capital and political participation. Social capital is measured through three variables. Social activity is an additive scale of four items asking the respondents how often they participate in ‘gatherings of fellow townsmen, old schoolmates, and military comrades’, ‘activity organized by neighborhood residents’ committees’, ‘activity organized by common interest groups’, and ‘voluntary activity’. Response categories include never (0), rarely (1), occasionally (2), sometimes (3), often (4), and very often (5). A Cronbach’s alpha of .62 indicates that the scale has an acceptable internal consistency. Two other variables are trust in neighbors and trust in leaders of neighborhood RCs, which are derived from two items where the respondents were asked to rate their levels of trust in these groups. Response categories range from none at all (1) to a great deal (4).</p>
<p>Political participation is measured using three variables. Party membership is a dummy variable with 1 representing those who are members of the CCP. Participation in political activity is an additive scale of six items asking the respondents how often they ‘express their opinions about public-interested issues to the media’, ‘offer their suggestions to political representatives’, ‘file complaints to protect their own interests’, ‘visit petitioning bureaus and other agencies’, ‘appeal cases to the government and engage in conversation with agency leaders’, and ‘sue the government or public safety agencies’. All these items have a six-point response category ranging from never (0) to very often (5). The Cronbach’s alpha associated with the scale is .78, suggesting acceptable internal reliability. Participation in online discussion is constructed by summing two items asking the respondents how often they participate in ‘online discussion about important domestic and international issues’, and ‘online discussion about the city’s development and affairs’. Response categories range from never (0) to very often (5). The scale has a Cronbach’s alpha of .87, indicating high internal reliability. The natural log of both scales is computed and used in this analysis because they are highly skewed.</p>
<p>Control variables include demographic characteristics, such as gender, age, educational attainment, employment status, and perceived family socio-economic status (SES), perceptions of safety, and locality. Gender and employment status are dummy variables with 1 representing female and employed (both full and part time). Age is measured in years. Educational attainment is a 10-category variable ranging from less than elementary school (1) to graduate study (10). Perceived family SES is measured using a single item asking the respondents ‘their family’s levels of SES within the city’. Possible responses include low (1), mid–low (2), middle (3), mid–high (4), and high (5).</p>
<p>A second group of control variables measures sense of safety. The respondents were asked to rate their perceptions of property safety, personal safety, and traffic safety (1 = not safe at all and 4 = very safe). Answers were used to construct an additive scale that has acceptable reliability (Cronbach’s alpha = .64). The last group of control variables is locality. A series of dummy variables are created to represent the eight cities, with Shanghai being the reference group in the regression analysis.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0004865811431329">Table 2</xref> reports the descriptive statistics of all variables used in the analysis. Possible multicollinearity problems were checked by examining the matrix of two-variable correlations among all independent and control variables. The highest correlation between two variables is .42, which is acceptable. The small magnitude of the correlations is confirmed by examining variance inflation factors (VIFs), all of which are well below the generally accepted limit of 10.

<p>Looking at the entire sample, three-quarters of the respondents (75%) reported that they trust the police ‘quite a lot’ or ‘a great deal’. This pattern is in line with findings from recent studies on Chinese evaluations of police using the general public sample (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0004865811431329">Lai et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0004865811431329">Wu and Sun, 2009</xref>). As the mean value associated with each city indicates, four of the eight cities have a mean score on trust in the police greater than the entire sample average of 2.86. Citizens in the three large-sized metropolitans, Shanghai, Tianjin, and Guangzhou, and a small-sized city, Xiamen, expressed higher levels of trust in the police than their counterparts in the other four cities. Shanghai stands out as having the highest level of trust in the police (87%). Approximately 75 percent of the respondents in Tianjin, Guangzhou, and Xiamen revealed positive assessments. While the mean scores associated with Changchun, Jinan, Xian, and Lanzhou are lower than the sample average, they do not fall markedly behind those of large cities and Xiamen. About 70 percent of residents in Changchun, Jinan, and Xian rated the police positively and 67 percent in Lanzhou gave favorable ratings to the police.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0004865811431329">Table 4</xref> demonstrates the binary logistic regression results of trust in the police. Two of the social capital variables, trust in neighbors and trust in leaders of neighborhood RCs, are significant predictors. A one-unit increase in trust in neighbors increases the odds of trust in police by a factor of 1.20. Similarly, with a one-unit rise in trust in neighborhood RCs, the odds of having trust in police increases by a factor of 2.79. Among political participation variables, only one achieved statistical significance. The odds of trust in police decrease by 40 percent with a one-unit increase in the measure of political activity.

<p>Among demographic variables, gender and educational attainment matter. Females were 1.34 times more likely than their male counterparts to trust the police. With a one-unit increase in educational attainment, the odds of trust in the police reduce by 4 percent. Citizens’ sense of safety is also significantly associated with trust in the police. Respondents with stronger feeling of safety were significantly more likely to express their trust in the police. Confirming the results from mean comparison, Chinese trust in the police varies across cities. Shanghai’s residents were more likely to report trust in police than their counterparts in Tianjin, Xian, Changchun, Jinan, and Lanzhou. Using different localities as the reference groups, additional analyses (results not shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0004865811431329">Table 4</xref>) revealed that variation exists among cities of similar size and across cities of different sizes. For example, among large-sized cities, Guangzhou residents were more likely to trust the police than their counterparts in Tianjin, and among small-sized cities, Lanzhou residents were less likely than Xiamen to express trust in the police. Citizens in the large city Guangzhou were more likely to trust the police than citizens in the medium-sized cities Xian and Changchun and the small-sized city Lanzhou, while citizens in the small city Xiamen exhibited a higher level of trust in the police than their counterparts in the medium-sized cities Xian, Changchun, and Jinan.</p>

<sec id="sec10-0004865811431329"><title>Multivariate regression analysis by city</title>
<p>The next step of the analysis is to assess whether the level of trust in the police in each city is predicted by a similar or distinctive set of predictors. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0004865811431329">Table 5</xref>, two variables stand out as the universal predictors of trust in the police across cities. Higher levels of trust in leaders of neighborhood RCs were consistently linked to higher probabilities of trust in the police throughout all eight cities. With the exception of residents in Shanghai and Xian, citizens with a stronger sense of safety were more inclined to trust the police. In addition, the significant connection between participation in political activity and trust in the police found in the all sample model works in three cities, Tianjin, Guangzhou, and Xiamen.

<p>Other predictors do not exert a consistent effect on trust in the police across all cities. The associations between gender and trust in the police and between educational attainment and trust in the police are merely evident in Xian and Lanzhou. With the exception of Changchun, the significant effect of trust in neighbors disappears. A new significant predictor surfaces – family SES, which decreased the likelihood of trust in police in Xian.</p>

<p>Relying on a large sample of survey data collected from eight Chinese cities, this study assesses the extent to which Chinese urban residents trust their police and explores factors that explain such trust. Four major findings emerge from this study. First, consistent with the results from previous research, the majority of urban dwellers exhibited a highly favorable opinion of the police. Despite the claim that the police are experiencing a crisis of legitimacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0004865811431329">Wong, 2004</xref>) and recent incidents of police deviance and malpractice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0004865811431329">Sun and Wu, 2010</xref>), it seems that many urban residents were either reluctant to acknowledge or simply ignored these problems and showed tremendous support for their local police. Future studies should collect in-depth interview data to uncover factors that underscore such high levels of public trust in the police.</p>
<p>Second, social capital plays an important role in predicting Chinese citizens’ trust in the police. The results show that trust in leaders of neighborhood RCs, and, to a lesser degree, trust in neighbors were associated with greater likelihoods of residents’ trust in the police, whereas the frequency of social activity (e.g. gatherings of fellow townsmen, old schoolmates, and military comrades, activity organized by neighborhood RCs, and voluntary activity) did not have a trust-enhancing effect. These findings suggest that different dimensions of social capital have an uneven influence on Chinese trust in the police, with subjective ties exerting a greater predicting power than objective associations.</p>
<p>The weak effects of objective associations in general are not so surprising given that there are different types of social activities with varied purposes, interests, and content. Some gatherings, along with the information shared in these gatherings, may actually promote mistrust and dissatisfaction with the police rather than enhancing the trust. Compared to objective associations, trust in neighbors and neighborhood committees represents intangible resources produced in relations among neighborhood members that can facilitate actions for mutual benefit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0004865811431329">Coleman, 1988</xref>). Thus, findings of this study support the necessity to separate the two components of social capital, objective associations and subjective ties, that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0004865811431329">Paxton (1999)</xref> proposes, or the two types of social capital, civic engagement and social trust, that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0004865811431329">Rosenfeld and colleagues (2001)</xref> maintain.</p>
<p>Looking at different types of social capital, the effects of trust in leaders of neighborhood RCs are more persistent than those of trust in neighbors across cities, indicating that bridging capital (i.e. trust in leaders of neighborhood RCs, with whom the residents are less likely to have personal, intimate contact) is more consistently connected to trust in police than bonding capital (i.e. trust in neighbors, with whom the residents are more likely to have personal, close contacts) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0004865811431329">Hawdon, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0004865811431329">Putnam, 2000</xref>). This finding should be further tested in future research.</p>
<p>With respect to the influence of political participation, while communist party membership and participation in online discussion about local, national, and international affairs did not have an impact on Chinese citizens’ trust in police, engaging in political activities could significantly lower public trust in the police. It should be noted that political activity can encompass a range of activities of different types and purposes, and this study only captures those that are more likely to be negative or alienating, rather than positive, contacts between citizens and government officials. Specifically, political activity in this study reflects whether respondents have expressed their political opinions to the media, offered suggestions to political representatives, visited petitioning bureaus, appealed cases to the government, and sued the government, including public safety agencies. It is very likely that people who have been treated unjustly by government agencies tend to initiate such contacts, and, if handled inappropriately, these interactions may instill more dissatisfaction and mistrust of authorities, including the police, into citizens.</p>
<p>Third, Chinese trust in the police varied across cities, and city-level assessments of the police were explained by some common and distinctive factors. Among the eight cities, residents in Shanghai expressed the highest levels of trust in the police, followed by residents in Tianjin and Guangzhou, and residents in Lanzhou showed the least trust, followed by residents in Xian and Jinan. Although data in this study do not provide evidence to identify the underlying forces of cross-city variations, one may suspect that these large metropolitans and the smaller coastal city Xiamen are economically advanced (which is evident in their substantially higher GPD per capita as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0004865811431329">Table 1</xref>), and perhaps, have better training of, and tighter control over, their police forces, which may contribute to more positive assessments of the police. This speculation should be investigated in future research.</p>
<p>Finally, citizens’ sense of safety exerts a consistently positive effect on their trust in the police. Those who think positively about their property’s safety, their personal safety, and traffic safety were more likely to trust the police. The strong link between public feelings of safety and trust in the police suggests that in China the police are seen as the main social institution that is responsible for dealing with crime and disorder problems in society. This finding resonates with the results of recent research conducted in both China (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0004865811431329">Wu, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0004865811431329">Wu and Sun, 2009</xref>) and the US (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0004865811431329">Reisig and Parks, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0004865811431329">Skogan, 2009</xref>), but is less in line with results based on UK data showing that the police were held responsible mainly for community values and informal social control rather than in the areas of crime and safety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0004865811431329">Jackson and Bradford, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0004865811431329">Jackson and Sunshine, 2007</xref>). Future research should continue to compare and contrast the impact on Chinese assessments of police of perceiving the police as guarantors of safety and security versus perceiving the police as defenders of social values and behavioral norms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0004865811431329">Jackson and Bradford, 2010</xref>). Future research should also explore the relationships between perceptions of safety, trust in the police, and trust in neighborhood committees, as crime and safety concerns may have a direct effect on trust in both formal and informal social control institutions.</p>
<p>The limitations of this study should be acknowledged. First, only a single item is available from the original dataset to measure the dependent variable, trust in the police, which although it appears to have good validity, cannot adequately capture the complicated nature of the concept of trust in the police (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0004865811431329">Stoutland, 2001</xref>). Recent research has conceptually and/or analytically distinguished between institutional- and motive-based trust (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0004865811431329">Hinds and Murphy, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0004865811431329">Tyler, 2005</xref>), trust and legitimacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0004865811431329">Hawdon, 2008</xref>), global and neighborhood attitudes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0004865811431329">Schuck and Rosenbaum, 2005</xref>), trust and confidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0004865811431329">Jackson and Bradford, 2010</xref>), and perceptions of effectiveness, procedural fairness, and shared values/priorities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0004865811431329">Hohl et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0004865811431329">Jackson and Sunshine, 2007</xref>). Future research should incorporate more carefully designed survey items to better measure various aspects of police performance. Second, this study, based on eight-city data, cannot reveal potential urban–rural differences in public trust in the police, as found in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0004865811431329">Albrecht and Green, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0004865811431329">Nofziger and Williams, 2005</xref>). Future research should collect data from the vast rural areas in China, taking the substantial developing disparities between urban and rural China into account. Third, some theoretically relevant variables were not assessed in this study. For example, police contact variables, including the occurrence, nature, and reasons of contact, as well as police performance during the contact, may have significant effects on citizen assessments of police and, thus, should be included in future research. Finally, the measures of social capital and political participation can be further improved by disaggregating social ties/activities and political activities of different types and nature.</p>
<p>For police agencies, promoting a sense of trust in the police may not be an easy task, especially among people who are economically and politically disadvantaged, living in neighborhoods that lack strong ties and mutual trust, and facing problems that lead to negative contacts with governmental agencies (e.g. petitioning and complaining). As one of the most visible and important government agencies, the police should strive to help build up social capital in disadvantaged neighborhoods. Positive activities, such as organizing community meetings, solving lingering neighborhood crime and disorder problems, reducing residents’ fear of crime, and improving neighborhood quality of life, can have especially effective trust boosting influences on local residents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0004865811431329">Reisig and Parks, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0004865811431329">Skogan and Harnett, 1997</xref>). Meanwhile, the police should value citizens’ opinions and suggestions, address their concerns, and take their complaints seriously and deal with them professionally. Although negative political activities are associated with lower levels of trust in the police, handling these activities in an appropriate and effective way may increase public satisfaction during that particular political activity encounter, improve police performance, and ultimately promote public trust in the police.</p>
