<body>
<p>Today’s case:<disp-quote>
<p><italic>Your morning email includes an ominously titled message from the agency to whom you submitted a grant application for an exciting trial whose results will make you the pride of your mentor and the envy of your peers. Merely glancing at your computer screen precipitates the symptoms Winston felt when he thought he’d encountered a member of the Thought Police in Orwell’s 1984: your “heart seemed to turn to ice and [your] bowels to water.</italic>” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1740774512449701">1</xref>]</p>
<p><italic>Sure enough. The body of the message is formal, brief, and bleak. They’ve turned you down.</italic></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This pair of <italic>Clinician-Trialist Rounds</italic> proposes three appropriate reactions to this awful news. Looking ahead, Part 2 will present the specific strategies and tactics that we and over 50 of our colleagues employ when we resubmit our own rejected grants. However, and of equal importance, Part 1 will recognize and deal with typical (and even healthy) psychological responses to receiving such a letter. Peter Szatmari, a senior psychiatrist–epidemiologist and autism spectrum disorder researcher, has joined this <italic>Round</italic> and we’ll trade comments and suggestions along the way.</p>
<p><italic>Peter Szatmari</italic>:</p>
<p>If you are a new clinician-trialist, one of the most difficult things to experience is rejection. Well, you may as well get used to it. Shit happens. Designing and conducting clinical trials always involve ‘dark moments’. Because most grant review committees fund fewer than 20% of the grants they see, most of their applicants will be unhappy like you. If I were a baseball player and hit .300, I could ask for a lot of money. But I have never hit .300 when it comes to grant applications so I spend a lot of time writing and rewriting grants.</p>
<p>My second message in this <italic>Round</italic> is that, unlike a cold shower or going to boarding school, having your grant turned down does <italic>not</italic> build character. On the other hand, it can result in a better grant (and protocol!), and at the end of the day, you might even be grateful to that review committee for turning down your first application.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1740774512449701">†</xref></p>
<p>The typical response to grant rejection has three stages. The first is an overwhelming sense of disappointment. It feels like a personal judgment on your scientific abilities, but this can often extend to a judgment on your character and personality. It is vital not to make any important decisions in the first few hours or days after receiving that rejection letter, during which your own ability to critically assess the situation is likely to be clouded. Moreover, to make sure that this stage isn’t prolonged, I suggest immediately moving the rejection notice to a folder where it won’t glare at you every time you glance at your desk or turn on your computer. Only after a nice glass of wine (or alternative relaxation) and some kind words from your partner or other friends is it sensible to come back to that rejection notice and read it in detail.</p>
<p>This usually triggers the next emotional stage: anger. This is the time one typically ‘reviews’ the reviewers. How could the reviewers be so stupid? The buggers obviously know nothing! Their comments are so unfair. Did they grasp the originality or the importance of the proposal? Did they <italic>really</italic> understand the objectives and methods? Were they familiar enough with the field or the methodology? Have they truly provided a scientifically accurate review? The answer to at least one of these questions is almost invariably ‘no’ and provides enough fuel to be angry at the reviewer and the granting agency for some time to come. Time for more wine.</p>
<p>Some colleagues find that writing a response at this stage (but then putting it away for a week) can be helpful. They claim it helps to get the emotion out of the way, and then acts as a starting point to make it easier to get into writing the later, more considered, response. As an inveterate procrastinator, I prefer the wine.</p>
<p>I also find this is the time to call for help from the social support network you’ve developed among your academic colleagues (your mentor, co-investigators, and support-research staff). They will be very helpful in softening the blow of rejection and dissipating your anger, leading to the third stage, that of reconciliation.</p>
<p><italic>Dave Sackett</italic>:</p>
<p>Your recovery might be speeded up by comparing the criticisms of your application with those of 605 grants rejected by the National Institutes of Health, as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1740774512449701">Table 1</xref>. There are three remarkable things about this table: First, you are in good company, for you will see that previous applicants have received the same criticisms as you. Second, this table contains lots of criticisms that you <italic>didn’t</italic> receive, indicating that you aren’t all that awful an investigator. Third, this table was created in 1960, and although we could refine some of its categories, grant reviewers of the new millennium confirm that the same protocol defects are appearing 50 years later.</p>

<p><italic>Dave and Peter</italic>:</p>
<p>After your anger has dissipated (and you realize that being angry won’t get you the money anyway), it is time to think about what the reviewers actually said (instead of what you think they said), and what you’re going to do about them.</p>
<p>We’ll close this first <italic>Round</italic> with the recommendation that your first order of business should be to decide whether to devote your scarce time and energy to resurrecting this grant or to abandoning it and moving on to another of your research ideas. The chances of getting the grant funded are now better since you know what the reviewers of the agency are thinking. But do you really have a chance to get them to turn their thinking around? The grounds for abandoning the proposal are four:</p>
<list id="list1-1740774512449701" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Is the RCT you proposed <italic>too late</italic>? Did their rejection provide convincing evidence that somebody else has beaten you to the punch and already answered your question? If so, should you abandon this application (for, say, an explanatory trial) and turn your thinking to developing one that addresses the next logical question to ask about the benefits of this experimental treatment (say, by proposing a pragmatic trial)?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Is the RCT you proposed <italic>too early</italic>? Did their rejection provide compelling evidence that your proposed intervention is too little understood to be ready for testing in an RCT? Again, if so, should you abandon this application and develop one (perhaps with a basic scientist co-investigator) that would fill in these blanks?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Did your grant receive a ghastly rating for a <italic>fatal flaw</italic> that you simply cannot fix? For example, did the only agency that supports trials like yours express a crushing lack of interest in your proposal?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Would it take <italic>too much of your time</italic> away from worthier pursuits to fix this grant? Has this research project lost its scientific value and attractiveness to you in the interim, replaced by a more important and exciting research question that would be far more deserving of your time and effort?</p></list-item></list>
<p>On the other hand, if the RCT you proposed wasn’t too late, too early, too uninteresting, or too time-consuming to fix, it’s time to convert your distress at its rejection into positive efforts to resurrect and resubmit it. The second of this pair of <italic>Rounds</italic> will summarize the strategies and tactics used by the two of us and over 50 other trialists as we repair and resubmit our unsuccessful RCT grant proposals.</p>
<p>As usual, that’s not the end of this round, for our discussion period has just begun. Rounders who have other or contrary thoughts about responding to grant rejections, have questions or comments about the ones presented here, or have unearthed an update of reference #2 are encouraged to send them to the Editors, with a copy to Dave at <email>sackett@bmts.com</email>. He’ll summarize them in a later round.</p>
