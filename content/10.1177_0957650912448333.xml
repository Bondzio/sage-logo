<abstract>
<p>This article discusses the cyclone performance using dust-laden combustible gas generated by the process of gasification. Unlike a conventional gas separation application, the input gas stream to the cyclone is hot and contains particulate matter in a wide range of sizes. In this study, two cyclone designs and their performances using theoretical and computational fluid dynamic models, supported by experimental work, have been discussed. The challenges faced with respect to measurement of particle size distribution and the particle shape have been identified and their effects on the cyclone performance analyzed.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0957650912448333" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Cyclone separators are considered to be proven particulate control devices within the category of gas–solid separation. These have been considered as an integral part of particulate or dust removal processes in various industrial applications mainly because of their simple design, easy maintenance, absence of moving parts, and low cost. However, their low collection efficiency for particulates smaller than 5 µm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0957650912448333">1</xref></sup> necessitates the use of further particulate cleaning devices.</p>
<p>Cyclones are extensively used in cement, power, and associated process industries. Apart from these industrial applications, cyclones have also been used as a part of gas cleaning equipment in gasification processes to remove dust particles in the raw gas in fluidized and fixed bed gasifiers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0957650912448333">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0957650912448333">3</xref></sup> In such applications, cyclones are used as pre-cleaners to reduce the dust loading on the subsequent particulate removal devices. Though cyclones have been used for particulate control for a very long time, the flow behavior of gas inside the cyclone and the phenomenon of dust collection are yet to be fully understood.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0957650912448333">4</xref></sup> One of the potential explanations is the complex three-dimensional (3D) fluid flow occurring in cyclones.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0957650912448333">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>This study discusses the performances of cyclones in cleaning particulate matter present in hot producer gas generated using woody biomass in a downdraft gasifier reactor.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0957650912448333">3</xref></sup> The original cyclone showed poor performance; therefore, for the given operating conditions, a high-efficiency cyclone was designed and its performance was evaluated. Theoretical calculations for cyclone collection efficiency and pressure drop were done using established theories available in the literature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0957650912448333">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0957650912448333"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0957650912448333"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0957650912448333"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0957650912448333"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0957650912448333"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0957650912448333"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0957650912448333">13</xref></sup> and validated against the experimental results. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation for the proposed design was carried out to gain greater insight into complex flow phenomenon inside a cyclone separator and predict its performance.</p>

<sec id="sec2-0957650912448333"><title>Literature review</title>
<p>As depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0957650912448333">Figure 1</xref>(a), a cyclone can be divided into four main parts: the inlet section for tangential entry of the dust-laden gas; the dust separation chamber which removes the dust particles; the dust collection chamber that collects the separated dust; and finally, the axial outlet pipe known as vortex finder which discharges the clean gas. During its operation, dust-laden gas makes tangential entry through the top portion of the cyclone and moves downward into the conical bottom of the cyclone, following a vortex-type flow. This vortex flow helps in the removal of dust particles due to the generation of centrifugal force.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0957650912448333">6</xref></sup> Due to changes in flow direction, the velocity of flow continuously increases in the outer vortex, and thereby results in higher centrifugal force, which causes the separation of the particles from the gas stream. After being separated from the flowing gas stream, particles slide down to the dust collection chamber provided at the bottom of the cyclone. During this process of separation, smaller particles may not get separated due to lower centrifugal forces acting on them. Also, some particles might re-entrain into the flowing gas bouncing off the cyclone wall. Both these factors lead to decreased collection efficiency of the cyclone. As the downward-moving gas reaches the bottom of cyclone, due to loss of energy in the vortex, it slowly starts migrating inward forming an inner vortex in the central core region and flow reversal takes place. Finally, the upward-moving gas leaves the cyclone through the vortex finder.

<p>The performance of the cyclone is judged by a parameter called ‘collection efficiency’ which is the ratio of particulate matter removed by the cyclone to the particulate matter present in the gas stream entering the cyclone. The key parameters affecting the cyclone collection efficiency can be broadly classified into three categories: geometrical, material, and operational parameters. The geometric parameters that influence the cyclone performance are cyclone inlet width, diameter, exit tube diameter, cone diameter, and cylindrical to cone height. Particle density, concentration, and particle size distribution (PSD) are the material parameters which affect cyclone collection efficiency. The operational parameters that influence the performance are the inlet velocity, saltation velocity, viscosity, and temperature of the fluid.</p>
<p>There are several theories proposed by researchers regarding particle separation in cyclones using different approaches and assumptions. A significant amount of research has been carried out by previous researchers to investigate the effect of cyclone geometry and operating conditions on the cyclone performance. Most of the methods used for estimating cyclone efficiency employ the term ‘particle cut diameter,’ (<italic>d</italic><sub>50</sub>), which is the diameter of the particle collected with 50% efficiency. The particle cut diameter can be estimated by two approaches. One is based on the widely used force balance theory from Lapple<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0957650912448333">7</xref></sup> and the other is the static particle approach proposed by Barth.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0957650912448333">7</xref></sup> However, the biggest drawback is that neither of these theories can directly calculate the collection efficiency for any given particle size.</p>
<p>There have also been theories proposed by Iozia and Leith<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0957650912448333">8</xref></sup> and Leith and Licht<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0957650912448333">9</xref></sup> which too have drawbacks. Li and Wang<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0957650912448333">10</xref></sup> have developed a theory relaxing some of the assumptions made by the above mentioned theories and proposed a new method to calculate the cyclone collection efficiency for any given particle size. This has been argued to be applicable to all types of cyclone design.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0957650912448333">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0957650912448333">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0957650912448333">10</xref></sup> Among the above models, literature establishes that the Li and Wang<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0957650912448333">10</xref></sup> model is able to make the most accurate predictions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0957650912448333">13</xref></sup> due to consideration of realistic phenomena such as particle re-entrainment and turbulence. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0957650912448333">Table 1</xref> summarizes the models used in this study for predicting the cyclone collection efficiency.

<p>Along with cyclone collection efficiency, pressure drop is an equally important parameter to be considered during cyclone design, since it has direct implications on the operating cost. Cyclone pressure drop is a function of cyclone geometry and its operating conditions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0957650912448333">12</xref></sup> Researchers have developed several empirical models as listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0957650912448333">Table 2</xref> to predict the pressure drop across the cyclone.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0957650912448333">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0957650912448333">12</xref></sup> Among these, the pressure drop prediction using the Shepherd and Lapple model has been observed to be the most accurate and thus widely used in cyclone design.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0957650912448333">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0957650912448333">12</xref></sup>

<sec id="sec3-0957650912448333"><title>Current work</title>
<p>The performance evaluation tests on the cyclone were conducted using the 35 kg/h biomass gasifier system installed at Siemens Renewable Energy Innovation Center, Bangalore, India. The collection efficiency of the originally fitted cyclone was found to vary between 21% and 25% at the rated throughput. As the performance of cyclone was a long way below generally acceptable performance, it was decided to examine the reasons behind poor collection efficiency and use the findings to design a new cyclone of higher efficiency. Therefore, one of the objectives of this study was to design a new cyclone with improved collection efficiency at a minimum acceptable pressure drop. Furthermore, the new cyclone was expected to reduce the dust loading on the subsequent gas cleaning systems. The specific objectives of the study are given as:
<list id="list1-0957650912448333" list-type="alpha-lower">
<list-item><p>to examine the reasons for poor collection efficiency of the original cyclone and compare the experimental results against the estimated results using theoretical models;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>to identify the critical geometrical parameters that influence the cyclone performance;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>make use of the findings from (a) and (b) to design a new cyclone for improved performance; and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>to employ computational tools such as CFD for performance evaluation of the cyclone.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<sec id="sec4-0957650912448333"><title>PSD of dust particles</title>
<p>In the design of the cyclone, the size of the particles in the input gas stream is of high relevance. It is therefore necessary to assess the PSD with reasonably high accuracy. Since this input parameter was of high relevance to this study, great care was exercised in assessing the PSD. In this study, the particle size at the exit of the gasifier reactor or the cyclone entry was measured using the well-established procedure for particulate matter and tar sampling procedure identified by Ministry for New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) for gasifier qualification.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0957650912448333">19</xref></sup> The gas containing contaminants was sampled for a period of 4 h. In the post-sampling analysis, the particulate matter collected on a cellulose filter paper was subjected to PSD analysis. The PSD analysis was conducted using a Laser Diffraction instrument known as Mastersizer 2000. As the instrument required the sample in liquid phase, filters containing particulate matter were soaked in a suitable solvent for sufficient time so as to dislodge the particles into the solvent. Subsequently, this solvent sample was subjected to a process known as internal sonification to break the agglomerated particles, if there were any. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0957650912448333">Figure 2</xref> shows the PSD of the dust particles in the input gas stream. The PSD data were in turn used as the input for cyclone design calculations, as discussed in the following section.

<sec id="sec5-0957650912448333"><title>Cyclone design</title>
<p>There are three major types of cyclone designs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0957650912448333">20</xref></sup> which are prominently used in the industries. These can be classified as the high efficiency, conventional efficiency, and the high throughput cyclones. This classification is essentially based on the geometric proportion of cyclone dimensions. The original cyclone that is being discussed in this study did not fit under this classification; it was more of an intermediate design with equal length cylindrical and conical portions. As the performance of the original cyclone (in terms of collection efficiency) was found to be too low (‘Results and discussion’) a thorough analysis was carried out. Comparison of the experimental results against the theoretical models revealed that the actual performance was lower by more than 50% (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0957650912448333">Table 3</xref>). The main reason attributed to this deviation in performance was the geometric design of the cyclone, and thus a new cyclone was designed based on high-efficiency considerations. Furthermore, the effect of the individual dimensions on cyclone performance was examined by benchmarking against the literature studies. Optimum values of each dimension mentioned in the literature vis-a-vis the design values for the current design are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0957650912448333">Table 4</xref>.

<sec id="sec6-0957650912448333"><title>The experimental trials</title>
<p>As mentioned earlier, the cyclones discussed here are meant to clean the dust-laden producer gas generated by the gasification process. Therefore, the experimental setup consisted of a full-fledged biomass gasification system (0.028 Nm<sup>3</sup>/s)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0957650912448333">3</xref></sup> comprised elements such as reactor, cyclone, and other gas conditioning systems. The two cyclones that are discussed in this study were tested in the above mentioned setup (separate sets of trials for the two cyclones), wherein series of trials were conducted at 50%, 75%, and 100% throughputs of the gasifier system. These trials were conducted using coconut shells as the feedstock in the biomass reactor. The overall schematic of the system along with cyclone and measurement locations is depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0957650912448333">Figure 3</xref>. To evaluate the cyclone performance, relevant parameters such as the mass flow rate of producer gas, pressure and temperature (entry and exit of cyclone), and particulate concentration in the inlet gas stream (inlet to the cyclone) were measured. The mass flow rate of producer gas, static pressure, and temperature were measured at entry (100 mm upstream of the inlet to the cyclone) and exit of the cyclone (100 mm downstream on the outlet pipe/vortex finder) using a calibrated orifice plate, pressure transducer/manometer, and thermocouple, respectively. The particulate matter in the hot gas at the entry to the cyclone was measured using the procedure described in ‘PSD of dust particles’. Similarly, the particulate matter removed (collected in a bin) from the cyclone was measured by weighing the collection at the end of the test duration. This data were used for calculating the collection efficiency. Addressing the experimental work in a chronological order, the originally fitted cyclone was first subjected to trials, as its performance was below satisfactory; next, a new cyclone was designed and tested on similar lines. The performance results of both cyclones are presented in the next section.

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0957650912448333">Figure 4</xref> depicts the comparison of pressure drop across the cyclone for the two designs at varying throughputs. In order to establish repeatability, multiple trials were conducted at each throughput using both cyclones. The variation in the results is within 7% (except for 50% load, where it is about 15%). It is evident that pressure drop across the new design is higher by about 50% at rated throughput. Similarly, these values are higher by about 50% compared with the pressure drop estimated by theoretical models such as Lapple model, as depicted in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0957650912448333">Table 3</xref>. The values clearly indicate the limitations of models proposed for the pressure drop estimation. Furthermore, comparing the experimental results, the variation in pressure drop between the two cyclones is marginal at lower throughput which could be attributed to operation of the cyclone under off-design conditions.

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0957650912448333">Figure 5</xref> depicts the cyclone’s collection efficiency for varying throughputs. It is evident that the collection efficiency with the new design is nearly double compared to original cyclone and this improvement could be attributed to the combined effect of enhanced gas inlet velocity and geometric changes employed with the new cyclone. However, these values are lower compared with the collection efficiency estimated by theoretical models as depicted in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0957650912448333">Table 3</xref>. Furthermore, comparing the experimental results, the variation in collection efficiencies between the two cyclones is marginal at 50% throughput and this could be attributed to the operation of the cyclone under off-design conditions.

<p>CFD simulations for cyclone separators were proposed to improve the understanding of flow phenomena inside a cyclone separator, predict various cyclone performance parameters such as pressure drop and collection efficiency and thereof reason out causes for deviations in performance against experimental findings.</p>
<p>A survey of the literature provided extensive material on this subject. It was found that CFD as a tool can be very effective in modeling cyclone separators. The biggest advantage with CFD simulations is that it provides greater insight into the complex flow phenomenon inside cyclone separator which might not be possible by just conducting the experimental trials. This would be helpful in improving the overall understanding of flow physics and thus arriving at an improved design.</p>
<p>The aim of the literature survey was multifold and is as follows:
<list id="list2-0957650912448333" list-type="alpha-lower">
<list-item><p>to have best practice advice for modeling cyclone separators based on the previous published work;</p></list-item>

<sec id="sec9-0957650912448333"><title>Geometry and meshing</title>
<p>CFD modeling of cyclone comprises three steps: the creation of 3D geometry, meshing the geometry in CFD pre-processors, and finally, running the simulation with appropriate boundary conditions in the CFD solver. The 3D modeling and meshing of cyclone geometry was done using CFD pre-processor ANSYS ICEMCFD. To model the highly swirling flow inside the cyclone, hexahedral grid with mesh elements aligned with the circumference of the cyclone (as proposed by Wang et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0957650912448333">25</xref></sup>) was used. The cylindrical and conical sections were meshed with ‘O’ grid to obtain a high quality mesh. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0957650912448333">Figure 6</xref> captures the meshed cyclone used for the final computation. For cyclone separators, boundary layer resolution is not very critical as the turbulence is generated in the main flow. Hence, mesh near walls can be sufficiently coarse.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0957650912448333">25</xref></sup> Since the solver used bridging wall functions to model wall effects, it was important to insure (while meshing) that the first node height satisfied 30 &lt; <italic>Y</italic><sup>+</sup> &lt; 300. The best practice advice for cyclone separator meshing from ANSYS was followed to get desired mesh size and quality. Grid refinement studies showed that a mesh size of 67,336 was sufficient to provide mesh-independent results. Mesh refinement up to 85,949 yielded insignificant changes in the results (1% variation). Therefore, a mesh size of 67,000 was adapted for all cases of simulations. The minimum and maximum sizes of the cell were about 10 and 0.01 mm, respectively. On the mesh quality, the mean orthogonal quality was 0.94 and mean skewness about 0.16 (for excellent mesh, othrogonality should be 1; skewness should be 0). Based on these statistics, the mesh employed can be considered to be of superior quality.

<sec id="sec10-0957650912448333"><title>The simulations</title>
<p>The prediction of flow behavior inside the cyclone using CFD was quite challenging. The main challenges faced were with respect to the following.
<list id="list3-0957650912448333" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>It was necessary to capture the radial transition between free and forced vortexes as this was fundamental for predicting the secondary phase separation and pressure field.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>However, the constrained free vortex flow in the cyclone meant that turbulent fluctuations were restrained in tangential and axial directions but less so in the radial direction. To accommodate this anisotropy of turbulence it was necessary to choose a suitable turbulence model.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Under certain operating conditions, cyclones have a number of possibly unstable flow features, particularly in the low-pressure central core. If steady-state solver was used, it possibly made it difficult for the solution to converge. In such cases, it was necessary to switch to a transient solver and allow it to reach steady state. Accordingly, the values reported in the article (‘Validation of model with literature’ and ‘CFD modeling results for the current study’) are all steady-state results.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>While modeling particles using discrete phase, particle tracking scheme played a critical role. To track finer particles (&lt;2–3 µm) accurately, adapting higher order tracking schemes was necessary.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>Keeping the above challenges in mind and using guidelines derived from the literature, the following models were identified to simulate the cyclone separator.
<list id="list4-0957650912448333" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>It is well documented in the literature that the standard <italic>k </italic>− <italic>ε</italic> model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0957650912448333">26</xref></sup> has limitations to predict the flow field in a cyclone flow; however, one can understand from the literature that the modified <italic>k </italic>− <italic>ε</italic> model is able to provide improved predictions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0957650912448333">18</xref></sup> In some recent studies, it is evident that the Reynolds’ stress model (RSM) is able to predict results close to large Eddy simulation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0957650912448333">26</xref></sup> Therefore, in this study, turbulence was modeled using RSM. This was chosen to accurately model turbulent stresses, which are highly anisotropic in a cyclone.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Higher order discretization schemes QUICK (quadratic upwind differencing scheme) were used for all conservation equations. For pressure, pressure staggering option which is similar to staggered grid scheme was used.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Boundary layer was not resolved and standard wall functions were used to bridge the information from wall to the bulk.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Particle tracking was performed using Eulerian–Lagrangian multiphase model. Here, the fluid is treated as a continuum by solving Navier–Stokes equations while dispersed phase is solved by tracking large number of particles through the calculated flow field. The dispersed phase can exchange momentum, mass, and energy with the fluid phase. To begin with, spherical drag law was used assuming particles to be perfect spheres. Later, some studies were done using non-spherical drag law by varying the shape factors. These results are presented in the latter part of ‘CFD modeling results for the current study’. The non-spherical drag law available in ANSYS fluent was used for simulations (with needle-shaped particles) as it is valid for a large range of shape factors.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>To capture the dispersion of particles due to turbulence, a stochastic tracking model was used. This model includes the effect of instantaneous turbulent velocity fluctuations on the particle trajectories through the use of stochastic methods.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Since the particle loading was very low, an uncoupled tracking was performed where the flow field was solved first and frozen. Particles were tracked thereafter by modeling their interaction with the flow field. The effect of particles on fluid flow was neglected. To confirm this, few coupled simulations were also performed and it was found that the results were very close to the uncoupled simulations.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>To track particles accurately (especially particles of diameter &lt;= 2 µm), higher order tracking scheme (fifth-order Runge–Kutta) was used.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Flow was solved as incompressible and isothermal. The effect of temperature variation across the cyclone was neglected because of small temperature drop across the cyclone.</p></list-item>

<sec id="sec11-0957650912448333"><title>Boundary conditions and material property</title>

</table-wrap></p>
<p>The accuracy of the CFD results for prediction of cyclone collection efficiency greatly depends upon the accuracy of PSD provided at the inlet boundary condition. In CFD simulations, PSD can be provided as an input to the solver through Rosin–Rammler (RR) expression. The complete range of sizes is divided into an adequate number of discrete intervals, each represented by a mean diameter for which trajectory calculations are performed. In RR distribution, mass fraction of particle of diameter ‘<italic>d</italic>’, is given by

where ‘<italic>d</italic><sub>mean</sub>’ is a size constant and ‘<italic>k</italic>’ the size distribution parameter. The RR fit for measured particle distribution is plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0957650912448333">Figure 7</xref>; the distribution seems to fit precisely for a particle size up to 25 µm. However, across the complete range of particles, the fit was not found effective. Therefore, it was not possible, with a single fit, to capture the smaller particles distribution which was critical for accurately predicting collection efficiency. To resolve this issue, the reduced particle range up to 25 µm was considered and scaled appropriately to obtain RR fit. As observed, any particle larger than 25 µm had 100% collection efficiency. So they were assumed to be completely separated in cyclone and the particulate mass flow rate was scaled appropriately to consider the particles with size less than 25 µm for CFD simulations. This was done to improve the accuracy of CFD predictions. When RR fit is used, the solver required inputs in the form of minimum diameter, maximum diameter, mean diameter (<italic>d</italic><sub>mean</sub>), spread parameter (<italic>k</italic>), and total particle flow rate.

<sec id="sec12-0957650912448333"><title>Validation of model with literature</title>
<p>As mentioned earlier in ‘CFD modeling results for the current study’, since it was necessary to first validate the envisaged simulation approach and solver settings, validation was carried out against two independent works reported in the literature. The geometry adopted for this validation activity is different (as given in the literature) when compared to the cyclone geometries that have been discussed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0957650912448333">Table 5</xref>. The two validation cases are presented separately as given below.</p>
<p>Case I: The validation was carried out against a numerical simulation study without particle entrainment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0957650912448333">5</xref></sup> This numerical study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0957650912448333">5</xref></sup> has in turn been validated against experimental results<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0957650912448333">28</xref></sup> which showed reasonably accurate prediction using RSM turbulence model. So, a CFD model was constructed for the given geometry, meshed, and simulated using the approach as described in previous sections. Turbulence was modeled using the RSM model. The problem was solved as a single-phase flow (without particle entrainment); with an inlet air velocity of 14.8 m/s and the exit as the outflow boundary condition. The validation was carried out in terms of parameters such as tangential velocity profile (plots shown at an axial location of 0.4 m from the top surface of the cyclone) and axial velocity profile (plots shown at an axial location of 0.15 m from the top surface of the cyclone) as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0957650912448333">Figure 8</xref>(a) and (b), respectively. The simulation was able to capture the trends reasonably well although there was a slight deviation in the magnitude, in particular for the axial velocity. Similarly, the pressure drop across the cyclone compared very closely with the values reported in the literature (1418 against 1407 Pa).

The work summarized the gas-particle flow in three different cyclone configurations using simulated spherical particles in the range 0.5–10 µm. The results that have been considered from this study corresponded to bottom trap boundary condition, where the results are marginally under predicted. So, likewise, a CFD model was constructed for this geometry, and simulations carried out with similar boundary conditions. The predicted collection efficiency using the CFD model evolved in this study compared closely with the published results, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0957650912448333">Figure 8</xref>(c).</p>

<p>The tangential velocity plots shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0957650912448333">Figure 9</xref> depict the variation of velocity field across <italic>YZ</italic> mid-plane. It is evident that CFD is able to predict the transition from free to forced vortexes. Peak tangential velocity was observed near radial location equal to half of vortex finder diameter. Peak tangential velocity in the new cyclone was almost 23% higher than the original cyclone. Higher tangential velocity was helpful in improving cyclone collection efficiency as it pushed smaller particles toward the wall due to higher centrifugal force but at the cost of higher pressure drop across the cyclone.

As expected, due to highly swirling flow, higher pressure was observed near the outer wall of cyclone while central core saw a very low pressure. The result of the new cyclone showed some symmetry in the velocity and pressure field along the core, near the bottom of cyclone. This was mainly due to unstable flow features which were oscillating and were inherently transient in nature. For such a case, the steady-state solver generally does not converge when higher order schemes are selected. This required a shift to transient solver which was done in this case.

<p>From the table, it is evident that CFD was able to predict pressure drop within an error band of about 4%; however, the predictions for collection efficiency are significantly off from the experimental results, but closer to the predictions based on theoretical models. These variations can be attributed to two factors which could largely influence the output of CFD simulations: (a) uncertainty in the measurement of PSD and particle density and (b) highly non-spherical shapes (needle shapes) of particles. Since there was uncertainty in the measurement of these three parameters, especially with particle size and shape, sensitivity studies were performed. The outcome of this study is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-0957650912448333">Figure 12</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table9-0957650912448333">Table 9</xref>. From <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-0957650912448333">Figure 12</xref>, it is evident that while particle density has a weak influence, the particle size has a large influence on the collection efficiency (it varies from almost 40% for 3 µm mean particle diameter to 75% for 9 µm mean particle diameter). Therefore, accurate measurement of size distribution is essential as input to CFD for accurate predictions.

<p>As mentioned earlier, even though utmost care was exercised in establishing the right method of preparing the sample (to dissolve sticky tar, etc.) for PSD by laser diffraction, there remained the possibility that the measurement was not a true representation of the particle size for the following reasons.
<list id="list5-0957650912448333" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>The particulate matter/dust deposited on the cellulose filter was extracted into a solvent. It is possible that all particles deposited on the filter were not extracted (particularly the particles deposited in the pores) into the solvent or dispersing medium. In such a case it would not be a representative sample.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The PSD analysis considered all the particles as spherical in shape, whereas close observation of the particle structure revealed that particulate matter/dust had needle-like shape and not spherical as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-0957650912448333">Figure 13</xref>. Therefore, the possibility of over estimating the particle size cannot be ruled out.</p></list-item>

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14-0957650912448333">Figure 14</xref> shows the photograph of the cyclone dust in a pile form. The entire dust was able to pass through a 1 mm sieve and nearly 98% through sieve of 0.4–0.45 mm. However, upon close examination it was found that the dust did not have spherical particles but needle-like particles as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-0957650912448333">Figure 13</xref>. As large-size particles visible to the naked eye had a large number of non-spherical particles as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-0957650912448333">Figure 13</xref>, it is entirely possible that the laser diffraction method of PSD analysis interpreted the non-spherical particles as equivalent spherical particles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0957650912448333">31</xref></sup> and thereby over estimated the particles’ size distribution.

<p>The particle shape has a significant influence on collection efficiency in inertial devices such as cyclone, since it modifies the drag coefficient significantly. Existing body of knowledge<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0957650912448333">32</xref></sup> clearly identifies the influence of the particle shape on the drag coefficient. Wadell<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0957650912448333">32</xref></sup> has introduced the concept of particle sphericity (ø) to account for the particle shape. Sphericity is defined as the ratio of surface area of a sphere having the same volume as the particle and the actual surface area of the particle. In theoretical studies there is no way of considering the effects of particle shapes; however, this is possible in CFD studies by modifying the drag coefficient, as has been suggested in the literature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0957650912448333">32</xref></sup> This, therefore, required assessing the extent of non-sphericity among the particles in the input gas stream to the cyclone. An advanced measurement technique–a particle imaging technique using scanning electron microscope (SEM) was employed.</p>
<p>The particle imaging was carried out to assess the mean value of sphericity of the particles by measuring the length and width of the particles. The analysis was initially carried out on the particles collected on the cellulose filter (the particles in the input gas stream to the cyclone), the SEM pictures revealed heavy agglomeration of particles as the particles were suspended in the solvent. There was no way that the particles could be de-agglomerated. Therefore, as an alternate approach, the dry particles collected in the cyclone were subjected to analysis. Once again, the analysis showed agglomeration of particles as represented in the SEM in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15-0957650912448333">Figure 15</xref>. The agglomeration was further enhanced when dispersed in the solvent (the sample required for analysis had to be suspended in a solvent). So particle imaging analysis once again turned out to be extremely challenging. In order to get an estimate of the extent of non-sphericity, the particles were sieved using a 0.5 mm sieve and then the particles were subjected to analysis. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig16-0957650912448333">Figure 16</xref> shows one such SEM result, wherein it is evident that some particles were of needle shape. The sphericity of nearly 100 particles was analyzed – the minimum, average, and maximum values of the sphericity were in the range of 0.49, 0.8, and 0.87, respectively.
<fig id="fig15-0957650912448333" position="float"><label>Figure 15.</label><caption><p>SEM of particles dispersed in solvent.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0957650912448333-fig15.tif"/></fig>
<fig id="fig16-0957650912448333" position="float"><label>Figure 16.</label><caption><p>SEM of dry particles.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0957650912448333-fig16.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>With the SEM sample size being too small, it would be inappropriate to draw any conclusion on the sphericity of all the particles unless analysis has been carried out on meaningful statistical sample size. Therefore, CFD analysis was carried out using varying sphericities, whose results is presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table9-0957650912448333">Table 9</xref>. The effect of particle shape factor on collection efficiency is not significant for a variation up to 0.6, but beyond this there seems to be a large influence on collection efficiency.</p>
<p>But at the observed level of sphericity from SEM analysis, the collection efficiency appears to be marginally lower as compared to spherical particles. It is, therefore, difficult to explain the large discrepancy between the experiment and modeling results. The inaccuracies both due to particle size measurement and particle shape could be jointly contributing toward the discrepancy.</p>

<p>This article discusses cyclone performance using dust-laden producer gas generated by the process of gasification. With the need for improvement in existing cyclone performance identified, a re-design of the cyclone was taken up based on information available in the literature. With PSD being the key design parameter, great care was exercised in getting the right assessment of the particle distribution in the inlet gas stream. With the new cyclone design, the performance was found to be superior but at the expense of pressure drop.</p>
<p>Similar trends were observed with CFD analysis with respect to pressure drop prediction; however, the collection efficiency was much higher compared to the experimental results but matched closely with the theoretical results. From the sensitivity analysis it became evident that collection efficiency was highly sensitive to both PSD and particle shape. On the PSD, there were two possibilities for errors, one due to agglomeration of particles and second due to non-sphericity of particles. These errors have implication in terms of inaccurate PSD which when input to models yield predictions of higher values. Both these issues have been addressed in this study, but to a limited extent due to complexities in measurement.</p>
