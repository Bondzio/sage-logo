<abstract>
<p>The production level has been neglected in current scholarship on global news contra-flows. Al Jazeera English (AJE) is a resourceful, multi-newsroom satellite news channel with an ambitious, alternative editorial agenda that poses practical challenges and conflicts. Based on 35 qualitative interviews with channel management and editorial members of staff, document analysis and observation of editorial meetings, the present article examines the employees’ reflections on these challenges during its first years on air. It problematizes the extent to which AJE should follow the western-led mainstream news cycle as opposed to creating an alternative agenda. Furthermore, discussions about who should be invited to represent ‘the other’ opinion among AJE’s news sources reveal diverging sourcing strategies and conflicting conceptions of which opinions should be represented on the channel. These dilemmas are symptoms of the structural contradictions in the AJE project aiming to implement an alternative, southern news perspective while maintaining professional journalistic standards.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1464884911398337">1</xref></sup></p>

<p>I think we can be more democratic as opposed to playing to what’s comfortable for those in power whether it’s governments or corporations. And if we’ve decided to take that stance of being different, then let’s be different. Let’s truly explore. Let’s even push the boundaries even if it takes being labeled radical. Let’s see what it takes because otherwise I think that we would then become diluted as we go along and we would become exactly what we claimed we weren’t going to be.

<p>The present article examines how AJE employees struggle to make sense of what it means to be and practice a southern alternative, in a mainstream 24-hours news landscape. The Al Jazeera phenomenon has been extensively debated in a growing number of journalistic and academic publications, but it remains under-researched (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1464884911398337">Hafez, 2008</xref>: 9). Overall, the rapid growth of non-western satellite news channels has contributed to a regional, transnational and global complexity that demands increased recognition and theorization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1464884911398337">Curran and Park, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1464884911398337">Löffelholz and Weaver, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1464884911398337">Rai and Cottle, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1464884911398337">Thussu, 2007</xref>). AJE is the first global English-language news channel headquartered in the Middle East. The present article addresses the acute need for studies that examine journalists’ reflection on their role in the new Arab media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1464884911398337">Mellor, 2008</xref>) and gives unprecedented empirical insights into the discussions and concerns in the AJE newsroom during its first years on air. The production level has been largely ignored in current scholarship on global news flows and contra-flows (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1464884911398337">Hanusch and Obijiofor, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1464884911398337">Hjarvard, 2002</xref>), and the present article addresses this lacuna by examining production strategies and editorial dilemmas of AJE empirically.</p>
<p>By exploring the dilemmas arising when the channel’s alternative editorial agenda is put into journalistic practice, this article documents how the employees struggle to prioritize between being alternative or competitive, thorough or immediate, bold or western-oriented, niche or mainstream. It aims to contribute to the theorization of satellite news, alternative media and the globalization of newsrooms and news production, as well as adding to the empirically grounded studies of non-western satellite news channels.</p>

<title>Alternative vs. mainstream editorial practices</title>
<p>Since the turn of the millennium, scholars have paid great attention to alternative forms of media. Current academic contributions have stressed the multiple, competing meanings of ‘alternative’ in alternative media and examined the alternative and mainstream as a continuum rather than as absolute, opposed categories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1464884911398337">Atton, 2002a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1464884911398337">2002b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1464884911398337">Atton and Wickenden, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1464884911398337">Bailey et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1464884911398337">Downing, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1464884911398337">Rauch, 2007</xref>). Bailey et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1464884911398337">2008</xref>: xii) argue that the identity of alternative media ‘should be articulated as relational and contingent on the particularities of the contexts of production, distribution, and consumption’.</p>
<p>A media organization’s position on the mainstream–alternative continuum may change according to the context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1464884911398337">Bailey et al., 2008</xref>: 70). Transnational media can cross borders between mainstream and alternative media in both the original (sending) country and wherever it is received, and, more importantly, it can be redefined by the particularities of production, distribution and consumption contexts. In essence, AJE may be perceived as mainstream news<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1464884911398337">2</xref></sup> in some parts of the world and as alternative when accessed by news media, diaspora groups or the general public in the West. A related example is the BBC in America during the last decade, what Bicket and Wall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1464884911398337">2009</xref>: 376) characterize as a ‘super-alternative’ news medium, albeit an alternative source with enormous resources and high credibility, within the context of an expanding public sphere in the USA. They argue that the BBC in the US context represents a media production that challenges actual concentrations of media power in the United States. Moreover, BBC’s ‘alternativeness’, the authors claim, is ‘a temporary condition, made possible by a confluence of larger changes in international relations, global journalism, and communicative practices and patterns’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1464884911398337">2009</xref>: 380).</p>
<p>Proposing a broader theoretical and methodological research framework for alternative media, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1464884911398337">Atton (2002a)</xref> distinguishes between alternative media as a <italic>product</italic> and as a <italic>process</italic>. On the product side he highlights politically and/or socially/culturally radical content and news values, alternative aesthetics and form (graphics and visualization), and reprographic innovations and adaptations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1464884911398337">2002a</xref>: 27). And on the process side, he stresses alternative sites and networks for distribution and an anti-copyright culture, collective organization, de-professionalization and transformed social relations, roles and responsibilities. Alternative media are radicalizing journalistic practices with their progressive sourcing strategies, ‘native reporters’, the significance of ‘active witnessing’ and a consideration of ‘social movement news’ in mainstream media culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1464884911398337">Atton, 2002b</xref>: 491; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1464884911398337">Atton and Wickenden, 2005</xref>). Further, alternative media ideally offer counter-hegemonic representations and discourses that differ from those in their mainstream counterparts; there is an emphasis on self-representation and a diversity of voices, as well as diverse news formats and news genres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1464884911398337">Bailey et al., 2008</xref>: 31). Moreover, the process of alternative media transforms the communication process and establishes horizontal linkages and networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1464884911398337">Rauch, 2007</xref>: 996).</p>
<p>Another characteristic of alternative media is their systematic critique of mainstream media and journalists. Journalists rely heavily on each other for ideas, and this reliance constitutes an important organizational routine. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1464884911398337">Zelizer’s (1993)</xref> analysis of journalists as an ‘interpretive community’ – with shared definitions, metaphors, memories and understandings of their practice – provides insights into how journalists and media professionals define their own profession. For those involved in alternative media, the mainstream media are corrupted by, dependent on and uncritical to the establishment, and according to Atton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1464884911398337">2002b</xref>: 499) alternative media activists do not distinguish between different media, but reduce the mainstream to representing one dominant bloc. Distancing themselves from the mainstream media, the radical reporters primarily identify with the protest movement itself and the grassroots as their ‘interpretive community’, and join the activists’ criticism of their mainstream counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1464884911398337">Atton and Wickenden, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1464884911398337">Rauch, 2007</xref>).</p>

<title>Methodology: The inside perspective</title>
<p>The present article explores how AJE employees are making sense of and practicing an alternative, southern news perspective. It first highlights two interrelated editorial dilemmas identified by channel staff, and secondly analyzes how AJE informants reflect on these challenges. The channel employs 1200 staff and 600 reporters in 50 countries and 25 bureaux (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1464884911398337">AJE, 2009a</xref>). For this study, 35 semi-structured qualitative interviews with AJE management and editorial staff (including an additional five interviews with Al Jazeera Arabic executives) were conducted in Doha (September to December 2007) and in London (January to September 2008).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1464884911398337">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>AJE’s headquarters are in Doha (Qatar) with broadcasting centers in Kuala Lumpur, London and Washington DC, and the interviews were conducted at the network headquarters in Doha and at the London Broadcasting Center. Visiting Qatar is imperative to understand the Al Jazeera Network: Doha remains the headquarters of the top management; the main newsrooms (half of the channel’s newsgathering and production resources) are located there; and it is the home of the network’s founder, the Emir of Qatar, Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al-Thani. London was selected among the three broadcasting centers, because it is a global media hub and it is responsible for covering Europe, thus providing insights into how the channel operates in and covers the traditionally over-exposed global North.</p>
<p>Informants were selected for their professional role in the newsroom, and informants from the front, medium and top levels of the news department are represented in the interview sample. Interviews were facilitated and organized by the channel’s marketing and media relations office, on request from the researcher. Overall, informants represent a variety of viewpoints within the Al Jazeera Network. At the network headquarters in Doha, bureaucracy and the organization of the network complicated accessing and interviewing informants (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1464884911398337">Figenschou, 2010b</xref>, for a critical methodological analysis on accessing and interviewing in the Doha headquarters). In contrast to other major news organizations, which document their activities, strategies and collective history through an extensive catalogue of written reports and policy documents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1464884911398337">Syvertsen, 2004</xref>), the Al Jazeera Network has been characterized by poor knowledge of management routines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1464884911398337">Zayani and Sahraoui, 2007</xref>). Consequently, even basic written documentation, such as an overview of the organizational structure or a list of the channel employees, was inaccessible in spite of numerous requests. It is therefore complicated to assess whether the interview sample is representative of the total channel staff. Suffice to say here that the findings from the interviews are principally confirmed by the renewal report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1464884911398337">AJE, 2009a</xref>) (discussed below) and suggest that they reflect the variety of sentiments in the channel.</p>
<p>The period of data gathering (from September 2007 to September 2008) was selected to study the everyday newsroom dilemmas after the first intense launch phase. During this period, the channel management initiated internal professionalization and evaluation processes. In March 2009, after interviewing the Managing Director Tony Burman, I gained access to the findings of these internal evaluation processes in a report titled <italic>AJE Renewal Project: Phase One Report</italic> (2009). Burman initiated the renewal project in October 2008, five months after he joined the channel as the new Managing Director. The report is written by seven working groups of AJE employees and voices substantial internal criticism. This type of document is valuable for analysis because it is a contemporary, unpublished, institutional document, primarily intended for internal use, and written without the interference of the researcher (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1464884911398337">Syvertsen, 2004</xref>). For the Managing Director, however, the renewal project signals to AJE staff (and the outside world) that the new top management team is proactive, taking the challenges seriously and doing their uttermost to professionalize the channel.</p>
<p>On the initiative of former London Bureau Chief, Sue Phillips, I was invited to observe editorial meetings and sat in on daily morning meetings, daily planning meetings and the weekly planning meetings, one day a week on average, from March to June 2008. The observation of editorial meetings and internal written documents such as newslogs and planning documents is primarily used for background information. Together, the analysis of the interviews, observation and documents provide unprecedented empirical insights.</p>

<sec id="section3-1464884911398337">
<title>Editorial agenda and production strategies</title>
<p>During the channel’s first years on air, there have been several efforts to articulate an editorial vision for AJE. The channel’s editorial line has been broad, vague and comprehensive. According to the official AJE website, the channel is concerned with ‘balancing the current typical information flow by reporting from the developing world back to the West and from the southern to the northern hemisphere. The channel gives voice to untold stories, promotes debate, and challenges established perceptions’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1464884911398337">AJE, 2009c</xref>). Further, the channel ‘will set the news agenda, bridging cultures and providing a unique grassroots perspective from under-reported regions around the world to a potential global audience of over one billion English speakers’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1464884911398337">AJE, 2009c</xref>).</p>
<p>After the initial channel launch period, the top management has set out to refocus and tighten the vision, and to establish practical systems and routines to ensure that the vision is communicated in the channel branding, practices and operational decisions, as well as in the news and programming. In the first phase of the AJE renewal project, the top management proposed the following six core values as a starting point for the editorial vision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1464884911398337">AJE, 2009a</xref>). Some of these vision statements have also been used extensively in advertisement campaigns for the channel. The six core values were presented in the renewal report:</p>
<list id="list1-1464884911398337" list-type="order">
<list-item><p><italic>Journalism of Depth</italic>: Going behind the headlines; avoiding the wire service approach to story selection and treatment; providing context and background; and original enterprise and investigative journalism.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Every Angle, Every Side</italic>: Challenging received wisdom and conventional assumptions; an alternative view; the magic of opposites and not aligned to any one country, region or political point of view (explicit or implicit).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Voice of the Voiceless</italic>: Focus on attention on the margins, not just the corridors of power; telling truth to power; skepticism of authority; against the system; and exploring people’s connection to power.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Being Where Others Aren’t</italic>: Telling the stories other channels don’t tell, and/or telling them in a different way; focusing on the unreported/under-reported world; away from the press pack; and being on the ground in more places and staying there in between the ‘big’ stories.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>The Southern Perspective</italic>: A much higher proportion of stories from the developing world; consider the impact of any story on the developing world; avoid conventional ‘western’ political and cultural attitudes and assumptions; adopt an indigenous perspective.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Letting the World Report on Itself</italic>: Telling the story from point of view of the people and places that are subject to the story; putting human beings at the heart of the story; covering ordinary people’s lives; correspondents with deep roots in their regions; and encouraging audience input and interaction.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The editorial core values (particularly 3–6) have close resemblance to the editorial agenda of alternative media projects: giving a voice to the voiceless, being where others are not, having a southern news perspective and letting the world report on itself. The repeated negative reference to ‘agency’ material is also noteworthy as it demonstrates how the channel distances itself from the mainstream western media and the global power elites.</p>
<p>To put the ambitious editorial agenda into practice AJE has employed a set of editorial strategies that represent a professionalization of alternative media production processes. First, AJE aims to cover the world without a domestic agenda, as a truly global news channel, in contrast to mainstream western news media that have become increasingly domesticated and commercially driven in their coverage of international issues. Secondly, AJE aims to report forgotten stories from the perspective of the voiceless – the global South, the underprivileged, the subaltern, the underdog, and the disenfranchised. To find and cover the stories of the voiceless, the channel has an extensive network of bureaux and correspondents around the world, particularly in the global South where its competitors are scarcely represented, demonstrating its active policy of countering the location practices of the western news media. Another interrelated editorial strategy to meet AJE’s ambitious editorial agenda is to cover global events through local correspondents, particularly in the South. There is a widely shared belief within the channel that local correspondents are better equipped to grasp and convey the realities on the ground than international (foreign) correspondents. Thirdly, to cover the other opinion in international news, those diverging, oppositional, controversial views and voices that are not regularly invited on mainstream news media, AJE emphasizes its editorial strategy in taking advantage of being part of the Al Jazeera Network.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1464884911398337">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Informants largely agree that instructions and directions from the top management have been broad and somewhat vague. Most AJE staff subscribe to these core values, but informants interpret them differently and disagree over how to put them into practice. After a brief outline of the current literature on AJE’s editorial line, the present article explores some of these tensions concerning the channel’s production practices, illustrated through two editorial dilemmas.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1464884911398337">
<title>A southern perspective: AJE’s editorial line</title>
<p>Empirically grounded studies of AJE’s editorial line are few, but the limited academic literature available has characterized AJE as the first viable, well-funded news channel with a radically different stance on international news (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1464884911398337">El-Nawawy and Powers, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1464884911398337">Figenschou, 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1464884911398337">Painter, 2008</xref>). Historically, the global North (Europe and North America) has been prioritized in international news worldwide. Based on a comprehensive, quantitative content analysis of the channel’s news, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1464884911398337">Figenschou (2010a)</xref> finds that the channel airs more news items from and about the global South than the global North, and that the South is covered in more in-depth news formats, with more correspondents on the ground. Furthermore, the study documents that male, independent elites are the most frequent and authoritative news sources on AJE. By this sourcing practice AJE continues the editorial strategy of inviting oppositional voices to the TV studios that made its Arabic sister-channel, Al Jazeera Channel, both famous and controversial, and thus follows the strategy of airing ‘the other opinion’. Nonetheless, the channel’s choice of sources illustrates how its alternative agenda of providing a grassroots perspective on world events comes into conflict with the elite orientation in international news journalism. As a compromise between mainstream news values and the southern agenda, AJE emphasizes the situation and problems of the ‘subaltern woman’, but she is not invited to speak for herself. The subaltern is spoken for and represented by male, independent elites such as oppositional politicians, representatives from international organizations and non-governmental organizations (NGOs), media or cultural personalities, analysts and academics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1464884911398337">Figenschou, 2010a</xref>). These findings are consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1464884911398337">Painter’s (2008)</xref> comparative analysis of one week of news on AJE, BBC World (BBC) and CNN International (CNN), where he finds that AJE had a clear emphasis on the global South.</p>
<p>More recently, AJE’s editorial distinctiveness was epitomized in the channel’s coverage of the Gaza war in January 2009. In a comparative content analysis of the war coverage on AJE, BBC and CNN, Figenschou (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1464884911398337">2010c</xref>: 217–220) finds that AJE’s coverage of the war in Gaza was different from that of its two main competitors. Moreover, the channel’s resources, power and editorial strategies were harnessed to redress the long-standing imbalance in international reporting of a conflict that has many more than ‘two’ sides. The AJE teams inside Gaza were Arabic speakers, some of them permanently based in Gaza City with extensive knowledge of Palestinian culture and religion. AJE also cooperated with its colleagues from Al Jazeera Arabic, who have covered the conflict extensively, and this gave the channel a comparative advantage. The channel reversed the systematic source imbalance in international coverage of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. It had almost three times more Palestinian than Israeli sources and quoted them directly and extensively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1464884911398337">Figenschou, 2010c</xref>). Furthermore, in AJE’s interviews with Israeli government officials, who have traditionally been successful in framing the news coverage of the conflict in western media, AJE’s editorial approach fundamentally undermined the Israeli media campaign through hard questions, critical contextualization of the Israeli government’s narrative and the visualization of the official statements. AJE’s coverage emphasized the situation on the ground, documenting and exposing the humanitarian crisis and the direct consequences of war and occupation for the people of Gaza. By exposing the weaknesses in the Israeli government’s position, instead of muting it, AJE questioned the legality and proportionality of the war (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1464884911398337">2010c</xref>).</p>

<title>Editorial dilemma 1: Alternative or competitive?</title>
<p>Shortly after the launch of AJE one of the top managers from its sister-channel, Al Jazeera Arabic (AJA), gave AJE the nickname ‘The <italic>feature</italic> channel’ because of the many long in-depth reports on the channel. Although they will (probably) never admit it publicly, most of the informants find it difficult to achieve a balance between being a competitive 24-hour international news channel and being an alternative to those channels. One top London manager, who articulates the dilemma, is worth quoting in detail:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>We should be better reacting to stories and do more breaking news, and more things that are happening on the day sometimes. But if you do that, you end up quite often following the agenda of everybody else. But what you don’t want is your program just being like: ‘Here’s ten features that we’ve gone and done around the world.’ You need a mix of different features and stories that are happening that day, because news is all about things that happened that day. If someone turns it on in the morning and then turns it on again in the evening, they expect to see something different in the evening. They expect to feel like there has been progression and change during the day. Or they turn it on and they go, ‘Yeah, but what’s actually happened in the world today?’ That’s what they want from their news programs. They don’t want just loads of features, because they can get their features from current affairs programs. They just end up with three minutes current affairs shows rather than proper news. It’s a balance to be … to try and be different, you have to go out and get these stories somewhere different and travel to them, and spend time filming them. To tell the news on the day, you need to have the resources to go and work out stories on the day. (London, 5 September 2008)</p>

<p>24-hour news channels aim to deliver three main types of information: continuous up-to-date news bulletins, live coverage of major news events, and in-depth information, background, context or analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1464884911398337">Lewis et al., 2005</xref>: 464). Content analyses of AJE newscasts find that the channel is editorially distinct, but AJE sources were concerned that their news emphasis potentially made them irrelevant. One example is the repeated discussions in the editorial meetings at the London broadcasting center of whether stories were what AJE staff call ‘newsy’ enough or too ‘featury’. These terms were not defined or discussed explicitly in meetings, but interviews show that being too ‘featury’ involves a fear of becoming irrelevant. Informants in London are worried that AJE risks being so alternative that their viewers feel they may miss out on the most important international news of the day. In the words of a London producer, the audience may switch from AJE to other news outlets ‘not because the content isn’t good, it just needs to look more like a news channel; it needs to be braver; it needs to have more breaking news’ (London, 7 May 2008).</p>
<p>According to AJE informants, there has been a tendency to emphasize the alternative pre-planned over the breaking news of the day. A member of the top management team in Doha says:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>I think if you look at this as a kind of a pendulum, I think that the pendulum has swung far to the excess on our side to planning, because it not only traps you into certain decisions on the day [that] probably are very absurd. But, they also occupy some of the resources [so] that we’re not actually equipped to go with the flow, and you have to go with the flow on a news channel. (Doha, 15 March 2009)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Informants believe that the London news center in particular has been strongly influenced by the planning desk. As underlined by a London-based producer, to cover European affairs for AJE:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>… means you have to spend more time researching more, thinking more, just trying to find something that’s more original and that you think might interest people. I guess it’s just more about spending time and trying to think outside of what the way that everyone else would cover it. (London, 11 June 2008)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>There are many explanations for the tendency to rely heavily on story ideas from the planning desk: Firstly, it is challenging to cover Europe from a southern perspective. AJE’s European news center is based in London, a global media hub in the global North, and informants find it difficult to find European stories that are not over-exposed or highlighted by the mainstream media. Secondly, compared to regions such as Africa, Asia and the Middle East, AJE has relatively few bureaux in Europe. Outside London, there are only three European bureaux – in Russia, Greece and Turkey. Therefore, instead of locally based bureaux and correspondents, it is mainly London-based correspondents, dispatched from AJE’s London Center, who cover Europe. Thirdly, the political, economic and legal systems in Europe are relatively well organized compared to other world regions, and the London planning desk has been particularly strong and efficient. The planning desk team are key players in defining the news agenda and they are regular participants in editorial meetings, whereas London-based correspondents are rarely present at the morning meetings.</p>
<p>In striving to implement the editorial agenda, channel employees have made conscious and unconscious editorial choices to mark the channel out as different from its competitors. Overall, sources explain that privileging breaking news events is difficult because AJE risks ending up with the same headlines as the CNN and the BBC – the mainstream western networks they aim to be an alternative to. Consequently, informants are concerned about the general tendency to focus on being different (to cover news that its competitors do <italic>not</italic>) instead of being competitive (to cover news events <italic>from another perspective than</italic> its competitors). Informants at all levels of the channel reflect this feeling and, as a result, improving the channel’s breaking news coverage and coverage of ‘the news of the day’ has become a priority for the top management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1464884911398337">AJE, 2009a</xref>).</p>

<title>Editorial dilemma 2: Who represents ‘the other opinion’?</title>
<p>AJE management and staff aim to redress the elite domination in international news, by consciously redirecting attention from the ‘corridors of power’ to the margins. Numerous studies have demonstrated how elite domination in mainstream news, ranging from elite consensus to intra-elite rivalry, sets the limits of the mediated debate (see the classic contributions from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1464884911398337">Bennett, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1464884911398337">Entman, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1464884911398337">Hallin, 1989[1986]</xref>, for models of elite influence). AJE’s aim to be systematically critical towards authority and elites, invite all sides of the story into the studio, including ‘the other opinion’ that is denied access to mainstream news, signals an ambition to challenge the established elite domination in global news. Content analyses of the channel’s news have documented that it has a different source profile than its mainstream competitors. How do the editorial staff perceive these alternative sourcing strategies?</p>
<p>Informants, particularly those with a professional background from Arab or other southern news channels, are concerned that the channel has been too cautious and unwilling to move outside what they see as a ‘western-oriented’ narrative or worldview, and consequently that controversial voices are denied access on AJE. They often illustrate the problem with examples from the channel’s coverage of political leaders or projects that have been severely criticized by western leaders and international organizations, such as the governments in Sudan, Zimbabwe, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Venezuela. Although informants underline that these controversial international political leaders and systems should be examined thoroughly and critically in the channel’s coverage, they believe that it is important to give a platform to ‘the other’ to try to understand their position. These views are echoing the trademark for AJE’s Arabic sister-channel – ‘the opinion and the other opinion’ – and dovetails nicely with AJE’s core values (‘every angle, every side’ and ‘the voice of the voiceless’).</p>
<p>Informants argue that the channel has not been open to try to explain these ‘enemies of the West’, present the world from their perspective, or invite them on the air. A Doha-based producer illustrates her point with the example of Zimbabwe:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Our Zimbabwe coverage, at least up until now, has been dominated by a British perspective, which is almost kind of like a revenge. Let’s get revenge on Mugabe. So that every single story, it’s like the network has been for the last year obsessed with Zimbabwe, obsessed with proving that Zimbabwe is a dysfunctional idiotic country with an idiotic leader who needs to be brought down immediately. I mean it is a campaigning kind of coverage […] I don’t think that is the view of the South. I just don’t. (Doha, 1 December 2007)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Informants argue that the channel has not been bold and brave enough when it comes to providing a platform for the other opinion hostile to the West. Informants critical of the channel’s practices argue that the channel only exposes the other opinion and oppositional voices if they agree with the ‘West’, while silencing those critical voices that are threatening them. A Doha-based correspondent, who articulates this point of view, is worth quoting in some detail. He demonstrates his point through the reactions to his own interview with Ahmad Muhammad Harun, former Minister for the Interior within the Sudanese Government, who was summoned before the International Criminal Court in February 2007. He says:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>You tell people what they don’t know otherwise you are not making any news – you are not really. […] In The Hague he is a war criminal against humanity, in Khartoum he is a Minister of Humanitarian Affairs. It’s a nice story; we focused on that. And we filmed in a meeting where he was hailed, cheered by crowds, and his colleagues in the Ministry of Defense defending him and saying: ‘He’s a hero. He’s our hero. We will not hand him to the enemy’ and so on. We focused on that. Our colleagues were not very pleased with that. They said: ‘How can you do propaganda for this criminal?’ My objection was that for me he is not a criminal. For me he is a human being. Yes, he is suspected by the United Nations, but I am not a judge to issue a verdict on him. And even the judges they have not yet issued a verdict, they said he is a suspect. That is just one of the things that, one of the problems, that results from the conflict of perceptions, the conflict of backgrounds. (Doha, 29 November 2007)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The quote illustrates that there are conflicting views on whether these controversial voices should be covered on AJE. Paradoxically, both the informants who argue that the channel has been successful in inviting the other opinion and those criticizing the exclusion of ‘the enemies of the West’ refer to the same cases, i.e. the channel’s Zimbabwe coverage and its coverage of Sudan. Both stories were among the top stories when it launched. Moreover, reflecting AJE’s strategy of having a broad southern presence, it is the only international broadcaster that has managed to operate a bureau in Zimbabwe. These cases illustrate that although there is a shared understanding across AJE that the channel needs to be bolder and a broad agreement to voice ‘the other opinion’, there are conflicting interpretations of what this means in journalistic practice.</p>

<sec id="section7-1464884911398337">
<title>Adapting alternative editorial strategies to the production of satellite news</title>
<p>The foregoing dilemmas are indicative of some of the inherent challenges in AJE’s ambitious editorial agenda and strategies, in which the channel aims to transpose alternative journalistic perspective and practices to a resourceful, multi-newsroom, transnational satellite news channel. By professionalizing its southern, alternative news perspective, AJE strives towards an editorial strategy that challenges the mainstream western cultural bias, without compromising its journalistic quality: good production values, accuracy, balance and multiple viewpoints. According to AJE sources there are three main obstacles in the channel’s process of professionalizing the southern perspective.</p>
<p>Firstly, for AJE the ambition to professionalize alternative editorial strategies involves adapting the practices of the ‘local correspondents’ to international news production, but also adjusting the professional practices of the editorial staff with extensive careers from mainstream media to the channel’s southern agenda. In the interviews for this article, the latter was underscored, because the majority of the editorial staff and management interviewed have impressive professional backgrounds from international mainstream TV newsrooms, predominantly from British ITN and BBC, or American CNN, ABC and CNBC. These informants gained their training in Anglo-American news channels, but most of them express disillusionment with the developments in mainstream international TV news. In interviews informants with long careers in mainstream newsrooms expressed particular concern over what they characterized as the increasing domestication of foreign reporting, the reduction of foreign bureaux and correspondents, the ‘parachute reporting’, and the turn towards celebrity and entertainment journalism.</p>
<p>Informants underline how they make an extra effort in putting aside their mainstream journalistic framing, terminology and worldview. A London-based editor underlined the extent of this transformation:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>I’m quite certain as well that you would have seen that while we try and look at things from a certain perspective, there aren’t very many Southern people here working, are there? They’re more like us. I think people like me … middle-class, white guys trying to do our best. […] For a lot of people, as you can imagine, it’s been an extraordinarily sharp load. (London, 24 April 2008)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Also those employees of non-western ethnic backgrounds that have worked with Anglo-American news channels emphasize the necessity of unlearning the practices and perspectives adopted from mainstream newsrooms, as explains one Doha-based presenter/correspondent:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>I think it starts really with just thinking out of the box. That’s the biggest challenge. It’s just thinking differently, because if you are a journalist who has worked all your life in international or the mainstream news media, it becomes part of your culture to think in a certain way. And you need to constantly change yourself, say ‘Okay’, and find that moment when you take a stop, and say ‘Okay, am I looking at this differently? Am I speaking to the grassroots on this story?’ I think, once you make that first step, then really, the rest is – [I] can’t say it’s easy, but it comes. It is achievable. (Doha, 2 October 2007)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>For a young and diverse global newsroom like AJE, the unarticulated editorial vision <italic>and</italic> the inconsistent implementation of the vision in practice were identified as a problem by AJE sources. Informants at all levels of the organization underline the lack of a coherent editorial agenda, described by one of the younger London-based producers as ‘a lack of understanding of who we are and where we are going’. These views are supported in the renewal report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1464884911398337">AJE, 2009a</xref>), where the lack of meaningful professional development processes is identified as a major concern.</p>
<p>Secondly, the staffing profile, or more precisely the issue of staff diversity, emerged as a recurrent issue in the interviews. According to the channel website, AJE has the ‘most diverse newsroom in the world’ with staff from nearly 50 nationalities including more than 45 ethnicities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1464884911398337">AJE, 2009b</xref>). Although all informants highlight the diversity in the AJE newsroom, there is a call for more diversity in the top management from executive producers and up. Initially, most of the management was recruited from the British channel ITV or ITN News (labeled the ‘ITN crowd’ in interviews). Members of the management team explain the recruitment policy with the need to establish a tight team of professionals who know and trust each other during the intense pressure of launching a global news network. British TV news sources such as BBC and ITN are internationally acclaimed, and with most American news professionals being skeptical towards Al Jazeera after the Arabic channel’s groundbreaking coverage of the ‘war on terror’, network executives started their project among British professionals. One of the first people headhunted to AJE was former Managing Director Nigel Parson, a news executive from ITN who headhunted the management group among his previous colleagues. According to a Doha-based network executive, the strategy was to hire the best TV professionals and then teach them the Al Jazeera vision. He says:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>Their previous jobs have provided them with professional standards; what we will provide is the vision. As long as the vision and the shared values are Al Jazeera’s visions and shared values and Al Jazeera spirit of reporting, I don’t really mind which background these people are from, as long as they embrace this spirit and they understand this vision, so I don’t mind whether they are British or not. (Doha, 15 December 2007)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Although AJE informants broadly acknowledge the technical, logistical and journalistic expertise of the management group, informants are concerned that the uniform management group represents ‘the North’ rather than ‘the South’. A Doha-based correspondent explains why he believes the management cannot fully capture the South:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>I have worked with them and I know they have good intentions. I know that it is just a matter of exposure and a matter of experience and a matter of understanding, because you can’t relate to a story if you don’t understand it. You could relate to it anyway, but you will relate it the way it was conceived in a certain part of the world. Now that you are here, now that you are in Al Jazeera, I think you have to see the story the way it is on the ground, not the way it was described to you when you were thousands of miles away. (Doha, 29 November 2007)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>AJE sources point to the paradox that although hiring local correspondents is one of the key editorial strategies of the channel, and the channel has a global presence and a multi-national staff, the executive producers are still the same professional elite (middle-aged, white men) that runs mainstream, global newsrooms. As explained by a producer in Doha:</p>
<p>
<disp-quote>
<p>There were a lot of people hired by AJE, but all the really good people that they hired, that could bring that perspective of the South are in lower positions. And the people that are in real gatekeeping positions, the real management positions of editorial control, hiring decisions control, control over what’s the top story, control over all of that stuff – those people are all British. White, British. White, British, men. All of them. [ …] [W]hen I raised this with one of my colleagues, he said: ‘What are you talking about? This is the most diverse channel in the world.’ And I said: ‘Yeah, up until the point where you get to the people who have power.’ There is no diversity there. (Doha, 1 December 2007)</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Some informants argue that both the issue of rolling 24-hour news and bolder news coverage relate to the management group’s background from terrestrial British broadcasters. Although not everyone shares this criticism, there is a broad understanding that a continued gradual diversification on the executive level of the organization is necessary to fulfill the channel’s editorial agenda. There have been gradual changes in the management team, including the recruitment of Canadian and South African executives, and top management informants underline that further diversity is a priority.</p>
<p>Thirdly, the relationship between AJE and its Arabic sister-channel, Al Jazeera Arabic (AJA), is another issue of concern for employees. Although the comparative advantages of being part of the Al Jazeera Network are emphasized as an important editorial strategy, informants often struggle to identify and cooperate with their Arab colleagues. AJA has come to represent the dissident, the maverick, the anti-establishment, the eccentric and risk-taking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1464884911398337">Zayani and Sahraoui, 2007</xref>: 25), both regionally and in the global media sphere. In a recent survey, authors Pintak and Ginges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1464884911398337">2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1464884911398337">2009</xref>) find that Arab journalists see their mission primarily as driving political and social change in the Middle East, while fulfilling a secondary role of defending the Arab/Muslim people against outside interferences (2008: 218). Another characteristic shows the community’s improved confidence vis-a-vis mainstream western media: Arab journalists, believing they outperformed their western colleagues in the coverage of the ‘war on terror’, have become increasingly tired of western media lecturing and criticizing them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1464884911398337">Pintak and Ginges, 2009</xref>: 174), and these beliefs were echoed among the AJA editors interviewed for this article. Whether journalists from pan-Arab media form an interpretive community, as argued by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1464884911398337">Mellor (2008)</xref>, or competing schools of Arab journalism, as documented by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1464884911398337">Sakr (2007)</xref>, the most important issue here is the key position held by AJA employees as pioneers, defining pan-Arab satellite news both regionally and globally.</p>
<p>As a result of miscommunication, most AJA editorial staff originally believed that the English-language channel would be a translation of the Arabic news channel, intended to broadcast their Arab perspective on world news to an international audience. In interviews conducted in Doha in 2007, informants from both AJE and AJA underlined that, particularly before the launch of AJE and during the first launch phase, the relationship between the two sister channels was tense. The underlying causes for the tensions have to do with ownership of the Al Jazeera project.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1464884911398337">5</xref></sup> Firstly, key AJA editorial management informants explained that they were disappointed by the network management’s decision to launch a broader ‘southern’ international channel, rather than ‘translating’ their news and current affairs programs. Secondly, AJA employees were critical towards the new British management, and disillusioned because their (western) colleagues in the English-language channel secured better contracts (higher salaries and better production equipment and technology). Thirdly, because the western AJE managers were under much pressure from the mainstream media to legitimize their new project, they often tended to distance AJE from its Arabic sister-channel, underlining that although they were part of the same network they were two independent channels. Fourthly, AJA employees expressed their concern that the editorial strategies of the new English-language channel would weaken the Al Jazeera brand that AJA had paid their lives and freedom to build. Addressing these conflicts, the network management appointed former Editor in Chief of AJA, Ibrahim Helal, as Deputy Managing Director of AJE to reunite the two factions months before the launch in May 2006. Furthermore, the network management stressed the need for integration between the two channels by making 2008 ‘the year of integration’ and appointing former London Bureau Chief, Sue Phillips, as Director of Foreign Bureau and Development (head of the integration process). Still, in interviews, employees from AJE continued to emphasize the differences between the channels (different style, audience, agenda, and perspective) when asked about their views on the integration process.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The empirical discussions about editorial dilemmas epitomize the fundamental challenge inherent in the AJE project – to implement an alternative, southern news perspective while maintaining professional journalistic standards. The newsroom challenges explored in this article cannot be explained by the lack of training, staff profile or network integration alone. The obstacles underscored by the informants are symptoms of the structural contradictions in the AJE project. Alternative news media have traditionally been in explicit opposition to mainstream media and professional journalists, whereas AJE’s editorial agenda and production strategies aim to professionalize the alternative perspective. In contrast to the ‘native reporters’ involved in alternative media who identify with an activist cause and characterize themselves as activists, AJE informants are professional journalists. At the same time, most AJE employees are critical of the development in international reporting, symbolized by the pressure towards domestication, corporate owners and commercial imperatives. The informants interviewed for this article have left their old interpretive communities behind, and struggle to position themselves professionally in between their old colleagues and their new colleagues in the Al Jazeera family.</p>
<p>The channel’s editorial core values are broad ideals that can have a wide variety of interpretations, as illustrated in the two dilemmas above. This article demonstrates that ambitious, alternative projects like AJE are not exempt from the hard reality of journalistic selection, but unlike their mainstream competitors and (former) colleagues, they do not have the established framework to facilitate the process. In practice, AJE informants have conflicting interpretations of the editorial core values, employ diverging editorial strategies, and evaluate the output differently. In lack of a coherent editorial vision, AJE employees are concerned that content has been desultory and inconsistent, underlining the need to narrow down the editorial agenda, articulate the editorial vision and institutionalize newsroom practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1464884911398337">AJE, 2009a</xref>). With the numerous interpretations of AJE’s editorial vision discussed in this article, these processes may intensify internal power struggles between interest groups both within the channel and throughout the wider network.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1464884911398337">6</xref></sup> Furthermore, the processes of streamlining and institutionalizing AJE may potentially ‘mainstream’ the news production and output.</p>
<p>Moreover, AJE’s editorial strategies, its southern presence, permanent local correspondents, and decentralized production structure are capital intensive. AJE’s southern news perspective depends on these resource-demanding production strategies. As part of the Al Jazeera Network, financed by the Emir of Qatar, AJE is a resourceful satellite news channel in striking contrast to the majority of small-scale alternative media outlets, which struggle with limited financial resources. Furthermore, while most alternative media develop from radical movements (bottom-up), AJE is financed and initiated by an autocratic elite in one of the world’s richest states (top-down). Although Qatar–AJE relations are too complex to be examined properly within the limits of this article, a few paradoxes should be mentioned here. Firstly, AJE’s owner, the Emir of Qatar, exercises full executive power, and the ruling elite is also the de facto owner of the country’s vast economic resources. Although Qatari authorities have pursued a political reform line and branded Qatar as a regional advocate for media freedom, the reform policies have largely served to strengthen the legitimacy of the ruling elites instead of opening up political power. Secondly, censorship in Qatar is a contradiction. The national media are still under censorship, while Al Jazeera Network is said to be operating freely, although its political and financial dependence on the Emir makes it vulnerable to political pressure. The contrast between Al Jazeera’s boldness in its coverage of international affairs and the cautiousness they and other Qatari journalists display when it comes to internal Qatari matters calls for empirical examination. Thirdly, the Qatari authorities’ strategic interests in launching and expanding the Al Jazeera Network are multifaceted, ranging from intra-Gulf rivalry, to the regional and global level. On the global level, as discussed in this article, the alternativeness of AJE is serving Qatar’s public diplomacy, and the channel’s position as a new ‘super-alternative’ news media is therefore highly conditional.</p>

<p>It is imperative to stress that both mainstream and alternative journalism can be high quality, serious and governed by rules. In the present article the terms ‘professional’, ‘professionalism’ and ‘professionalization’ are used to stress AJE’s struggle to adapt their southern news perspective to the production strategies and news formats of mainstream, international news that have historically been defined by Anglo-American media organizations, at the same time as AJE aims to be different from these western media outlets. The professional–alternative contrast is thus not a denigration of the quality of alternative forms of journalism, but an analytical tool to emphasize how AJE is aiming to adapt bottom-up, alternative production strategies (developed in opposition to mainstream journalism) to the production of international satellite news.</p>
