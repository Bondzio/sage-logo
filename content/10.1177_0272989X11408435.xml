<p><bold>Background</bold>. Many descriptions of health used in vignettes and condition-specific measures name the medical condition. This article assesses the impact of referring to the medical condition in the descriptions of health states valued by members of the general population. <bold>Methods</bold>. A valuation study was conducted using face-to-face interviews involving the time trade-off valuation technique. All respondents valued essentially the same health states, but for each respondent, the descriptions featured an irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) label, a cancer label, or no label. Random effects generalized least squares regressions were used to estimate the impact of each label and experience of the condition on health state values. <bold>Data</bold>. A sample of 241 members of the UK general population each valued 8 states, generating 1910 observations (response rate = 39%, completion rate = 99% for all states). <bold>Results</bold>. The authors find no significant difference between health state values when the description contains no label or an IBS label. They find that the inclusion of a cancer label in health state descriptions affects health state values and that the impact is dependent on the severity of the state, with a significant reduction in values for more severe health states (up to −0.25 for the worst possible state) but no significant difference for mild states. <bold>Conclusions</bold>. A condition label can affect health state values, but this is dependent on the specific condition and severity. The authors recommend avoiding condition labels in health state descriptions (where possible) to ensure that values are not affected by prior knowledge or preconception of the condition that may distort the health state being valued.</p>

<p>During the past decade, resource allocation across competing health care interventions has been increasingly informed by economic evaluation using cost-utility analysis. Cost-utility analysis measures the benefits of competing health care interventions using quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), which capture changes in both quality and quantity of life. Typically, the “Q” quality adjustment weight used to produce the QALY estimate is obtained using an off-the-shelf generic preference-based measure of health such as the EQ-5D,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0272989X11408435">1</xref></sup> which is the most commonly used measure and is recommended by the National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) in England and Wales.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0272989X11408435">2</xref></sup> Preference-based measures have a scoring system based on elicited preferences for different health states, in contrast to non-preference-based measures, which typically involve ratings of functional or quality-of-life dimensions. Although the EQ-5D is found to be reliable, valid, and responsive for many conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0272989X11408435">3</xref></sup> for other conditions, this is not the case, such as visual impairment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0272989X11408435">4</xref></sup> and hearing loss.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0272989X11408435">5</xref></sup> For this reason, condition-specific measures (CSMs) are included in many clinical trials, either alongside or instead of generic preference-based measures.</p>
<p>A difference between generic and condition-specific preference-based measures is that many condition-specific preference-based measures state the cause of the health problems being assessed in the classification system (i.e., they name the condition). Often the condition’s name is embedded within the classification system (often derived from functional status measures), and health status cannot be valued in the system without labeling the condition. For example, for an asthma-specific measure,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0272989X11408435">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0272989X11408435">7</xref></sup> it is infeasible to remove the mention of asthma without changing the meaning of the dimension “experience asthma symptoms as a result of air pollution.” Yet the inclusion of a condition label in a health state valuation exercise may affect the values provided by members of the general population due to prior knowledge or preconception of the condition. This is problematic as it may mean that the elicited values do not reflect the health state being valued.</p>
<p>There is disagreement in the literature regarding the extent to which naming the condition in health state descriptions has an impact on health state values. Some studies have found that the inclusion of condition labels has lowered health state values.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0272989X11408435">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0272989X11408435">12</xref></sup> For example, one study found that the explicit use of mental health labels, including <italic>mental handicap</italic>, <italic>schizophrenia</italic>, and <italic>dementia</italic>, was associated with lower health state values.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0272989X11408435">10</xref></sup> Two studies found that labeling breast cancer states did not affect values<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0272989X11408435">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0272989X11408435">10</xref></sup> with the exception of scenarios written in the third person,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0272989X11408435">8</xref></sup> whereas another study found that it reduced values.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0272989X11408435">11</xref></sup> The finding that cancer labels have no impact is surprising given that the large majority of members of the general population will have prior knowledge and preconceptions of cancer: Cancer treatments can have severe treatment side effects associated with low quality of life, and cancer is widely known as one of the world’s largest killers, especially in developed countries.</p>
<p>The majority of studies examining the impact of labeling include more than one condition label and find that the results differ according to the specific condition. Typically, the studies ask respondents to value many states with changing descriptions (due to framing or labeling) and assess whether values change accordingly. This within-subject paradigm offers great power at small sample sizes but potentially introduces a demand effect, as respondents may realize that the health states are different in part due to the presence of the (changing) condition label (or framing). This may actually cause respondents to change their values accordingly and to purposefully consider their prior knowledge and preconceptions of the condition. Furthermore, as few health states are presented across a small severity range, results are specific to those few states. To address these limitations, we have undertaken a study in which condition labels are manipulated between subjects to compare values from samples of respondents who value states with only one or no condition label across a range of health states of differing severity.</p>
<p>This article assesses the impact of naming the medical condition in the descriptions of health states valued by members of the general population. We compare health state values that were elicited using 3 different labels: no label, irritable bowel syndrome label, and cancer label. Each respondent values the same set of states using only one label. We further analyze values to determine whether values are affected by prior experience of the relevant condition and other background characteristics along with severity of the state.</p>
<sec id="section1-0272989X11408435" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>The classification system from EORTC-8D, a recently developed preference-based measure for cancer derived from the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer core quality of life questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30), is used to define the health states.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0272989X11408435">13</xref></sup> The use of this classification system rather than vignettes has the advantage that the health state descriptions are based on the EORTC QLQ-C30, which is a widely used, valid, and reliable measure of health-related quality of life. Despite being developed for cancer, the content of the EORTC-8D classification system is quite generic and makes no reference to cancer. A member of the general population would not necessarily know it was a cancer measure. The classification system has no labels, and hence labels can be added and removed without fundamentally changing the meaning of any of the dimensions. The classification system, shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0272989X11408435">Table 1</xref>, has 8 dimensions: physical functioning, role functioning, pain, emotional functioning, social functioning, fatigue and sleep disturbance, nausea, and constipation and diarrhea. Each dimension has 4 or 5 severity levels, and the classification system defines 81,920 health states. The valuation study used to elicit preference weights for all states defined by the classification system did not include a condition label.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0272989X11408435">13</xref></sup>

<p>Given that the classification system analyzed here is intended to capture quality-of-life changes in cancer patients and did not include a condition label in the original valuation study, 2 of the labels chosen for this study were no label and a cancer label. We were further interested in testing the generalizability of this finding to another condition and selected one other condition that might be reasonably perceived by respondents to account for health states described using the EORTC-8D. The third label chosen was irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) as several clinicians and doctors suggested that this condition would be accurately described by the EORTC-8D classification system.</p>
<sec id="section2-0272989X11408435">
<title>Valuation Survey</title>
<p>Members of the general population each valued the same 8 health states from the EORTC-8D using time trade-off (TTO). The sample was divided into 3 groups: no label, IBS label, and cancer label. These groups were interviewed in sequence, with all respondents from the first group being interviewed before respondents from the second group were contacted. This was undertaken to ensure that all respondents were informed of the relevant condition in the cover letter due to ethical concerns but were not aware of the other conditions being valued in the study.</p>
<p>A representative sample of the general population was used for each of the 3 groups. To ensure each group had the same characteristics and were a representative sample of the United Kingdom, the sampling strategy involved 2 steps. First, all households contacted to request participation in the study were sampled using the AFD Names and Numbers version 3.1.25 database (AFD Software Limited, Ramsey, UK), and the sample was then balanced to the UK population according to geodemographic profiles. Second, each unique postcode included in the sample was divided into 3 to form 3 separate samples for each group. The sample size was chosen to enable the comparison of mean values between health states with the inclusion of each condition label using simple <italic>t</italic> tests. Assuming a power of 0.8, a significance level of 0.05, a standard deviation of 0.3, and an expected difference of 0.1, this requires a sample of 73 valuations for each state and a total of 219 completed interviews.</p>
<p>Eight health states were selected to represent the range of possible values for the measure, and this was informed by the results of the original valuation study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0272989X11408435">13</xref></sup> The original study valued 85 health states across 12 combinations of states (card blocs) each with 8 states, where 81 states were chosen using an orthogonal array, and this was supplemented by 4 additional states. Selection criteria for the most appropriate combination of 8 health states (card bloc) to be selected from those valued in the original study included minimum prediction error per card bloc, largest range of mean TTO distribution per card bloc, smallest missing data per card bloc, and general “feasibility” of states (e.g., avoiding “You were not limited in pursuing your hobbies or other leisure time activities” combined with “Your physical condition or medical treatment interfered very much with your social activities”). The selected states are 11111111, 31212241, 13423411, 44321321, 23141224, 24432411, 51224434, and 544444444, where 1 is no problems and level 4 is the worst level (5 for physical functioning dimension). An example health state (51224434) using each label is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0272989X11408435">Figure 1</xref>.</p>

</fig>
<p>At the start of the interview, respondents in the labeling groups were shown an information sheet about the relevant condition (included in the <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0272989X11408435">appendix</xref>). To familiarize themselves with the classification system with the relevant condition label, respondents were asked to complete the classification for themselves if they had the condition and otherwise to complete the classification for someone they knew/imagining someone with the condition.</p>
<p>As a warm-up task prior to TTO, respondents were asked to rank 8 health states alongside “full health” and “dead.” Third, respondents valued the 8 states using the Measurement and Valuation of Health (MVH) study version of TTO, including a visual prop designed by the MVH Group (University of York).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0272989X11408435">1</xref></sup> To familiarize respondents with the TTO task, respondents completed a practice TTO question for an additional state (22332322) prior to valuing the 8 health states. Finally, respondents completed questions about their demographic and socioeconomic characteristics.</p>
<p>For the 2 groups involving a label, the condition was mentioned in the cover letter, on the information sheet about the study, and on the cards used in the valuation exercises. A question on whether respondents have had experience of the labeled condition in themselves, in family, or in caring for others was included in the sociodemographic questions at the end of the interview.</p>
<p>Respondents were interviewed in their own home by trained and experienced interviewers who had worked on previous valuation surveys, including the HUI2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0272989X11408435">14</xref></sup> and OAB-5D.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0272989X11408435">15</xref></sup> The project was approved by the ScHARR Research Ethics Committee at the University of Sheffield.</p>
<p>Respondents were excluded from the analysis if they valued all states as identical and less than 1, valued the worst possible health state higher than every other state, or valued all states as worse than dead.</p>

<p>Respondent characteristics vary significantly at the 5% level across the 3 groups in respondents aged 18 to 40 years and full-time students (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0272989X11408435">Table 3</xref>) using a factorial ANOVA. The IBS label group has a relatively smaller proportion of respondents aged 18 to 40 and full-time students, and the no-label group has a relatively higher proportion of full-time students. These differences should be taken into account when modeling the data. The cancer label group has a larger proportion of respondents with experience of the condition in their family and in caring for others than the IBS group but a smaller proportion of respondents with experience of the condition in themselves. This may reflect the prevalence of the condition but also that cancer is a more obvious condition to others.</p>

<p>Spearman correlation coefficients among the predictor variables indicated poor intercorrelation (&lt;|0.3|<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0272989X11408435">18</xref></sup>) with the exception of moderate correlation (&lt;|0.7|<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0272989X11408435">18</xref></sup>; here &lt;|0.5|) between employed and retired variables. Age and health status using the EQ-5D were not included as predictor variables as they were correlated with the employment status predictors. The cancer label is not included in models (2) and (3) because of perfect collinearity between the cancer label and the 8 cancer × state interactions.</p>
<p>The results show that all state dummy variables are significant at the 1% level and are consistent, meaning that the utility decrement is larger for more severe health states as expected (where severity is calculated using the modeled utility values from the original valuation study). Across all models, the IBS label is never significant and the cancer label is significant in model (1). Statistical measures of within, between, and overall <italic>R</italic>-squared; root mean squared error; and ρ and Wald χ<sup>2</sup> indicate that models (2) and (3) perform better than model (1). This shows that the inclusion of interaction terms rather than a simple additive labeling variable for cancer improves the model. The inclusion of experience of the labeled condition also improves the model. Models were estimated with interaction terms for IBS, but these variables were never significant and did not improve the model.</p>
<p>Interaction terms for the state and the cancer label are significant for the 5 more severe states but not for the 3 least severe states. There is little difference in the coefficients for states 44321321, 23141224, 24432411, and 51224434, varying from a utility decrement of −0.128 to −0.148 in model (3). However, the size of the utility decrement for the most severe state, 54444444, is much larger at −0.254 in model (3). The inclusion of the interaction terms reduces the absolute size of the coefficient for the state dummy variables with the exception of state 31212241. For this state, the interaction term is positive in model (2) but not significant. Variables representing experience of the labeled condition are significant for the cancer label but not for the IBS label. The results indicate that participants in the cancer label group who had themselves experienced cancer gave, on average, lower utilities for health states, whereas participants in this group with experience of cancer in caring for others gave, on average, higher utilities. Only 2 sociodemographic variables are significant; being a student reduces all utility values and being unemployed increases all utility values (although note that the number of respondents in each category is small).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our results demonstrate that the inclusion of a condition label can affect health state values, but this is dependent on the specific condition. This is in accordance with the literature where some studies find that labeling affects health state values, whereas other studies find the reverse. Contrary to previous studies, we find that the inclusion of a cancer label in health state descriptions affects health state values, and we further find that the impact is dependent on the severity of the state. When label and severity interactions are accounted for in the model, the inclusion of a cancer label does not significantly affect health state values for milder states but has a significant reduction in health state values for more severe states (from 0.128 to 0.148 [<italic>z</italic> statistics = −2.15 to −2.49] in model (3)) and a noticeably larger reduction for the worst state (0.254 [<italic>z</italic> statistic = −4.26] in model (3)).</p>
<p>The inclusion of an IBS label rather than no-condition label does not significantly affect health state values, although the values are slightly raised, and this is consistent across all states of differing severity. The difference in impact on values across the 2 labels is striking. One possible reason causing the impact is that the prior knowledge and preconception of the condition are different in each case. IBS is a long-term chronic disorder affecting the digestive system that is not well publicized and generally regarded as mild. Cancer is used to refer to many different conditions affecting different parts of the body and can be terminal. It is associated with fear and dread and comes with preconceived ideas about prognosis. Research in psychology suggests that risk perceptions and attitudes of the general public are related to “dread risk” perceived by lack of control, dread, and fatal consequences that may bear little relationship to the actual scientific risk.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0272989X11408435">19</xref></sup> Therefore, these perceptions may affect the values assigned to health states, despite the fact that the quality of life and health state description is identical and that individuals should value the exact scenario presented in the time trade-off exercise.</p>
<p>Differences may also be due to stigmatization of patients with cancer, exaggeration of the effects of cancer, or taking account of mortality (which would make the estimates biased).</p>
<p>As patients often experience their own health conditions with a label attached, it could be argued that appropriate condition labels actually enable utility values to be produced that are comparable across conditions. If elicited preferences reflect preferences for life given a particular health state, rather than health in a given health state (see Tsevat<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0272989X11408435">20</xref></sup> for a discussion of this), this suggests that a condition label enables the preferences associated with the actual experience of life given a particular health state to be determined.</p>
<p>Another possibility is that the difference in condition represents a change in the underlying health state, and this is what affects values. For example, respondents may place a different value on interference with social activities due to, say, needing to be near a toilet than due to undergoing chemotherapy.</p>
<p>Qualitative research undertaken in this area would enable better understanding of the reasoning used by respondents to determine why the inclusion of different condition labels affects health state values. The difference in values may represent greater precision in utility estimates for the relevant condition, but further research is required to determine this. Until the reasoning behind the difference in health state values can be determined, avoiding condition labels will ensure that values are not affected by factors that should not alter the quality of life of a health state, such as preconceptions or taking into account mortality.</p>
<p>The aim of producing health state values is to inform resource allocation decisions across all conditions and patient groups, meaning there must be comparability across common health state descriptions regardless of the underlying condition. Otherwise, this could imply that, for example, a given generic EQ-5D state has a lower utility value for a patient with cancer than for a patient with IBS. We therefore argue that health state values developed for use in resource allocation should not reflect any difference in values introduced by referring to a medical condition.</p>
<p>Ensuring that health state values do not reflect differences in values introduced by naming a medical condition poses difficulties for preference-based measures derived from existing condition-specific measures with items that mention the condition. Here a choice must be made between either maintaining the reference to the condition with the possibility of introducing a distortion in values or removing the condition label, meaning that the preference-based measure does not perfectly map to the original measure. Neither option is ideal. One alternative is to develop a descriptive system de novo, yet this is time-consuming and expensive. Furthermore, condition-specific preference-based measures are often developed from existing measures because of their wide usage and established reliability and validity, and sometimes because this enables utilities to be obtained from existing data sets where other options are unsuitable.</p>
<p>Each label group has a large proportion of respondents with experience of the condition (40% in the IBS group, 78% in the cancer group), and variables representing experience of cancer in themselves and in caring for others were significant in the regression analysis. This is problematic as it again suggests that the elicited values may not purely reflect the health state being valued. ANOVA tests (not reported) revealed that IBS values were affected by experience of IBS in the family or in caring for others, yet these variables were insignificant in the regression analysis. Experience of cancer in themselves leads to <italic>lower</italic> health state values, which is inconsistent with the literature examining patient values, where it is found that patients provide higher health state values than the general population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0272989X11408435">21</xref></sup> Experience of cancer in caring for others leads to <italic>higher</italic> health state values, meaning greater unwillingness to sacrifice years of life in return for increased quality of life. This could be due to a variety of reasons such as knowledge of adaptation, although this would be incompatible with the previous finding.</p>
<p>To ensure comparability across economic evaluations, health state values produced by different preference-based measures should reflect the health state description and should not be affected by the reference to the condition per se. We demonstrated that the condition label of cancer affected values, whereas the IBS label did not, and hence further research is required to determine which condition labels may affect values and the reasoning why this occurs. Until this information is available, we recommend avoiding condition labels in health state descriptions to ensure that values are not distorted by prior knowledge or preconception of the condition. However, for some conditions and existing measures, this is impractical, as the condition label is embedded within the classification system.</p>
