<p>The authors report a descriptive, correlational study of advanced cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy treatment. The purpose of the study is to cultivate an improved understanding of the theoretical linkages among perceived social support and caring. The authors define advanced cancer as the stage of the disease where there is no possible cure and only supporting and palliative treatment can be administered. This component of thedefinition is instrumental in framing the outcomes to be measured – highlighting the issue of what outcomes become significant to patients and practitioners in the absence of a cure for the disease. Focus is typically placed on emotional adjustment to the disease. However, there is a slight paradox in that whilst the disease is constructed as an ‘immovable’ there is also evidence for the buffering effect of emotional support in advanced cancer in terms of physical as well as emotional health.</p>
<p>The authors rightly state the case for the need to explore linkages between social support and coping mechanisms in order to understand more about how this important buffering effect works. Research in this area is timely. Healthcare professionals involved in the care of patients with cancer have been advised to ensure that the organisation and provision of supportive care services comply with the recommendations made in ‘Improving supportive and palliative care for adults with cancer’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1744987111424561">NICE, 2004</xref>). One recommendation from this support is key. Assessment and discussion of patients’ needs for physical, psychological, social, spiritual and financial support should be undertaken at key points (commencement, during, and at the end of treatment; at relapse; and when death is approaching). Understanding of what constitutes social support, the mechanisms by which it has its effects and how it impacts on coping styles and patient well being and quality of life is an area worthy of attention.</p>
<p>The authors use the model of Lazarus and Folkman, which configures social support as a ‘dynamic and multi-dimensional construct within a process that changes through shifts in the person–environment relationship’. However, what I feel is missing in consideration ofthis model is the importance of the relationship between practitioner and patient. Ibelieve that the nature of this therapeutic relationship impacts on the connections between perceived social support and coping. Decades of psychotherapy research has demonstrated that practitioner effectiveness is independent of treatment model including placebo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1744987111424561">Blatt et al., 1996</xref>). This finding is well established for treatment of depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1744987111424561">Wampold, 2001</xref>) and should be considered in implementation of healthcare treatment models including those for advanced cancer. Consideration of the therapeutic relationship could usefully unpick the connections between stress and coping styles and inform the design of nursing interventions to enhance social support – one of the authors’ recommendations for clinical practice.</p>
<p>An interesting part of the background is the paradoxical relationship between the social environment and the individual which is highlighted by the authors; that is, it can be a precursor to stress but also alleviate stress. To me, this paradoxical relationship signals the possibility of mediators – and the therapeutic relationship is one such mediator that could determine whether the social environment is nurturing or stressful for the individual. Consideration of the therapeutic relationship and social support also applies to services’ responsiveness to patients’ needs – the therapeutic interaction between service and patient. Previous studies that draw upon the experience with patients with life-limiting and life-threatening illnesses indicate the benefits to patient care of partnership working and seamless services. These two areas of responsiveness towards patient needs could be usefully addressed via consideration of the therapeutic relationship.</p>
<p>On a final note I would like to highlight the importance of plurality in methodological approaches to these questions. The correlations reported in this study are generally weak. Rather than purely indicating a weak relationship between the concepts proposed, this could signal a need for a range of methodologies to address the research question. For example, individual interviews analysed by narrative methodology would provide the researcher with the ideal opportunity to explain how ‘meanings’, their linkages and horizons are actively constructed within the interview environment. Such a methodology would counterbalance and complement quantitative methods and be eminently suitable for enhancing understanding of such a multi-dimensional and dynamic concept as social support.</p>
