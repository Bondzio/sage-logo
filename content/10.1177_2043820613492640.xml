<body>
<p>In the field of geography, “where you are” matters more than in most other fields. That seems an obvious point, as geography is by definition a field focused on place. Yet, we are only beginning to write the geography of geography, or more precise, the geography of geographical knowledge production and consumption (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2043820613492640">Aalbers and Rossi, 2007</xref>). The paper, “Neither here nor there or always here and there?,” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-2043820613492640">Wray et al., 2013</xref>) is an important building block in creating such a geography. Wray et al. clearly illustrate how and in which ways Antipodean economic geography is both unique and related to economic geographical knowledges elsewhere. I have a number of reflections on their paper, the most important one being that almost all of us are, in some way or another, in between. This is not to argue that we are all the same; we are all different, but we share many of such differences.</p>
<p>The authors point out not only how Australia and New Zealand are different but also how the experiences of economic geographers working in both countries have many similarities. Of course, there are many obvious reasons for this, all of them very geographical in nature. Indeed, geographers in both countries are “neither here nor there or always here and there,” but I would argue that this is true for most countries in the world and, more importantly, for most geographers in the world (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2043820613492640">Rossi, 2008</xref>). Reading the paper, I was struck by the similarities between the Antipodes and the experiences of geographers working elsewhere outside the perceived core. To speak of the context I know best, continental Europe, the resemblance is striking. Although Wray et al. at times refer to the Northern Hemisphere as the perceived center of geographical knowledge production and the Antipodes as the “in between,” many continental European geographers share feelings of being “in between.” Some of them may come from former colonial powers, but being physically close to the United Kingdom and somewhat less close to the United States does not mean that they feel part of the same perceived center of geographical knowledge production.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-2043820613492640">1</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>This also brings me to one important issue that is almost completely ignored by Wray et al.: the issue of language. One reason that the Antipodes are sometimes a little more “here” than “there” from a UK or US viewpoint is that most geographers in the Antipodes have English as the first language. A great deal has been written about the role of language in creating and maintaining the Anglo-American or Anglophone hegemony in academic publishing (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2043820613492640">Aalbers, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2043820613492640">Berg and Kearns, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2043820613492640">Garcia-Ramon, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2043820613492640">Kitchin, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2043820613492640">Minca, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2043820613492640">Paasi, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2043820613492640">Rodríguez-Pose, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2043820613492640">Schuermans et al., 2010</xref>). The space permitted here does not allow me to go into details, but it is important to note how the important issue of language takes most of the Northern Hemisphere out of the perceived center. Many of these countries may be privileged in other ways, and often in ways not unlike Australia and New Zealand, but they are also placed at a distance from the center in both passive and active ways.</p>
<p>Does this mean the perceived center or heartland is reduced to only the United Kingdom and United States? This would also be too easy. And where does that leave places like Ireland or Canada? What the perceived center is for geographers from the Antipodes may not be the perceived center for geographers from continental Europe or elsewhere, but it is important to note that geographers in the perceived center may consider themselves to be outside the center as well, conditioned as their situation is by competition and regulation as well as by disciplinary and patriarchal power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-2043820613492640">Sidaway, 1997</xref>). Consider the case of a struggling adjunct in an elite institution in the heartland teaching five courses per semester but unable to land a tenure-track position in that or any other university. Physical location and language are crucial but so is one’s secure or precarious position within or outside the academy (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2043820613492640">Rossi, 2008</xref>). Indeed, almost everyone is “in-between.” Again, that does not imply we all share the same experiences, but I’d like to suggest that we share more than one often tends to think. One’s positionality may be unique, but one shares many ingredients of that uniqueness with others around the globe.</p>
<p>Geographers are well aware of the risk of overgeneralizing, but I think that sometimes there is also a risk in essentializing, or in not seeing the wood for the trees. I believe our “in-betweenness” often brings us closer together when we realize that we are not the exception—we are all particular. Once we start analyzing the perceived extreme nodes, we also start to realize that most people that we thought were inside those nodes are also “in-between”—neither here nor there or always here and there. Let me provide a few illustrations of things that are described as typical for the Antipodean positionality, but that may also be considered typical for many other places: interdisciplinarity, engagement with place, more quantitatively grounded and descriptive research and frustration with having to refer to “centric” literature, sometimes at the expense of “local” literature.</p>
<p>A few years ago, I was asked to write a 300-word review for <italic>Cultural Geographies </italic>of the edited volume <italic>Mapping worlds: International perspectives on social and cultural geographies</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2043820613492640">Kitchin, 2007</xref>). What struck me most in reading the stories of geographers in the twenty-some countries discussed in <italic>Mapping worlds </italic>was that they shared many similar experiences. For example, in many countries a more quantitatively grounded and descriptive tradition within human geography remained strong, stronger at least than this tradition is perceived to be in the United States and in particular the United Kingdom. Like in the Antipodes, geographers from many smaller population countries will also recognize the need to work interdisciplinarily in both teaching and research, as work sometimes tends to be less specialized and less abundant within our field, making us rely on studies outside the discipline. (Of course, many geographers in large population countries do interdisciplinary work as well, but this may be different from the practical necessities experienced in smaller population countries.) Furthermore, the engagement with place and with local practice that Wray et al. comment on is something that became highly visible in the survey Ugo Rossi and I undertook among early career geographers in Europe. Many stressed the importance of publishing in international academic journals as well in local publications, often of the popular academic or non-academic kind (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2043820613492640">Aalbers and Rossi, 2007</xref>). Although we contrasted this situation to that of the <italic>homo publicans</italic> that seems to be dominant in Anglophone geography, it is again important to stress that many geographers in the Anglophone world, not only in the Antipodes but also elsewhere, follow similar work and publishing attitudes, speaking to both the international/Anglophone world and the local world.</p>
<p>In the end, I feel that Wray et al.’s article is an important contribution to the geography of geography, not only because it tells the story of the Antipodes but also because it helps to understand how most of us are, in some way, outside the perceived center of knowledge production and consumption. Since no geographical location is only normal or exotic—the exceptionalism of each place, including the perceived center, is the norm—we should continue to intensify our efforts to decenter as well as deperipheralize our field, and indeed the world at large.</p>

<p>In that sense, I feel that the idea of <italic>Southern Theory</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2043820613492640">Connell, 2007</xref>) does not add a lot to the literature on postcolonial geographies, and histories and geographies of knowledge production for understanding Antipodean positionality in geography. (This does not mean I want to suggest that the lens of <italic>Southern Theory</italic> adds little for understanding other places or topics.) I also feel the concept of <italic>Southern Theory</italic> is not really “triangulated” with postcolonial interventions in economic geography and critical histories of the sub-discipline, as Wray et al. argue. Triangulation provides distinctly different viewpoints, while I see <italic>Southern Theory</italic> as a lens related to postcolonial theorizing rather than as something entirely separate from it.</p>
