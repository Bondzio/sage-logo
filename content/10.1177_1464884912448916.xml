<abstract>
<p>Since its US launch in the Washington, DC, market in July 2009, Al Jazeera English (AJE), like other news organizations, has engaged in activities to shape and promote its journalistic values and practices for itself and the public. Using the theoretical framework of journalists as interpretive communities, this article examines American media coverage of AJE through its first seven months of broadcasting in the DC market. The study finds that AJE’s attempts to shape and modify its image for an American audience have been mostly successful, although limited. The analysis indicates a gradual move towards acceptance of the network in the USA by its journalistic peers (other American journalists).</p>

<p>This article examines American media coverage of the US launch of Al Jazeera English (AJE) in the Washington, DC, market from the launch in July 2009 through the first seven months of broadcasting in this market (January 2010). It analyzes the coverage of the new channel with an eye to looking at whether the attempts by the channel to promote the values and practices employed by its journalists were visible in the coverage of AJE by other US news outlets.</p>
<p>AJE proclaims itself the ‘world’s first global English language news channel to be headquartered in the Middle East’. Al Jazeera has a unique funding stream – it is financed primarily by the Emir of Qatar, headquartered in the capital city Doha. The coverage and reception of Al Jazeera in the United States is itself socio-political (largely because of preconceived notions the new channel is trying to dispel). For some Americans, the channel is most recognizable for its sister network – the original Arabic-language Al Jazeera – which controversially broadcast Osama bin Laden’s tapes after the onset of US force in Afghanistan in October 2001. Even before its initial launch, the new Al Jazeera English channel was preemptively working against this deep-seated and negative heuristic in Americans’ memories.</p>
<p>The channel hosted members of Washington’s intellectual community at the Newseum’s Knight Studio for a town hall discussion and taping of a program about Al Jazeera English that aired during the channel’s inaugural week of broadcasting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1464884912448916">Al Jazeera, 2009</xref>). At this event, AJE then-managing director Tony Burman<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1464884912448916">1</xref></sup> was on hand to answer questions, along with David Frost, AJE anchor of <italic>Frost over the World</italic> and famous for his revelatory 1977 interviews with former President Richard Nixon that were the subject of the 2008 movie <italic>Frost/Nixon</italic>. Also present at the event were AJE anchors Ghida Fakhry, Marwan Bishara, and host of the event Josh Rushing. Rushing was still making the publicity rounds for AJE through fall 2010 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1464884912448916">Al Jazeera English, 2010b</xref>). As a former US marine featured in the documentary <italic>Control Room</italic>, and author of an autobiographical account, <italic>Mission Al Jazeera</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1464884912448916">2007</xref>), of his transition from US military communicator to AJE presenter of the program <italic>Fault Lines</italic>, Rushing is positioned to act as liaison between AJE and American audiences. In fact, Burman (a former Canadian Broadcasting Corporation senior executive), Frost, and Rushing were all strategic choices in terms of trying to convince American audiences that they should be more open-minded about AJE. To make AJE ‘palatable to Western viewers and advertisers’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1464884912448916">Khamis, 2007</xref>: 46), the channel also hired anchor Riz Khan from CNN, and featured other presenters with western backgrounds who had been hired by AJE since it originally launched in 2006. Among these were Richard Gizbert from ABC, who presents Al Jazeera International’s world media review program <italic>Listening Post</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1464884912448916">Day, 2006</xref>), and Shiulie Ghosh, hired from Britain’s ITV who had previously worked for the BBC, and who anchored AJE’s first program to air when AJE began broadcasting in 2006 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1464884912448916">Ghosh, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Two years later, AJE continues its image and publicity campaign, which until summer 2010 was largely ‘ad hoc’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1464884912448916">Al Jazeera English, 2010a</xref>). Beginning in summer 2010, AJE planned to launch a more coordinated major promotional campaign effort (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1464884912448916">2010a</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1464884912448916">Zayani (2008</xref>: 219) has observed, Al Jazeera’s public relations apparatus until recently has been elusive, not fitting any of the established western models:
<disp-quote>
<p>Interestingly enough, Al Jazeera’s controversial status has at times served it well, either as a contributing success factor or as an image enhancer. Seen from this vantage point, it may not be in the best interest of Al Jazeera to overcome the current perception of it as being controversial. Such an image has been so ingrained in the mind of the public that it would be hard to conceive of Al Jazeera otherwise, not to speak of the fact that trying to dispel controversy is most unlike the channel. Whence the conundrum: the public relations department would seek to put out fires in a media organization which, as history suggests, has capitalized by adding fuel to the fire.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Marking a departure from its ad hoc and mostly reactive public relations approach, Al Jazeera (AJ) retained the public relations firm Brown Lloyd James to prepare the public for Al Jazeera International – the original name for AJE – and establish its identity (Kincaid, 2005, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1464884912448916">Zayani, 2008</xref>). It also centralized its public relations efforts through an office of Communications and International Relations. ‘To sell itself, Al Jazeera International has been emphasizing that it is not a translation or an English version of the original Arabic news channel’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1464884912448916">Zayani, 2008</xref>: 219), that it is distinct. Correspondents Ayman Mohyeldin and Josh Rushing both said that AJ and AJE are ‘virtually the same network’, and ‘a single network’, at an event in September 2010 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1464884912448916">Al Jazeera English, 2010b</xref>). Structurally, employees of AJ and AJE answer to the same director general, and the two channels share content, but AJE has its own managing director and director of news. Salah Najem was hired in November 2009 as director of news for Al Jazeera English from BBC Arabic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1464884912448916">Tryhorn, 2009</xref>). Najem had previously worked for Al Arabiya and Al Jazeera Arabic. Al Anstey, who had also previously worked for BBC Arabic and ITN, succeeded Tony Burman in October 2010 as AJE’s managing director. In interviews with CNN and <italic>Time</italic>, Anstey has insisted ‘that AJE is wholly independent of the Qatari government’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1464884912448916">Gustin, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1464884912448916">Weprin, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>If media both influence and reflect sentiments in the culture in which they operate, then the tenor of American media coverage of AJE in its first seven months of broadcasting in DC may be an indicator of its wider reception by Americans.</p>
<sec id="section1-1464884912448916">
<title>Al Jazeera English’s entry into US television</title>
<p>Al Jazeera translated means ‘the island’ in Arabic and refers to the peninsula of Qatar or Arabian Peninsula. AJE has been broadcasting in English outside of the United States since 2006. The original Arabic-language channel has existed since 1996. Getting American cable television providers to carry the channel took some time. Three years earlier, in 2006, Comcast backed out of negotiations. According to some accounts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1464884912448916">Allers, 2009</xref>), this may have been due to high ranking members of George W. Bush’s administration, namely vice president Dick Cheney, accusing Al Jazeera’s Arabic channel of ‘inciting terrorism’, calling it the ‘mouthpiece of Osama Bin Laden’ because of its readiness to broadcast Bin Laden videos and audio tapes. Al Jazeera’s former director general, Wadah Khanfar, told Arabian Business in 2009 that a more ‘benevolent political climate’ had lessened the concerns of cable providers.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1464884912448916">2</xref></sup> Eventually, an agreement was made with Comcast. The carrier of the channel is MHz Networks, a nonprofit broadcaster with 10 channels of international programming (Russia Today, France 24) in Washington (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1464884912448916">Helman, 2009</xref>). The MHz deal meant 2.3 million subscribers would now have access to the channel, adding to the 140 million households already receiving Al Jazeera English worldwide in 2009 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1464884912448916">Allers, 2009</xref>). By 2011, Al Jazeera English was available in over 100 countries, reaching over 220 million households (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1464884912448916">Al Jazeera, 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1464884912448916">Youmans, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Prior to its launch in DC, the network had been carried in the USA only in Burlington, VT, and Toledo, OH, since 2007, and even in politically left-leaning Burlington (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1464884912448916">Youmans, 2011</xref>) protests about the network by local residents had ensued. After public debates in Burlington in 2008 about whether AJE should be carried on the ‘quasi-public’ entity Burlington Telecom, in addition to Buckeye Cable which had already made the decision to carry, AJE ultimately ‘gained carriage on Burlington Telecom and survived efforts to remove it’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1464884912448916">Youmans, 2011</xref>: 20). Also in 2008, AJE encountered a PR challenge when David Marash, ‘the most prominent American anchor on Al Jazeera English’, quit the channel, ‘citing an increased level of editorial control exercised by the channel’s headquarters in Doha’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1464884912448916">Stelter, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Even so, in November 2009, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) cleared the way for AJE (which at the time was headed up by former Canadian Broadcasting Corporation editor-in-chief Tony Burman as managing director) to be viewed in Canada as a digital cable channel. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1464884912448916">Vlessing (2009)</xref>:
<disp-quote>
<p>The CRTC slapped no conditions on the approval for Al-Jazeera English, in contrast to 2003 when it green-lit the Arabic language Al-Jazeera service for Canadian carriage, but ordered cablers and other content carriers to edit out violence or potential hate messages. No Canadian content carrier has yet taken up the expense, or bother, of editing the Arabic Al-Jazeera service as a condition of carriage … Against around 2600 public comments that the CRTC received in support of the carriage application by Al-Jazeera English, only 40 parties expressed opposition, the regulator said.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>As of August 2011, Al Jazeera English had 70 news bureaus worldwide (more than the BBC or CNN), and 1000 staff (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1464884912448916">Al Jazeera, 2011a</xref>). According to a January <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1464884912448916">2012</xref> report in Doha News, under AJ’s new director general, Ahmed bin Jassim Al Thani, who replaced Khanfar in September 2011 and is re-evaluating the organization’s structure, there is a general hiring freeze, a planned management restructuring and consolidation of AJ and AJE offices, but also the building of new studios for the Arabic and English channels.</p>
<p>Prior to September 11, 2001, few Americans were familiar with Al Jazeera. Once they became familiar with the network after 9/11, it was with mostly strongly negative perceptions. Former US Secretary of Defense, Donald Rumsfeld, called Al Jazeera’s coverage ‘propagandistic and inflammatory’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1464884912448916">CNN, 2001</xref>). Rumsfeld also ‘accused the network of manufacturing footage of dead civilians’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1464884912448916">CNN, 2001</xref>). The Bush administration asked the Qatari government ‘to get Al Jazeera to tone down anti-American voices on its shows and to limit its broadcasting of Al-Qaeda statements’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1464884912448916">CNN, 2001</xref>). Others believe that AJE has been unfairly ‘maligned’ in America ‘as an Al-Qaeda mouthpiece’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1464884912448916">Dawson, 2009</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1464884912448916">Zayani (2005</xref>: 26), the USA’s defensive actions towards AJE and attempts to influence the channel backfired, and subsequently US officials started to change their approach to AJ, opting to speak through the channel. ‘If anything, the United States is caught up in a somewhat ambiguous relationship with Al Jazeera, at times finding itself almost compelled to take heed of the network it took pains to discredit’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1464884912448916">Zayani, 2005</xref>: 26).</p>
<p>While westerners see Al Jazeera as a channel with Arab viewpoints and a pan-Arab mouthpiece, AJ sees itself, and is seen by other Arab states’ governments, as oppositional and a forum for resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1464884912448916">Zayani, 2005</xref>). AJE says of itself that it is ‘fearlessly reversing the conventional information flow by reporting objectively and impartially from South to North’ and that it ‘challenges established perceptions, bridges cultures and gives voice to the voiceless’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1464884912448916">3</xref></sup>. According to some scholars, Al Jazeera is an example of contraflow – an ‘alternative source of information’ from ‘Anglo-American domination of news and current affairs in one of the world’s most geo-politically sensitive areas’ (Thussu, 2007, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1464884912448916">Wessler and Adolphsen, 2008</xref>). For Sakr (2007, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1464884912448916">Wessler and Adolphsen, 2008</xref>: 440), contraflow is not only about a geographical shift of production capacities towards peripheral locations:
<disp-quote>
<p>More important is the appreciation of contra-flow content in Western locations and a certain degree of interaction with dominant media – be it of an appreciative or confrontational nature. This could lead to some form of discourse between dominant flows and contra-flows and – in the case of Al-Jazeera – to the construction of a ‘communication bridge’ between the West and the Arab world.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1464884912448916">Khamis (2007)</xref> has also written about AJE’s potential to bridge the gap between cultures and foster improved cross-cultural understanding, but <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1464884912448916">Samuel-Azran’s (2010)</xref> work argues that AJE is not having this idealized effect, and instead has strengthened the US government’s ability to influence media and public discourse. El-Nawawy and Iskandar (2003, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1464884912448916">El-Nawawy and Powers, 2008</xref>: 14) view AJ’s coverage through the lens of ‘contextual objectivity’, ‘the necessity of television and media to present stories in a fashion that is somewhat impartial yet sensitive to local sensibilities’. In their view, ‘all media deviate from the standard of objectivity by framing the facts of a given situation in ways that are socially accepted and expected amongst their particular audiences’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1464884912448916">El-Nawawy and Powers, 2008</xref>: 14).</p>
<p>At a symposium in Washington, DC, in March 2010, former Al Jazeera director general Wadah Khanfar said that AJ’s mission is ‘what is the collective good for the people we report to [on]’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1464884912448916">Khanfar, 2010</xref>), but he also said that AJ is ‘just faithful to the principles of journalism that existed in the West’. Although Khanfar said, ‘I think that Al Jazeera is not taking a side’, he also said that it has its preferences and its allies in the region, and that ‘Qatar is a state, it is not a charitable organization, so any entity should benefit the state interests’. These statements are somewhat at odds with each other. If descriptions of AJ are full of contradictions even coming from the head of AJ himself, then it follows that it might be difficult for others to come to a clear understanding of the network. Khanfar was responsible for launching the Al Jazeera Code of Ethics and Al Jazeera’s Code of Conduct in 2004, and has made the rounds on the speaking circuit at many American institutions,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1464884912448916">4</xref></sup> actions that also serve to further AJ’s communications agenda.</p>
<p>In investigating whether AJE’s external communications efforts were reflected in American journalistic coverage of its first seven months in DC, this study draws on several distinct but related bodies of scholarly literature. Theoretical frameworks and research findings from journalism studies, persuasive communication, and work specifically about Al Jazeera, are discussed in the next section.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1464884912448916">
<title>Theoretical framework: Journalists as an interpretive community</title>
<p>A sizable body of work in journalism studies over many decades has found that news organizations, and journalistic communities as a whole, attempt to shape and promote journalistic values and practices for themselves and the public. Many of these studies employ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1464884912448916">Zelizer’s (1993)</xref> conceptualization of journalists as interpretive communities who, through discourse, assert, negotiate and reassert their codes of practice. Some of the reasons journalists are motivated to articulate and publicize their values and actions are to establish and reinforce their own legitimacy and authority as purveyors and disseminators of news, and to defend against and ward off criticism and would-be external regulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1464884912448916">Tuchman, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1464884912448916">Zelizer, 1997</xref>). And so to maintain their autonomy and demonstrate their successful self-regulation, as well as to serve their financial bottom line and curry favor with audiences and advertisers, journalists and their news organizations engage in promotional activities with varying degrees of subtlety. All news organizations engage in these types of activities, and so it is no surprise that Al Jazeera English engages in them as well. While AJE’s financial bottom line is mostly supported by Qatar’s ruling family, the network also generates revenue from advertising, subscriptions, program sales, rebroadcasting fees and sale of footage to other networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1464884912448916">Zayani, 2005</xref>) and so AJE, like other news organizations, has several motivations for its promotional activities.</p>
<p>When journalists critique their peers – as in the case of American news outlets critiquing AJE – these activities perform a self-policing role within the journalistic community. They protect journalism’s boundaries from undesirable or unflattering behavior on the part of other journalists or news organizations that could jeopardize credibility with audiences or compromise standards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1464884912448916">Bishop, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1464884912448916">Haas, 2006</xref>). This ‘journalistic metacoverage’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1464884912448916">Haas, 2006</xref>), or ‘boundary work’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1464884912448916">Bishop, 1999</xref>), is part of the larger discussion through which the journalistic community self-monitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1464884912448916">Meltzer, 2010</xref>). It has also been observed that American journalists on the whole are characteristically resistant to change and slow to adapt, but that gradually, and eventually, they do (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1464884912448916">Jackaway, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1464884912448916">Meltzer, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1464884912448916">Ruggiero, 2004</xref>). Accordingly, American journalism is wary of new entrants, and reluctant to admit new members into its community. But the community’s flexibility enables it to eventually assimilate and accept new members. In her research, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1464884912448916">Tenenboim-Weinblatt (2009)</xref> found that the journalistic community’s eventual acceptance of Jon Stewart as a quasi-journalist or new kind of journalist was facilitated by political communication scholars and academic research that legitimated him as an educating source of political and news information. AJE’s coverage of the Egyptian uprisings and other uprisings in the Middle East and North Africa in winter and spring 2011, which have become known as the ‘Arab Spring’, has prompted comparisons with CNN’s ascendancy and greater acceptance after its coverage of the Gulf War (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1464884912448916">Campbell, 2011</xref>), and may eventually be seen as a critical incident (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1464884912448916">Zelizer, 1992</xref>) on AJE’s road to acceptance. A critical incident is an event that causes the journalistic community to reconsider its boundaries and practices, and can lead to a marked change. New entrants are often met with initial skepticism on the part of American journalists, who ultimately may come around to accepting them as members.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1464884912448916">
<title>Persuasive communication and Al Jazeera English</title>
<p>Literature on persuasion and influence in communication is also applicable to this study. Research in persuasion and influence has provided strong evidence that out of three possible types of attitude- and behavior-influencing campaigns – ones aimed at shaping, changing, or reinforcing people’s attitudes and behaviors – changing is the most difficult to achieve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1464884912448916">Jowett and O’Donnell, 1992</xref>; Miller, 1980, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1464884912448916">Stiff and Mongeau, 2003</xref>). Shaping means moving a person from no formed attitude or behavioral response to the subject, to the response desired by the persuader. Reinforcing is strengthening an already existing attitude or behavioral response. Response-changing is moving a person from an existing formed attitude or behavioral response to the one desired by the persuader. In AJE’s case, it is engaging in a response-changing campaign, the most difficult type, to move American audiences from formed negative attitudes towards the network to more receptive and positive attitudes. The ultimate goal of influencing positive attitudes towards the channel is that those attitudes will lead to the behavior of actual viewing. Additionally, in their response-changing campaign, AJE is working against a heuristic, which is a mental shortcut that people use to connect ideas within their cognitive frameworks. With a heuristic, people come to make automatic associations between a word, subject, or image, and other ideas. Over time and with repeated activation, a heuristic becomes deeply ingrained and is extremely difficult to counteract.</p>
<p>Among the scholarly research on Al Jazeera, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1464884912448916">King and Zayani’s (2008)</xref> content analysis of how the Al Jazeera brand has been presented in major newspapers worldwide suggests that Al Jazeera has made inroads to acceptance. According to their study, Al Jazeera’s move to establish the English-language service has in some ways improved its image and standing in newspapers around the world.</p>
<p>In their 2008 study of Al Jazeera English, El-Nawawy and Powers found that AJE can function as a ‘conciliatory media’, covering contentious issues in ways that contribute to ‘cooperation, negotiation and reconciliation’, and that the longer a viewer watched, the less dogmatic they were in their thinking (2008: 8). However, the study also found that viewers of AJE tuned in more to reaffirm their existing views than to gain new information. Respondents in the study who watched BBC World and CNN International were more generally more supportive of US foreign policy than AJE viewers. Further, the more frequently a participant watched AJE, the less supportive they were of US policy towards the Palestinian–Israeli conflict, and the longer they watched AJE, the more critical they were of US policy in Iraq. Thus, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1464884912448916">El-Nawawy and Powers (2008</xref>: 10) write, ‘while the news media are unlikely to change one’s opinion on politically salient issues, it may often be the case that they do reinforce and deepen already held opinions’.</p>
<p>The link between media coverage and public opinion is well documented through research. It is no secret that audiences tend to select media to attend to that are likely to reinforce their existing attitudes and opinions. Selective exposure and attention helps audience members avoid divergent viewpoints that are contrary to their own and might cause them psychological discomfort, or dissonance (Festinger, 1957, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1464884912448916">Stiff and Mongeau, 2003</xref>). So it makes sense that if American journalists and audiences perceive that the viewpoints presented on AJE are dissimilar to their own, and results from research show that watching AJE correlates with being less supportive of US foreign policies, then it is no wonder that AJE has been seen and treated as an outsider. American journalists, while asserting their ability to be objective and critical of leaders and power, are nonetheless still American. Especially when it comes to national security, tragedy and times of crisis, as with 9/11, American journalists have shown themselves to be patriotic and protective of their nation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1464884912448916">Schudson, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1464884912448916">Zandberg and Neiger, 2005</xref>). However, the ‘conciliatory’ potential of AJE is interesting in that we also know that for the sake of public discourse and diplomacy and having informed, considered opinions, it is beneficial to be exposed to a range of viewpoints, including divergent ones. It is with all of this in mind that this study examines AJE’s progress in its efforts to promote itself, as measured by American press coverage.</p>

<title>Analysis method</title>
<p>The online database Lexis-Nexis (Academic version) was used to search for articles written by US news organizations about the US launch of Al Jazeera English in DC in July 2009 (search date started with 1 July 2009) through its first seven months of broadcasting (until 31 January 2010). The headlines and full texts of articles were searched for the terms ‘Al Jazeera English’. Duplicate articles that appeared in multiple publications were eliminated. The search included US newspapers and wires, and broadcast transcripts. Using the grounded theory approach to textual analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1464884912448916">Glaser and Strauss, 1967</xref>), the themes were decided on after reviewing a number of items in the sample.</p>
<p>The search for ‘Al Jazeera English’ in broadcast transcripts returned 36 items. The search for the same term in US newspapers and wires returned 87 items. All relevant items were saved to an electronic database. Relevance of the item was determined by its mention of the network in conjunction with some discussion or description of it, rather than the mere fact that it covered another news story. The goal here is to analyze news articles about Al Jazeera English, not about AJE being present at coverage of a news event, unless AJE’s coverage of an event or story is what is being discussed substantively.</p>

<title>Mentions of AJE’s presence at US government briefings</title>
<p>Although they were not specifically analyzed in this study, news wire briefing reports about government briefings, including Federal News Wire, State Department Documents and Publications, and States News Service, frequently featured AJE reporters asking questions at the briefings. The presence of AJE reporters who get called on to ask questions at US government briefings is itself a normalizing activity. This activity is witnessed by journalists from other news organizations who are present at the briefings, in addition to whoever has access to and reads the wire reports. Over time, AJE becomes seen as another member of the press pool.</p>

<p>Accounts covered in the US press about western journalists with traditional western journalism backgrounds who now work for AJE also add to this normalizing process of AJE.

Before joining Al Jazeera in 2005, Palmer worked for CNN, the Associated Press Television Network, and was European foreign correspondent for Channel Seven Australia. One Associated Press story about journalism students graduating and trying to find jobs mentioned one graduate of the Columbia Journalism School’s work stints including AJE in the same breath as the <italic>New York Times</italic> and PBS:

<p>As an aside, the article mentions that while at ACORN, ‘King served as a national spokesman, engaging commentators and reporters from Fox News, CNN, National Public Radio, and even Al Jazeera English’.</p>
<p>Additionally, a story in the <italic>Pittsburgh Post-Gazette</italic> is about Pittsburgh native Jeffrey Ballou, now a resident of Washington, DC, who ‘relishes the challenge’ of working at AJE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1464884912448916">Todd, 2009</xref>):

<p>Ballou earned his undergraduate degree from Penn State and a master’s degree in journalism and public affairs from American University, and received a Hearst Fellowship for Young Journalists:

<title>AJE journalists receive journalism awards</title>
<p>It is also notable that, as the AP reported, David Frost, presently the host of <italic>Frost Over the World</italic> on AJE, was honored at the 37th Annual International Emmy Awards in November 2009 for his career in broadcasting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1464884912448916">Gans, 2009</xref>). Barbara Walters presented Frost with the Founders Award for lifetime achievement and former British Prime Minister Tony Blair also appeared on video to honor Frost. The British TV personality gained popularity in the early 1960s as host of the irreverent groundbreaking satirical program <italic>That Was The Week That Was</italic> that lampooned the political establishment. He later turned to more serious interview-based shows. ‘He holds the distinction of having interviewed all seven British prime ministers serving since 1964 as well as all seven US presidents in office between 1969 and 2008’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1464884912448916">Gans, 2009</xref>).

<title>AJE journalists as featured panelists at events</title>
<p>Adding to the normalizing and legitimizing process for AJE, AJE journalists have acted as moderators and panelists at events and forums sponsored by agencies such as the United Nations Development Fund for Women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1464884912448916">States News Service, 2009</xref>) and the United States Institute of Peace (USIP).

<p>Even where AJE journalists are not on the panels, the network’s coverage still comes up. For example, at the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) Edward R.

<title>Findings from US coverage that indicate criticism or casting of AJE as ‘other’</title>
<p>In January 2010, AJE was criticized for its coverage out of Haiti (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1464884912448916">Burns, 2010</xref>). Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton said she resented criticism of the US effort to help stricken Haiti. ‘Some of the international press either misunderstood or deliberately misconstrued what was a civilian and military response, both of them necessary in order to be able to deliver aid to the Haitians who desperately needed it,’ Clinton told a gathering of State Department employees.</p>
<p>Asked to whom Clinton was referring, State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley mentioned news reporting from Haiti by the Al Jazeera news network and CNN that he said was unfair. Crowley called reports by Al Jazeera’s English-language channel inflammatory: ‘It suggested there was a militarization of the effort. It compared military activities at the airport to a little “green zone”,’ he said. ‘We thought that was inappropriate.’</p>
<p>In response to Crowley’s comments, Al Jazeera English issued a statement defending its reporting in Haiti. It called its work ‘balanced, fair and detailed’, and said it reflected a range of views on quake relief efforts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1464884912448916">Burns, 2010</xref>). Criticizing AJE in the same breath as CNN also performs the function of normalizing the channel as one on par with the established CNN.</p>
<p>According to a PR Newswire release in November 2009, a survey by Nielsen Media Research found that in the Washington, DC, designated market area the TV audience prefers watching news on Russia Today TV (RT) in prime time, rather than news on Al Jazeera English, Deutsche Welle, France 24, Euronews and CCTV-9. Nielsen reported that RT’s daily audience is over 6.5 times bigger than that of Al Jazeera English, the second most popular source of TV news among foreign broadcasters in the USA after BBC (however the survey was conducted May–July 2009 and AJE didn’t launch in DC until July 2009, so only one possible month of its broadcasting could have been measured).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1464884912448916" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>From an analysis of the American media coverage of AJE during is first seven months of broadcasting in the DC market, it appears that AJE’s attempts to shape and modify its image for an American audience have been mostly successful, although limited. These findings from the journalism coverage of AJE may also indicate AJE’s wider reception by American audiences, although no research with audiences was conducted for this study. These findings are also consistent with those of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1464884912448916">King and Zayani’s (2008)</xref> study, which showed prior to the DC market launch that AJ – facilitated by the launch of the English channel elsewhere in the world – was making inroads in acceptance by major world newspapers. Movement towards acceptance by AJE’s peers (other American journalists) could reflect and influence its reception by the American audience at large.</p>
<p>Only 123 news items in total mentioning AJE over a seven-month period were retrieved through search databases. This study did not account for possible coverage through blogs, social networking sites, or other websites, which are venues of possible AJE discussion that future research could explore. Al Jazeera is only one of many Arab media outlets, but its English-language TV channel now carried by American cable providers garners the most attention by American journalists and audiences. Future research might also heed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1464884912448916">Zayani’s (2011)</xref> call for expanding the focus of scholarly research beyond Al Jazeera, and adopting an interdisciplinary approach to studying Arab media using ethnographic and anthropological methods and perspectives. However, the coverage examined in this study reflects an increasing acknowledgment and recognition of AJE as a legitimate and important new media force. AJE journalists’ presence at government briefings, employment of experienced western journalists, and receiving of coveted awards that are all mentioned in press coverage, bolster AJE’s stature as a contender and peer in the American journalistic community.</p>
<p>While the media coverage of AJE is mostly positive, there are some negative aspects to it however. AJE was criticized for its Haiti coverage and is still discussed in the context of bringing an oppositional, divergent viewpoint to its coverage. In this regard, the general nature of the critiques of AJE differs from that of other news outlets, although all news outlets are criticized at some times for aspects of their existence. These critiques are sometimes spurred by mistakes made by an employee of the organization or allegations of partisan or other biases.</p>
<p>Some American media coverage of AJE does couch its entry on the scene and growth in a challenging and starting-from-behind perspective. Some believe that the network is still a long way from mainstream:
<disp-quote>
<p>It would be an exaggeration to claim it’s gained wide acceptance. It’s still largely something you have to hunt down on the Internet. (Tom Rosenstiel, director of the Pew Center’s Project for Excellence in Journalism, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1464884912448916">Todd, 2009</xref>)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>According to Qureshi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1464884912448916">Al Jazeera English, 2010a</xref>), Satnam Matharu, Al Jazeera’s Director of Communications and International Relations based in Doha, is encouraging Qureshi and AJE in the USA to give away the program content for free, with the theory being that if they can get people to see it, want it and ask for it, that will cause it to be carried more widely.</p>
<p>AJE’s coverage of the ‘Arab Spring’ in 2011 bolstered the channel’s prominence, and was referred to as ‘AJE’s moment’ (Bauder, 2011; Burman, 2011; Kirkpatrick and Worth, 2011, as cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1464884912448916">Youmans and Brown, 2011</xref>). Amidst this coverage in March 2011, it was widely reported that Secretary Clinton, who in 2010 had criticized the channel’s Haiti coverage, was now calling the channel a ‘leader’ and producer of ‘real news’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1464884912448916">Radia, 2011</xref>). Additionally, in 2011 AJE was the recipient of several prestigious journalism awards, including Columbia University’s Journalism School’s highest honor – the Columbia Journalism Award (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1464884912448916">Fox News, 2011</xref>). The channel also won ‘Best 24 Hour News Program’ at the 48th and 50th Annual Monte-Carlo Television Festival, Best News Channel three years in a row at the UK’s Freesat awards, and other awards from the Royal Television Society, Amnesty International and YouTube (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1464884912448916">Al Jazeera, 2011a</xref>). In addition to winning a DuPont award in December 2011 and George Polk award in early 2012, in March 2012 AJE became the first international news channel to win a Howard Scripps Award for its coverage of political unrest in Bahrain during the ‘Arab Spring’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1464884912448916">Shaw, 2012a</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite these achievements, a recent study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1464884912448916">Youmans and Brown (2011)</xref> found that ‘Americans who watched AJE news coverage – branded with a CNN International logo – found it to be fair. People watching the same clip who were told it was Al Jazeera were more likely to conclude the story was biased’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1464884912448916">Joyella, 2011</xref>). The study showed that ‘a considerable segment of Americans is cognitively predisposed against the channel’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1464884912448916">Youmans and Brown, 2011</xref>). Leveraging the newfound interest in the channel as a leader in this coverage, by summer 2011, its promotional efforts included the Al Jazeera US Forum on ‘The New Age of Journalism’ at the Newseum in May 2011, featuring Bob Woodward, Zbigniew Brzezinski, Jon Lee Anderson, and a panel of Al Jazeera reporters including Sherine Tadros and Ayman Mohyeldin. Additionally, the DC-based AJE channel continued its outreach through local universities and organizations by pitching Mohyeldin, who covered the Egyptian uprisings in winter 2011, as a guest speaker. Several universities, including Georgetown and the George Washington University, and organizations such as the New America Foundation, held events featuring Mohyeldin in Spring 2011 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1464884912448916">Al Jazeera English, 2011</xref>). On 2 May 2011, Al Jazeera English launched ‘The Stream’, ‘a web community with its own daily show on Al Jazeera’s global English-language channel’, which will have ‘a major presence’ on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and other platforms, according to its promotional materials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1464884912448916">The Stream, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>This analysis of the first seven months of coverage of AJE since its launch in DC indicates that the move towards acceptance of the network in the USA is gradually taking place. The move towards acceptance will likely be strengthened by AJE’s more coordinated campaign launched in mid-2010 and there is already evidence of this. By September 2011, the network’s ‘Demand Al Jazeera in the USA’ campaign had resulted in over 50,000 emails in support of American cable and satellite providers carrying AJE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1464884912448916">Ricchiardi, 2011</xref>), and on its own website, AJE announced that it is on the air in New York City on Time Warner Cable (Channel 92) and soon will be on Verizon FiOS as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1464884912448916">Al Jazeera, 2011b</xref>). It has also achieved part-time carriage in Chicago and Miami (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1464884912448916">Shaw, 2012b</xref>).</p>
