</p>
<p>Until a few decades ago, the main focus of intensivists was patient survival and getting patients through the ICU. Thanks to a clearer understanding of disease pathophysiology, improved technology, and novel therapies, ICU mortality has dramatically decreased since then. As a result, intensivists had to shift their focus from short-term mortality to longer term morbidity and take on the new challenge of treating patients with chronic disabilities resulting from prolonged ICU stays. One of the most common long-term disabilities is prolonged weakness. The pathophysiology of this disability and the potential effect that therapies such as early mobilization have on its course are discussed below.</p>
<sec id="section1-1944451611435275">
<title>ICU-Acquired Weakness</title>
<p>ICU acquired weakness, also known as ICU-acquired paresis, critical illness myopathy/neuropathy, or critical illness neuromuscular abnormality, is one of the most common disabilities affecting ICU survivors and is defined as a clinically apparent weakness attributable to critical illness. Unfortunately, systematic epidemiologic data on ICU acquired weakness are limited. However, in a review on 1421 ICU patients admitted for sepsis, multiorgan failure and prolonged mechanical ventilation, Stevens et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1944451611435275">1</xref></sup> found a median prevalence of ICU-acquired weakness of 57%. In a study on survivors of acute respiratory distress syndrome, Tansey et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1944451611435275">2</xref></sup> reported a median loss of 9% of body weight and a significant reduction in the distance walked in 6 minutes in 18% of the study cohort patients.</p>
<p>ICU-acquired weakness consists of a spectrum of abnormalities involving both nerves and muscles. At each end of this spectrum are critical illness polyneuropathy (CIP) and critical illness myopathy (CIM). Whereas CIP is an axonal polyneuropathy that typically affects distal motor and sensory nerves, CIM is mainly a myopathy that causes proximal weakness without sensory deficits. In between CIP and CIM there is a continuum of conditions characterized by different degrees of muscular and nerve damage that often coexist, so much so that it is at times impossible to clinically distinguish one from the other.</p>
<p>The etiology of ICU-acquired weakness is not yet completely understood. In some studies, CIP has been correlated with a microcirculatory dysfunction causing impairments in the delivery of oxygen and nutrients to the nerves.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1944451611435275">3</xref></sup> Other studies have implied a causative relation between inflammatory changes to the nerves, increased microvascular permeability and formation of edema with compression of microvessels and consequent hypoxemia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1944451611435275">4</xref></sup> Some authors have hypothesized CIP is caused by an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, causing mitochondrial dysfunction and neuronal bioenergetic failure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1944451611435275">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1944451611435275">5</xref></sup> As regards CIM, some authors have attributed it to a decrease in membrane excitability from sodium channelopathy and/or to a dysfunctional excitation–contraction coupling from altered calcium sarcolemma release.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1944451611435275">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1944451611435275">7</xref></sup> Others have focused on a mismatch in the oxygen and nutrient demand/supply ratio to muscles, on an increase in protein catabolism due to prolonged bed rest and inflammatory status, as well as on an imbalance between anabolic and catabolic hormones.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1944451611435275">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1944451611435275">9</xref></sup> Other proposed mechanisms include an impaired expression of myofibrillary repair genes and a decrease in the frequency and intensity of nerve impulses arriving at the muscle membrane (functional denervation) due to bed rest.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1944451611435275">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1944451611435275">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>Controversy exists also as to the factors that predispose ICU patients to developing ICU-acquired weakness. Female gender, old age, severity of illness, hyperglycemia, systemic inflammatory response disease/sepsis, and use of corticosteroids, neuromuscular blocking agents, and aminoglycosides have all been implicated as risk factors, but many reports lack support from rigorous clinical investigations.</p>

<title>Detrimental Effects of Prolonged Bed Rest</title>
<p>Prolonged bed rest is one of the most commonly blamed factors for the pathologic changes of CIP and CIM. Indeed, prolonged bed rest has been shown to hasten a switch in the muscle fibers from slow-contracting fatigue-resistant myosin isoforms (type I) to fast-twitching isoforms (type II). It has also been associated with a switch in muscular metabolism from fatty acids to glucose, a decrease in protein synthesis, and the development of insulin resistance at the muscular level.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1944451611435275">10</xref></sup> Bed rest can cause microvascular dysfunction, decreased venous compliance, and third space fluid compartmentalization, which in turn are responsible for the postural hypotension, tachycardia, decreased stroke volume, and peripheral vascular resistances often seen in critically ill patients. Some studies have linked bed rest to an increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL1β, IL-2, and INFγ), and ROS production.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1944451611435275">11</xref></sup> The numerous deleterious consequences of prolonged obligated bed rest range from muscle atrophy, with a decrease in total muscle mass, muscle strength, and exercise capacity, to impairment of deep tendon reflexes, entrapment neuropathies, and joint contractures, as well as stocking/glove sensory losses, hyperesthesia, foot drop, heterotopic ossifications, decreased bone density, pressure ulcers, decreases in lung volumes, and atelectasis/pneumonia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1944451611435275">11</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1944451611435275">
<title>Safety and Benefits of Early Mobilization</title>
<p>Because of the recognized detrimental effects of prolonged immobility, it seems intuitive that the ICU patient would benefit from avoidance of bed rest and early initiation of physical therapy. Indeed, studies have shown that physical exercise can trigger ROS activated cell signaling pathways and increase protection against oxidative stress.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1944451611435275">12</xref></sup> Furthermore, evidence is available that moderate exercise triggers the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines, while decreasing that of pro-inflammatory ones.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1944451611435275">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1944451611435275">13</xref></sup> Despite the favorable physiological premises, competing time requirements in the busy setting of the ICU, the inability to diagnose CIP/CIM in a timely or effective manner, and concerns with costs and safety issues, explain why early mobilization is not a standard ICU therapy as yet. In a single center study on early mobility, only 6% of 35 mechanically ventilated patients in the ICU received physical therapy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1944451611435275">14</xref></sup> In a study on 150 patients with acute lung injury, only 27% of patients received physical therapy, with therapy occurring on only 6% of ICU days.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1944451611435275">15</xref></sup> Another study on ICU adult patients revealed that mobilization other than routine turning and range of motion was rare routine practice and that real physical therapy occurred less than 25% of the time.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1944451611435275">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1944451611435275">17</xref></sup> A recent national survey also demonstrated that protocols for initiation of physical therapy exist in only 10% of US hospitals.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1944451611435275">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>Only a limited number of studies exist on outcomes of early mobilization. Little is known about the current standards of practice for physical therapy and mobilization in the ICU, so that it becomes difficult to make any comparison. Nevertheless, some preliminary evidence does show improved clinical outcomes, such as a decreased incidence of delirium, a decrease in time spent on a mechanical ventilator, duration of ICU and hospital stay, and an increase in independence status at hospital discharge. In a study on early mobility involving 103 ICU patients, Bailey et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1944451611435275">19</xref></sup> documented only 14 adverse events (&lt;1% of total mobilization activities, consisting of falls to the knees without injury, systolic blood pressures falling below 90 mm Hg or raising above 200 mm Hg, oxygen desaturations below 80%, and removal of nasogastric tubes), with early mobility leading to 69% of patients ambulating more than 100 feet before ICU discharge, a percentage that is significantly higher than that of routine care in the ICU. In the same way, Morris et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1944451611435275">14</xref></sup> reported no adverse events during mobilization of ICU patients by a dedicated mobility team, with more patients receiving mobilization than the control group (80% vs 48%), a shorter ICU and hospital length of stay, and with a trend toward decreased ICU hospital mortality (12.1% vs 18.2%). Thomsen et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1944451611435275">20</xref></sup> demonstrated that early mobilization resulted in 91 out of 104 ICU patients (88%) ambulating a median of 200 feet at ICU discharge. In another study by Stiller et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1944451611435275">21</xref></sup> only 3 out of 31 ICU patients receiving mobilization showed a transient decrease in oxygen saturation that readily responded to an increase in supplemental oxygen. A recent randomized controlled trial by Schweickert et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1944451611435275">22</xref></sup> on medical ICU patients, assessed the effects of early mobilization initiated within 72 hours of admission. The authors found that 59% of the treatment patients versus 35% of the control group returned to an independent functional status at hospital discharge. Patients in the intervention group had more ventilator-free days and a shorter duration of delirium. Early mobilization was safe, as only one episode of oxygen desaturation occurred, and no other adverse events.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1944451611435275">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>Despite encouraging early evidence, however, larger prospective, randomized controlled trials are needed before the long-term benefits of early mobilization of patients in the ICU can be confirmed.</p>

<title>Adjunctive Therapies</title>
<p>In recent years, there has been a growing interest in developing new technologies that can assist in early mobilization of critically ill patients. One such modality is neuromuscular electrical stimulation, which consists of creating passive contractions of muscles by means of a low-voltage electrical impulse delivered through electrodes placed on the skin of target muscles. Zanotti et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1944451611435275">23</xref></sup> showed that neuromuscular electrical stimulation of a limb for 1 month leads to increased muscle strength, reduced respiratory rate and a shorter time to move from bed to chair in patients admitted to the ICU with hypercapnic respiratory failure. Some authors have also evaluated the efficacy of bedside cycle ergometers in providing passive, active-assisted or active training to critically ill patients. Safety and feasibility of cycle ergometry have been demonstrated both in a hemodialysis population and in bed-bound patients with severe COPD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1944451611435275">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1944451611435275">25</xref></sup> Furthermore, various custom-designed aids such as walkers, wheel chairs, and carrying poles have been devised to assist with ambulating patients in the ICU.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1944451611435275">26</xref></sup></p>

<title>Considerations Before Mobilizing Critically Ill Patients</title>
<p>Unfortunately, there are no evidence-based guidelines or follow-up guided protocols providing clear guidance on patient inclusion and exclusion criteria, the optimum time to start mobilization, or how to do it. Because of the uncertainty about risks and benefits of early mobilization as a result of the lack of controlled long-term follow-up studies, there are only a few authors who have attempted to give such indications. In many cases, the suggested guidelines have been borrowed and adapted from rehabilitation and exercise programs specific to other diseases, such as stroke or chronic pulmonary conditions.</p>
<p>Stiller<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1944451611435275">27</xref></sup> and Rochester<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1944451611435275">16</xref></sup> have suggested that patients should be evaluated in the light of their past medical history, usual level of mobility and fitness, presenting conditions, and current medications. Also, special consideration should be given to how well the patient has tolerated recent interventions, immediately before and during ICU admission. Necessity for inotropes, mechanical ventilation, and respiratory pattern should be considered as well. Mechanical ventilation is not a contraindication to mobilization per se, as long as the ventilator settings are reasonably low. A Pao<sub>2</sub>/Fio<sub>2</sub> &gt; 200 mm Hg seems safe before initiating mobilization. Hemoglobin and platelet levels, temperature, glucose, and body mass index need to be considered, as well as pain control and neurological status. Acute cardiac conditions such as any recent cardiac event, acute pulmonary embolism, and dissecting aneurysms represent absolute contraindications to early mobilization. Certain orthopedic conditions, deep venous thrombosis, and skin grafts/flaps require special consideration as well.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1944451611435275">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1944451611435275">27</xref></sup></p>
<p>As Morris and Herridge<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1944451611435275">28</xref></sup> outlined in a recent article focusing on future directions in early ICU mobility, there are still many concerns to be addressed and questions to be answered. Ad hoc designed studies will have to shed light on the best time to start mobilization, which mode and intensity, as well as define what are the absolute and relative contraindications to early mobilization and how to judge the appropriate “dose” of therapy. Before commencing early mobilization, we must recognize that exercise is going to produce a change in the patient’s vital parameters and we must delineate a “safe range” for these parameters during activity and decide on limits when therapy should stop. We need to consider the optimum mode of ventilation (if patients are still receiving mechanical ventilation) to support increased activity and the ideal airway, endotracheal tube, or tracheostomy. Further studies are needed to explore the benefits of early tracheostomy in the setting of early mobilization. Numerous potential benefits have been speculated, such as a decrease in dead space, a reduced need for sedatives, and less concern with potential extubation during mobilization, but large controlled trials are lacking.</p>
<p>A mobility team, possibly consisting of a physiatrist, a physical, an occupational and a respiratory therapist, a nurse, a nutritionist, a psychologist, a social worker, and the intensivist should be coordinated, but there is no literature yet on how this team should be organized and who should be responsible for it. Last but not least, ICU follow-up clinics should be instituted, where the long-term impact of early mobilization (as well as other ICU interventions) could be more rigorously assessed to determine if these interventions translate into improved outcomes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1944451611435275">28</xref></sup></p>

<title>Our Experience at the University of Virginia</title>
<p>To meet the specific needs of the critically ill patient, the Physical Therapy Department has recently established a team of therapists who provide care exclusively in all ICUs. This team of therapists has a vested interest in the complex patient population and is comfortable with a higher acuity level. When initiating a mobility plan for an ICU patient, the therapist must understand the medical risk versus benefit of early mobility. Mobility would be inappropriate if the patient’s ventilator settings are high and very slight activity such as repositioning or hygiene activity compromises respiratory status. They must also take into account medications such as pressors, the location/purpose of central and peripheral lines, drains, and other devices. It is very important for the therapist to coordinate with the medical team (ie, nursing, respiratory therapy) to determine if and when the patient is appropriate for activity.</p>
<p>In addition, we also have the position of an Activity Specialist on the Surgical Trauma ICU. This position was created in 2003 and the goals are to</p>
<list id="list1-1944451611435275" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>develop, plan, and coordinate therapeutic activities;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>provide exercise and activities that increase muscle strength, flexibility, and endurance to improve cardiovascular and respiratory functions; and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>provide adaptive communication techniques when needed to improve patient communication.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>These positions have been supported by the institution and ICU staff. Alhough definitive outcomes in terms of decreased days of mechanical ventilation or ICU stay may be difficult to measure, the perceived benefit to the patient of improved psychological well-being, sense of purpose, and autonomy have produced a general consensus that these services are worth the investment in staff and resources.</p>
