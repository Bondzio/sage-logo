<abstract>
<p>Assuming that theological anthropologies are put to work for particular historical projects, this essay examines recent contributions in this area in view of the project of inclusion. It claims that theological arguments in support of both the end and means of inclusion neglect the fact that from the perspective of creation, inclusion is the default position, and therefore requires no argument. Disability experience is not merely something that needs to be overcome. An alternative strategy is to consider an ecological view on disability by looking at the notion of ‘weeds’ as a conceptual byproduct of human design. The essay concludes that this perspective generates different questions that enable us to think about disability in terms of the goodness of being.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Let me start with a simple observation. Philosophical and theological characterisations of human being often have used the logic of classification to determine what distinguishes the human from other species: to be a human being means to possess properties a, b and c. The inevitable implication of applying this logic is the problem of boundaries and marginal cases: some humans appear to be more human than others. If this claim doesn’t bother anyone then there is no problem. I would be surprised, however, when Christian theologians would not be bothered by it. The implication as stated does not sit well with an intuition grounded in the creation story (particularly Gen. 1.26-27) that has guided much of Christian theology: God did not create only some human beings in his image. For mainstream Christian theology the invention of a category of subhumanity must appear as counterintuitive, I would argue.</p>
<p>This concern about the logic of classification set the stage for thinking about an all-inclusive theological anthropology as it was presented in my book <italic>Receiving the Gift of Friendship</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0953946812466487">1</xref></sup> In this article I want to look at the problem from a different perspective. The main idea that I will put to work comes from the core principles in the theory of ecology. It is actually a very simple idea, the idea namely that from an ecological point of view there are no weeds. Insofar as ‘flora’ is concerned, there are only plants, and flowers, and herbs, and bushes, and trees. When you find any of these blossoming it is because their environment is just what they need it to be, with the right amount of minerals, humidity and sunlight.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0953946812466487">2</xref></sup> ‘Weed’, on the other hand, is what you are likely to get when nature gets cultivated.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0953946812466487">3</xref></sup> The point that I want to take from this ecological view is that weeds are not a product of nature. They are rather a conceptual byproduct of nature as a human project. They are produced by design. From the perspective of design, however, ‘weeds’ are but dysfunctional organisms. They don’t belong, and because they don’t belong they are to be removed.</p>
<p>It is not difficult to see how this ecological perspective on weeds could be very effectively used as a metaphor for people with disabilities, particularly people with intellectual disabilities. In the popular eye they appear as human beings who do not fit the patterns of ordinary life common in our society, which explains why their existence is targeted by strategies of prevention. Indirectly they also are the object of design, namely in the sense that their existence contradicts the preferred ‘design’ of human being as it is operative in the notion of ‘designer babies’. It would not be difficult to show that their presence is unwanted because they don’t fit.</p>
<p>Tempting as this metaphorical use of the notion of weeds in this connection is, however, my aim in pointing to the principles of ecology is a different one. The idea that nature does not produce weeds is helpful to the discussion of theological anthropology because it helps to see that however the concept of a human being is understood, it will inevitably be a byproduct of some historical project. There is no historical project, in other words, that does not tailor its own conception of human being, and by implication marginalises those members of the species that don’t meet its standard. It may be the project of, say, medieval christendom, or the late twentieth-century project of a free society, but whatever it is, it will require a particular understanding of what counts as a human being properly so called. Conceptions of human being are subservient to historical projects.</p>
<p>This claim holds for theological conceptions as well. One way to look at theories of theological anthropology, therefore, is to ask oneself what is the project that these theories are supposed to be supporting? What is the historical end for which a given conception is construed? And which group of human beings, if any, is assigned the status of second-class participants in this particular project?</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0953946812466487">
<title>The Project of Modernity</title>
<p>Without going into much detail, let us look for example at the project of modernity. The project of modernity adopted human prosperity and progress as its main objective, and the way it characterised human being was entirely in line with this objective. In Charles Taylor’s account of it, dominant shifts occured in religious life in eighteenth-century Europe in which it came to be believed that ‘nothing is more likely to prevail with wise and considerate men to become religious, than to be thoroughly convinced, that religion and happiness, our duty and our interest, are but one and the same thing considered under different notions’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0953946812466487">4</xref></sup> Christianity transformed from a religion of being saved from perdition by grace towards a religion of the edifying role of moral sentiments and instrumental reason in living in accordance with a divinely created order. In view of the advances of science, churchmen could not be prejudiced against the improvement of knowledge, nor the advancement of ‘the work of men’s hands’, and therefore could not be doubtful of the powers of reason without undermining progress.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0953946812466487">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>To explain the shift Taylor points to the experience of elites of being successful in imposing the moral order they sought upon themselves and upon society. The virtue of a disciplined, sober and industrious life was elevated to the cloak of a second nature that could not but serve the end of a prosperous and harmonious society. Theoretical expressions of this philosophy in the work of thinkers such as Adam Smith indicate, according to Taylor, that religion was taken to serve the cause of civilisation rather than of a transformation that takes human beings beyond the limits of their present condition.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0953946812466487">6</xref></sup> Christianity, at the end of the eighteenth century, saw no aim beyond human flourishing, which leads Taylor to comment:<disp-quote>
<p>If God’s purpose for us really is simply that we flourish, and we flourish by the judicious use of industry and instrumental reason, then what possible use could he have for a Saint Francis, who in great élan of love calls on his followers to dedicate themselves to a life of poverty. At best this must lower GNP, by withdrawing these mendicants from the workforce; but worse, it can lower the morale of the productive.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0953946812466487">7</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Since progress and prosperity were seen as the achievement of industrious and self-supporting, independent men, the project of modernity produced its own misfits: the unpossessing poor. Taylor’s comment is particularly instructive in that it fits seamlessly with the invention of the ‘feeble-minded’ in the course of the nineteenth century.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0953946812466487">8</xref></sup> In developing industrial society the poor could redeem their own plight by accepting their role as ‘labour’, as a consequence of which this society produced its own ‘weeds’, which were those human beings who were unable to work because of some kind of physical or mental deficiency.</p>
<p>It is not by accident, therefore, that somewhere in the course of the nineteenth century the notion of the ‘feeble-minded’ emerges to identify those human beings on which society cannot count to participate in its endeavour to be a progressive and prosperous society. Unsurprisingly it is in the same era that we find the emerging concept of intelligence as an intrinsic quality,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0953946812466487">9</xref></sup> justifying the invention of a particular category of human beings, which indicates how ‘feeble-mindedness’ emerged as a conceptual byproduct of the project of modernity.</p>

<title>Introducing the Argument</title>
<p>If it is true, as I said, that anthropologies are consciously/unconsciously constructed in support of particular historical projects, then we may ask ourselves what kind of historical project our own contribution to theological anthropology is supposed to serve. My own answer to this question would be that the project most deserving of our support in the present day and age is the project of ecological sustainability. I think we should ask what the conception looks like that will assist reintegrating human being with its natural environment such that the distorting effects of the project of modernity can be overcome. Theologically speaking this will require us to think about the connections between anthropology and the doctrine of creation.</p>
<p>What I will present here, by way of a first attempt, comes from rethinking some of the issues that were discussed in <italic>Receiving the Gift of Friendship</italic>. Assuming that this book is at least partly responsible for the invitation to contribute the present article, it is appropriate, perhaps, that I spend a few paragraphs on what was argued in this book, which carries the subtitle: <italic>Profound Disability, Theological Anthropology, and Ethics</italic>. This subtitle indicates a particular group of human beings as the starting point of its reflections.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0953946812466487">10</xref></sup> This starting point provided me with the systematic angle to challenge the logic of classification as stated above. The argument proceeds as follows.</p>
<p>For people with profound intellectual disabilities it is generally true that they lack some of the properties entering into most philosophical and theological accounts of human being, such that they are the prime members of the anthropological subdivision that this logic inevitably creates. As may be expected, the properties that are usually responsible for this outcome are the capacities of reason and will, which in these human beings are lacking, at least as far as we know. Occasionally these capacities may not even be potentially present, as in some cases of microcephaly, for example. Having in mind the existence of such human beings—represented by the two main ‘characters’ of the book—the argument seeks to rigorously avoid grounding theological anthropology in any kind of natural capacity. Put simply, the thesis is that the end of human life is fulfilled in God’s friendship with each and every human being. Being in relation with God is key, but only in the sense that he engages in a relation of grace with each human being. In other words: the theological meaning of being human resides in the gift of God’s friendship.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0953946812466487">11</xref></sup> Understood in this way the true meaning of human being does not presuppose any natural capactity, and thus the lack thereof cannot create the problem of relegating some human beings to an anthropological subdivision. Their lives attain fulfilment in the same way as other people’s lives such that in the most fundamental sense there is diversity but no difference in God’s relation with human being.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0953946812466487">12</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0953946812466487">
<title>The Project of Inclusion</title>
<p>In view of what was argued in the opening section of this article, the proper question to ask in view of this theological anthropology would be: what is the historical project that it is supposed to serve? The answer of <italic>Receiving the Gift of Friendship</italic> was to support the historical project of inclusion that has motivated the disability field at least in the last forty years. But in order to do so, the book attempted to transcend the limits of this project as it is commonly understood. The main contention of this common understanding is that people with disabilities ought to be treated as equal citizens with the same rights and opportunities enjoyed by other people. Accordingly, the disability movement has been rightly named ‘the last civil rights movement’, which indicates its political orientation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0953946812466487">13</xref></sup> Very briefly, but not inaccurately stated: the goal of inclusion aims at institutional change by making public spaces accessible to all.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0953946812466487">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>While there is much to be applauded in this project, in my view, it is nonetheless limited in a way that particularly affects people with profound intellectual disabilities. Without awareness of its exclusionary implications, the disability rights movement has positively adopted what I have called the anthropology of liberal citizenship. It describes people with disabilities as self-determining individuals who with sufficient supports are perfectly capable of living their own lives according to their own preferences. Typically, the disability rights project is based upon the claim that ‘ability’ rather than ‘disability’ defines people’s lives, not unlike that of other people. It suggests that rather than thinking in terms of the ability/disability dichotomy, it is much more adequate, as well as respectful, to think in terms of variations in ability.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0953946812466487">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>The idea underlying this claim is that it is of utmost importance that people with disabilities tell their own story rather than have imposed upon them all sorts of labels indicating deficiency, dysfunction and defect. This claim—regarding the importance of enabling people to tell their own story—shows that the key value of the project of inclusion is that people with disabilities be represented as human ‘selves’.</p>
<p>In view of this anthropology it is clear that the project of inclusion thus conceived cannot be as all-inclusive as it is usually taken to be.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0953946812466487">16</xref></sup> There are quite a few human beings with regard to whom the notion of a ‘self’ is problematic. Most conspicuous among these are people with profound disabilities. Hence the attempt in <italic>Receiving the Gift of Friendship</italic> to overcome the limitations of the project of inclusion as a <italic>political</italic> project by grounding it in an all-inclusive theological anthropology. It argues for understanding inclusion not primarily as a matter of including people with disabilities as equal citizens in our institutions, but of including them as fellow human beings in our lives, because the God that Christians worship as the Triune God has done so. The connection with ethics is then developed by thinking through the meaning of practices of friendship in this connection.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0953946812466487">
<title>Inclusion as the Theological Default Position</title>
<p>Having been engaged in a wide range of discussions on the argument as presented, I think there is reason for second thoughts, particularly in view of the connection between theological anthropology and the doctrine of creation, as was indicated above.</p>
<p>Actually, I see two reasons. The first springs from the observation that, theologically speaking, it is odd that we should need a reason for inclusion. From a theological perspective there is no need to argue for inclusion, because it is given in creation. The reason, as mentioned before, is that God did not create only some human beings in his image.</p>
<p>As a historical project, however, ‘inclusion’ presupposes that exclusion is the default position, which is true for both the ‘political’ as well as my own ‘ethical’ version. In the former, inclusion is shaped by the politics of equal rights and opportunities; in the latter, it is shaped by the practice of friendship. In both versions, however, some kind of strategy is needed, first to justify the goal of inclusion, and then to justify the means to accomplish it. From the perspective of a theology of creation, on the other hand, <italic>inclusion</italic> rather than <italic>exclusion</italic> is the default position. One remaining question, then, is how to account positively for the existence of profoundly disabled human beings in a theology of creation.</p>
<p>Here the second reason immediately ties in. In denying our natural capacities any relevance in the construction of a theological anthropology because of their radically uneven distribution, one is in fact proceeding from an eschatological point of view. Because God fulfills human being such that it is in no way dependent on its own capacity, the unequal distribution of these capacities cannot lead to marginal cases. There is a price to be paid for this strategy, however, which is that there is no logical space left for a positive account of our bodily existence. While there may have been a sound intuition behind this move—the body of human beings with profound disabilities is where the problem resides—the argument in fact reinforced a position that I was emphatically trying to get away from, namely the position that their existence <italic>as such</italic> is a problem. Not just an accidental problem, but one that concerns their very being. This is a position that one cannot be content with, theologically speaking. Turning towards eschatology in order to avoid any kind of anthropological subdivision, one has apparently no logical space left to account for people with profound disabilities as <italic>God’s</italic> creatures. Understanding the gift of friendship as God’s end for human being, there is nothing left to say on what it means that he is their Maker.</p>
<p>The point I am making here with regard to the argument in <italic>Receiving the Gift</italic> holds for a much wider range of arguments in the field of theology and disability. As far as I can see, the doctrine of creation has typically not filled many pages in theological texts on disability. As to why this is, one may surmise that from the perspective of creation, disability, like disease and disaster, presumably raises questions about the goodness of creation. Generally speaking, most theologians working on disability tend to invoke theological doctrines concerning Christ and his work—like the doctrine of incarnation, the doctrine of redemption, or the doctrine of eschatology. Disability appears as that part of human experience that somehow needs to be overcome by God’s promises for humankind. The moral imperative following from these contributions is that either the Church, or society at large, is called upon to make these promises happen, to the extent that this is possible at all. In other words,theological contributions to the project of inclusion tend to assume that overall disability experience is what human beings need to get away from. This aim is particularly evident when they are buying into the shift from <italic>disability</italic> towards <italic>ability</italic>. The implicit message is that disability ought not to exist.</p>
<p>The topicality of inclusion as an historical project in the late twentieth century in fact reflects this very shift. It is the attempt to do away with disability experience as a social experience of marginalisation and exclusion. It works towards enabling people to show what they can do with adequate supports, rather than focusing on what they cannot do. Though there is much in this project, both in its political and ethical sense, that warrants supporting it, the implicit drive towards overcoming disability experience raises a profound theological question. Is it truly the case that what is part of God’s creation needs to be overcome somehow, either by human response or by his own redemptive action? This is the remaining question that I want to think about.</p>
<p>In order to take a fresh look at this, I suggest that bringing the doctrine of creation into play we can ask different questions, questions that do not take as their point of departure the presupposition of disability experience as something that people should be enabled to leave behind. Instead they enable us to aim at understanding how disability experience at least potentially contributes to the goodness of life. There is reason to raise this issue once we remind ourselves of the creation account in Genesis according to which God looked at the work of his hands and saw that it was good.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0953946812466487">
<title>Mutuality and Responsiveness</title>
<p>Only very recently, an attempt at moving in this direction was presented in Molly Haslam’s <italic>A Constructive Theology of Intellectual Disability</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0953946812466487">17</xref></sup> While Haslam recommends my theological argument for its attempt to leave behind the conditions of agency as a prerequisite of human being, she does not think the argument succeeds. I will skip the answer to her objections here, but will only briefly present and discuss her constructive position.</p>
<p>Haslam opens her constructive account with what she calls ‘a phenomenology of human being in relational terms’ (p. 53). In this phenomenology she describes a person named Chan. Chan is a young man of twenty years who was born with cerebral palsy, but also has a profound intellectual disability. This involves his intellectual functioning, Haslam, explains, at an IQ level below twenty-five. Chan also has severe impairment in adaptive behaviour. He does not demonstrate the ability ‘to comprehend words or sentences; neither is he able to produce them. He does not demonstrate an ability to use gestures or sounds with the intent to communicate his needs or wants’ (p. 57). As a result of his cerebral palsy he has also ‘spastic quadriplegia’, which means he has poor motor skills. Chan is totally dependent on his caregivers for all his daily needs.</p>
<p>Among these caregivers is a man named Philip who is particularly important for Chan, Haslam tells us. It is in relation to Philip that Chan exhibits particular behaviours that are pivotal to her argument. As soon as Philip steps into the room, he becomes more active: ‘The motor activity of his arms and legs increases, his eyes remain open, he smiles, and he begins to vocalize at the sound of Philip’s voice’ (p. 58). Characteristically none of these behaviours occurs when other caregivers are working with him. Haslam describes a similar pattern of exchange between Chan and his physical therapist, Sara (pp. 59-61). In view of this case study, the question she addresses is to what extent these observations can be taken to account for Chan’s participation in the pattern of mutuality and responsiveness that she claims is characteristic of human being as relational being.</p>
<p>Haslam’s answer to this question is to say that Chan does not exhibit acts of intentional communication, but then she maintains that he functions on a ‘preintentional level’ (p. 62). This means that<disp-quote>
<p>Chan does respond to the world around him through changes in his behavior, and the world around him in turn responds to him. However, these changes in Chan’s behavior appear to serve a communicative function, not because they are an intentional attempt by Chan to communicate but because they are interpreted by those language users around him as expressive of wants and needs of which Chan appears to be unaware (p. 62).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>As Haslam points out, this observation indicates that there seems to be no intentional communication on Chan’s part, but this does not rule out the communicative function of his behaviour. She maintains that even though there is little evidence of an awareness in Chan of the way in which he may affect the world around him, her account nonetheless reveals ‘the ways in which responsive relations are possible for individuals without the intellectual capacity for conceptualization’ (p. 64). On this basis she concludes that her case study suggests ‘an alternative understanding of what it means to be human based upon these responsive relations’ (ibid.).</p>
<p>In rereading how the argument proceeds, however, there seems to be logical error here. As the above quotations suggest, Haslam seems to move from ‘being responded to’ towards ‘being in responsive relation’ without explaining the difference between the two. When I come home from a trip abroad and see some of my plants hanging down because I forgot to water them before leaving my apartment, they appear to me in a state of need. This state of need is being responded to as soon as I water them, but it does not follow that therefore they are in a responsive relation with me. The changing focus from being the object of response to being a subject in a responsive relationship is unwarranted.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0953946812466487">18</xref></sup> Earlier in her book Haslam described her project as the attempt to follow Martin Buber’s dialogical thought, and ‘locate our human being not on one or the other side of the subject/object dichotomy but in the realm of “the between”’ (p. 9). While this may be in itself a laudable enterprise, the way Haslam herself frames the opposition between what Philip can do and what Chan cannot do, reinforces rather than leaves behind the dichotomy she objects to.</p>
<p>On the basis of her phenomenology Haslam then moves towards a theology of creation but there the same unwarranted move occurs. This happens when she interprets <italic>imago Dei</italic> in terms of ‘participating in relationships as responders’ (p. 105).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0953946812466487">19</xref></sup> Because of the behavioural changes that occur in Chan she claims that he responds to the world around him, and then continues: ‘these changes in Chan’s behavior appear to serve a communicative function <italic>not because</italic> they are an intentional attempt by Chan to communicate but because they are interpreted by those language users around him as expressive of wants and needs of which Chan appears to be unaware’ (p. 106).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0953946812466487">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>In view of such statements it is hard to see what could be the meaning of mutuality in Haslam’s account, since she so clearly acknowledges the absence of it by assigning communicative responsiveness exclusively to the interpretative function of Chan’s caregivers. To return to my earlier example, of course one could say that my plants respond to my watering them by going up again, but would it follow that they therefore participate in a relationship of mutual responsiveness? Haslam, it seems to me, is forced to answer affirmatively. Since she has ruled out any intentional mental state on Chan’s part, the responsiveness she claims for Chan is in no way distinct from any other kind of responsiveness in organisms such as plants. At any rate, the mutuality she maintains is flawed. Even when one maintains responsiveness for both Chan and his caregivers, Haslam’s account indicates two very different kinds of responsiveness such that her claim to mutuality on this point is empty.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0953946812466487">
<title>Reintroducing ‘Substantialism’</title>
<p>In arguing for mutuality and response, Haslam in fact reinforces the approach to theological anthropology that she wants to get away from, namely, the approach that retains the primacy of agency as a necessary condition, which in her theory is fulfilled by the capacity of responsiveness. As we have seen, Chan’s ‘responding’ is clearly no more than just a physical reaction—a ‘behavioral change’, as Haslam describes it—that for its responsive meaning is entirely dependent upon the responsiveness of ‘language users’.</p>
<p>There are two problems with her position. Since ‘mutuality’ and ‘responsiveness’ in her account of Chan’s behaviour are in no way different from the way other natural organisms react to their environment, it follows that these reactions as such do not ground the distinctiveness of <italic>human</italic> being. The second problem is that her account indicates that Chan’s humanity is entirely dependent upon other agents. Not only in the sense that without his caregivers Chan could not survive, but also—and more importantly in this connection—in the sense that the responsiveness of his caregivers is what fulfills the condition of Chan being included in Haslam’s conception of human being. It is because of their interpretative responsiveness that Chan can be said to participate. In other words, it is their responsiveness that constitutes his humanity.</p>
<p>I have discussed Haslam’s constructive account here because it represents a pattern that one finds quite frequently in the literature.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0953946812466487">21</xref></sup> ‘Relationality’ is proposed as an alternative to a ‘substantialist’ conception of human being, but when the <italic>purpose</italic> of human being is explained—the purpose that the proposed relation is meant to secure—substantialism is reintroduced by making human being conditional upon some kind of capacity. This is also clear in Haslam’s account. We find Chan being described in terms of behavioural changes that some of his caregivers have learned to see as responses, but then their interpretation gets substantialised in Chan’s capacity to respond, which leaves Haslam precisely in the position where she does not want to be. Without interpretative action of the caregivers there is no participation—as Haslam’s analysis indicates—and so her conclusion is unwarranted. Chan does not participate in the purpose of mutuality and responsiveness as the true nature of human being. It is exactly this pattern, I may add, that led me to argue in <italic>Receiving the Gift of Friendship</italic> that human beings like Chan can only be included in a conception of human being when the purpose of his being is externally grounded in God’s agency.</p>

<p>This conclusion takes me back to the critical point I made before about <italic>Receiving the Gift of Friendship</italic>. Making the purpose of human being dependent upon God’s eschatological gift of friendship, there seems to be no room left for a positive account of our bodily existence. In view of this critical point, the question should perhaps be rephrased. How can ‘being’ and ‘purpose’ be linked in a theology of creation without making the link dependent upon God’s eschatological action? In view of human beings with profound disabilities, the specific issue this question raises is the absence of agency.</p>
<p>The answer that I want to explore, as indicated by the title of this article, is taken from the principles of ecology, but at this stage I can only hint at a few tentative thoughts in this connection. In following these principles, the historical project of ecological sustainability will seek to integrate human flourishing with the flourishing of all other natural organisms. In the context of this project the notions of progress and prosperity will not be as prominent as they have been in the project of modernity. Not because we ought to leave the world unchanged, but because change can only by contributive to sustainability when it seeks to improve ecological balance. Balancing the ecological conditions of all living organisms, including human beings, can be the only goal for this project to succeed.</p>
<p>A couple of points follow. First, with regard to human beings like Chan, nothing depends on their agency because the condition of flourishing is not dependent upon it, as Haslam’s account indirectly shows. Chan’s flourishing is dependent upon the presence of caregivers interpreting his wants and needs in responsive ways. Human beings like Chan can flourish, but they cannot flourish as self-asserting agents. Haslam’s constructive argument fails because its central notion of participation in mutual responsiveness remains captive to what ecologists would call an anthropocentric mode of thinking. The theological question is, of course, what a theocentric mode of thinking would be like, in this connection.</p>
<p>Second, the purpose of human being—on the above account—is no other than <italic>to be</italic>. That is to say, there is no purpose <italic>external</italic> to its being. In terms of a theology of creation, there is no purpose for human external to its being <italic>as God’s creature</italic>. When God created human being, and saw that it was good, he did not value what it potentially could become, but what it actually is. The same holds for all other creatures as well.</p>
<p>Third, the Christian tradition has always believed that the purpose of creation consists in God creating the world for himself, and not for the sake of his creatures. Therefore the purpose of human being does not exist in its being in- and for itself. Put differently, when the purpose of creation is no other than to glorify God, as particularly the Reformed tradition has it, than this purpose is realised in the <italic>being</italic> of creatures.</p>
<p>Fourth, flourishing human beings glorify God in his creation, but so does the flourishing of all his creatures. The notion that creation is for the glorification of God appears to be adequately reflected in the project of ecological sustainability. This project seeks to balance the ecological conditions that enable all of creation to be flourishing, wherefore to participate in it is to participate in sustaining God’s creation to be.</p>
<p>A last question to conclude these reflections. Is there a specific theological space to be retained for the flourishing of <italic>human</italic> being? Interestingly, in view of this question, putting all the weight on a theology of creation invokes the concern of theological <italic>anthropology</italic>, which, again, suggests the need for some kind of balancing act. One observation in this connection might help, the observation namely that the theological discussion on human being in the twentieth century has been marked by a shift from ‘individual substance’ towards ‘communal relations’, as was also reflected in the views that have been discussed in this article.</p>
<p>As Old Testament scholars have pointed out, in this connection, the creation narrative inaugurates the being of the nations—as it is explained in Genesis 1–11—just like the calling of Abraham (Genesis 12) inaugurates the being of Israel.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0953946812466487">22</xref></sup> This indicates that the question as to what constitutes the divine image in a human being does not regard the human individual taken as a being in- and for itself, which is typically a modern notion. What the <italic>Book of Genesis</italic> seeks to tell is how God creates a people for himself. The notion of a people, as the biblical record shows, takes a long time to be properly understood as including all God’s children.</p>
<p>Here, again, the simple idea with which I started helps. From the perspective of a theology of creation there are no ‘weeds’, because creation is not limited in ways that are dependent on any type of human design. To explain what this means, I finally want to suggest, with Moltmann, requires a theology of creation that recognises that our Maker is the Triune God.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0953946812466487">23</xref></sup> It helps us see that through the Son, we are called to witness that the Father relates equally to all human beings as his children. In God there is no difference in how he relates to each and every one of them.</p>

<p>Actually, this claim needs qualification. There is a distinct ecological usage for the term ‘weeds’, which is to indicate plants that colonize degraded habitats, or invade habitats where they do not normally grow.

<p>It is interesting to note that the praise the book has received is mostly from people with some intimate knowledge about the lives of human beings with profound intellectual disabilities, which is a topic that is hardly ever addressed in the scholarly literature, neither in philosophy nor in theology. Molly Haslam recommends it for being the first study that directly asks what being human means, theologically speaking, in view of the lives of human beings with profound disabilities. Molly C. Haslam, <italic>A Constructive Theology of Intellectual Disability: Human Being as Mutuality and Response</italic> (New York: Fordham University Press, 2012), p. 7.</p>

<p>The notion of friendship comes in because of the argument in the book aims at a strong tie between theological anthropology and ethics. If being human is the gift of God’s relationship with every human being, then ‘belonging’ is a key in understanding what this means. ‘Being human’ then can be explained as being chosen by someone, as ‘being the apple in someone else’s eye’, the proper ethical concept of which expression, I argue, is friendship. Friendship in this connection is defined as being chosen by someone for the sake of oneself (<italic>Receiving the Gift of Friendship</italic>, pp. 131-32, 143-44, 244-45).</p>

<p>This thought is illustrated by the language of ‘the temporarily abled bodied’, which is to indicate that the distinction between ability and disability is a relative one. See Nancy L.

<p>Haslam prepares for her reading of Gen. 1.26-27 by turning to Martin Buber’s dialogical philosophy, in particular his account of the I-Thou relationship as the relationship within which human beings fulfill their existence (pp. 67-91). It is unclear, however, how Buber’s account can be relevant to her project of presenting an anthropology that includes human beings like Chan. Haslam seems to think that given the absence of reflexivity in his case Chan cannot get entangled in I-It relations that eliminate the otherness of Thou by turning it into an extension of the self, from which she concludes that he therefore must be engaged in I-Thou relations (p. 79). But this move is quite unconvincing in view of Buber’s claim (in Haslam’s words): ‘because there is no specifiable I without the Other in virtue of which the I is specifiable, the wholeness of the self cannot be manifest in I-It relations’ (p. 69). For Buber, I-Thou relations at least require the presence of an I.</p>
