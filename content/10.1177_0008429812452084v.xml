<p>With <italic>Killing Enmity</italic>, Thomas R. Yoder Neufeld joins a growing trend to attend to situations of violence and violent imagery in religious traditions. This book does not contain a comprehensive treatment of violence in antiquity or an in-depth discussion of different forms of violence, but it does offer some interesting interpretations of a number of theologically troublesome passages in the New Testament. Each chapter analyzes a specific violent passage or event, such as the Parable of the Unforgiving Slave or the crucifixion, in order to access the underlying message about violence. It soon becomes evident that the guiding interest in this analysis is in demonstrating that the New Testament does not promote violence.</p>
<p>Yoder Neufeld sets the stage in Chapter One with a brief discussion of the concept of violence. Although he is clearly aware of different forms of violence, the analysis in the rest of the book only rarely builds upon the important variations he notes at the outset. In the following chapters, he is mostly concerned with overt, physical violence, save for Chapter Six, which touches upon structural violence in the household.</p>
<p>Chapter Two discusses the infamous injunctions to turn the other cheek and to love one’s enemies. Rather than recommendations to passively accept violence, Yoder Neufeld suggests that these voluntary actions can be read as subtle confrontations and thus subversions of the violent culture from which they stem. He acknowledges that there is a certain ambiguity in this interpretation, given that the New Testament often presumes future judgment for those behaving contrary to its recommendations. This ambiguity continues in Chapter Three, which examines the Parable of the Unforgiving Slave—admittedly a problematic passage for Christians on most interpretations. Yoder Neufeld rejects an exclusively socio-political interpretation as “reductionist” and “potentially distorting” (49) and opts instead to view it as a (limited) teaching on forgiveness and God’s mercy.</p>
<p>In Chapter Four, the issue is whether or not Jesus’ disruption of Temple commerce, narrated in all four canonical gospels, fundamentally recommends violence. Instead of seeing this incident as an individual act of violence by Jesus, the author prefers to view it as an expression of the increasing confrontation between the kingdom of God and the current order. This confrontation culminates with the death of Jesus, the subject of Chapter Five. Yoder Neufeld explores the violence inherent in this event by relating it to various, often theological, theories of atonement.</p>
<p>Yoder Neufeld turns to the question of subordination as a form of violence in Chapter Six, which is the only chapter to extend beyond traditional conceptions of physical violence. Here the reader finally finds the notion that social hierarchies and inequalities are expressions of violence that restrict or deny power to some groups. The focus is both on the household code in the ancient world, and on the political submission seemingly recommended by Romans 13. In both of these cases the relationships are fundamentally defined by subordination and obedience. Yoder Neufeld characteristically tries to find ways to assuage the structural inequality that these passages would entrench. Ultimately he settles on seeing a close connection between subordination and transformation in the Christian tradition, which is part of the “deep mystery” that “pervades the New Testament and resides in the central figure of Jesus” (121).</p>
<p>Chapter Seven deals with the theme of divine warfare, and the author rightly resists reading the imagery of war as purely metaphorical or spiritual. Yet even though such texts as the Apocalypse of John depict graphic scenes of violence, he again wants to temper this extreme interpretation to something less straightforward: violence is not the main point of Revelation’s story; it is part of the “great mystery to the intrusion of God into the affairs of humanity” (134). This chapter also considers the violent overtones in the “day of the Lord” and Paul’s writing about the “armour of God”.</p>
<p>Yoder Neufeld does an excellent job of demonstrating how violent imagery in the New Testament resists unambiguous explanations or interpretations. Despite this, his ultimate conclusion is that the New Testament encourages “the subversion of violence, not its legitimation” (150). Many aspects of this book are tailored more for a theologically-minded, popular readership than for scholars of religion. Indeed, Yoder Neufeld’s confessional proclivities are evident when he frequently digresses to discuss what these violent passages imply for modern Christians, and it is clear that he shares with this audience a certain discomfort about many of them. Although this theological agenda is stated up front, it does affect the contours of his analysis in important ways. For instance, he is often concerned with trying to argue that independent Christian texts are consistent. At one point, he proposes that the concept of forgiveness promulgated by the Parable of the Unforgiving Slave accords with Paul’s understanding of forgiveness in Romans. Scholars who do not share this theological interest would not be burdened to show that these passages from different texts within the New Testament are ideologically consistent.</p>
<p>Overall, <italic>Killing Enmity</italic> is an accessible exploration of the question of violence in some key passages in the New Testament. It is not, however, a cutting-edge discussion of the conceptual category of violence in the ancient world, or even in the contemporary setting. This book would be most appropriate for readers with Christian tendencies who have perhaps struggled with the violent rhetoric in their own scripture.</p>
