<p>At the time of submission to the Interdisciplinary Network for Group Research (INGRoup) conference, convention paper authors were asked if they would like their papers to be considered for this special issue. These papers are reviewed separately by members of the <italic>Small Group Research (SGR)</italic> editorial board and by ad hoc reviewers who regularly attend INGRoup. Through this selection and review process, these articles represent the variety of research and disciplines contributing to group research presented at the 2012 Conference of INGRoup (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ingroup.net">www.ingroup.net</ext-link>). The conference was held in Chicago, Illinois, USA, July 2012.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of INGRoup in 2006, <italic>SGR</italic> has partnered with INGRoup to provide journal space for articles that began as papers at the INGRoup conference. This is the seventh year for this special issue (Issue 3 for years 2007 through 2012; Issue 2 for 2013). The goal of this partnership is to reflect the different disciplinary traditions brought to the study of groups. In addition to competitive papers presented at INGRoup, this special issue also includes papers from a panel in which participants reflected on the methodological issues that have the potential to divide us. Ed Salas, the 2012 recipient of INGRoup’s Joseph E. McGrath Award for Lifetime Achievement in the Study of Groups, provides an invited response to these commentaries.</p>
<p>The interdisciplinary nature of INGRoup, which is reflected in their name, and the interdisciplinary nature of <italic>SGR</italic>, which is reflected in our title and mission, results in a natural relationship. We hope that our relationship with INGRoup will continue to enhance both the interdisciplinary and international characteristics of group and team research that we believe is essential to the health and impact of this area of study.</p>
