<abstract>
<p>In a somatic society which promotes visible, idealized forms of embodiment, men are increasingly being interpellated as image-conscious body-subjects. Some research suggests that men negotiate appearance issues in complex and varied ways, partly because image concerns are conventionally feminized. However, little research has considered how overweight men construct body projects in the context of weight loss, or how men talk to each other about weight management efforts. Since sources of information and support for overweight men are now provided online, including dedicated weight loss discussion forums, our analysis focuses on one such forum, linked to a popular male-targeted magazine. We conducted a thematic analysis of selected extracts from seven threads on the forum. Our analysis suggests a widespread focus on appearance, as well as the use of emotion categories when describing difficult bodily experiences. Invariably, however, such talk was carefully constructed and constrained by hegemonic masculinities founded on discipline, work-orientation, pragmatism and self-reliance. The findings are discussed in relation to magazine masculinities and aesthetics, as well as literature on male embodiment.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>This article focuses on how men talk to each other about their weight management efforts in an online support group linked to a popular male-targeted magazine. We know that support groups are flourishing online, encompassing a whole range of health-related topics (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1363459312454149">Sullivan, 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1363459312454149">2008</xref>). Although we know that conventional weight loss groups and the concept of ‘dieting’ are unattractive to most men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1363459312454149">Bye et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1363459312454149">Wilkins, 2007</xref>), little is known about how all-male group settings might impact on men’s weight loss projects, or indeed how men might support each other as they negotiate challenges in this (and other) health-related domain(s). Attention to male vulnerability, emotional communication and homosocial support in the context of an online group setting will also enable us to contribute to understandings of contemporary masculinities, and to literature on men’s health (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1363459312454149">Courtenay, 2000</xref>). This focus on weight management is important in light of the much reported links between obesity and major health problems (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1363459312454149">Haslam and James, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1363459312454149">Kopelman, 2007</xref>), although the medical problematization of larger bodies and the associations with disease and degeneracy have been subject to sociological critique (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1363459312454149">Gard and Wright, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1363459312454149">Monaghan, 2007</xref>). To help contextualize our study, we consider literature on male embodiment in health contexts, body image issues in men and mass media constructions of idealized bodies.</p>
<p>The work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1363459312454149">Watson (2000)</xref> has been influential in theorizing men’s embodiment and is a useful starting point. His study of a well man’s clinic identified different forms of embodiment variously invoked by male patients and health professionals. The preference for the men was for a ‘pragmatic embodiment’, where the body is regarded as a means of performing and completing tasks, while ‘experiential embodiment’, where the body engenders feelings, was typically eschewed. In another relevant study, this time on body projects and the regulation of normative masculinity, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1363459312454149">Gill et al. (2005)</xref> drew on interviews and focus groups with 140 men aged between 15 and 35 in Britain. These authors highlight autonomy as a central theme, with men presenting themselves as ‘the individual managers of their own bodies’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1363459312454149">2005</xref>: 55). This research concluded that men viewed their bodies as projects to construct identity, rather than a more holistic entity to be cared for. Such findings support theoretical work on masculinities in which notions of functionality and achievement are deemed hegemonic while emotions are gendered as feminine, coded as weakness and therefore to be avoided (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1363459312454149">Seidler, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>Recent research by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1363459312454149">Robertson (2006)</xref> undermines stereotypical constructs of male (dis-)embodiment. Based on interviews with men on health and lifestyle practices, it was found that the men variously drew upon all four of Watson’s embodiment repertoires (pragmatic; experiential; visceral; and normative) and linked them together in often subtle and complex ways. More recent work in an illness context with men on a cardiac rehabilitation programme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1363459312454149">Robertson et al., 2010</xref>) demonstrates that men, for example, do use an experiential account where feelings concerning the body are disclosed, an ‘embodied emotionality’ which is also connected to other forms of embodiment (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1363459312454149">Branney et al., 2012</xref>). For example, improving fitness via the exercise component of the cardiac rehabilitation programme was seen to confer benefits experientially (feeling good), pragmatically (task completion), normatively (looking good) and viscerally (e.g. lower cholesterol readings).</p>
<p>Related more directly to the focus of this article, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1363459312454149">Monaghan’s (2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1363459312454149">2008</xref>) research with male members of a slimming club highlights widespread rejection of medicalized standards and definitions of embodiment and health (e.g. Body Mass Index (BMI)), and a celebration of ‘vibrant physicality’ as opposed to post-weight loss thin bodies, construed as extreme and unattractive. This research drew on ethnographic observation at slimming club sessions and one-to-one interviews with male members. Building on such work, the present study seeks to examine the accounts provided by men to each other in an online discussion forum concerning weight loss (i.e. in the absence of any researcher). The anonymous nature of online communication along with the homosocial context provide men with opportunities to display concern for and vulnerability around their bodies, and to give and receive support from peers – data valuable to researchers interested in the construction and negotiation of contemporary embodied masculinities in health contexts.</p>
<p>Although health discourse dominates weight management sites and constructions of large bodies, men are also likely to draw upon aesthetic discourses (‘normative embodiment’, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1363459312454149">Watson’s (2000)</xref> terms) since male bodies have become objects of consumption in mediating, marketized environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1363459312454149">Bordo, 1999</xref>). This is all the more likely in our study where the online discussion forum is linked to a popular male-targeted magazine which typically features idealized images of lean-but-muscular men throughout (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1363459312454149">Labre, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1363459312454149">Stibbe, 2004</xref>). In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1363459312454149">Gill et al.’s (2005)</xref> interview study the men were careful to position themselves as interested in their appearance without being vain, while recent analyses of ‘metrosexual’ men’s talk online suggests a concern to appear masculine (e.g. emphasizing heterosexual success) while referencing feminized practices (e.g. tweasing eyebrows) (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1363459312454149">Hall and Gough, 2011</xref>). More generally <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1363459312454149">Grogan (2007)</xref> notes that men are increasingly sensitive to body image, more susceptible to bodily dissatisfaction, and more likely to engage in appearance-related practices than previous generations of men. The role of popular culture and mass media in manufacturing fantasies and anxieties around male embodiment, including specific and significant body parts such as the penis, was highlighted by Bordo as early as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1363459312454149">1999</xref> in a follow-up to her groundbreaking text on the cultural construction of female bodies and disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1363459312454149">Bordo, 1993</xref>). The desire for slender, tight bodies experienced by men and women is firmly situated in culture rather than nature, and amplified in particular mediated contexts such as advertisements in gender-targeted magazines.</p>
<p>In light of the contemporary western emphasis on body projects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1363459312454149">Giddens, 1991</xref>), and given that overweight and obese individuals are widely criticized in contemporary psycho-medical discourse (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1363459312454149">Monaghan, 2007</xref>), it is likely that men who join and contribute to a discussion forum on weight control have to some extent declared their bodies to be problematic. This is not to ignore associations between largesse and hegemonic notions of masculinity, founded on physical presence and occupying space, for example in American football (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1363459312454149">Pronger, 1999</xref>) and hip hop culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1363459312454149">Gross, 2005</xref>), and also in gay ‘bear’ communities where large bodies are eroticized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1363459312454149">Gough and Flanders, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1363459312454149">Monaghan, 2005</xref>). Nonetheless, the contributors to our online weight loss forum will be oriented to body modification projects and likely to be invested in health and/or aesthetic discourses: it will be interesting to examine the extent to which masculinities inform their accounts. It is also likely that the men will resort to a discourse of self-management and goal setting in their efforts to shed some pounds, since such terminology infuses men’s health promotion materials (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1363459312454149">Gough, 2009</xref>) and magazine masculinities (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1363459312454149">Labre, 2005</xref>), and resonates with hegemonic masculine concepts of rationality and control (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1363459312454149">Seidler, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1363459312454149">Connell’s (1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1363459312454149">Connell and Messerschmidt, 2005</xref>) concept of ‘hegemonic’ masculinity has proved useful in previous analyses of men’s health issues (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1363459312454149">Gough, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1363459312454149">2007</xref>), and can be defined as those forms of masculinity which are dominant at any one time in a given community. Current conceptions promote the diversity, complexity and fluidity of masculinities, and our position here is that what counts as hegemonic is in part made relevant by men in everyday contexts and in part influenced by wider cultural norms. Since weight loss and associated practices (e.g. dieting) are historically feminized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1363459312454149">Bordo, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1363459312454149">Orbach, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1363459312454149">Wolf, 1991</xref>), and given the male-centred magazine context described above, the presentation of masculine identities may well be a concern for the men contributing to the forum, especially as they will be communicating with other men. However, we should not rule out possibilities for displaying and negotiating disappointments and vulnerabilities, and we will attend to the construction and reception of such posts where available.</p>
<p>To reiterate, the development of online discussion forums attached to particular publications presents valuable opportunities to examine how men communicate with each other about their bodies, weight management projects and (implicitly) masculinities – and to make recommendations about improving men’s health promotion campaigns concerned with combating obesity.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>In contrast to more conventional qualitative research (interviews, focus group discussions), the forum data considered here feature men ‘talking’ to each other without the potentially constraining presence of a researcher and thus may be considered more naturalistic (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1363459312454149">Potter and Hepburn, 2005</xref>). In this anonymous ostensibly all-male peer context, it is perhaps more likely that men will feel comfortable in recounting their weight management stories and offering glimpses of more personal concerns and hopes.</p>
<p>To identify relevant discussion forums, we conducted online searches using keywords such as ‘men and weight loss’, focusing on UK sites as far as possible. As well, we looked at UK-based mainstream commercial weight management sites, such as ‘Slimming World’ and ‘Weightwatchers’. We found that these websites featured little in the way of male engagement and discussion. For example the Weightwatchers UK forum has a ‘Men’s Arena’ which appears to be used by both sexes to discuss men’s weight loss (i.e. some women use this as a place to ask advice on how to help their partner lose weight). By contrast, a discussion forum on ‘weight loss’ associated with a popular male-targeted magazine contained by far the most male-to-male ‘talk’, so we opted to study these data in detail. On this forum all posts were publically accessible and no passwords were required. In total seven threads (and 547 posts) were analysed. These were selected for richness of data, having many contributors, or covering issues which attracted many responses. As no one thread had all of these features it was necessary to choose from a range of types. Six of the threads were from the ‘losing weight’ forum on the discussion board, while the seventh was from another forum but had been linked from posts in the ‘losing weight’ forum. Although the forum dates from 2001, threads were chosen that had been added to in the year to date (August 2008–2009).</p>
<p>Internet research such as this generates questions about ethical principles and safeguards. For example, online data can be deemed both public and private, but it is widely accepted that posts on open access sites (which are not password protected) are available to all and treated as such by contributors (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1363459312454149">Rodham and Gavin, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1363459312454149">Walther and Boyd, 2002</xref>). The online forum under consideration here is accessible by anyone and so issues of informed consent do not apply. However, researchers can take steps to maximize anonymity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1363459312454149">BPS Online Ethics Working Party Report, 2007</xref>) and as such we have changed usernames and thread titles have been altered and have neither specified the forum web address nor the magazine to which the forum is attached. The research project was approved by the relevant University Ethics Committee.</p>
<p>The seven threads are as follows:</p>
<list id="list1-1363459312454149" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>Thread 1. Original contributor Richy6, subject ‘The Big Change’: based around one man’s story of his progress in losing weight/getting fit (281 posts by 69 different forum users over five months).</p></list-item>

</list>
<p>Our focus on one discussion forum and a limited number of threads/posts (seven threads/547 posts) is within the range of published qualitative research working with online data (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1363459312454149">Horne and Wiggins, 2009</xref>: 42 threads/329 posts; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1363459312454149">Stommel and Koole, 2010</xref>: 27 threads/215 posts), and modest datasets are common with respect to qualitative research across a range of methodologies, where the focus is on intensive rather than extensive analysis (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1363459312454149">Smith, 2004</xref>). This is especially true with discourse-based analyses of online (and offline) data (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1363459312454149">Smithson et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1363459312454149">Sneijder and Te Molder, 2005</xref>), and out analysis draws partly on discursive concepts. In the case of phenomena which have received little or no prior research attention it is also accepted that a focus on one case/site is justified, as in other studies of online data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1363459312454149">Barney et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1363459312454149">Stommel and Meijman, 2011</xref>); we think our novel focus on naturalistic homosocial discussion in one online forum around weight, embodiment and masculinities falls into this category. Our methodological approach is informed mainly by thematic analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1363459312454149">Braun and Clarke, 2006</xref>) while also drawing on elements of discursive analysis (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1363459312454149">Potter, 1996</xref>), an approach we have used before with other datasets of similar scope.</p>
<p>Featuring by far the highest number of posts, clearly thread 1 offers the most content for analysis; it also proved to contain a range of responses to the originator’s many posts, so posts from this discussion feature most in our following analysis. The threads were often dominated by the originator, as perhaps would be expected. For example 107 posts (38%) in thread 1 were by the originator Richy6, and the length of this particular thread is due to his continued interest in posting his progress for other members of the group to witness and comment on over the course of five months. Since this particular originator had much to report, and given his apparent investment in his body project and in soliciting feedback from peers, we present a number of extracts from his accounts in our analysis. Other participants started a thread with the same stated intention (for example thread 2) but did not always sustain interest in writing up their progress for longer than a few weeks or with such frequent postings.</p>
<p>It is difficult to know the precise demographics of the men that posted on the forum as not every contributor made these public; indeed we cannot guarantee that all contributors were men, but usernames and references to body areas, wives and so on suggest male users. Those men who posted age information suggest an age range of 19–40. Some men would be initially classified as overweight according to their BMI and reported losing less than a stone. Other men however reported being very obese at the outset and reported losing up to 12 stone in weight. No men on the forum identified as homosexual, and while heterosexual status was not overtly declared, references to partners or sexual attractiveness suggest a focus on women.</p>
<p>The forum transcripts were analysed using the thematic analysis procedure described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1363459312454149">Braun and Clarke (2006)</xref>. This type of analysis was favoured as it would help establish patterns of meaning across the forum dataset in an inductive, data-driven fashion. Data analysis involved each thread being printed and read carefully. All data were then systematically coded, generating a wealth of specific, descriptive categories to begin with. Periodically, initial categories were grouped together, with each cluster being allocated a meaningful label. The developing system of category clusters was regularly reviewed and refined, with analysis proceeding from many descriptive clusters towards fewer, more conceptual clusters which were thought to subsume most of the data. We also attended to the ways in which key themes were oriented to, constructed and managed by forum users (i.e. discursive practices). Since a discussion forum foregrounds social interaction, a discursive sweep enables us to examine how accounts are worked up and how they function in this particular social context. This constructionist version of thematic analysis is specified in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1363459312454149">Braun and Clarke (2006)</xref>, and we have successfully used this methodology with other datasets (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1363459312454149">Gough, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1363459312454149">2009</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1363459312454149">
<title>Findings</title>
<p>Analysis of the forum responses generated three key themes: retaining control; fashioning a masculine body; manly support: heroism and pragmatism.</p>
<sec id="section4-1363459312454149">
<title>Retaining control</title>
<p>In general, there was a reluctance to deploy emotion categories in the forum, which echoes the findings of an offline men-only weight loss intervention where emotion talk needed to be downplayed in the group meetings for men to be at ease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1363459312454149">Gray at al., 2009</xref>). This reluctance around emotion-based support has been explained by the need for men to preserve hegemonic masculinity in social situations to others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1363459312454149">Bennett, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1363459312454149">Connell, 1995</xref>), that is, reinforcing self-control, rationality and perceived invulnerability.</p>
<p>Throughout the exchanges, there was widespread criticism of mainstream commercial diets, such as those advertised by ‘WeightWatchers’ or ‘Slimming World’, as feminized (‘girlie’), restricted and superficial: ‘there is a massive difference between losing weight via some shit diet (the missis loves weightwatchers and I can’t stand it) and doing what’s required to truly change your life … eat right, exercise right’ (Kingofthehill, thread 1). A clear distinction is made here between the dismissed women-friendly approach (‘shit diet (the missis loves weightwatchers)’) and the preferred approach, which is deemed effective (‘truly change’), necessary (‘what’s required’) and correct (‘eat right, exercise right’). This difference is emphasized with extreme case formulations (‘<italic>massive</italic> difference’) while the chosen approach is similarly underlined as efficacious (‘<italic>truly</italic> change’) (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1363459312454149">Pomerantz, 1986</xref>). Moreover, the decried diet is linked to weight loss only while the preferred approach is construed as more globally effective (‘truly change your life’), incorporating exercise as well as dietary factors. Other studies focusing on media representations of gender and diet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1363459312454149">Gough, 2007</xref>) and interviews with men about eating habits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1363459312454149">De Souza and Ciclitera, 2005</xref>) also highlight perceived sex differences between the nature and value of diets which favour ‘male’ versions.</p>
<p>The notion of weight loss per se, however, was rejected by the men, who made clear distinctions between unwanted fat and idealized muscle. Consequently, the use of body fat measures was popular as an addition to, or replacement for, scale weight measure, with the latter denounced as a ‘lying bitch’ by one contributor. This echoes research which states how problematic scale weight and BMI measures are for people, in particular those who are more muscular than average, as such measures neglect body composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1363459312454149">Ross, 2005</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1363459312454149">Monaghan, 2007</xref> for a critique of BMI).</p>
<p>The forum discussions also positioned men firmly in the kitchen, a historically feminized sphere of course but here given a masculinized spin in terms of gaining knowledge of – and control over – food content, preparation and consumption, for example framed within a typical male social drinking scenario: ‘in my opinion my kebab tastes better than the ones you get in the kebab house after a night out! Worked for me and two of me mates Friday night’ (Mitch_e, thread 1). In the context of UK male drinking culture, a night out with friends (‘mates’) is typically rounded off with some fast food such as a meat-filled kebab; in this example then, the healthy and the masculine are neatly combined – and proven to be effective (‘worked for me …’). The kitchen is also construed as a site for moulding muscular bodies:<disp-quote>
<p>I think the saying ‘a sixpack is made in the kitchen and not in the gym’ is 100% true. (Jamie15, thread 5)</p>
<p>Be a beast in the gym and a beast in the kitchen, that’s where good bodies are made. (Richy6, thread 1)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Here, muscularity is first connected to the kitchen which is then likened to the gym as a legitimate space for masculine endeavour (‘be a beast’) and the production of fit male bodies. This construction of cooking in a masculine way for weight-training purposes has been found in the wider media as a way to reinforce further hegemonic masculinity, for example through the use of military and evolutionary metaphors (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1363459312454149">Gough, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Weight training was considered desirable not only for creating muscular physiques but because it was considered to help the men gain control of their metabolism: ‘Think of yourself as a car … the bigger your engine (in this case muscles mass) the more fuel (calories) you’ll burn’ (Micky, thread 4). Here, muscles are construed as an engine which will help body fat or food to be burned off at a higher rate. Muscles were described as ‘your fat burning friend’ by another contributor for the same reason. By bulking up, men expect to gain control over their level of fatness. The machine metaphor deployed in relation to male embodiment has been found in health promotion texts, for example <italic>The HGV Man Manual</italic>, a guidebook for tackling male obesity in the UK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1363459312454149">Banks, 2005</xref>). It has been argued that such mechanization of overweight and obese male bodies, which renders them exterior, solid and hard, obscures the reality of flabby, soft, pliable bodies which may well provoke body-image concerns requiring psychological support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1363459312454149">Gough, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>There was one issue, however, which engendered much concern and which potentially positioned the men as vulnerable – unanticipated loose skin following weight loss that could not be resolved without surgery (a procedure not available within the UK National Health Service). This situation appeared to represent a sudden and unwelcome loss of control over their appearance:<disp-quote>
<p>… these mags have never really touched on the whole surgery and excess skin side of things, and I see a lot of people who are desperately unhappy after losing all the weight and being confronted by this situation … it’s like a kick in the face. (southernlad, thread 7)</p>
<p>Turns out I need surgery to get my loose skin taken off. I didn’t think that I had that much, turns out the belly I was trying to diet away is mainly skin. Still a bit of fat, but mainly ‘redundant skin’. I’m gutted to be honest, gutted that I can’t finish this on my own, and that I need to have surgery. (Richy6, thread 1)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The first extract highlights how this topic is not receiving sufficient coverage in the magazine, even though it is presented as a common problem. It would perhaps not serve the magazine’s aesthetic and commercial agenda to highlight this issue to readers; however, if it is something that is affecting the self-esteem of men who have lost weight then it is important that other men and healthcare practitioners are made aware of this. The second extract illustrates the loss of control and the resulting emotional fallout (‘gutted’) at the prospect of submitting to external intervention. The mediated promise that one is able to sculpt the body to a specified ideal has been broken, a phenomenon well documented for women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1363459312454149">Bordo, 1993</xref>), but now seemingly affecting men. Unlike in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1363459312454149">Watson’s (2000)</xref> sample, a repertoire of ‘experiential embodiment’ is denoted here, which entails how the body makes one feel – the ‘visceral embodiment’ characterized by the loose skin produces an ‘embodied emotionality’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1363459312454149">Robertson et al., 2010</xref>). In this instance the men cannot resolve the problem without medical intervention, a cause for regret since men have been found to prefer ‘doing’ emotion through action rather than ‘just’ expressing feelings (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1363459312454149">Robertson, 2006</xref>). The excess skin issue can also be regarded as an instance of ‘leaky embodiment’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1363459312454149">Longhurst, 2005</xref>) which challenges efforts after control and which, by extension, constrains masculine subjectivity in this context.</p>

<title>Fashioning a masculine image</title>
<p>There was quite a lot of talk generated on the forum about losing weight and getting fit and muscular which was linked to enhancing appearance. Some men expressed it as their original motivation for getting into shape, citing specific events like their wedding or a ‘lads’ holiday. Through training, men were able to target and monitor positive improvements in their appearance, and for the majority building strength and a muscular physique was emphasized as personally significant. This appearance orientation can be linked to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1363459312454149">Crawshaw’s (2007)</xref> notion of ‘aesthetic health’ whereby males are increasingly interpellated as bodily subjects obliged to maintain disciplined, healthy and attractive bodies. Many men also expressed particular interest in getting rid of their ‘bellies’, ‘man boobs’ and ‘saggy bits’ – again a concern with stemming ‘leaky’ embodiment. Others talked about their aesthetic goals in specifically aspirational ways, for example:<disp-quote>
<p>putting up a pic of what you want to look like works, I have one on my wardrobe door and I can see the improvements in my body rather than what weight I am as I wouldn’t lose any more weight as I tone up. (Greenz, thread 1)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In this extract the contributor is actively comparing his body against an aspirational body, which is justified in terms of results (it ‘works’). In terms of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1363459312454149">Watson’s (2000)</xref> schema, a repertoire of ‘normative embodiment’ is referenced, displaying a concern for how the body looks – a concern not much in evidence in his sample of male clinic users – but here regarded as a desired object or product linked to motivation and achievement. The idealization of the lean muscular torso has been linked to body image problems in men and the rise of body modification programmes incorporating dietary and exercise changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1363459312454149">Gill et al., 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Other users point to active monitoring of appearance as weight loss progresses:<disp-quote>
<p>I can see some changes in body shape, my delts are a separate entity again (shoulder balls), if I ‘flex’ I have noticeable biceps, my legs have some definition. The belly is cutting in and coming up. The visceral (hard belly fat, known to docs as heart attack fat) fat is noticeably decreased. The massive difference though is in my face. Starting to get a proper defined jaw line again. (Richy6, thread 1)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Richy6’s references to improvements in body definition (jawline, ‘delts’, ‘biceps’) centre on body parts associated with the chiselled and muscular male ideal advertised by the magazine. Recourse to technical weightlifter jargon also suggests an expert at work, someone who has insight into and control over their body project. Such accounts echo those from research on bodybuilding, where attention is also focused on acquiring an aesthetically pleasing body judged on muscular mass, symmetry and definition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1363459312454149">Roundtree, 2005</xref>), a body from which individual bodybuilders can experience much satisfaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1363459312454149">Monaghan, 2001</xref>). In the pursuit of manly bodies, the potentially feminizing orientation to appearance is recuperated as a legitimate masculine concern.</p>
<p>Clothing was another important issue for bodily esteem within the threads, with dropping a trouser size cited as an achievement worthy of celebration. Such talk echoes commercial discourse targeting women, including a high profile campaign linking consumption of a particular breakfast cereal with fitting into a lower dress size. For this man, for example, being able to buy clothes in ordinary high street shops (as opposed to specialist outlets attending to the ‘larger’ frame) was taken as a source of confidence and sign of success: ‘Just being able to buy stuff off the rack again in a “trendy” (I hate that word) clothes shop is an amazing feeling. Given me a much needed confidence boost at the moment’ (Richy6, thread 1). Here, potential accusations of vanity are managed by a renunciation of things ‘trendy’, recalling other research which suggests that although men often claim an ambivalent attitude towards clothing they do in fact use it strategically to work up their appearance in order to meet masculine ideals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1363459312454149">Frith and Gleeson, 2004</xref>).</p>

<title>Manly support: heroism and pragmatism</title>
<p>The responses posted in relation to reports from those who had transformed their bodies through weight loss, exercise and bodybuilding were invariably glowing with praise, with phrases such as ‘astounding work’, ‘fantastic job’ and ‘that is PROPER determination’ showing an appreciation of the work ethic required. Many such comments were littered with sporting or military references, such as ‘you deserve a medal’ or ‘I salute you’, lending the commendations a masculine complexion. In general, conventionally masculine notions of self-reliance, work orientation and achievement focus are invoked in the process of exalting the body transformations indicated by fellow contributors:<disp-quote>
<p>thanks for giving me the realisation that if you truly want something, there is no quick fix, no shortcuts. It’s just down to you and you alone and that if you are prepared to work hard enough then anything is achievable. (Kingofthehill, thread 1)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In matters pertaining to the body, it is (paradoxically) the rational male mind which is privileged as the source of change through effort, logic and goal setting (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1363459312454149">Gough, 2009</xref>). Asking for help (e.g. from partners) is not considered since, as noted above, autonomy and self-discipline are traditionally prized by men, while appearing vulnerable is taboo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1363459312454149">Courtenay, 2000</xref>). Despite other research suggesting that heterosexual men are inclined to hand over responsibility for dietary matters to their partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1363459312454149">De Souza and Ciclitria, 2005</xref>), within the forum partners were rarely mentioned, and when they were it was not in the context of them being a motivating factor. It may be that this particular group of men are using the material from the magazine and website to ‘go it alone’, and in the homosocial forum context any role actually played by partners may well be downgraded.</p>
<p>Overcoming physical barriers such as work-induced fatigue is clearly regarded as important, and this theme extended to men feeling unwell: ‘Do your best today at the gym. Forget about the passing flu. Half of its in your mind, just tell yourself to get a grip and boss it!!!!! Remember where you want to be for xmas’ (Woodie, thread 1). Here, the advice dispensed reinforces the masculinized idea that illness can be viewed as psychological weakness and is therefore to be dismissed. Mental fortitude is again underlined, as is imposing control over one’s body and progressing towards defined goals. Bodily discomfort and signs of sickness are discounted, construed as minor and possibly imagined obstacles to exercise and weight loss which can easily be transcended. Such minimization of pain and discomfort is also encountered in a range of male-dominated sporting situations (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1363459312454149">Thorpe, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>In some cases, however, men did elaborate upon emotions experienced at points in their weight loss journey – stories which occasionally prompted softer statements of support from other men:<disp-quote>
<p>I’m still not brave enough to go back to the really old pictures! My sister was desperate to show me them last night to prove how well I’d done. But to be honest, the thought scares me, and I’m not lacking motivation at the moment. Those pictures have such an effect on me. I get angry, I have cried looking at them. So it would be a whole load of heartache for not much gain at all really. (Richy6, thread 1)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Such reference to feminized emotional phenomena such as ‘crying’ and ‘heartache’ and being ‘scared’ recalls <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1363459312454149">Watson’s (2000)</xref> experiential embodiment category and was unusual in the forum context. Perhaps the anonymity occasioned by this medium encourages some men to step out of a restricted masculine register, although even in this example there is still some recourse to more traditional ‘manly’ concepts such as bravery, anger and pragmatism (reviewing the old photographs is deemed counterproductive). In response to the few instances of such emotional discourse, other contributors produced supportive but concise replies, ranging from the empathetic (‘I understand what your saying mate’) to the privileging of manly pride over emotional pain (‘sod the heartbreak man you should be proud of what you are doing’). This second reply was more typical, highlighting discomfort with and dismissal of feminized emotions, vividly illustrated in this next extract:<disp-quote>
<p>The reason that people believe you could be inspirational as there are a lot of guys out there that have punished their bodies so much to extent where you were: And are at rock bottom in weight and confidence, a lad who sees this post and reads it through to the end will be sat there thinking God if this guy can do it then so can I!!!! You are inspiring people like others on here that by saying and showing (in the words of Rhys). Loosing weight is not hard stop moaning and get to it. I think you need to read back this post my friend and see how far you have come. Any way enough of this girly stuff … (Woodie, thread 1)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This post is interesting since support is offered while reaffirming a masculine way of dealing with weight problems. Being emotional is here constructed as a risk to other overweight men, who may be deterred by ‘moaning’, with the target of the message positioned as a role model. Emotional language is implicitly critiqued as self-centred, neglecting the potential impact on other vulnerable men, and then ultimately and explicitly decried as excessive and feminine (‘enough of this girly stuff’). By contrast, action and achievement are elevated (‘this guy can do it’; ‘get to it’) and viewed as ‘inspirational’. The focus is certainly on problem- and action-orientated coping.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our analysis suggests that online discussions between men concerning bodily transformation are informed by particular notions of hegemonic masculinity. Weight loss per se was associated with caricatured, feminized diets and rejected in favour of plans and programmes emphasizing nutrition, exercise and muscle development. These themes clearly echo the magazine content to which the online discussion forum is attached (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1363459312454149">Labre, 2005</xref>). In this context the flabby, overweight body, including the worked-on body which yielded residual loose skin, was constructed as a deviation from the lean-but-muscular magazine ideal, and as such in need of transformation via goal-setting, work and sacrifice. Homosocial support was evidently appreciated by men on the forum, although sympathy and encouragement was often accomplished in a low-key way, and most forum users did not dwell on emotional issues, preferring instead to talk in practical and often rather technical terms about personal exercise and nutrition plans.</p>
<p>It was interesting that contributors emphasized a bodily aesthetic, or normative embodiment in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1363459312454149">Watson’s (2000)</xref> terms. Indeed, there was little in the way of pragmatic embodiment talk as discussions focused on achieving a desirable body size and shape per se without reference to the body’s improved functionality. The emphasis on looking good is reinforced in those accounts where loose skin is problematized, and can be connected to the magazine aesthetic which idealizes lean and muscular physiques and eschews ‘leaky’, ‘obese’ or otherwise imperfect bodies (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1363459312454149">Longhurst, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1363459312454149">Monagahan, 2007</xref>). Arguably such magazine-generated norms form part of a wider contemporary cultural push towards visible and regulated male bodies which increasingly impinge upon modern masculine subjectivities (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1363459312454149">Bordo, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1363459312454149">Gill et al., 2005</xref>). In caring for and attempting to control and fashion excessive leaky bodies, our contributors take up positions as neo-liberal moral subjects who engender current discourses around ‘aesthetic health’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1363459312454149">Crawshaw, 2007</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1363459312454149">Bordo (1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1363459312454149">1999</xref>) suggests both men and women are increasingly required to monitor and shape their bodies towards a slender, tight ideal though discourses and strategies applied are differently gendered (e.g. feminized emphasis on weight loss versus masculinized focus on muscularity, themes which punctuated our data). Living up to the idealized images on offer is difficult, however, and the prospect of failure and disappointment is ever-present, as highlighted by the struggles around motivation, loose skin and falling short in our data, and rates of psychologized bodily disorders in both men and women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1363459312454149">Bordo, 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1363459312454149">1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1363459312454149">Grogan, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1363459312454149">Pope et al., 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Also evident were examples of Watson’s ‘experiential embodiment’, whereby feelings connected to body projects were shared in the forum. As noted, however, despite the deployment of emotion categories these were often framed delicately and received with caution and critique. In the context of magazine-informed masculinities, there is perhaps little room for developing a discourse of male vulnerability and extended support, whereas in other health and illness contexts men may well feel more inclined to use an experiential repertoire, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1363459312454149">Robertson et al.’s (2010)</xref> work on embodied emotionality suggests. Perhaps our contributors would expand their body talk when in conversation with female partners, for example, away from the constraints which operate in homosocial, magazine-influenced environments. As we have argued elsewhere (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1363459312454149">Gough, 2009</xref>), ‘masculinity’ can be usefully regarded as a multi-faceted, flexible resource whereby certain features can be hegemonic in one context but not in others. Being lean and muscular clearly embodies cultural capital in gym environments but not necessarily in office-based situations, while being large rather than lean/muscular can carry prestige in particular settings such as bear communities, hip-hop clubs and certain sporting contexts (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1363459312454149">Monagahan, 2005</xref>). Of course, there are limits to the extent to which hegemonic masculinities can be freely chosen or discarded, and in relation to our current focus embodiment represents an obvious constraint/resource. We have seen that certain aspects elude control (e.g. flabby skin), and other researchers have pointed to other problematized bodily aspects, including <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1363459312454149">Longhurst’s (2005)</xref> work on breasted men. It would be interesting to explore further how men experiencing excess skin problems construct and negotiate masculine subjectivity.</p>
<p>In reflecting on the study the particular online magazine context where the men discussed their efforts at body transformation should be borne in mind. Not all men read male-targeted magazines or endorse associated norms of muscularity, fitness and sexual performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1363459312454149">Labre, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1363459312454149">Stibbe, 2004</xref>). It would therefore be interesting to study how other overweight men in other forums, both online and offline, construct and manage their body projects, and to pay closer attention to factors such as age, social class and relationship status to help determine variation between groups of men. It would be important to explore further how partners and families may have influenced these men’s body projects, as previous research has shown that, for example, heterosexual men in weight loss groups are often accompanied and supported by their partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1363459312454149">De Souza and Ciclitira, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1363459312454149">Monaghan, 2007</xref>). Interviews with women, couples and other family members would provide further insight into the wider relationship and familial contexts which inform men’s weight management efforts.</p>
<p>One of the main roles the forum fulfilled was providing men with information on other men they could emulate who had been in a similar situation as they had regarding their weight. Although the ethic of being self-reliant was admired within the forum it appeared that the forum users did value having dialogue with men like themselves. The literature is mixed regarding whether men prefer individual or group weight loss interventions and how this can be achieved (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1363459312454149">Bye et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1363459312454149">Gray et al., 2009</xref>). We suggest that the forum provides a middle ground whereby men are able to post anonymously and are under no pressure to talk about issues with which they do not feel comfortable while still benefiting from social support. Despite the careful management of emotion-talk, the forum clearly provided a safe space for men to give accounts of their body projects and such web discussions could be included as a valuable element of targeted weight control interventions for men.</p>
