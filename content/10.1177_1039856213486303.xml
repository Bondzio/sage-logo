<body>
<p>Although anorexia nervosa (AN) is a serious psychiatric disorder with a high morbidity and mortality,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1039856213486303">1</xref></sup> numerous reviews have commented on the paucity of evidence to inform treatment approaches<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1039856213486303">2</xref></sup> or indeed treatment setting.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1039856213486303">3</xref></sup> For adolescents with a relatively short duration of illness, family-based treatment is developing a robust evidence-base in terms of full and partial remission at six and 12 months.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1039856213486303">4</xref></sup> In adults, those adolescents or families who cannot engage in family-based treatment and those adolescents with a longer duration of illness the evidence-base is much less clear. Clinicians are thus guided by what little can be gleaned from the evidence-base for treatment of AN in adults and by their clinical experience. In essence, this translates to a focus on improving nutritional status, weight and health and a good quality psychotherapy supportive of the patient and their carers that has components of psychoeducation, distress tolerance and the identification and resolution of important maintaining factors which make AN ‘valued’ to the individual.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1039856213486303">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Until 2010, the North East (NE) region of Melbourne, Australia, which has a population of approximately 1.5 million, had been served by a longstanding five-bed inpatient Eating Disorder Unit. However, consistent feedback through the unit’s consumer and carer advisory group, and from Eating Disorder Victoria (a lead non-government organization providing support, information and advocacy) was that people with eating disorders and their families found it extremely difficult to access any form of specialist outpatient care. Even when GPs or other health service providers recognized the presence of an eating disorder and attempted to refer elsewhere, they often could not access secondary or tertiary specialists with interest and expertise in managing eating disorders. This led to a sense of hopelessness, loss of motivation and frustration amongst affected people. Indeed, only 29 patients were admitted to the five inpatient beds in 2009. In a previous paper, we have argued that there is a clear need to develop a rational continuum of care between community and specialist inpatient eating disorder beds, in order to ensure that the needs of the community for specialist eating disorder, assessment and treatment are better met.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1039856213486303">6</xref></sup> During 2009–2010, a treatment model for the Body Image, Eating Disorders Treatment and Recovery Service (BETRS) was initiated and time-limited funding for 18 months was obtained from the Victorian state government to demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach. This paper reports on the development of the BETRS and its initial 18-month evaluation.</p>
<sec id="section5-1039856213486303" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>As part of the development of BETRS, a review of the literature was undertaken around the evidence-base for adult AN treatment interventions and treatment settings.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1039856213486303">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1039856213486303">7</xref></sup> Consultations occurred with local stakeholders, including Area and Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services, General Practice organizations, consumer and carers and non-government organizations.</p>
<p>The service was developed with the intention to facilitate access and entry, treatment provision and linkage into the community. Funding allowed for a total clinical equivalent full time (EFT) of 4.2 EFT across medical, nursing, dietetic, psychology, social work and occupational therapist. This small EFT led to a number of compromises in the continuum of treatments and clinical services that could be provided.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1039856213486303">
<title>Objectives of BETRS</title>
<p>The BETRS objectives over the 18 month evaluation period were to:</p>
<list id="list1-1039856213486303" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Provide excellent specialist evidence based eating disorders care, delivered in the most clinically effective setting;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Provide services that are accessible, acceptable, cost-effective and affordable;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Develop, maintain and maximize partnerships with private and public care providers to deliver a continuum of care for eating disorders.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The following clinical services were developed as the foundation of BETRS.</p>
<sec id="section7-1039856213486303">
<title>Intake</title>
<p>Anyone contacting the service was provided with helpful advice regarding appropriate next steps for them. Generally, this involved multiple contacts with the patient, their family or referring agency to establish what the concerns were and what would be the best way to approach them. An accepting, problem-solving approach was set as the culture of intake to ensure that BETRS was accessible to all people (clinical and non-clinical) who contacted the service. The only limitations to progressing access to this regional, novel service were that the patient reside in the North East region of Victoria and that they were 16 years or over and developmentally appropriate for an adult service.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1039856213486303">
<title>Assessment and treatment planning</title>
<p>Assessment and treatment planning took place over a maximum of four sessions and required a medical referral. This was followed by completion of diagnostic assessment, involvement of carers, motivational assessment, collaborative treatment planning, linkage, and communication with the referrer and the most appropriate, ongoing service providers within or external to BETRS.</p>
<p>The outcome from this process was a jointly developed and shared conceptualization of the patient’s predicament, a thorough diagnostic statement and identification of the motivational status of the patient. An identification of the modifiable and non-modifiable needs of the patient and the goals of treatment, and an articulation of how those treatment goals would be best met, were achieved by either liaison and linkage of the patient to other community clinicians known to the BETRS team to be skilled in the management of people with eating disorders, or entry into the Specialist Treatment arm of the BETRS service.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1039856213486303">
<title>Specialist treatment within BETRS</title>
<p>The approach of the BETRS service at all times was to engage with the patient and family in a mutually respectful and collaborative alliance. All staff were trained in Socratic questioning and motivational interviewing techniques. See <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1039856213486303">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<title>Measures</title>
<p>At intake, a standardized clinical interview was administered to participants in conjunction with the Mini Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1039856213486303">8</xref></sup> to diagnose the presence of comorbid psychiatric conditions. Patients also completed a battery of self-report measures comprising the Eating Attitudes Test – 26 (EAT-26),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1039856213486303">9</xref></sup> Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale – 21 (DASS-21),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1039856213486303">10</xref></sup> Brief Disability Questionnaire (BDQ),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1039856213486303">11</xref></sup> Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire – Short Form (QLESQ-SF),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1039856213486303">12</xref></sup> and University of Rhode Island Change Assessment (URICA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1039856213486303">13</xref></sup> scale.</p>
<p>The EAT-26<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1039856213486303">9</xref></sup> questionnaire comprises three subscales: Dieting, Bulimia and Food Preoccupation, and Oral Control. The EAT-26 has shown to be a reliable and valid measure of general eating disorder symptoms.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1039856213486303">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>The DASS-21<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1039856213486303">10</xref></sup> is a 21-item, self-report measure that comprises three seven-item subscales: Depression, Anxiety, and Stress. The DASS-21 has been shown to be a reliable and valid measure of depression and anxiety symptoms in clinical populations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1039856213486303">15</xref></sup> and as a routine clinical outcome measure in inpatient settings.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1039856213486303">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>The BDQ<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1039856213486303">11</xref></sup> is an 11-item, self-report questionnaire that assesses functional disability in daily activities in social, occupational, and general functioning domains.

<p>The QLES-Q-SF<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1039856213486303">12</xref></sup> is a reliable and valid self-report measure composed of 14 items that assess quality of life across multiple domains, including physical health, mood, work, household activities, social relationships, family relationships, leisure time activities, ability to function in daily life, sexual drive and interest, economic standard, living situation, ability to get around physically, vision, and an overall sense of well-being to produce an overall quality of life score.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1039856213486303">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>The URICA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1039856213486303">13</xref></sup> scale is a 32-item, self-report questionnaire that assesses readiness to change across a broad range of problems.

<sec id="section11-1039856213486303">
<title>Data analyses</title>
<p>Stata 12.1 (StataCorp, College Station, Texas) was used to analyse the data. A series of dependent sample <italic>t</italic>-tests were used to compare baseline and follow-up scores. The data were screened for test assumptions, which indicated that all variables approximated a normal distribution. An alpha value of 0.05 was used to determine statistical significance.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Between December 2010 and July 2012, 208 patients accessed BETRS. Of these patients, 188 (90.4%) were female. While the patients ranged in age from 17 to 76 years (<italic>M</italic> = 26.91, SD = 9.65), over half (59.6%) were under 25 years of age.</p>
<p>As there were 11 unplanned patient discharges, the following data report on the remaining 197 patients for whom baseline assessments were completed.</p>
<p>In relation to World Health Organization (WHO) body mass index (BMI) classification, 52 (28.1%) were severely underweight (BMI = &lt; 16.0), 56 (30.3%) were underweight (BMI = 16.0 to 18.5), 64 (34.6%) were normal weight (BMI = 18.5 to 24.9), 11 (6.0%) were overweight (BMI = 25.0 to 29.9) and two (1.1%) were obese class I (BMI = 30.0 to 34.9). BMI data were missing for 12 patients. The BMI at assessment ranged from 11.5 to 33.8 (<italic>M</italic> = 18.46, SD = 3.85).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1039856213486303">Table 2</xref> shows that the most common DSM-IV-TR diagnosis at assessment was AN, followed by eating disorder not otherwise specified (EDNOS), bulimia nervosa, and body dysmorphic disorder. The comorbid psychiatric diagnoses are also presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1039856213486303">Table 2</xref>, which shows that depressive episode was the most common comorbid condition.

<title>Day patient programme (DPP) evaluation</title>
<p>There were 43 (91.5%) female and four (8.5%) male patients who attended the DPP over the 18-month period. The patients ranged in age from 18 to 51 years (<italic>M</italic> = 23.32, SD = 6.92), and 80.6% were aged 25 years or younger. In relation to DSM-IV-TR diagnoses, 36 (76.6%) patients had AN, six (12.8%) had bulimia nervosa and five (10.6%) had an EDNOS. A total of 43 patients were discharged from the DPP. Their length of stay in the DPP ranged from 0 to 59 weeks (<italic>M</italic> = 10.07, SD = 11.61), while about two-thirds (65%) of patients stayed in the DPP for 10 weeks or less.</p>
<p>The BMI on discharge or most recent monthly weighing (<italic>M</italic> = 18.15, SD = 2.50) was significantly higher than the BMI on entry to the DPP (<italic>M</italic> = 17.01, SD = 1.97), <italic>t</italic>(45) = 4.42, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001. Patients gained an average of 3.28 (SD = 5.11) kg, which equated to a mean BMI increase of 1.14 (SD = 1.38).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Developing BETRS has led to a number of important improvements to the provision of eating disorders services in the region, which were previously confined to inpatient care and a fragmented interface between the primary care and specialist sectors.</p>
<p>Over half of the patients diagnosed with a DSM-IV TR eating disorder suffered with AN, and approximately a quarter each with bulimia nervosa and EDNOS. More than half of the patients were significantly underweight, with almost 30% severely so. The majority were women and aged 25 years or less. Comorbidity, with an average in excess of two Axis I diagnoses per patient, particularly depressive and anxiety disorders, was the norm rather than the exception. Whilst the 12-month follow-up data are limited by attrition and with 28.9% not consenting to the one year follow-up, the majority of people assessed were transitioned from BETRS in less than 12 months. This indicates that a significant and markedly ill group of eating disorders patients are being retained in community-focused care with significant improvement in psychopathology and functioning.</p>
<p>Clearly attendance at either the BETRS DPP or the overall therapeutic programme has led to demonstrable, clinically significant improvements in eating disorder pathology, quality of life, disability measures and mood symptoms. At the same time, patients have, where required, also improved their weight and BMI, which are important proxies for physical health. Perhaps more importantly, the front end of BETRS has led to a flood of referrals from people with eating disorders and their families who previously were unable to access specialist eating disorders assessment and ongoing treatment.</p>
<p>Feedback from Eating Disorders Victoria included the following:
<disp-quote>
<p>‘Since its inception in 2010 BETRS has made a huge contribution to treatment delivery with its innovative approach to eating disorders. Offering a very comprehensive assessment, experienced multidisciplinary team, the programme is able to meet the individual’s needs in their treatment. Until the establishment of BETRS treatment programmes were traditionally a one size fits all approach. BETRS has recognized that this approach has its limitations and has been innovative enough to look at different approach to the treatment of eating disorders. BETRS looks at the individual not just at the illness.’</p>
<p>‘This innovative approach has also included support and guidance for families of clients. This holistic approach is a breath of fresh air for those of us who have been touched by eating disorders.’</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This kind of feedback, as well as that received directly from families, has assisted BETRS in identifying the importance to the community of ensuring, for this serious but relatively low prevalence set of disorders, that people are assisted in accessing skilled experienced eating disorder clinicians in both public and private practice.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The development of BETRS has markedly improved access to specialist eating disorder services. It has led to a demonstrable improvement in the health and well being of people with eating disorders in NE Victoria.</p>
