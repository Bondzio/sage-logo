<abstract>
<p>In recent years, millions of U.S. jobs have been outsourced to other countries with very low-wage rates. Moreover, a recent study noted that 40 percent of the jobs that remain in America are low-income jobs. This trend is not going away, and in fact is spreading. Even nations like China and India are beginning to find outsourcing profitable. As robots and computer systems become capable of more and more complex tasks, that once provided satisfying and well-paying jobs to humans, new approaches must be found to preserve the middle class as we know it in America. Although no complete solution appears feasible, this article offers suggestions for actions that government and businesses can take that may help mitigate the effects of outsourcing and slow the replacement of humans by machines in the white-collar workforce.</p>

<body>
<p>On September 7, 2012, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that as of the end of August 2012, there were 12.5 million unemployed persons looking for work resulting in an unemployment rate of 8.1 percent. This contrasts with a long-term unemployment average of 5.79 percent. Of these 12.5 million unemployed, 5 million (40%) had been unemployed for longer than twenty-seven weeks. The U.S. unemployment rate has remained above 8 percent for forty-three straight months. There were approximately 142,101,000 in the U.S. workforce at the end of July 2012.</p>
<p>Further compounding this gloomy situation are a large number of what are sometimes labeled as the “forgotten unemployed”—those unemployed for over a year. According to this same report, there were 2.6 million persons in this category, 844,000 of whom were classified as “discouraged.” This means they no longer searched for work because they felt there were no jobs available for them. In addition, there were 8 million who were underemployed—part-time for economic reasons. “These individuals were working part-time because their hours had been cut back or because they were unable to find a full-time job.” When you add the 12.5 million who are unemployed, together with the 2.6 million forgotten unemployed, and the 8 million underemployed, you arrive at a total of 23.1 million people.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the unemployment problem affects various education and ethnic groups disproportionately. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, in 2011, high school dropouts suffered the highest rate of unemployment at 14.1 percent, with high school graduates having an unemployment rate of 9.4 percent, associate degree holders a rate of 6.8 percent, and bachelor’s degree holders at 4.9 percent. The message is clear, the more education you have, the less likely you are to be unemployed. These numbers help explain why we have three million jobs that go unfilled in a time of high unemployment. Too many are undereducated and in many cases, even those who are educated have skill sets that don’t match the available jobs.</p>
<p>With respect to ethnicity, the aforementioned unemployment report for September 7, 2012, noted the following seasonally adjusted unemployment rates among major worker groups: adult men (7.6%), adult women (7.5%), teenagers (24.6%), African Americans (14.1%), Asians (5.9%, not seasonally adjusted), Hispanics (10.2%), and whites (7.2%). We also know that African Americans and Hispanics have higher educational dropout rates than whites. While in the past, most of these less educated could find jobs. Unfortunately, what is happening now is that the jobs that the less educated, especially men, have held are disappearing and this situation is only expected to get worse in the future (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1946756712473437">Ansberry 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1946756712473437">Coy 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1946756712473437">Dorning 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Now you have discovered that the unemployment situation is not just gloomy, it is dismal. And not surprisingly, dismal also describes what is happening to the U.S. middle-class economic situation because, as reported by Mike Dorning of <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://Bloomberg.com">Bloomberg.com</ext-link>, 95 percent of the jobs lost in the great recession were middle-class jobs.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1946756712473437">1</xref></sup> In addition, researchers Sherle R. Schwenninger and Samuel Sherraden in the New American Foundation report, “The American Middle Class Under Stress” noted that in 1980, 30 percent of the jobs in the United States were low-income jobs, but in 2011, 40 percent of the jobs in the United States were low-income jobs. Finally, jobs for men were especially hard hit in the recession with construction and manufacturing, male-dominated jobs, losing more than four million jobs combined.</p>
<p>So how did we get in this mess?</p>
<sec id="section1-1946756712473437">
<title>Why Have So Many Jobs Disappeared from the United States?</title>
<p>Most people recognize that millions of U.S. jobs have been outsourced to China, other parts of Asia, and to other countries with very low-wage rates. Most people also realize that with the immigration of extremely low-cost labor from Mexico, many jobs in the United States have until recently gone to noncitizens or those who recently became citizens but will work for very low wages. But the disappearance of jobs from the United States is much more complex than just the outsourcing of jobs and a porous immigration program. A simplified version of the scenario that has transpired goes something like this.</p>
<p>The opportunities for business growth were perceived by business leaders in the past fifteen years or so as being best in the emerging markets of countries such as China, India, and Brazil, and not in already developed markets such as those of the United States and most of Europe. To be competitive in any business environment, firms from all countries need to be efficient and turn out high-quality products. Efficiency is about reducing the cost of producing goods and services. So to be efficient, many U.S. and European firms did indeed begin outsourcing jobs to low-wage-rate countries. But just as critically, for U.S. labor to be cost competitive, a combination of two actions had to occur. Either wages had to go down, and/or robots and computerized management systems—which include artificial intelligence (AI) technologies—had to replace humans in the manufacturing and service processes. The U.S. auto industry is a perfect example of an industry in which both of these actions transpired. Companies downsized, union contract wages and benefits were renegotiated downward, and many jobs previously held by humans were filled by robots and sophisticated computer management systems. <italic>The bottom line is that once U.S. firms chose to actively pursue global strategies, U.S. labor had to become competitive with labor across the globe, not just in skills, but in the willingness to work for less. But one way to maintain higher wages for those who are employed is to employ fewer humans and employ more robots and sophisticated computer systems</italic>.</p>
<p>Robots generally produce higher quality goods than humans do on average and for less cost. They don’t require health care and other benefits, they don’t require social security contributions, they don’t unionize, and they work for a lot less than humans. Sophisticated computerized management systems have these same cost saving benefits and also assist in reducing costs and increasing quality in the overall production process. And robots and sophisticated computerized management systems are now making similar inroads in service industries. So both efficiency and higher quality are becoming increasingly easy to achieve through the use of robots and sophisticated computer systems, thus reducing the need for human employees.</p>
<p>Think about your own experiences for a minute. When you use your phone to call your insurance company, an airline, a manufacturer, FedEx or UPS, or even your doctor’s office, your first contact is almost certainly with a robotic answering system that can ask you questions, interpret your answers, and send you on your way. Sometimes this robot, usually speaking with a pleasant feminine voice, will even refer you to a human being, but just as often it seems, she will refer you to another robot. In the beginning, such devices were often nonfunctional and annoying to the customer. Now they are efficient, effective, and usually quite acceptable substitutes for people, even though quite irritating on occasion. How many phone answering jobs do you think have been lost to such devices—millions to be sure.</p>
<p>And when you drive your car to work or to the grocery store, or when you take your kids to school, one of the primary reasons your automobile functions flawlessly most of the time is that it was primarily built by robots, which in turn were controlled by sophisticated computer programs to make them even more effective and efficient. Virtually every manufactured product is built that way today. Products cost less, last longer, and don’t break down like they used to. But again, millions of jobs have been lost to robots and related technologies. Admittedly, many of these kinds of work may be so-called drudge jobs. But if you have one, they still help you pay the bills. If you don’t have one, who takes care of you? The government, which ultimately means the taxpayers?</p>
<p>It seems doubtful that there will ever be a utopia in which robots do all the work and government provides us humans with everything we need for free. But if jobs disappear, as they most certainly have and will continue to do, how are people going to feed themselves? The people most at risk to lose their jobs are the ones least likely to be capable of performing the new jobs that technology is creating.</p>
<p>People in my own profession, and other similar ones, used to do a great of clerical and research work by performing hand searches of hard copies. Or we might delegate these tasks to assistants to be handled in a similar fashion, or at least go to librarians for help. Technological progress has made people much more productive. But now I don’t need an assistant, a librarian, and so on. And services that are not needed disappear. Granted, I am personally more productive, but at the expense of the people who once worked in the information field.</p>
<p>In the same way, I and my colleagues used to dictate some of our written work. Now some do it through Dragon Dictate or similar software. Those who used to receive dictation, now don’t. In our shop, twenty-three people were supported by one assistant, and three assistants would have been the norm twenty years earlier. But laptops, printers, and just recently speech recognition software have done away with the need for so many assistants. If you examine the use of smart phones and tablets across businesses, you find a tremendous number of software packages that are eliminating jobs. This is great for productivity but no so good for people looking for work.</p>
<p>When I and millions of others dictate letters, memos, or studies to an automatic writing system or query the web for information, how many millions of jobs have been or will be lost because no human is actually performing these tasks?</p>
<p>Yes, many new jobs have been created in computer, software, communication, manufacturing, and service businesses (especially in China) related to the production of robots and advanced computer technology systems. But also recognize that in many cases, robots are building the robots. A trade-off occurred in the 1990s and the first decade of this century when higher paying manufacturing jobs were replaced by lower paying service and retail positions. But now these jobs too are being replaced by robots and sophisticated computer systems. On balance, the number of new jobs created come nowhere close to being as many as have been lost to robots and sophisticated computerized production and service technologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1946756712473437">Author and Dorn 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1946756712473437">Brynjolfsson and McAfee 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1946756712473437">Talbot 2012</xref>). And therein lays the crux of the problem.</p>
<p>So what does the future hold with respect to jobs for members of the U.S. human workforce?</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1946756712473437">
<title>Impacts from the Global Economy and Related Requirements for Efficiency and Quality</title>
<p>These three issues are so intertwined that the exact impact on jobs within each segment of the overall job problem is difficult to identify. This is because, to achieve the efficiency and high levels of quality required to be globally competitive, most manufacturing companies across the board are using more robots and sophisticated computer systems than they have in the past. Service firms are following suit. In essence, increased efficiency and quality are achieved through technological advances. Humans can also work harder and longer, but the end result is the same. Jobs for humans are being decreased.</p>
<p>There is an economic mantra based on extensive research of historical economic progress that indicates that increased productivity is the key to advancing the quality of economic life in a society. And while that has historically been proven to be true, the economics of both manufacturing and service operations are changing such that millions of people are being left out of the mainstream economy. Those who remain survive, and some prosper. Those left out of the mainstream economy barely survive through government and family resources. And government resources are going to become scarcer as the United States faces up to its huge deficits and increasingly tight budgets.</p>
<p>Historically, the view that new technologies open up as many or more new jobs than are lost as the old technologies vanish has been true, but we haven’t ever seen the sweeping replacement of jobs that we are seeing now. And while education helps, there are not going to be enough jobs for many people who are undereducated or in many cases, simply under motivated. True, the industrial revolution produced sweeping changes, but today’s situation is different. Having more college trained people only works if these people are trained in the exact skill sets needed.</p>
<p>The same forces that caused U.S. firms to outsource to China and other low-wage-rate countries will continue to exist. But depending on the type of work, outsourcing is going to occur not just to China but increasingly to countries such as Vietnam, the Philippines, and Malaysia. Increased foreign wages have returned and will continue to return some jobs to the United States. It is important to note that outsourcing is not just affecting the United States, Canada, and Western European countries, but European and Asian countries as well—even China. Compared with numerous other developing Asian countries, China’s wage rates have now risen substantially, especially in coastal areas. This has caused many Chinese firms to move production inland where wage rates are cheaper, and to other Asian countries that have cheaper wage rates. Nor is China immune to the robotization of work. Much of the manufacturing that goes on in China is highly automated. But the future promises even more robots in that country. Terry Gou, Chairman of Taiwan’s Foxconn, assemblers of Apple’s iPods and iPads in China, has indicated that the company planned to use 1 million robots within three years, up from about 10,000 robots in use 2011 and it expected to be using 300,000 in 2012. This leap in robot usage resulted from increased wages in China.</p>
<sec id="section3-1946756712473437">
<title>Millions More Jobs Will Be Lost</title>
<p>The impact of the globalization of business will accelerate the use of robots and sophisticated computer technologies in all types of businesses. How many million jobs might be at stake in the next twenty years? In the United States, this number could easily be between three and five million. Globally, as many as a billion jobs could be lost depending on the speed of modernization of commerce in Asia, South America, and Africa.</p>
<p>While some readers may find this estimate high, I offer it for two major reasons:</p>
<p>First, as previously noted two key components of global competition are efficiency and quality. Robots and sophisticated computer systems improve both. Manufacturing is undergoing and will continue to undergo dramatic shifts to totally computerized and robotized processes. Service industries are following suit.</p>
<p>Second, for the first time in history, robots and AI technologies that have been developed to perform numerous menial jobs will soon be at price points where they are economically competitive with low-wage workers, for example, janitors, window cleaners, nursing assistants, and various construction employees.</p>
<p>One should also recognize that it is not just frontline workers who have been affected by robots and sophisticated computer systems. The ranks of management have been significantly reduced across most U.S. firms. So while a high percentage of management positions has been lost to downsizing/rightsizing, various computerized systems and sophisticated computer technologies promise further significant reductions in the management ranks. As part of this continuing reduction in force, management may soon become what I have labeled “Management by Apps,” meaning that individual managers will use significantly more software-based applications to make management decisions than they do now. The next step in this computerization process could be to simply replace the manager altogether. The continuance of such reductions will not only eliminate jobs but will also reduce the upward mobility so vital to satisfying people’s needs for esteem and self-fulfillment.</p>
<p>So while economists tout increases in productivity as the primary way to raise the standard of living in any economy, as it turns out, increased productivity may ultimately destroy the standard of living. Economists need to develop new models for maintaining the standard of living other than increasing productivity. If professional economists do not create a new model of what an economy should be, who will?</p>

<title>The Fourth Singularity</title>
<p>Most people have heard of the term <italic>the Singularity</italic>. Many speak knowingly of it and its impacts. However, there is not just one singularity, but at least three different identifiable singularities that are currently discussed around the world. The first singularity is described as that point in time when computers/robots become as intelligent as people. Most experts point to some time around 2017 when this is expected to take place. If you think that will never happen, do not forget that IBM’s Watson soundly defeated human competitors on the TV quiz show “Jeopardy” in 2011. While the cost of Watson makes it impractical today for mass utilization, all of Watson’s capabilities should ultimately prove to be scalable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1946756712473437">Frier 2012</xref>). The second singularity is the point at which robots decide humans are no longer necessary and therefore seek to eliminate us. Movies such as <italic>I Robot, Blade Runner</italic>, and <italic>Terminator</italic>, and the TV series, <italic>Battlestar Galactica</italic>, have portrayed such themes. The <italic>Star Trek</italic> TV series posited a third type, the “quantum singularity,” defined as “a point or region in the space-time continuum where normal physical models do not apply and extraordinary amounts of gravitational force are typically present” (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.startrekfreedom.com/wiki/index.php/Quantum_Singularity">http://www.startrekfreedom.com/wiki/index.php/Quantum_Singularity</ext-link>).</p>
<p>But there is a Fourth Singularity more imminently threatening than any of those previously mentioned. And that is the point in time when, metaphorically speaking, robots eat your lunch. That is, they take your job. The following paragraphs identify some of the many jobs that are likely to be taken by robots/sophisticated computer systems in the next ten to fifteen years.</p>
<list id="list1-1946756712473437" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p><italic>Manufacturing jobs and three-dimensional (3D) printing</italic>: Hundreds of thousands of manufacturing jobs currently held by humans in the United States will eventually disappear as the result of 3D printing. 3D printing is currently limited mostly to smaller physical material items such as gears or parts for various products such as lamps. But the future theoretically holds for the printing of almost anything of any size. As the technology has grown, so have the size and complexity of printable objects.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Health care robots</italic>: Japanese companies have created relatively affordable health care robots able to perform many types of human-assist functions. For example, robots can now lift patients easily and comfortably. Other robots can assist patients as they learn to use new prosthetic limbs. Japanese robot technology is improving and the cost of these robots is coming down dramatically. Scalability and hence affordability are going to occur in the near future. As a result, many nurses’ aides and other professional service personnel in the health field will lose their jobs to robots.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Maintenance employees</italic>: Many of the duties performed by janitors may soon be performed by robots. Robotic floor cleaners are already being touted and when the bugs are finally worked out, hundreds of thousands could lose their jobs. These may not be the most desirable jobs around, but the humans who lose them lose not only a source of income but also source of self-respect.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Professors</italic>: According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, there are 1,756,000 college professors, approximately 175,000 of which are teaching assistants. As the cost of higher education rises even further, intense pressure will be brought to bear to reduce their numbers. Already thousands have disappeared in the great recession. And as a large number of professors retire in the next ten years, they will almost certainly not be replaced by humans, but by sophisticated computer programs and robotic devices. Mass TV lectures, simulcasts, podcasts, online courses, apps, and other as yet unforeseen technological education enhancements could well eliminate a third of these jobs in the next ten to fifteen years. Once the most vital functions of critical and creative thinking and problem solving are programmed into robots and/or sophisticated computer systems, more and more professors will be replaced. This is especially true in subject areas such as history and mathematics where content mastery often involves rote memorization more than creative problem solving. Clearly technological innovations will enhance access to higher education; but the sad truth is that we do not need simply “more college graduates” but “more graduates with degrees in the right fields.” We could actually get by with fewer if those we have were trained in the right areas.</p></list-item></list>
<list id="list2-1946756712473437" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Primary and secondary school teachers</italic>: According to the Center for Education, in 2010, there were 3,823,142 teachers in public, charter, private, and Catholic elementary and secondary schools. For the same kinds of reasons that professors will soon be disappearing in massive numbers, schoolteachers will too. Preparing a large portion of U.S. high school graduates to be globally competitive and/or to be prepared to go to college or trade school is an increasingly difficult task. According to an August 15, 2012, <italic>The Wall Street Journal</italic> article by Juan Williams, likely role models for education in the future are schools such as those in Moorseville, North Carolina. This school district ranks 100th out of 115 North Carolina school districts in per pupil spending, but in the past ten years has raised its test scores from the middle of the pack to a tie for second place. The school has far fewer teachers than it used to but every student from third grade through high school has a laptop computer. All textbooks, learning materials, assignments, and notes are computerized. Every aspect of student performance is recorded and analyzed, with recommendations for improvement offered, along with the provision of additional learning materials and exercises. There could be a million job casualties in the next ten years in elementary and high school teaching alone.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Domestic workers</italic>: For the first time ever, domestic robots may soon reach a price point to make them readily affordable to a large number of consumers. In the home, robots that clean, cook, sew, and so on are just around the corner, or at least just down the next street.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Truck and taxi drivers</italic>: Google is developing a driverless car. When that becomes feasible, it will change the whole nature of the driving experience. But this does not bode well for truck and taxi drivers. Not all truck drivers would be replaced, of course, because somebody still has to do the loading and unloading of the trucks. Oh wait; robots can do that job as well. And don’t forget taxi drivers. They could disappear also.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Librarians</italic>: Google has developed its own online library system eliminating the need for thousands of librarians. Think about your own neighborhood or school library. Hugo, Minnesota, a suburb of St. Paul already has branches with no librarians. You order books online and pick them up a few days later from what amounts to a sort of ATM machine for books. And at a new library at the University of Chicago, a robot searches for your books, not a person. These systems are in part the same kind of robotic inventory system used by major online or mail order retail chains. A computerized information kiosk can also provide important information that research librarians might normally provide.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Rental car agents</italic>: Hertz and others are already using kiosks to deliver the keys to your car to you. As a result, thousands of agents have lost, or will soon lose their jobs.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Other jobs under threat</italic>: In addition to the above, robots already either in production or being designed may very well eliminate many if not most: waiters and waitresses, information agents, retail clerks, and many types of soldiers. Even doctors and chefs are not immune to having many of their functions robotized or their skills become the subject of sophisticated computer systems. Currently, the da Vinci Surgical System assists doctors in many types of surgery.</p></list-item></list>
<p>In summary, we are rapidly approaching a jobless future for millions of human beings in the United States and perhaps a billion or more in other places around the globe.</p>

<sec id="section5-1946756712473437">
<title>The False Hope of Future Industries</title>
<p>Numerous experts have predicted a new era of economic bounty created by emerging industries. Typical of such predictions are those from Mark P. Mills and Julio M. Otinno appearing in the January 30, 2012 edition of <italic>The Wall Street Journal</italic>. They forecast that three key grand technological transformations are occurring: big data, smart manufacturing, and the wireless revolution. As a result, they suggest that our economy will soon undergo tectonic shifts. Big data allow for much more rigorous analysis of the business situation, making managing businesses easier and better, and opening up huge new markets. Social media (tailored to business) will enable businesses to be more effective and more efficient. Smart manufacturing will make manufacturing more effective and efficient. New materials such as grapheme and the process of 3D printing are two of the highlights of this transformation. The wireless revolution will provide unbounded opportunities to communicate with customers, employees, teams, and everyone else on the planet.</p>
<p>The upshot of these predictions coming true is that everything will change from manufacturing to marketing, from products to processes, generating unprecedented new opportunities for business. Mills and Otinno go on to cite several reasons why the United States is positioned to take advantage of these transformations. What they have forecasted will probably prove to be true. Businesses will flourish. But do not be misled. Most of the jobs created by these industries will not be going to humans. They go to robots and sophisticated AI-based computer systems. And humans will not even be building these robots and sophisticated computer systems. They will build themselves.</p>
<p>The commentaries by Mills and Otinno are only one set out of many. But all make the same mistake. This technological revolution will be unlike any before it. The Fourth Singularity is not comparable with farmers leaving their farms to take jobs in factories as happened in the United States and other developed nations over a century ago, and as is happening in China now. Nor will former factory workers be switching to jobs in the so-called service and knowledge economies as occurred in a sizable percentage of U.S. industries in recent years. Rather, a huge number of jobs for humans will simply disappear altogether as robots and sophisticated computer systems become capable of taking over any job, including yours.</p>
<p>Utopia this is not.</p>

<title>Some Modest Solutions for the Jobless Future</title>
<p>It would be easy to say that there is no wholly satisfactory solution. What is more accurate is to say that there are several partial solutions. For example,</p>
<p>The federal government can</p>
<list id="list3-1946756712473437" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Formulate a strategy for the U.S. economy focusing on the businesses of the future. This would incorporate a national strategy for creating and saving jobs. This could include being first and most competitive in one or more new business arenas. What <italic>not</italic> to do is exemplified by the following event. While the United States was trying to decide how to approach the solar industry, the Chinese became number 1. This is similar to what happened when the Russians beat the United States into space with Sputnik. We should avoid allowing such events to occur in the future. This could also involve working with governments from other countries to improve job creation and retention there as well. I am thinking here about innovative products and services. In this case, the first to market a new device or service can usually secure up to 60 percent of the market, and often hold this market share for some time, but (as Apple is learning with its I-phone) not forever (see more on this in the list titled “Domestically and globally businesses and governments together can”).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Establish a microeconomy based on government service in trade for receipt of government assistance. In China, for example, if you do not anticipate that you can afford in-home assisted living when you are aged, then you can volunteer to provide such service for someone else before you yourself need it. Then when you need it, another volunteer in need of service credits can provide that service for you.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Get serious about cyber warfare and improve the protection of our research and development secrets from competitive rivals. Almost every major U.S. firm as well as the central intelligence agency (CIA) and several other government agencies have been penetrated by foreign hackers seeking our product, process, innovation, trade, and military secrets. Surely one thing that the federal government can do to protect American jobs is to help keep competitors from stealing our ideas.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Ease regulations on businesses to put capital to better use. For example, the CEO of a large plastics company estimates that it costs his firm $4 million a year to comply with Sarbanes–Oxley (a regulation enacted in 2002 that requires top managers of companies to individually certify the accuracy of all financial information in their reports). Surely simpler reporting requirements could be developed and much of the savings realized could then be spent creating jobs that move the company forward rather than simply creating jobs that track compliance. Similarly, California has for years burdened firms with excessive taxes and regulations while spending lavishly on social welfare programs and state and local pensions.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Provide more business-friendly environments. For example, state and local governments in California have also possessed a governmental attitude of “give public unions what they want even if meeting their demands is not fiscally sound.” What happened of course is that many companies fled the state for more business-friendly locations elsewhere. One of the major concerns of businesses today is taxation at the national level. Firms complain over and over about high taxation rates in the United States compared with other countries. So, make the United States more business friendly.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Provide tax incentives to startup companies to create jobs in this country rather than outsourcing jobs. The watchword in Silicon Valley for some time has been that to be price competitive, startup manufacturing companies must outsource their manufacturing to China.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Inspire confidence in the economy. Consistently during this recession and its recovery, surveys have shown that businesses would hire more employees if they had faith in the recovery. <italic>The Wall Street Journal</italic> recently ran a major piece on why business was not investing in our economy because of lack of confidence about what might happen in the future. Changing this will require actions, not words, from the politicians of both parties.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Focus on changing cultural attitudes toward education among African and Hispanic Americans to make them more education oriented. These cultures often downplay the importance and/or relevance of education to their potential success in our economy. Robert Samuelson in an article in the January 10, 2011 <italic>Washington Post</italic> discussed this issue and noted that the lowest ethnic group scores for U.S. students on a generally accepted global student assessment test were for African American and Hispanic students. The evidence also reveals that the highest high school dropout rates among major ethnic groups in the United States are experienced by African American and Hispanic males. Notwithstanding the fact that other factors also precipitate these lower scores and high dropout rates, the government could do much to change student perspectives. Studies clearly show that more education leads to improvement in job possibilities at virtually every level. High school dropouts are the hardest hit in unemployment statistics.</p></list-item></list>
<p>Federal, state, and local governments can</p>
<list id="list4-1946756712473437" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Create new business models. Federal, state, and local governments must reexamine how they fund themselves and how they spend their revenues. They must find new ways to fund themselves in the future and spend only what they can fund. Budgets in governments are now raised in all economic times but seldom cut, especially at the federal level. At the federal level, of course, are the so-called entitlements. A viable long-term solution will require new thinking about how much government <italic>can</italic> do and what citizens <italic>should</italic> do for themselves. In creating business models, governments must balance the various incomes that they have against what they can actually provide. Although many states and local municipalities already have improved their business models, over the long term, millions of jobs are still at stake in both public and private sectors.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Create a new business model that would facilitate and reward the creation of jobs by the private sector. This should be a key point in the examination of business models at all levels, but especially at the federal level. States and municipalities have been examining and recreating theirs. The federal government has been promising to, but so far has not. The point is, Can the government be all things to all people, and attempt to give everyone what they want? If not, then the spending side of their business model clearly needs to be altered. And in all probability the revenue side as well. What would this mean; more user taxes? Perhaps, but creative government thinking can surely come up with a new and more effective business model.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Create jobs by funding badly needed improvements in infrastructure. Clearly this is a short-term solution at best, but the turnover of monies resulting from these jobs will create new support jobs for workers and even add some additional tax revenues.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Take the actions necessary to avoid the Fourth Singularity. One of the major problems with the federal government is that no one in it appears to take this danger seriously; or if they do, they do not seem motivated to prevent it. Elected officials worry they might not get reelected if they make tough decisions, so they simply postpone them. And if they ever do finally decide to act, they may not have much money to act with if they wait much longer. Ok, so how do we do that? The first step is to raise the level of awareness. Futurists, consultants, political staff, and lobbyists must inform those in government of this danger. The second step is to motivate action. Awareness helps that to happen. Web campaigns can help make that happen. Interested parties can put pressure on Congress and the president for action. Lobbyists can be critical in doing so. But the harsh reality is that only when it becomes a crisis are politicians likely to act.</p></list-item></list>
<p>Federal, state, and local government politicians and staff can</p>
<list id="list5-1946756712473437" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Put the people first. It may sound old fashioned, but politicians at every level of government should act for the good of the nation and their constituents not to serve their own self-interests. There is a general perception among the population of the United States that these groups serve themselves first, last, and always. They ply various voting groups with promises to be reelected, but consistently vote themselves higher compensation and pension packages. Sadly, the facts too often appear to support such perceptions. If legislators in Congress did what they were supposed to do rather than what benefited them they would pass tax reform, budget reform, entitlement reform, subsidy reform, and take actions to make the United States more globally competitive and instill confidence in business.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Revise government election requirements to include term limits and qualifications for office, and extend House of Representatives terms to four years instead of two. Term limits lead to the end of lifelong careers for politicians. This means that those elected will be more likely to actually pass sound but possibly unpopular legislation rather than postpone it to keep their careers going.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Set financial limits on election expenditures and time limits for election campaigns. We really do not need a president campaigning for the past two years of his or her first term.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Downsize government across the board. Although I am specifically talking about the United States here, the debate about cutting government is literally being argued all around the world. But, unless a government’s spending is controlled, it will eventually collapse under the weight of debt.</p></list-item></list>
<p>Educational systems can</p>
<list id="list6-1946756712473437" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Focus on developing those skill sets most likely to be needed for success in the future.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Do more to assist underprivileged African and Hispanic Americans complete high school. The demographics of unemployment that began this article indicate just how severe this problem is. Clearly, many African and Hispanic Americans come to school with clear disadvantages and on average, lower expectations than do those from other ethnic segments of the population. Computerized learning promises improvement in test scores and skill set acquisition for all groups. This assistance will help significantly improve job skills sets and more closely matching student abilities with future job opportunities.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Society must admit that there is only so much school systems can do. Education systems cannot solve the student motivation problem by themselves, nor can they do much about many other variables that affect school performance. For example, studies show that where parents are active in the education system that their children attend, students perform better. Yet, relatively few parents are active in their children’s school systems across the economic spectrum, especially among financially poorer families. There are a whole host of reasons for this that go beyond the school’s abilities to overcome these parental deficits. If more parents did a better job of parenting, the education system could be more successful. But instead, society and the media continuously blame the teachers and schools alone for student failure. School systems may sometimes achieve less than is expected of them but these expectations are not always realistic. Only if students possess the motivation to work hard and achieve, and only if they also receive critical family support and encouragement can we expect our educational system to be fully successful. The educational system is a lot less responsible for its supposed failures than the media makes them out to be. Education systems cannot solve the student motivation problem alone. Parents and the students themselves must also be held responsible for what happens in the classroom. Lack of motivation and involvement cuts across all economic groups to some degree. Self-discipline is vital but often missing. This is a major reason why efforts to change cultures with respect to the value of education are so critical.</p></list-item></list>
<p>Businesses can</p>
<list id="list7-1946756712473437" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Look for ways to combine the efforts of humans and robots, and do more to integrate the creativity of human beings with the speed and reliability of sophisticated computer systems.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Do more to create and/or maintain jobs. There has always been a question as to what exactly the social responsibilities of business are. The environment, climate management, and sustainability have been three key issues over the past few years. Today one of the biggest issues is whether it is not also business’s social responsibility to provide meaningful and satisfying jobs.</p></list-item></list>
<p>Nobel Prize winning economist Milton Friedman always stated that the sole responsibility of business was to make a profit. Today, most discourses with respect to the social responsibilities of business issue address the concept of “enlightened self-interest.” This term means that if businesses do not act in ways that benefit society, they may very well end up cutting off their noses to spite their faces. With respect to jobs, enlightened self-interest means that businesses should keep employing people in large numbers to perform necessary and useful work. Otherwise, there will ultimately be no customers for the products and services they turn out. Broadening this concept, CEOs such as Howard Schultz of Starbucks and John Mackey, co-CEO of Whole Foods, have taken the position that shareholders are but one of many stakeholders affected by a corporation’s actions. Therefore, in making corporate decisions, companies should consider the needs of all these stakeholders not those of shareholders alone.</p>
<p>Domestically and globally businesses and governments together can</p>
<list id="list8-1946756712473437" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Formulate new rules for the competitive game. The business environment is a competitive one. So unless there is some agreement among competitors that providing jobs is important and that all parties agree to not reduce employment, then no one company or industry will do so. Realistically on a global basis, no firm from one country is going to hold employment levels if competitors from other countries are reducing theirs to be more competitive. Does this mean more government intervention in the process? Regrettably, it almost certainly does. If this country wants businesses to do something about jobs, then government must provide the direction and the motivation for businesses to do so. Globally, there would need to be some agreement among countries regarding ways to increase jobs, but this is most unlikely to happen until a global employment crisis occurs. Every nation wants to better its own economic situation at the expense of other nations. So the United States, if it really wants to provide employment for its citizens, must tackle this issue by itself until a global crisis emerges.</p></list-item></list>

<title>The Future of Jobs for Humans Is Bleak</title>
<p>We stand on the threshold of the Fourth Singularity. The future of jobs is rosy for robots and sophisticated computerized systems. For humans, not so much. We are about to be replaced. And make no mistake, over time all of us can be replaced by robots and sophisticated computer systems. The real question is, “How can we stop it from happening?”</p>
<p>Unless we take substantive actions, we will become a three-tiered nation of technocrats, low-level jobholders (for those who can find jobs), and the permanently unemployed. If humans are to hold onto jobs in the future, we must focus on providing jobs for humans. There must be wholesale changes in the way we do government, business, education, and global relationships. And the way we live our lives will most certainly change. The modest solutions mentioned above include both stopgap measures, such as infrastructure development, and long-term strategic changes, including a national business strategy and a coordinated national strategy to create and/or save jobs. If we allow the future of jobs to be usurped by robots and computerized systems, the Fourth Singularity will be on us before we know it.</p>
<p>While not treating the subject directly in this article, the author is well aware of the inverted pyramid of those supporting the nonworking others as compared with the historical support burden pyramid. This is precisely why we must act to save jobs. Most estimates of the future extrapolate. I do so too, but with a different set of assumptions. I see job destruction increasing at an ever-faster rate while job creation slows and the ranks of the jobless increase. Let’s check back in a few years and see if I am right.</p>
