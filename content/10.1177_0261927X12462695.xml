<abstract>
<p>Research on communication accommodation theory in online communication has documented convergence primarily in terms of lexical variables. This article presents the results of two studies that investigate convergence in structural variables in instant messaging (IM) conversations. Study 1 examines zero-history, intragroup dyads participating in a task-based IM conversation. Study 2 examines IM conversations between friends and contrasts social and task-based interactions. Results show interlocutors have a general tendency toward convergence on both the length and duration of individual contributions. Results also show differences reflecting relational (friends vs. strangers) and conversational (task vs. social) context that affect levels of convergence as the conversation continues.</p>

<p>Communication accommodation theory (CAT; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0261927X12462695">Giles &amp; Ogay, 2006</xref>) theorizes that to achieve social approval or acceptance, interlocutors often <italic>converge</italic> or
<disp-quote>
<p>adapt their communicative behaviors in terms of a wide range of linguistic (e.g., speech rate, accents), paralinguistic (e.g., pauses, utterance length) and nonverbal features (e.g., smiling, gazing) in such a way as to become more similar to their interlocutor’s behavior. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0261927X12462695">Giles &amp; Ogay, 2006</xref>, p. 295)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Most CAT research focuses on face-to-face (FtF) communication, but CAT has also been applied to computer-mediated communication (CMC). Lexical convergence in CMC has been documented in the use of politeness terms in email (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0261927X12462695">Bunz &amp; Campbell, 2004</xref>) and in gendered language in various CMC channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0261927X12462695">Herring, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0261927X12462695">Thomson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0261927X12462695">Thomson, Murachver, &amp; Green, 2001</xref>). Lexical convergence influences perceptions of rapport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0261927X12462695">Crook &amp; Booth, 1997</xref>) and varies by level of trust (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0261927X12462695">Scissors, Gill, Geraghty, &amp; Gergle, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0261927X12462695">Scissors, Gill, &amp; Gergle, 2008</xref>). In both synchronous chat and email, interlocutors converge structurally as well as lexically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0261927X12462695">Bunz &amp; Campbell, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0261927X12462695">Scissors et al., 2009</xref>). Intercultural (American and Chinese) pairs converge in use of active or reactive conversational styles in text-only and video chats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0261927X12462695">Wang &amp; Fussell, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0261927X12462695">Hesse, Werner, and Altman (1988)</xref> identify pace as an important temporal structure in CMC. Both message length (shorter or longer messages) and duration (shorter vs. longer response times) are structural variables that influence temporal pace. In email, individuals tend to have very consistent response latencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0261927X12462695">Kalman, Ravid, Raban, &amp; Rafaeli, 2006</xref>). Faster response latencies lead to more positive interpersonal perceptions in supportive emails (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0261927X12462695">Ledbetter, 2008</xref>), in task emails (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0261927X12462695">Walther &amp; Tidwell, 1995</xref>), and in emails from job candidates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0261927X12462695">Kalman &amp; Rafaeli, 2011</xref>). Similarly, longer messages on an email discussion list resulted in more positive interpersonal perceptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0261927X12462695">Liu, Ginther, &amp; Zelhart, 2001</xref>). Such effects have been explained in terms of SIDE theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0261927X12462695">Lea &amp; Spears, 1992</xref>), suggesting that these cues become more important because there are fewer nonverbal cues available compared with FtF communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0261927X12462695">Walther &amp; Tidwell, 1995</xref>), or in terms of expectancy violation theory, suggesting that deviations from communicative behavioral norms influence interpersonal perceptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0261927X12462695">Kalman &amp; Rafaeli, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>From a CAT perspective, it is important to investigate not only the effects of different temporal cues but also the extent to which interlocutors adapt to each other’s use of these cues. Temporal convergence has been documented in synchronous online chats between an advisor and four graduate students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0261927X12462695">de Siqueira &amp; Herring, 2009</xref>). Although each graduate student was consistent with himself or herself across conversations and different from each other, the pace of message production remained largely the same as the advisor adapted to the students. This effect held true even though interlocutors had varying typing speeds; that is, though each may have taken the same amount of time to produce and send a message, one message may have had more words than another.</p>
<p>The purpose of the present studies is to further investigate temporal convergence in synchronous CMC, specifically Instant Messaging (IM). We expect temporal convergence as interlocutors attempt to adapt to their partners’ message length and response times but that this convergence will be influenced by (inter)personal variables, such as level of disagreement, experience with IM, and length of relationship, as well as contextual variables, such as whether the conversation is task-oriented or social. Study 1 analyzes zero-history dyads participating in a task-oriented, persuasive conversation. Study 2 analyzes IM conversations between friends in both a task-oriented and a social conversation.</p>

<sec id="section3-0261927X12462695">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Thirty-seven participants (11 males; <italic>M</italic> age = 19.89 years, <italic>SD</italic> = 2.54) interacted with a confederate for credit in a college psychology course. Five other participants were age 40+ and were dropped from the following analyses to exclude possible intergroup interactions with the 20-year-old confederate.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0261927X12462695">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>This study was part of a larger project on turn-taking, argumentation, and alignment in CMC. Three variables (topic, disagreement, and nonverbal cues) were experimentally manipulated. A female confederate was used to ensure counterbalancing of agreement and nonverbal cues. Naïve participants met the confederate and were assigned to separate computer rooms. Participants completed a questionnaire gathering demographic information, rated their frequency of IM use on a scale of 1 (<italic>never</italic>) to 5 (<italic>daily</italic>), then read a short text advocating that the HPV vaccine Gardasil should be either (a) mandatory or (b) voluntary. Participants were then instructed on how to use the IM program. Participants and the confederate were given the same instructions.</p>
<p>Depending on the condition, the confederate either disagreed with the participant’s arguments or was neutral. The confederate also either used nonverbal cues (capitalized words, emoticons, and repeating punctuation such as !!! and ???) or did not use any nonverbal cues. The confederate participated in several practice chats to ensure proper execution of these manipulations. Once the confederate and participant entered their assigned rooms, a reminder of the conditions was placed prominently on the confederate’s computer. The confederate was told that analyses were to be conducted on the use of nonverbal cues and the impact agreement may have on the use of these cues; she was unaware of any analyses related to temporal convergence.</p>
<p>Participants were instructed to try to persuade the confederate to accept their assigned position. Each chat lasted approximately 27 minutes, with a 2-minute warning given before the chat ended. Participants were then asked whether they agreed with their assigned position and to rate their pretask knowledge about the topic.</p>

<sec id="section5-0261927X12462695">
<title>Data</title>
<p>IM transcripts were segmented into transmission units (TUs), which consist of all the text appearing in the composition box when an interlocutor hits enter/send (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0261927X12462695">Figure 1</xref>). TUs were further grouped into transmission sequences, or consecutive uninterrupted TUs from the same interlocutor, providing an approximation of how long she held the floor. In the subsequent analyses, each sequence was treated as the unit of analysis, with sequence length measured in the number of words per sequence, and sequence duration measured in the number of seconds elapsed between the beginning of one partner’s sequence and the beginning of the other partner’s adjacent sequence. Additionally, the difference in interlocutors’ adjacent sequence lengths and durations were calculated to measure convergence.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Pearson correlations show that interlocutors generally converged in temporal pace. The confederate’s (<italic>M</italic> = 30.85 words, <italic>SD</italic> = 8.47) and participants’ (<italic>M</italic> = 33.48 words, <italic>SD</italic> = 11.61) adjacent sequence lengths were correlated (<italic>r</italic> = .44, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). Likewise, the confederate’s (<italic>M</italic> = 70.88 seconds, <italic>SD</italic> = 48.60) and participants’ (<italic>M</italic> = 88.54 seconds, <italic>SD</italic> = 70.71) adjacent sequence durations were correlated (<italic>r</italic> = .42, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). Sequence duration was correlated with sequence length (<italic>r</italic> = .69, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001).</p>
<p>Linear mixed-effects (LME) models were generated to analyze the effects of participant role (participant as opposed to confederate), disagreement condition, additional sequences, and IM experience on interlocutors’ sequence length and duration, as well as dyad convergence in sequence length and duration. LME models derive an intercept, or mean, for each dependent variable and calculate how much that intercept changes with each change in each independent variable. For sequence length and duration, the models control for multiple observations from each interlocutor within dyads; for sequence length and duration differences the models control for the dyad. All dependent variables showed gamma distributions; natural log transformations corrected for nonnormal distributions. Non-log-transformed values are included with results in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0261927X12462695">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<title>Convergence in sequence length and duration</title>
<p>Convergence was measured by the difference in the length and duration of interlocutors’ adjacent sequences, with greater differences indicating less convergence. The model shows that each additional sequence significantly decreased convergence (i.e., increased the difference) in both length and duration. Interaction effects show that each additional sequence in the disagreement condition led to significantly decreased convergence in both length and duration compared with the neutral condition. That is, convergence decreased over the course of the conversation, and this divergence was even greater when the confederate actively disagreed with the participant.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>Thirty-five dyads (<italic>N</italic> = 70, 22 men; <italic>M</italic> age = 19.70 years, <italic>SD</italic> = 3.58) were composed of students enrolled in a psychology course who brought a friend to the study. Participants chose either course credit or $10 compensation. Five dyads consisted of two males, 18 of two females, and 12 of mixed sexes. Dyads self-reported friendships lasting between 2 months and 21 years (<italic>M</italic> = 3.57 years, <italic>SD</italic> = 4.58). One 46-year-old participant was an outlier in age and length of friendship (21 years). The outlier did not alter the mean or standard deviation meaningfully, and this dyad was included in subsequent analyses. Participants reported IMing with their dyad partner on a scale of 1 (<italic>never</italic>) to 7 (<italic>&gt;10 times per day; M</italic> = 2.75, between &lt;1/month and 1-3 times/month; <italic>SD</italic> = 1.79).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0261927X12462695">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>Each participant in the dyad was placed in a separate room with a computer. The participants completed a questionnaire requesting age and sex, the length of their friendship, their level of trust in their dyad partner, and their use of several computer-mediated communication channels. Pairs participated in two studies, the current IM study and a separate email study, which were counterbalanced as to which was completed first. In the present IM study, dyads either participated in a persuasive or a social conversation first. Both conversations lasted 20 minutes. In the persuasion condition, participants were assigned to persuade their partners either to favor or oppose a policy change in printing fees at their university. Participants were given five arguments that could be used to support their assigned positions. In the social condition, participants were instructed to IM with their dyad partners about any topic they wished.</p>
<p>Dependent variables were derived and LME models were calculated in the same manner as in Study 1. The LME models tested the effects of persuasion task, additional sequence, IM frequency with partner, and months of friendship. When dyad partners disagreed on IM frequency and friendship length, the mean of their responses was derived. Results are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0261927X12462695">Table 2</xref>.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Adjacent sequence lengths were correlated both in the persuasive condition, (<italic>r</italic> = .44, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001), and in the social condition (<italic>r</italic> = .32, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). Similarly, adjacent sequence durations were correlated in both the persuasive (<italic>r</italic> = .47, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) and social (<italic>r</italic> = .40, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) conditions. These results replicate those of Study 1, finding general convergence in both sequence length and duration. Also as in Study 1, sequence duration was significantly related to sequence length for both social and persuasive conversations (both <italic>r</italic>s = .54, <italic>p</italic>s&lt; .001).</p>
<sec id="section14-0261927X12462695">
<title>Sequence length and duration</title>
<p>Sequence length was greater in the persuasion condition (<italic>M</italic> = 17.40 words, <italic>SD</italic> = 16.62) compared with the social condition (<italic>M</italic> = 10.74 words, <italic>SD</italic> = 9.72). Likewise, sequence duration was greater in the persuasive condition (<italic>M</italic> = 30.05 seconds, <italic>SD</italic> = 35.90) than in the social condition (<italic>M</italic> = 17.02 seconds, <italic>SD</italic> = 17.44). Additionally, sequence duration decreased with each additional sequence and increased with each additional month of friendship. Interaction effects show that in the persuasion condition, each additional sequence increased both sequence length and duration more so than in the social condition.</p>

<title>Convergence in sequence length and duration</title>
<p>Sequence duration convergence significantly increased with each additional sequence. Additionally, there was less convergence in both sequence length and duration in the persuasion condition than the social condition. Interaction effects show that sequence length and duration convergence increased more with each additional turn in the persuasion condition than in the social condition. That is, while the difference between adjacent sequence lengths and durations were greater overall in the persuasion task, this difference decreased more with each additional sequence in the persuasive than in the social conversations.</p>

<title>Discussion and Conclusions</title>
<p>These studies document a general trend toward convergence in temporal pace (message length and duration) in synchronous CMC, as well as some conditions that either increase or decrease such convergence. Study 1 extends <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0261927X12462695">de Siqueira and Herring’s (2009)</xref> study by focusing on intragroup (undergraduate), zero-history dyads, controlling for intergroup, high-status differential (professor/student) context and prior communication history. Additionally, Study 1 includes a larger sample and more statistically powerful sequence-by-sequence analyses. However, as in the in the de Siqueria and Herring study, one interlocutor was consistent across these conversations. Study 2 therefore investigates temporal convergence between social and persuasive conversations within dyads comprised of friends, thus investigating convergence within completely independent dyads with prior communication histories.</p>
<p>Although convergence was observed in both studies, some important differences emerged between the two studies as well. There was less convergence in both sequence length and duration in Study 1 compared with Study 2. Furthermore, sequence length and duration convergence between the interlocutors decreased over the course of their conversations in Study 1, whereas duration convergence increased over the course of the conversations in Study 2. These differences may reflect relational dynamics; the interlocutors were strangers to one another in Study 1 but were friends in Study 2. Strangers may require longer messages and composition time than do friends, which is evident in the higher intercepts for the variables in the LME models between Study 1 and Study 2. This seemingly more effortful message production for strangers may be exacerbated as the conversation continues.</p>
<p>The effects of additional sequences on convergence interact with two different but related conditions in each study. In Study 1, convergence decreased over the course of the interaction more so in the disagreement condition than in the neutral condition; in Study 2, convergence increased over the course of the persuasive conversations more so than in the social conversations. It may be that when managing disagreement in IM, friends are more motivated to gain social approval than are strangers, and thus attend to and adapt to each others’ temporal pace. Conversely, strangers may be more strongly motivated to “emphasize distinctiveness” when there is disagreement, and thus diverge from their partner’s pace (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0261927X12462695">Giles &amp; Ogay, 2006</xref>, p. 296). It should be noted that the social conversations in Study 2 overall showed greater convergence than did the persuasive conversations. Future research should investigate whether persuasive or other task-based IM conversations show consistently less convergence compared to social talk.</p>
<p>Future research might also investigate the role of prior communication history on convergence in persuasive tasks. Temporal convergence seems to be influenced by whether interlocutors know each other (though not necessarily by how <italic>long</italic> they have known each other), whether they are engaging in persuasive or social IM conversations, and—in persuasive talk—by active disagreement.</p>
<p>Interlocutors’ experience with the CMC channel did not influence temporal convergence. More frequent prior experience IMing in general (Study 1) or IMing with one’s interlocutor (Study 2) did not affect convergence in sequence length or duration. Additionally, in Study 2, longer relationship histories did not lead to more convergence. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0261927X12462695">de Siqueira and Herring (2009)</xref> suggest that although IM users vary in their preferred “temporal styles,” they still accommodate to the style of their interlocutors. Our findings extend de Siqueira and Herring’s, showing that convergence and divergence both occur in IM and that this accommodation varies with specific conversational exigencies (stranger vs. friend, task vs. social). To the extent that personal temporal styles are influenced by experience with the channel or interpersonal histories, these variables did not affect temporal accommodation.</p>
<p>Recent research suggests that, despite the seeming lack of cues in CMC compared with FtF communication, participants with no prior communication history can form favorable impressions of their conversational partners in short, task-based interactions comparable with those in Study 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0261927X12462695">Yao &amp; Flanagin, 2006</xref>). It may be that the type of structural accommodation found in our study contributes to impression formation in CMC. Future research is needed to test this assumption. Similarly, the divergence resulting from disagreement in Study 1 contributes to the hyperpersonal perspective on CMC, which argues that users take advantage of the technological affordances of the medium to enhance relational outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0261927X12462695">Walther, 2007</xref>). In the disagreement condition, participants (as opposed to the confederate) may have been more mindful of their interaction as the conversation progressed, and thus were spending more time and effort on self-presentation strategies. Given that convergence increased in the Study 2 persuasion condition, there may be less need to be mindful when interlocutors share a history. Future research combining variables relevant to both CAT and the hyperpersonal perspective could elucidate the possible connections between accommodation and impression management in CMC.</p>
<p>Whereas previous research suggests the importance of temporal cues in impression formation, the present studies demonstrate further how interlocutors accommodate to these cues in synchronous CMC interactions. These findings contribute to a growing literature on CAT in online communication contexts by suggesting conditions under which convergence and divergence emerge within a relatively understudied CMC channel, IM. Since IM is often used in various workplace settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0261927X12462695">Garrett &amp; Danziger, 2007</xref>), research on when individuals will likely converge or diverge in task-based IM is important both theoretically and practically.</p>
