<abstract>
<p>Generic medicines have become essential contributors for governments in their effort to contain public health care budgets. Therefore, market access of generic medicines should be made possible immediately after expiry of the patent protecting the originator medicine. Generic medicines can only enter the market when the patent on the originator medicine is expired and when a marketing authorisation and pricing and reimbursement approval have been obtained from the national competent authorities. Arguments on patent validity or patent infringement which result in litigation before national courts, backlogs in national approval systems, defensive patenting strategies (‘evergreening’), patent linkage and third-party interventions during the process of marketing authorisation and pricing and reimbursement are well-documented causes for delayed market access of generic medicines. The establishment of a unitary European Union patent together with a unified and specialised patent litigation system, the reduction of backlogs in national agencies, avoiding third-party interventions as much as possible and automatic approval of pricing and reimbursement status upon marketing authorisation approval of the generic medicines are just a few examples of policies which could enhance market access of generic medicines in the European Union. This article aims to provide an overview of the regulatory framework regarding market access of generic medicines in the European Union and lists the hurdles which impede market access. Recommendations to enhance market access of generic medicines round off this article.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1741134312441107" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Generic medicines have become essential contributors for governments in their effort to contain public health care budgets.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1741134312441107">1</xref></sup> Generic medicines are substitutes for originator medicines with the same active ingredient and the same quality, safety and therapeutic efficacy as the originator medicines and whose bio-equivalence with the originator product has been demonstrated in appropriate bio-availability studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1741134312441107">2</xref></sup> However, prices of generic medicines tend to be 10–80% lower than those of originator medicines.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1741134312441107">3</xref></sup> Therefore, it is important for generic medicines to enter the market as soon as possible, as any delay constitutes a missed opportunity for savings to health care budgets and for access to health care for patients.</p>
<p>Generic medicines can only enter the market when all protection on the originator medicine has expired. Originator medicines are protected by patents and have been granted this period of exclusivity to reward the inventor for dissemination of the details of their invention.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1741134312441107">4</xref></sup> In addition to patents, market protection may be extended for other reasons such as supplementary protection certificates (SPCs), data and marketing exclusivity rules (see below). When the period of exclusivity has expired, generic medicines need to obtain a marketing authorisation (MA) and pricing and reimbursement (P&amp;R) approval before actually entering the market, just as the originator medicines. During these processes, delays may occur due to various reasons, causing harm to health care budgets (third-party payers, government), directly and indirectly to patients and generic medicines manufacturers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1741134312441107">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>The aim of this article is to give an overview of the procedures which need to be fulfiled for generic medicines to enter the European market (data protection, MA and P&amp;R) and to list hurdles which can be a cause of delayed market access of generic medicines. Finally, recommendations to enhance market access of generic medicines are suggested.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec2-1741134312441107" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title>
<p>Studies were identified by searching Pubmed, EMBASE, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Econlit and Google Scholar. Bibliographies of included studies were checked for other relevant studies. In addition, the Generics Bulletin and the <italic>Journal of Generic Medicines</italic> were specifically searched.</p>
<p>Additional studies were searched on various websites, including those of the European Commission, the European Patent Office (EPO), the European Medicines Agency (EMA), national competent authorities and the European Generic Medicines Association (EGA). The 2011 Market Review of the EGA was used for data on MA delays.</p></sec>

<sec id="sec5-1741134312441107"><title>Intellectual property protection</title>
<p>Generic medicines can only enter the market when all protection on the originator medicine has expired (not only patent protection). The protection of intellectual property (IP) can be either an original patent or a SPC.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1741134312441107">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1741134312441107">7</xref></sup> Patents in Europe provide protection for a period of 20 years from the date of the filing of the patent application, in accordance with the Trade Related aspects of Intellectual Property rights agreement.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1741134312441107">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>Patent applications can be directed at national patent offices or the EPO. Most pharmaceutical companies prefer to use the EPO, as the application has to be examined only once and a ‘European’ patent is granted. As there is still no Community patent in the European Union (EU), each Member State (MS) will have to validate this ‘European patent’, granted by the EPO, at a national level in order for the patent to be enforceable.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1741134312441107">5</xref></sup> To obtain a patent from the EPO, the invention must meet certain criteria which are laid down in the European Patent Convention. These criteria include novelty, involvement of an inventive step and susceptibility of industrial application.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1741134312441107">8</xref></sup> They are called primary patents when the patent covers a new active ingredient and secondary patents when the patent covers products or procedures containing active ingredients already covered by a primary patent.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1741134312441107">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>As patent applications in the pharmaceutical sector are filed very early in the process of research and development (R&amp;D), the effective period of protection for the originator medicine on the market is considerably lower than these 20 years. Therefore, the European Commission has adopted Regulation (EEC) No 1768/92 which has introduced the SPC.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1741134312441107">10</xref></sup> If a medicinal product is protected by a basic patent in force, has been granted a MA, has not yet been the subject of a certificate and the MA is the first authorisation to place the product on the market as a medicinal product, this medicine can obtain a SPC. A SPC is a unique IP right which extends the monopoly of the initial patent protection by up to 5 years and gives manufacturers the opportunity to recoup the large investments on R&amp;D. The combined period of protection is, however, limited to 15 years from the beginning of the first MA in the Community.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1741134312441107">5</xref></sup> This period of 5 years can be extended for 6 months, if the MA holder files an extra indication for paediatric use for the medicine.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1741134312441107">11</xref></sup> For instance, the introduction of the SPC for all patented medicines registered in Poland since 2000 can be expected to delay generic medicine market entry in Poland in future years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1741134312441107">12</xref></sup></p></sec>
<sec id="sec6-1741134312441107"><title>Data and marketing exclusivity</title>
<p>Medicinal products authorised in the EU also benefit from a certain period of exclusivity obtained by the data and marketing exclusivity rules. During the data exclusivity period, the manufacturer of the originator medicine is guaranteed additional market protection as the application for MA for a generic medicine cannot refer to the pre-clinical and clinical documentation of the originator medicine. During the subsequent marketing exclusivity period, the MA application for the generic medicine can refer to this documentation but the product cannot enter the market as long as this exclusivity applies.</p>
<p>Data exclusivity rules have been harmonised in the EU since March 2004 by Directive 2004/27/EC.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1741134312441107">2</xref></sup> Before this date, data exclusivity varied between 6 and 10 years depending on the country that granted the MA and whether the product was authorised by a national or centralised procedure. From 2004 on, data exclusivity extends for a period of 8 + 2 (+1) years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1741134312441107">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1741134312441107">7</xref></sup> The generic applicant can now file an ‘abridged’ application (cf. infra) 8 years after the initial MA of the reference products and rely on their data for safety and efficacy. However, they cannot bring the product on the market for 2 more years, the so-called marketing exclusivity period, so the MA holder of the reference product benefits from a period of exclusivity of 10 years. This period of protection can be extended by 1 additional year if a new therapeutic indication with significant clinical benefit can be demonstrated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1741134312441107">5</xref></sup> The definition of significant clinical benefit by the European Commission is, however, relatively wide.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1741134312441107">13</xref></sup> As the new rules for data exclusivity have only been implemented in 2004, this new rules only apply for products which the initial MA has been granted after 20 November 2005 (centrally authorised products) or 30 October 2005 (nationally authorised products).</p></sec>
<sec id="sec7-1741134312441107"><title>Bolar provision</title>
<p>In order to facilitate fast generic entry, the EU has adopted a so-called ‘Bolar provision’ in 2004. This type of provision already existed in the USA and is provided for in the Hatch-Waxman Act. It allows producers of generic medicines to carry out development, testing and experimental work (which is necessary for the purposes of submitting one or more generic or hybrid MA applications to be made pursuant to Article 10<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1741134312441107">1</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1741134312441107">4</xref></sup> of Directive 2001/83/EC) on the patented product before the expiry of the patent of the original product. In general, generic entry was not delayed in the absence of this provision as most producers of generic medicines moved their testing to countries where this was already allowed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1741134312441107">5</xref></sup></p></sec>
<sec id="sec8-1741134312441107"><title>Marketing authorisation</title>
<p>Any medicinal product in the EU can only be brought to the market if it has obtained a MA from the competent authorities of the MS. This MA affirms the safety, quality and efficacy of the medicinal product and is meant to protect public health within the EU.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1741134312441107">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1741134312441107">14</xref></sup> A generic product can obtain a MA by filing a so-called ‘abridged’ application. This dossier must include a summary of product characteristics (SmPC), the package leaflet and the labelling text. The applicant is exempted from pre-clinical tests and clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy and may rely on the data of the reference product. These data are, however, protected for a defined period, the so-called data exclusivity period (cf. supra). A MA is granted for an initial period of 5 years, which can be extended after a re-evaluation of the risks and benefits. When the medicinal products is not placed on the market 3 years after the MA or is absent for a period of 3 consecutive years, the MA will be revoked.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1741134312441107">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>There are different ways for an applicant to obtain a MA in Europe: a national procedure, a centralised procedure, a decentralised procedure (DCP) and a mutual recognition procedure (MRP). Generic medicines account for the vast majority of MA submissions for both the DCP (84.7% of all submissions) and the MRP (64.7% of all submissions).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1741134312441107">15</xref></sup> The use of the centralised procedure for generic medicines has been limited so far as only three applications in 2006 and 8 in 2007 have been reported.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1741134312441107">5</xref></sup></p>
<sec id="sec9-1741134312441107"><title>National procedure</title>
<p>An application is submitted to the competent authorities of the concerned MS. The MA is restricted to the MS where it is granted.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1741134312441107">14</xref></sup></p></sec>
<sec id="sec10-1741134312441107"><title>Centralised procedure</title>
<p>An application is submitted to the EMA, where the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) will evaluate the dossier and publishes a European public assessment report. Once the MA is granted by the European Commission, this community MA is valid in all MSs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1741134312441107">14</xref></sup></p></sec>
<sec id="sec11-1741134312441107"><title>Mutual recognition procedure</title>
<p>This procedure can be used when there is already a MA granted in one MS. This MS will act as reference MS. The applicant files multiple identical dossiers to all concerned MSs and these will base their decision on the assessment report (including the SmPC, package leaflet and labelling text) of the reference MS. Each MS will grant a national MA for the medicinal product if the assessment report is accepted.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1741134312441107">14</xref></sup></p></sec>
<sec id="sec12-1741134312441107"><title>Decentralised procedure</title>
<p>This procedure can be used when a MA has not been granted at the time of the application. The applicant files identical dossiers to all concerned MSs and one MS is chosen to act as the reference MS. This MS will prepare a draft assessment report on which other MSs will base their evaluation. Each MS grants a national MA for the medicinal products if the draft assessment report is accepted.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1741134312441107">14</xref></sup></p></sec></sec></sec>
<sec id="sec13-1741134312441107"><title>Pricing and reimbursement</title>
<p>When generic medicines have acquired an MA, they can enter the market, but to become a commercial success, they need to have obtained a P&amp;R approval. Just as originator medicines, generic medicines have to pass through the trajectory of obtaining P&amp;R approval of the competent national agencies as P&amp;R is a national competence of MSs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1741134312441107">5</xref></sup> However, the EU has provided a legal framework, Directive 89/105/EEC and the EC treaty, which stipulates conditions that MSs have to meet. This so-called ‘Transparency Directive’ states that P&amp;R decisions have to be taken in a transparent way, i.e. within a specific timeframe (90 days for pricing decision and 90 days for reimbursement decision), with the possibility to judicial appeal at a national level and with a communication to both public and the applicant with a statement of their decision based on objective and verifiable criteria.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1741134312441107">16</xref></sup> The European Commission is currently investigating whether the Transparency Directive needs a revision by means of a public consultation of all concerned stakeholders as the 90/180 days timeframe is not respected in all countries (see below).</p>
<p>Policies have already been implemented in European countries to accelerate the process of P&amp;R approval, but these vary between individual countries. Some countries use an automatic P&amp;R approval for generic medicines under the same conditions as the originator reference product (i.e. Germany and UK).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1741134312441107">17</xref></sup> Some countries allow applications for P&amp;R status already after a positive advice of the CHMP and do not wait until the MA is granted.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1741134312441107">5</xref></sup> Finally, some countries automatically approve the P&amp;R status of generic medicines when the competent authorities have not made their decision within 90/180 days.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec14-1741134312441107"><title>Causes of delay of market access for generic medicines</title>
<sec id="sec15-1741134312441107"><title>Intellectual property protection</title>
<p>Despite being necessary to promote innovation by protecting IP, patents can also have negative side effects on the public health. It even made Pope Benedict XVI express his concerns: ‘on the part of rich countries, there is excessive zeal for protecting knowledge through an unduly rigid assertion of the right to IP, especially in the field of health care’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1741134312441107">18</xref></sup> Market access of generic medicines has been delayed in some cases due to arguments on patent status of originator medicines.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1741134312441107">5</xref></sup> This has led to ongoing litigation disputes before national courts. As the judgement of these courts can take a while and interim injunctions are obtained, market access of generic medicines is delayed until a settlement or a decision is reached.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1741134312441107">9</xref></sup> This is a major problem in Portugal, for instance. It has been reported that originator companies have exploited administrative courts’ preparedness to hear complaints of infringement of originators’ patents. As these courts, unlike commercial or IP courts, have no competence in patent law, have judges who are not typically technically qualified and/or rarely undertake consideration of the merits, they have simply decreed that authorisations, as well as P&amp;R approvals, should be suspended. This has led to 22 generic substances, including atorvastatin, valsartan and many others, which are blocked from market access in Portugal. Apart from blocked access, this has also caused a financial loss to the state and patients of around €100 m since 2007.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1741134312441107">19</xref></sup> The law in Portugal is, however, changing and from March 2012 on administrative courts will no longer be able to suspend MA or P&amp;R because of patents. In other countries, patent injunctions are granted automatically by local courts so long as an originator shows that it holds a patent without consideration of the potential invalidity or non-infringement arguments of the generic companies (e.g. Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, Norway, Poland, Romania, Slovakia). In these countries, it also takes a very long time to get a first instance decision on the merits.</p>
<p>Originator companies may try to extend the period of marketing exclusivity to a maximum by applying defensive patenting strategies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1741134312441107">20</xref></sup> These practices are commonly known as ‘evergreening’, also known as ‘product life cycle management’ tactics. It includes the patenting of non-essential features of products and thereby creating patent thickets for certain active substances.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1741134312441107">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1741134312441107">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1741134312441107">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1741134312441107">22</xref></sup> These non-essential features can include different production processes, changes in strength or dosage, new metabolites or active enantiomers, new formulations, etc. The protection of the originator product is thus extended, thereby prolonging the product sales/royalties, sometimes without any real innovation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1741134312441107">22</xref></sup></p></sec>
<sec id="sec16-1741134312441107"><title>Marketing authorisation</title>
<p>Several problems have occurred in the process of obtaining MA in the EU which ultimately postpones market access of the concerned generic medicines.</p>
<p>Generic applications for MA are mostly filed by the DCP/MRP (80% of all DCPs comes from generic medicines) but face delays due to regulatory backlogs in national approval systems. The number of MSs acting as reference MS is restricted (77% of the procedures are carried out by Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands and the UK) and there is shortage of specialised assessors in the competent national agencies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1741134312441107">5</xref></sup> This lack of resources and capacity has caused a delay in the granting of a MA to generic medicines.</p>
<p>But also with the CP, problems are reported. These problems are mainly related to the use of Second Medical Use Patents. These patents cover different new indications, different patient groups, different functional effects or different modes of administration assigned to the originator medicine and can differ between MSs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1741134312441107">9</xref></sup> When applying for a MA trough the CP, a SmPC has to be submitted that has to be identical in all EU MSs. As the deletion of the infringing parts from the SmPC for the concerned MSs is not permitted, problems arise when the generic medicine is marketed in MSs where the reference product still has a patent-protected indication.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1741134312441107">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>Another reason for delayed granting of MA is third-party interventions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1741134312441107">5</xref></sup> Third-parties, mostly originator companies, intervene in the process of granting MA by filing concerns/complaints to the MA bodies. For example, originator companies may claim that generic medicines are either less safe, less effective and/or of inferior quality than their original equivalents.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1741134312441107">5</xref></sup> They may also try to link the patent status of the originator reference product to the granting of MA (i.e. patent linkage).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1741134312441107">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1741134312441107">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1741134312441107">17</xref></sup> This means that generic companies have to demonstrate the non-infringement of generic medicines with valid patents. As regulatory agencies have to assess all these complaints, the granting of MA for these generic medicines is delayed. The sector inquiry of the European Commission has indicated that the granting of MA for generic medicines where a third-party intervened was delayed on average by 4 months.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1741134312441107">5</xref></sup> Patent linkage is, however, unlawful in the EU as Directive 2001/83/EC states that the patent status of originator medicines may not influence the decision on MA and P&amp;R.</p>
<p>This is what happened in Italy following a revision of their industrial-property code in 2010. From then on, a generic applicant can only start the registration procedure 1 year before the expiration of any protection on the active substance (patent or SPC). This is, however, in opposition with Directive 2001/83/EC.

<p>Generic companies have complained that regulatory bodies who are responsible for the approval of P&amp;R status ask for details of bio-equivalence and re-asses these data.

<p>The USA have developed a market environment for generic medicines which differs from the European market with regards to regulatory and IP requirements. The main differences are given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1741134312441107">Table 2</xref>. Regulatory and IP requirements have been harmonised in the USA and generic medicines can enter the market immediately upon patent expiration. Notwithstanding the fact that the market environment for generic medicines in the USA is arguably far from perfect, some policies, such as harmonised regulatory and IP requirements and immediate market entrance upon patent expiration, could serve as an example for Europe to adapt their generic medicines policies.

<p>Recently, US federal regulators and the generic drug industry have reached an agreement that calls for generic drug manufacturers to pay collectively an annual fee of US$299 m. Hence, the food and drug administration would be able to hire extra reviewers and speed up the review processes of MA applications. This would ultimately result in faster uptake of generic medicines in the American market, giving patients and doctors quicker access to generic medicines.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1741134312441107">26</xref></sup></p></sec></sec></sec>

<sec id="sec20-1741134312441107"><title>Recommendations to enhance market access of generic medicines</title>
<p>Delayed market access of generic medicines constitutes a missed opportunity for savings to health care budgets and for access to health care for patients. A change of policies are needed to enhance market access of generic medicines:
<list id="list1-1741134312441107" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Patents should only be granted to truly innovative medicines, e.g. if they offer additional clinical efficacy and/or effectiveness compared with current care.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1741134312441107">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1741134312441107">28</xref></sup> This would eliminate the benefits associated with evergreening practices as non-innovative features would not be patented anymore. Patent thickets are thus less likely to occur and this would enable generic medicines to enter the market sooner. However, the granting of patents for real innovations may not be restricted, as further innovation needs to be encouraged.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The creation of a unitary EU Patent, formerly known as a Community Patent, is to be recommended. Such patent would be enforceable in the entire EU, unlike the European patents granted by the EPO at this moment, which become a bundle of nationally enforceable patents. The European Commission is currently working on this issue. Two EU draft regulations on the unitary EU patent were created in 2011. In total, 25 EU MSs have now embarked on enhanced co-operation with a view to creating unitary patent protection in their countries. Italy and Spain decided not to join this initiative, primarily based on translation issues.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1741134312441107">29</xref></sup></p></list-item>
<list-item><p>It is recommended that a unified and specialised patent litigation system for European and Community patents will be created in the EU. As the current system with litigations in different national courts leads to extra costs, delays and diverging judgements, a unified patent litigation system would ensure the uniformity of interpretation of patents among the MSs and increase the legal certainty for concerned parties.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>As there are delays reported due to regulatory backlogs in national agencies, it is important to reduce these backlogs as much as possible by increasing capacity and resources of national agencies. As the number of MSs acting as reference MS in the MRP/DCP is restricted, there should be a rebalancing of responsibilities among the national agencies of the European countries. The administrative burdens imposed on companies when using MRP should also be reduced by harmonising regulatory procedures between countries.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>There should be an increased possibility for the use of the CP for generic medicines. This should relieve the MSs acting as reference MS in the MRP/DCP, as in 77% of the cases, this task is performed by only four countries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1741134312441107">5</xref></sup> There should be the possibility to delete the infringing parts from the SmPC in the concerned MSs to solve the problems related to Second Medical Use Patents.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Third-party interventions (both during MA and P&amp;R processes) should be subject to tighter control/regulation. It is necessary for third-party interventions that they are well-documented, made transparent towards the applicants and do not lead to delays for the applicant. Health insurers and/or companies should be able to pursue damage claims for foregone savings and/or revenues if the third-party intervention seemed to be unfounded and a cause of delay of market access.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Regulatory authorities should not consider the patent status of the originator medicine when approving MA or P&amp;R status. The requirements to be considered for the granting of a MA for a generic medicine are set out in Directive 2001/83/EC and the patent status of the originator medicine is not among the requirements.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>There should be automatic P&amp;R approval upon the MA of the generic medicines. Generic medicines have already proven therapeutic equivalence and bio-equivalence to the originator medicine by obtaining MA and any delay for this P&amp;R decision cannot be justified. Germany and UK already adopted P&amp;R status immediately following the MA.</p></list-item>

<notes><title>Author's Biography</title>
<p>Pieter Dylst is a PhD-student at the Research Centre for Pharmaceutical Care and Pharmaco-economics of the KU Leuven under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Steven Simoens. He graduated as a pharmacist at the KU Leuven in 2009 and started his PhD subsequently. His PhD-project focuses on the analysis of European policies towards generic medicines. He has published papers before in the field of generic medicines.</p>
<p>Arnold Vulto (1952) obtained his pharmacy-degree from Groningen University (The Netherlands) in 1981, with undergraduate studies in Cambdrige (UK). He was trained as a pharmacologist at the Rudolf Magnus Institute for Pharmacology/Medical Faculty at the University of Utrecht and at the Karolinska Institute (Stockholm, Sweden). He specialized in hospital pharmacy at the University Hospital Maastricht, The Netherlands (1988) and obtained his PhD from Utrecht University. In 1988 he was appointed Head of the Hospital Pharmacy of the Veterinary Faculty, University of Utrecht. In 1995 he was appointed Deputy Head/Research Director of the Hospital Pharmacy of the Erasmus University Medical Center Rotterdam, where he was awarded an Associate Professorship in pharmacy in 1998. In 2004 followed an appointment to the chair of Hospital Pharmacy/Practical Therapeutics at the Erasmus University Medical Center. He is responsible for the Unit of Medical Education, Professional Training and Research of the hospital pharmacy, which comprises the clinical trial unit. In this capacity he is the preceptor of the Hospital Pharmacy Specialization Program (with eight residents in training).</p>
<p>Professor Vulto is the (co)author of more than 100 peer reviewed papers in international journals on a wide variety of topics, all around medicines and has been supervising 15 PhD projects. In 2010 he was elected as a Fellow of the American College of Clinical Pharmacology. In 2010-2011 he was a visiting scientist at the Paul Ehrlich Institute for Vaccines &amp; Biomedicines in Langen, Germany. From 2002-2007 he was member of the Board of Directors of the European Association of Hospital Pharmacists (EAHP); from 2003-2006 Chairman of the EAHP Scientific Committee, responsible for the content of the annual 2000-delegate congresses.
