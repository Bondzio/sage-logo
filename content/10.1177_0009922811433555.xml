<abstract>
<p>The globalization of pediatric graduate medical education is ongoing; thus, this study was conducted to begin to explore the nature of resident interest in global health (GH) training and to further identify potentially modifiable factors influencing participation in away rotations. The authors surveyed all residents at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center to identify factors influencing participation in education efforts and away rotations. With a participation rate of 79.4% (n = 143), 5 key factors emerged as most significant in the decision-making process amid all participants. Among residents who had previous experience, 82.1% were interested in participating in an away elective compared with 58.3% of those without experience (<italic>P</italic> = .002). Residents with previous experience abroad were also more likely to plan to integrate GH into their careers (61.7% vs 26.7%, <italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001). This article describes specific obstacles to resident participation in GH education and documents the association between previous experience and significant interest in long-term involvement.</p>

<title>Background</title>
<p>Globalization has growing implications for graduate medical education, as regional economies, societies, and cultures converge through communication, trade, and transportation. The concurrent explosive growth in interest among residents in overseas rotations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922811433555">1</xref></sup> has fueled a movement among residency programs to develop global health (GH) educational experiences.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0009922811433555">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0009922811433555">3</xref></sup> Moreover, globalization will influence how these future health care professionals will practice medicine within our borders. As international travel has become ubiquitous, many infectious diseases not endemic to the United States are now seen in doctor’s offices and emergency rooms across the country.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0009922811433555">4</xref></sup> The arrival of immigrants and the return of deployed military troops from abroad increase this incidence rate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0009922811433555">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0009922811433555">7</xref></sup> Furthermore, since the political, economic, and social dimensions of this phenomenon affect the health of underserved populations and the delivery of health care in the United States and across the globe, it is incumbent on today’s residents to demonstrate a commitment to carry out their professional responsibilities in this new context with respect, integrity, and compassion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0009922811433555">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>The complex and rapid changes in US demographics,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0009922811433555">9</xref></sup> the persistence of health care disparities,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0009922811433555">10</xref></sup> and current and proposed accreditation requirements in graduate medical education<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0009922811433555">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0009922811433555">11</xref></sup> underscore the need for increased attention to culturally appropriate problem-solving skills for physicians. A way to meet this educational obligation is to develop cross-cultural programs that fulfill the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education requirements, strengthen professional and problem-solving skills, and offer residents adequate financial support, preparation, and mentorship.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0009922811433555">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0009922811433555">15</xref></sup> Overseas elective rotations expose learners to cultures and diseases not previously seen and provide encounters with common diseases in uncommon environments. Additionally, training in settings with limited resources and technology urges learners to develop problem-solving skills.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0009922811433555">16</xref></sup> Furthermore, GH education has been shown to have a positive effect on participants’ clinical skills and cultural effectiveness; it is also associated with career choices in primary care, public health, and in service of underserved populations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0009922811433555">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0009922811433555">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>Beyond the educational benefits afforded to the participants, there are urgent clinical needs in many of these geopolitical regions and a thoughtful approach to the workforce shortage therein is pressing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0009922811433555">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0009922811433555">23</xref></sup> Given the disproportionately great disease burden and mortality among children in low resource and high birth rate regions, these issues have clear ramifications for pediatric graduate medical education.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0009922811433555">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0009922811433555">25</xref></sup> However, the studies on GH training in US pediatric residencies and its components are few. Moreover, although such training promises to improve the knowledge, attitudes, and skills of learners,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0009922811433555">26</xref></sup> there is a need to test the validity of this promise and to quantify the degree of interest among pediatric residents. Furthermore, it is central to understand how variance in interest level in GH training predicts participation. We conducted this study to begin to explore the nature of resident general interest in GH education and to further identify potentially modifiable factors influencing participation in GH away rotations.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>Residents were recruited between March 1 and April 15, 2010, from the pediatric residency program at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC), Cincinnati, Ohio. CCHMC is an academic teaching hospital with 475 registered beds, nearly 24 000 admissions per year, and approximately 53 interns enrolled per year. All pediatric and combined-residency training residents met the eligibility criteria (N = 180) and no resident was excluded from participation. Potential participants were identified by viewing the residency roster. All residents meeting eligibility criteria were invited to participate by the investigators via e-mail messages, printed flyers, and public announcements. Residents could opt not to participate in the study and still participate in all GH educational activities offered throughout the residency program. Participants received no financial incentive to complete the questionnaire. This study was reviewed and declared exempt by the CCHMC Institutional Review Board.</p>
<sec id="section3-0009922811433555">
<title>Survey Instrument</title>
<p>The questionnaire was made available on paper and electronically through the Survey Monkey online data collection system (Survey Monkey, Portland, OR) throughout the recruitment period. The survey contained 7; 2 of these questions provided additional subquestions (Likert statements). Each statement, within these 2 questions, related to a specific factor under study. For example, one such statement related to “financial support” and another to “personal safety.” Participants were asked to indicate on a 5-category Likert rating scale his/her level of agreement with each statement.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0009922811433555">27</xref></sup> In addition, demographic information including gender, race/ethnicity, postgraduate year, and marital status was collected. The survey was designed to identify interest and factors related to involvement in GH education during the pediatric residency program. A GH rotation was defined as the practice of medicine in any geographical region of the globe outside the principal and typical patient population for whom residents provide care.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0009922811433555">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>We consolidated the data for description; thus, responses were clustered into 3 categories: disagreement (strongly disagree or disagree), neutral, and agreement (agree or strongly agree). Frequency distributions and bivariate analyses (Fisher’s exact test) were developed. <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05 was accepted as statistically significant. All analyses were performed by using SAS 9.2 for Windows (SAS Institute, Inc, Cary, NC).</p>

<sec id="section5-0009922811433555" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>The survey was completed by 79.4% (n = 143) of eligible residents. Thirty-four percent (n = 47) of the participants were male and 66% (n = 93) female, which was similar to the comparable residency population’s demographic of 42.8% and 57.2%, respectively. Seventy-six percent (n = 107) of respondents were white, approximating the 81.5% in the comparable resident population. Demographic information was not completed in 3 surveys. Respondents represented all 5 postgraduate years, including categorical pediatric, preliminary-year program, combined-residency training program (medicine/pediatric, pediatric/neurology, pediatric/genetic, and pediatric/physical medicine), and chief residents (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0009922811433555">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Factors in Decision Making</title>
<p>Eighty-four percent (n = 117) of respondents were generally interested in GH as an educational topic of study during their residency. Seventy percent (n = 97) of respondents were interested in participating in a GH away elective rotation during their training. In addition, we measured the residents’ levels of agreement or disagreement with Likert statements related to factors in GH education participation. A high number (&gt;65%) of residents agreed that availability of financial support (85.9%), a preestablished site (79.0%), and appropriate supervision at that site (73.4%) were significant positive factors in their decision. Furthermore, 69.9% of respondents agreed that the availability of a GH resident interest group and personal safety (67.8%) positively affected their decision (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0009922811433555">Table 2</xref>).</p>

<title>Previous Experience</title>
<p>Forty-eight percent (n = 68) of all respondents had previous experience in GH. Their previous service encompassed 41 countries on 6 continents. Twenty-seven (18.9%) of the participants participated in college and 51 (35.7%) also participated during medical school. When responses from those with previous experience and from those without were compared, significant findings emerged (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0009922811433555">Table 3</xref>). Among residents who had previous experience, 82.1% were interested in participating again in an away elective compared with 58.3% of those without experience (<italic>P</italic> = .002).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The findings affirm a high degree of previous experience and current interest in GH education and rotations by residents. They further suggest that previous experience is associated with their interest in away elective rotations and involvement in GH throughout their career. Nevertheless, factors obstructing participation remain. Notwithstanding marked interest, benefits, and international pediatric workforce needs, a survey of program directors demonstrated that only 10% of pediatric residents participated in a GH away elective during residency.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0009922811433555">15</xref></sup> In our study, potentially modifiable factors relevant to resident participation emerged. Regrettably, in view of the specific contributions future pediatricians could make in the service of the underserved and among the global medical workforce, to our knowledge, a study of this nature has not been previously conducted among an entire pediatric and combined-residencies training population.</p>
<p>It is well demonstrated that participants in GH experiences are more likely than nonparticipants to work among underserved populations, to choose primary care specialties, and/or pursue graduate education in public health.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0009922811433555">28</xref></sup> Additionally, participation in GH while in training aids residents to clarify and delineate the level and nature of their interest and ultimately helps determine whether a career with significant involvement in GH is suitable.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0009922811433555">29</xref></sup> Despite known benefits and documented high interest, similar to other academic programs,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0009922811433555">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0009922811433555">30</xref></sup> the actual participation by eligible senior residents at CCHMC has been lower than expected. For instance, although nearly twice the participation rate in a national sample,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0009922811433555">15</xref></sup> only 22 (18.3%) residents took part in a global away elective in the 2010-2011 academic year. Thus, obstacles and decision modifiers have been evident. Concurrently, best practice and ethical mandates in GH training call for provision of financial support, long-term partnerships, trainee personal safety, as well as adequate supervision and mentorship.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0009922811433555">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0009922811433555">31</xref></sup> Hence, we sought to understand if these and other proposed components modified the residents’ decision-making process ultimately influencing participation. In our study, it was clear that a great majority of residents were interested in GH as a topic of study and a smaller yet substantial group was intent on participating in an international away elective during training. Additionally, of the 5 proposed components, 4 led the list of factors shaping the decisions of greater than 65% of all respondents (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0009922811433555">Table 2</xref>).</p>
<p>Nearly half of our study population had previous GH experience, with 35.7% who participated during medical school. Curiously, a national participation rate of 29.9% was reported through the corresponding Association of American Medical Colleges’ Medical School Graduation questionnaire.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0009922811433555">32</xref></sup> Even though our Global Health Scholars Program,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0009922811433555">20</xref></sup> the forerunner to the current track, was only first made known to visiting residency applicants in 2007, this relative higher rate of medical school participation among our current residents may attest to the appeal GH training potentially had during the applicants’ residency program selection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0009922811433555">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0009922811433555">33</xref></sup> In fact, past international experience was the greatest predictor of interest. This was further significantly associated with a key difference between those with experience and those without (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0009922811433555">Table 3</xref>). Although the 2 groups were similarly concerned with the availability of financial support, a resident interest group, personal safety, and mentorship, those with experience not only were more interested in away electives but also decisively planned to incorporate GH into their careers. Indeed those with previous experience were nearly twice more likely to plan to incorporate GH into their future career than that reported among a national random sample of graduating pediatric residents.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922811433555">1</xref></sup> Conversely, those without experience reported a lower interest in going to a preestablished global site with faculty supervision and, if not single, a higher interest in taking their spouse/children with them, suggesting a naive understanding of the strenuous conditions encountered while completing a rotation overseas. Notably, 42% of all participants did not appreciably consider mentorship when making a decision. Given the known importance of a mentor in successful GH training,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0009922811433555">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0009922811433555">34</xref></sup> this topic is a fertile ground for resident education.</p>
<p>In a national environment of guarded funding of pediatric graduate medical education and increasing restrictions on resident duty hours,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0009922811433555">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0009922811433555">36</xref></sup> understanding the mechanisms that influence away elective participation can aid academic departments and program directors to more judiciously allocate spending and overcome barriers. In addition, identification of an indicator associated with future involvement in GH during professional practice can guide the investment of limited resources. In our study, the greatest predictor of meaningful interest was previous participation, which suggests that educators would do well to perceptively consider experience when selecting residents into a GH focused pathway or track. Regardless of the specific structure of the GH training, when developing a program, barriers must be addressed. We identified 5 factors with great potential influence over the resident decision-making process. Henceforth, within our program we prioritized the development of strategies to overcome the obstacles they represent. It is evident, however, that further exploration into which strategies will be most efficacious and cost-effective is warranted.</p>
<p>Our study has several limitations. Given the cross-sectional and observational nature of our methods, we are careful not to overstate the apparent association between previous experience and interest in participation in GH education during residency training and professional practice. The number of factors evaluated by our instrument may have also been too few to entirely assess the full spectrum of dynamics. However, despite the number, significant differences could be shown between residents with previous experience and those without. Last, in the absence of direct interviews of residents, we cannot exclude the possibility that the decision-making process is also influenced by additional factors. Future studies should repeat this analysis with a larger group of learners across institutions and with long-term follow-up.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>With globalization and recent health care reform as a backdrop, legislative, economic, and social pressures are reshaping graduate medical education. Concurrently, interest, educational benefits, and worldwide workforce shortages bring GH training to center stage. In this setting, we describe specific obstacles to resident participation and document the association between previous experience and significant interest in ongoing involvement in GH. Investigations of effective strategies in overcoming these barriers and their dissemination are also indicated. To live in the promise that GH training will aid in the care of underserved populations—in these transforming times—policy makers, funders, and educators must join and focus efforts; it is necessary to do this on behalf of learners and the children for whom they care at home and abroad.</p>
