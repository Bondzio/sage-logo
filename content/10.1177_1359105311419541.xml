<abstract>
<p>Previous research has concentrated exclusively on the association between the frequency of joint family activities (JFA) and adolescent problem behaviours. In this study, multiple linear regressions based on a national sample of 3467 13– to 16–year-olds in Switzerland revealed that JFA enjoyment rather than JFA frequency is consistently related to low adolescent substance use and violence. By choosing JFA that their children enjoy, parents might provide opportunities for disclosure, strengthen family bonds and reduce the likelihood of adolescent problem behaviours. In terms of prevention, a shift in focus towards the quality rather than the quantity of JFA could prove more effective.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Previous research has shown that time spent together as a family in general and joint family activities (JFA) in particular are associated with healthy child development. Among adolescents, inverse relationships have been found between JFA and a variety of problem behaviours such as substance use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1359105311419541">Garmiene, Zemaitiene, &amp; Zaborskis, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1359105311419541">Granado Alcon &amp; Pedersen, 2001</xref>) and delinquency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1359105311419541">Robertson, 1999</xref>). However, the mechanism involved is still only partially understood. In the present study, we investigate whether the ‘protective’ effect of JFA is mainly due to the time spent with parents or whether it is the adolescents’ enjoyment of JFA that is responsible for the negative link to problem behaviours.</p>
<p>Primary socialization theory may offer an explanation for the protective effect of JFA on adolescent problem behaviours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1359105311419541">Oetting, Deffenbacher, &amp; Donnermeyer, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1359105311419541">Oetting &amp; Donnermeyer, 1998</xref>). It posits that the family, rather than school and peers, is the main primary socialization agent and tends to promote predominantly prosocial values which may ‘arm’ the adolescent against other social influences. Peer groups, in contrast, are regarded as a source for the promotion of deviant norms, leading to problem behaviours such as substance use.</p>
<p>From this theory, we can derive two possible explanations for the inverse relationship between JFA and adolescent problem behaviours. The first is that JFA may simply restrict the time adolescents spend with peers, thereby offering them fewer opportunities to use substances and to indulge in other problem behaviours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1359105311419541">Crawford &amp; Novak, 2002</xref>). Studies have shown that adolescents who spend less time in structured activities with adults (e.g. playing sports in a supervised team or attending meetings of a hobby association) have more opportunities to participate in delinquency and non-normative activities such as stealing or getting drunk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1359105311419541">Mahoney &amp; Stattin, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1359105311419541">Persson, Kerr, &amp; Stattin, 2007</xref>). Similarly, investigating the exposure opportunity hypothesis, Anthony and colleagues have demonstrated that being exposed to substance use in peer groups and other social environments creates the opportunity for personal use which, in turn, results in higher substance use levels (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1359105311419541">Van Etten, Neumark, &amp; Anthony, 1997</xref>). For example, in 31 countries, the frequency of evenings out with friends was a particularly strong and consistent predictor of adolescent cannabis use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1359105311419541">Kuntsche, Simons-Morton, Fotiou, ter Bogt, &amp; Kokkevi, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Yet, in their reconceptualization of ‘parental monitoring’, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1359105311419541">Stattin and Kerr (2000)</xref> demonstrated that the protective effect was primarily due to the children’s spontaneous disclosure and readiness to tell their parents what they did in their leisure time rather than any form of active parental control, tracking or surveillance. However, such disclosure is only likely when parents are motivated to involve themselves in their children’s lives and to guide and influence them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1359105311419541">Dishion, Nelson, &amp; Bullock, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>This brings us to the second explanation of how JFA might contribute to lower levels of adolescent problem behaviours: by spending time with their children, parents may contribute to the transmission of prosocial values, life skills, trust, and self-confidence. Empirical studies have shown that JFA often strengthen family relationships and improve the quality of communication, negotiation and conflict resolution skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1359105311419541">Baldwin, Ellis, &amp; Baldwin, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1359105311419541">Fiese, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1359105311419541">Orthner, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1359105311419541">Smith, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>In his attachment theory, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1359105311419541">Bowlby (1982)</xref> conjectures that children who do not build secure attachments to their caregivers early in life are likely to develop problem behaviours later on (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1359105311419541">Cooper, Shaver, &amp; Collins, 1998</xref>). In contrast, when adolescents have a good relationship with their parents and feel close to them, they are more open to their influence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1359105311419541">Hahm, Lahiff, &amp; Guterman, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1359105311419541">Kuntsche &amp; Kuendig, 2006</xref>) and consequently less prone to such behaviours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1359105311419541">Rose, Dick, Viken, Pulkkinen, &amp; Kaprio, 2001</xref>). Social control theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1359105311419541">Hirschi, 1969</xref>) also holds that parental attachment—defined as a child’s emotional bond to his or her parents—prevents the child from doing anything that could compromise the relationship and thus from engaging in deviant or delinquent behaviours.</p>
<p>The two processes—restricted opportunities and transmission of prosocial values—are the background for the hypotheses we want to test here. We consider both processes to be concurrent but not mutually exclusive. We assume that evidence of a strong association between JFA frequency and lower levels of problem behaviour supports the hypothesis of restricted opportunities. When an adolescent greatly enjoys the JFA in which he or she participates, we take this as a sign of mutual trust, secure attachment, and a condition that favours the transmission of prosocial values, all of which are associated with lower levels of problem behaviours.</p>
<p>We hypothesize that there are lower levels of adolescent problem behaviours in families that do a variety of JFA, at least from time to time (labelled ‘active families’), compared to those families who largely do not. For ‘active families’, we use JFA frequency and enjoyment indices, as well as an interaction variable to determine whether the protective effect of JFA on different forms of problem behaviours is primarily due to restricted opportunities or to the parent-child transmission of personal values, confidence and trust.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section3-1359105311419541">
<title>Study design</title>
<p>The Swiss contribution to the international survey ‘Health Behaviour in School-Aged Children’ (HBSC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1359105311419541">Currie et al., 2008</xref>) was used as the database for the present study. The HBSC survey has been conducted every four years in more than 40, mostly European, countries since 1982 under the aegis of the World Health Organization (WHO).</p>
<p>The data were collected anonymously with a self-completed standardized questionnaire between January and April 2006. Teachers administered the questionnaires in the classroom. The students completed the questionnaires independently during one school period (about 45 minutes).</p>
<p>Permission to conduct the study was obtained from the educational authorities of each participating canton and from the principals of the selected schools. The survey procedures were also approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee of the University of Lausanne. Students were free to choose whether to participate or not, and confidentiality was guaranteed at all stages of the study.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1359105311419541">
<title>Sample</title>
<p>Based on a list of all public school classes in Switzerland, 8th and 9th grade classes were randomly sampled and a response rate of 85.7% was achieved. In total, the sample comprises 3968 13– to 16–year-old students. 16 participants (0.4%) who did not indicate their gender were excluded, as were the 110 (2.8%) participants who had one or more missing values in the outcome variables. The 83 participants (2.1%) with more than three missing values in either the eight JFA frequency items or the eight JFA enjoyment items were excluded too, as were eight participants (0.2%) with unrealistic values (indicating a daily frequency for all JFA). The final sample consisted of 3751 13– to 16–year-old students (94.5% of the raw sample).</p>

<title>Measures</title>
<sec id="section6-1359105311419541">
<title>Dependent variables</title>
<p>To measure weekly <italic>tobacco use</italic>, the students were asked “How many cigarettes did you smoke over the last seven days?”, with response categories ‘none’, ‘less than one’, ‘less than one per day’, ‘1–5 per day’, ‘6–10 per day’, ‘11–20 per day’ and ‘more than 20 per day’. Midpoints of categories were used and multiplied by seven. The upper category was recoded with 157.25 (i.e. 141 plus half the range to the mid-point of the adjacent category).</p>
<p><italic>Frequency of drunkenness</italic> was measured by the question “In the last 30 days, how many times have you done the following?”, and ‘I was drunk’ being one item. The response categories were ‘never’, ‘once or twice’, ‘3–5 times’, ‘6–9 times’, ‘10–19 times’, ‘20–39 times’ and ‘40 times or more’. Midpoints of categories were used and 45.75 for the upper category.</p>
<p><italic>Frequency of cannabis use</italic> was assessed in the same way as frequency of drunkenness, with the question “Have you ever consumed cannabis in the last 30 days?”</p>
<p>To measure <italic>bullying</italic>, the students were asked “How often have you taken part in bullying other classmates at school in the past couple of months?” The response categories were ‘I have not bullied other students in the past couple of months’ (coded as 0), ‘that has only happened once or twice’ (0.5), ‘two to three times a month’ (2.5), ‘about once a week’ (4) and ‘several times a week’ (8).</p>
<p><italic>Fighting</italic> was assessed with the question “How often have you been involved in a fight or brawl in the past 12 months?” Students could indicate: ‘I have not been involved in a fight’ (coded as 0), ‘once’ (1), ‘twice’ (2), ‘three times’ (3) and ‘four times or more’ (4.5).</p>
<p>Since the distributions of these frequency measures were skewed to the left, the logarithm was taken for regression analyses, as recommended by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1359105311419541">Tabachnick and Fidell (2001)</xref>. Such a transformation not only approximates normal distribution, but also reduces the impact of outliers.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1359105311419541">
<title>Independent variables</title>
<p>Students were asked how often they did eight specific JFA (“How often do you and your family usually do each of these things all together?”), and how much they liked them (“Do you like to do these things with your family?”). Both questions concerned the following eight activities: (1) watch TV or a video together; (2) play indoor games together; (3) eat a meal together; (4) go for a walk together; (5) go places together; (6) visit friends or relatives together; (7) play sports together; (8) sit and talk about things together.</p>
<p>For the question on frequency, the answer categories were ‘every day’ (coded as 5), ‘almost every day’ (4), ‘about once a week’ (3), ‘less often’ (2), or ‘never’ (1). For the question on enjoyment, the answer categories were ‘like very much’ (coded as 4), ‘rather like’ (3), ‘don’t like very much’ (2) and ‘don’t like at all’ (1), as well as ‘my family doesn’t do this’.</p>

<title>Analytical strategy</title>
<sec id="section9-1359105311419541">
<title>Index construction</title>
<p>Given that earlier research found that JFA frequency is dependent on the gender and the age of adolescents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1359105311419541">Zaborskis, Zemaitiene, Borup, Kuntsche, &amp; Moreno Rodriguez, 2007</xref>), we split our sample into four groups: boys aged 13 or 14 (M = 14.4, SD = .43); boys aged 15 or 16 (M = 15.6, SD = .45); girls aged 13 or 14 (M = 14.3, SD = .44); and girls aged 15 or 16 (M = 15.6, SD = .44). The construction of the index and all subsequent analyses were performed separately for each of these groups.</p>
<p>If the teenage respondents had never taken part in a particular family activity, they were logically not in a position to indicate whether they enjoyed it or not. Thus, the 284 students (7.6%) who stated that they never undertake four or more of the JFA were classified as adolescents from ‘inactive families’ and were excluded from both indices and from the subsequent multivariate analyses (cf. below).</p>
<p>In the end, the multivariate analysis sample consisted of 3467 students who had taken part in at least four of the eight JFA. We refer to this group as adolescents from ‘active families’. Of these, 746 (23.5%) indicated doing seven out of the eight JFA, while 423 (12.2%) indicated doing six out of the eight, and 283 adolescents (8.2%) only five.</p>
<p>The JFA frequency index—and by analogy the JFA enjoyment index—was calculated as a weighted mean score, as recommended by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1359105311419541">Zaborskis and colleagues (2007)</xref>. Using principal component analysis and the pair-wise exclusion of missing values, weights were determined separately for frequency and enjoyment, and for each of the four groups.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1359105311419541">1</xref></sup> This approach has the advantage that each item contributes to the mean score according to its contribution to the total score variance. If an individual had missing values on between one and three of the eight JFA items, the mean score was calculated based on the remaining four to seven items.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1359105311419541">
<title>Statistical analyses</title>
<p>We first used t-tests to analyse whether there are any differences in the mean level of problem behaviours between adolescents from ‘inactive families’ and those from ‘active families’.</p>
<p>Subsequently, for adolescents from ‘active families’, we used multiple linear regressions to investigate whether JFA frequency or enjoyment, or an interaction between the two can predict tobacco, alcohol and cannabis use, and bullying and fighting, respectively. We checked correlations between the JFA frequency and enjoyment indices. These were found to be reasonably low (Pearson’s r &lt; 0.5), thus allowing their mutual inclusion in a multiple linear regression. To facilitate comparisons, the independent variables were Z-transformed. As recommended by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1359105311419541">Jaccard and Wan (1996)</xref>, interaction terms were obtained by multiplying the two Z-standardized indices (interaction = Z(frequency index) * Z(enjoyment index)). In a first step we calculated regression models using only the JFA frequency and enjoyment indices. In a second step we added the interaction variable. To illustrate the interaction effect, the level of a given outcome variable was plotted as a function of the JFA frequency index for both above-median and below-median JFA enjoyment.</p>
<p>All analyses were performed with Stata 10.1 and adjusted for the design effects of clusters (school classes) by using the Huber-White sandwich estimator for standard errors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1359105311419541">Stata Corp, 2009</xref>). When interpreting the results, we consider both significance levels and the consistency of results across gender and age groups and outcome variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1359105311419541">Rothman, 2002</xref>).</p>

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1359105311419541">Table 1</xref> shows both the means and the standard deviations for the frequency and enjoyment items of the eight JFA among adolescents who indicated that they had taken part in at least half of them. In all four groups, ‘eating a meal together’ is by far the most frequent and the most popular JFA, whereas ‘playing sports together’ is the least frequent, and ‘going for a walk’ the least popular. As a measure of inter-item correlation, Cronbach’s alpha varies between 0.63 and 0.67 for the frequency items and is about 0.82 for the enjoyment items.</p>

<p><italic>Note</italic>: Adolescents who do fewer than four activities (adolescents of ‘inactive families’) were excluded because their enjoyment of the activities could not be assessed reliably (for the number of cases, see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1359105311419541">Table 2</xref>).</p>

<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1359105311419541">Table 2</xref>, differences in substance use and aggressive behaviour can be observed between age and gender groups: in general, the prevalence of substance use and aggressive behaviour tends to be higher among 15– and 16–years-olds than among the 13– and 14–year–olds. The same holds for boys compared to girls. However, much more important than these age and gender differences are the variations within the groups, i.e. between adolescents from ‘active families’ and those from ‘inactive families’. Teenagers who report doing hardly any JFA (‘inactive families’) tend to smoke more cigarettes per week, to have been drunk, to have used cannabis more often and to have been more frequently involved in bullying or fighting. Although the results were not always statistically significant, the direction of the relationship was consistent in all groups.</p>

<p>Multiple linear regressions were calculated for adolescents from ‘active families’ so that both the frequency and the enjoyment variables could be included, as well as their interaction term. According to the models without the interaction term (see the ‘a’ columns in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1359105311419541">Table 3</xref>), enjoyment of JFA, regardless of frequency, was consistently linked to lower levels of substance use and the violent behaviours addressed in this study. This holds true for all four groups, i.e. for boys and girls, and for the different age ranges.</p>

<p>As regards JFA frequency, a less consistent picture emerged. Among boys, no clear pattern could be detected, as the algebraic sign changed from one outcome variable to the other, and the regression coefficients were only minor in terms of effect size and were never significant. Among girls, we observed that there tended to be inverse relationships, albeit not always significant, between JFA frequency and the problem behaviours of substance use and involvement in fighting (but not bullying). Only for 15– and 16–year-old girls was a consistent and significant pattern found for the inverse relation between JFA frequency and the substance use variables.</p>
<p>A closer examination of the size of the regression coefficients of the JFA enjoyment and frequency indices revealed that the (inverse) association with the different problem behaviours was always much stronger (at least by a factor of 2, with one single exception) for enjoyment than for frequency.</p>
<p>We checked for a possible interaction between JFA frequency and enjoyment by including in the regression model a variable that was the product of the two indices (see the ‘b’ columns in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1359105311419541">Table 3</xref>). The interaction term was hardly ever significant. However, it was striking that the algebraic sign of its coefficient was almost always positive. The meaning of this is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1359105311419541">Figure1</xref>, which plots cannabis use among 15– and 16–year–old girls. Within the group who reported above-median enjoyment of JFA, the impact of increasing frequency is much lower (or even negligible) than it is for the group reporting below-median enjoyment, while an increase in the frequency has a much stronger effect.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Drawing on from primary socialization theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1359105311419541">Oetting, et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1359105311419541">Oetting &amp; Donnermeyer, 1998</xref>), we propose two principal arguments to explain the inverse relationship between JFA and adolescent problem behaviour: 1) JFA restrict adolescents’ opportunities to engage in problem behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1359105311419541">Crawford &amp; Novak, 2002</xref>); 2) JFA promote and encourage trust, self-confidence and the transmission of prosocial values from parents to adolescents which, in turn, curbs the development of problem behaviours. The aim of the study was to test these two hypotheses empirically by investigating the link between both JFA frequency and enjoyment and problem behaviours.</p>
<p>In a first step we analysed differences in problem behaviour between adolescents who did hardly any JFA (from ‘inactive families’), and those who undertook at least a minimum number of JFA (from ‘active families’). These analyses found that there were consistently higher frequencies of substance use and violent behaviours among adolescents from ‘inactive families’. These results are in line with earlier research on JFA and problem behaviours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1359105311419541">Garmiene, et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1359105311419541">Granado Alcon &amp; Pedersen, 2001</xref>). However, as we could not control for levels of enjoyment, this result cannot be used to explicitly support or contradict either of the two proposed hypotheses.</p>
<p>Among adolescents from ‘active families’ we conducted multiple regression analyses where we could disentangle the JFA frequency and enjoyment variables. These results showed a very clear and consistent association between enjoyment and lower levels of problem behaviours, even when controlled for frequency. Although the latter also tends to be inversely related to problem behaviours, this trend is not consistent and tends to be much weaker than the one observed for the association between enjoyment of JFA and problem behaviours.</p>
<p>When explaining the association between JFA and adolescent problem behaviour, it therefore seems that the adolescents’ enjoyment of these activities is more important than how often they actually undertake them. These results support the hypothesis that it is through improving mutual trust, secure attachment, and transmission of prosocial values from parents to child that JFA can protect against adolescent problem behaviours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1359105311419541">Hahm, et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1359105311419541">Kuntsche &amp; Kuendig, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>However, the frequency of JFA can also protect against adolescent problem behaviours, at least among certain groups. This appears to be the case with respect to substance use for girls, especially those aged 15–16 and those who rated their enjoyment of JFA relatively low, thus supporting the restricted opportunities’ hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1359105311419541">Crawford &amp; Novak, 2002</xref>). The protective effect of JFA enjoyment, though, was still stronger even for this group. We should add that the finding should not be extended to other groups of teenagers, as adolescents who like JFA tend to be much less prone to substance use, regardless of how often they participate in such activities.</p>
<p>The internal consistency between the items in the enjoyment index (i.e. the enjoyment of the eight JFA) was high (Cronbach’s alpha &gt; 0.8), indicating that the enjoyment index can be considered a global measure of the enjoyment that adolescents derive from activities they undertake with their family.</p>
<p>The present study reaches a similar conclusion to that of Stattin and Kerr in their reconceptualization of parental monitoring (2000): strong parental control over children’s behaviour in their leisure time seems to be a much less effective means to prevent children from engaging in problem behaviour than building a strong emotional bond based on trust and confidence.</p>
<p>The present study has a number of strengths. It is, to our knowledge, the first to include differentiated measures of JFA frequency and enjoyment in the analysis of a wide range of adolescent problem behaviours. The data used in this study is nationally representative for pupils in Switzerland in the chosen age ranges. The large sample size makes it possible to conduct separate analyses of distinct groups of adolescents that also take accurate account of the variations in JFA patterns across age groups and gender described in previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1359105311419541">Zaborskis, et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>However, the present study has also some limitations, such as the rather low effect sizes—9% or below—in terms of explained variance in our regression models. Without question, other factors besides JFA may be more influential on adolescent problem behaviours. Nevertheless, given that all analyses were performed separately for gender and age groups (two variables accounting for a considerable part of the different problem behaviours), the effect size should not be underestimated. Another limitation of this study is that the data are cross-sectional and the construed directions of the found effects are based solely on theory. For further research, it would be desirable to use longitudinal designs to investigate the relationship over time.</p>
<p>Based on the results of our research, we conclude that quality rather than quantity appears to be a determining factor for the protective effect of JFA a finding which family-based prevention efforts should take into account when dealing with adolescent problem behaviours. Parents should be encouraged to engage in JFA with their children, not so much as an end in themselves, but as means to strengthen bonds of mutual trust within the family and to create opportunities for disclosure. Parents, therefore, should try to choose joint activities that their children would potentially enjoy.</p>
