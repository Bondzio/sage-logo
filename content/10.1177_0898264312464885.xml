<p><bold>Objectives:</bold> Identify factors associated with changes to health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in baby boomers. <bold>Methods:</bold> Panel data were collected on baby boomers at two time points, 2000-2002 and 2004-2006. A fixed-effects model was used to identify associations between changes in the dependent variable (SF-36 summary scales) and changes in independent variables (health indicators/employment status). <bold>Results:</bold> Mental health problems, being out of labor force, sedentary behavior, and severe lung disease were associated with deterioration in physical and mental HRQoL. Obesity was associated with deterioration in physical HRQoL whereas cardiovascular disease was associated with deterioration in mental HRQoL. Unemployment, full-time employment, and absence of lung disease symptoms were associated with improvements in physical and mental HRQoL. <bold>Discussion:</bold> If we are to maximize the future labor participation, and HRQoL, of this cohort, it will be necessary to reduce obesity and sedentary behavior and to further investigate the association between health and employment.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Life expectancy at birth increased significantly over the 20th century both in Australia and in other developed countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0898264312464885">Australian Bureau of Statistics [ABS], 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0898264312464885">Kinsella, 1992</xref>). More recently, there has been a substantial increase in life expectancy at age 50 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0898264312464885">Table 1</xref>). This is mainly due to a reduction in CVD (cardiovascular disease–related mortality, which fell by around 76% between the years 1968 and 2007 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0898264312464885">Australian Institute of Health and Welfare [AIHW], 2010</xref>, p. 141).</p>

<p>One impact of medical advances and technology is to increase the survivorship rate of those with poorer health, potentially resulting in a higher proportion of the older population having chronic conditions and/or disabilities than in the past (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0898264312464885">Mor, 2005</xref>). Both Australian and international data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0898264312464885">AIHW, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0898264312464885">Crimmins &amp; Beltrán-Sánchez, 2011</xref>) indicate that a substantial proportion of the extra years gained may be lived with a disability. This suggests that an unintended consequence of medical advances, and the longer life expectancies they deliver, may be a trade-off in terms of health, resulting in a diminished quality of life (QoL). These trends will have a significant impact at both the macro and individual level, particularly with the large baby boomer cohort beginning to enter older age groups. This article expands on the baby boomer health literature through an examination of their health status and an investigation of the factors that influence their health and health-related QoL (HRQoL) over time.</p>
<p>Although it is sometimes assumed that baby boomers will have better health than previous generations, recent research suggests that the emergence of an obesogenic environment, which encourages excessive food intake and provides little opportunity for the integration of physical activity into everyday life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0898264312464885">Buckley, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0898264312464885">French, Story, &amp; Jeffery, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0898264312464885">Hill &amp; Peters, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0898264312464885">Lake &amp; Townshend, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0898264312464885">Offer, 2006</xref>), will contribute to a significant increase in chronic diseases and in medical interventions such as knee replacements and bariatric surgery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0898264312464885">Adams, Tucker, Hugo, Hill, &amp; Wilson, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0898264312464885">World Health Organization [WHO], 2011</xref>). In turn, these processes will reduce workforce capacity and place an added burden on the health system. Health, therefore, is critical, particularly given the fiscal challenges posed by population aging. These include an increase in costs related to health, aged care, and pensions, and a reduction in productivity due to a decrease in the number of new entrants to the labor force and an increase in the age profile of existing workers who are more likely to exit the work force or work part-time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0898264312464885">Access Economics, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0898264312464885">Treasury, 2010</xref>, p. 11).</p>
<p>In Australia, and other developed countries, a key strategy to manage the effects of population aging is to increase and extend labor participation in middle age and older people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0898264312464885">Casey et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0898264312464885">Productivity Commission, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0898264312464885">Treasury, 2010</xref>). The Australian Government has introduced a number of policies to achieve this, such as increasing the age criteria for the Pension to 67 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0898264312464885">Commonwealth of Australia, 2009a</xref>, p. 9), the Work Bonus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0898264312464885">Commonwealth of Australia, 2009a</xref>, p. 11), and the Transition to Retirement Measure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0898264312464885">Australian Taxation Office, 2007</xref>). On the expenditure side, efforts are being made to contain future health care costs through reforms to the hospital and primary care sectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0898264312464885">Commonwealth of Australia, 2009b</xref>) and through an increased emphasis on health promotion and disease prevention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0898264312464885">Department of Health and Ageing [DOHA], 2009</xref>). However, Australian government policies in these two key domains are not well integrated despite emerging research that suggests strong associations between work and health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0898264312464885">Costa et al., 2004</xref>). Future policy integration in these domains is essential, as health is a critical mediating factor in the effectiveness of government strategies to increase and extend labor participation.</p>
<p>The entry of the unusually large baby boomer cohort into older age groups will amplify the effects of population aging. Currently, baby boomers constitute the core of the mature age workforce and their full or partial departure from the labor market will impact productivity, knowledge retention, and age pension expenditure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0898264312464885">Productivity Commission, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0898264312464885">Taylor, 2006</xref>, pp. 73-74). Therefore, identifying the factors influencing their health and labor participation has become a matter of some urgency both in terms of the future well-being of this cohort and the impacts associated with their transition into retirement.</p>
<p>There is a diverse literature on baby boomers’ health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0898264312464885">AARP, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0898264312464885">Adams et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0898264312464885">Hunter, Wang, &amp; Worsley, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0898264312464885">Murray, Pullman, &amp; Rodgers, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0898264312464885">Schofield &amp; Earnest, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0898264312464885">Temple, 2006</xref>), of which a reasonable proportion focuses on health status and trends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0898264312464885">Adams et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0898264312464885">Atlantis, Lange, &amp; Wittert, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0898264312464885">Chen, Cohen, &amp; Kasen, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0898264312464885">Evandrou &amp; Falkingham, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0898264312464885">Leveille, Wee, &amp; Iezzoni, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0898264312464885">Martin, Haren, Taylor, Middleton, &amp; Wittert, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0898264312464885">Rice, Lang, Henley, &amp; Melzer, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0898264312464885">Schofield, Passey, Earnest, Gloor, &amp; Shrestha, 2007</xref>) and associations between health and labor force participation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0898264312464885">Cai &amp; Cong, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0898264312464885">Gong &amp; McNamara, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0898264312464885">Schofield et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0898264312464885">Schofield, Shrestha, Passey, Earnest, &amp; Fletcher, 2008</xref>). Although this literature demonstrates some common themes there are also contradictions. Not surprisingly, most studies that included BMI as an indicator found that obesity was higher in the baby boomer cohort (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0898264312464885">Atlantis et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0898264312464885">Leveille et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0898264312464885">Martin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0898264312464885">Rice et al., 2010</xref>). This was also the case for multiple chronic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0898264312464885">Chen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0898264312464885">Evandrou &amp; Falkingham, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0898264312464885">Rice et al., 2010</xref>), mental illness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0898264312464885">Chen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0898264312464885">Rice et al., 2010</xref>), and diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0898264312464885">Atlantis et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0898264312464885">Martin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0898264312464885">Rice et al., 2010</xref>). Findings on self-rated health (SRH) were less consistent, with one study finding no change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0898264312464885">Rice et al., 2010</xref>), a second finding an increase in poor-fair SRH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0898264312464885">Chen et al., 2007</xref>), and a third study finding first an improvement and then a decline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0898264312464885">Martin et al., 2009</xref>). CVD also showed some variation, with one study finding a decrease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0898264312464885">Atlantis et al., 2009</xref>) compared to others that found an increase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0898264312464885">Martin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0898264312464885">Rice et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Although the literature on baby boomers’ health is expanding there are still some major gaps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0898264312464885">Humpel et al., 2010</xref>). With some exceptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0898264312464885">Leveille et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0898264312464885">Schofield et al., 2007</xref>), few studies have analyzed trends within the baby boomer cohort over time, with most focusing on differences between baby boomer and pre–baby boomer cohorts. In addition, few studies involve repeated measures on the same sample of baby boomers. Although we found one such Australian study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0898264312464885">Cai &amp; Kalb, 2005</xref>), a substantial proportion of this sample were pre-boomers, with birthdates going as far back as 1937. Equally, we found no evidence of studies that set out to examine the factors associated with changes to baby boomers’ health over time, although <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0898264312464885">Rice and colleagues (2010)</xref> differentiated between period and cohort effects in their comparison of pre-boomers and boomers.</p>
<p>The assessment of health in the studies reviewed above is limited to the use of health indicators such as SRH, obesity, smoking, and the prevalence of specific diseases. This makes it possible to determine changes in the prevalence of individual conditions, but improvements or declines in overall health cannot be identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0898264312464885">Fryback, 2010</xref>). Although SRH has a high correlation with biomedical markers of disease, and therefore is deemed a good indicator of physiological health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0898264312464885">Jylhä, Volpatob, &amp; Guralnikc, 2006</xref>), its inability to distinguish between physical and psychosocial health means that it cannot measure health as comprehensively as a generic profile such as the SF-36, which assesses both physical and mental health across eight distinct domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0898264312464885">Fryback, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>This article is a step toward filling the gaps noted above and builds on baby boomer research focused on health status and health and labor participation. Previous research suggests that overall health, as measured by HRQoL instruments, is influenced by socioeconomic status (SES; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0898264312464885">Robert et al., 2009</xref>) as well as by individual health conditions. Therefore, it is reasonable to hypothesize that employment status, as a proxy for SES, would be associated with changes to HRQoL. Equally, employment status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0898264312464885">Costa et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0898264312464885">Department for Work and Pensions, 2006</xref>, p. 12; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0898264312464885">Winefield et al., 2002</xref>) and work environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0898264312464885">Michie &amp; Williams, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0898264312464885">Niedhammer, Goldberg, Leclerc, Bugel, &amp; David, 1998</xref>) have been shown to influence health either negatively or positively. These associations point to the importance of including employment status as an independent variable when examining changes to baby boomers’ HRQoL over time. In addition, as both health expenditure and labor participation influence the ability to manage the demographic shift to an older population, the inclusion of both variables in the analysis has value from a policy perspective.</p>
<p>In contrast to previous studies, we employ a composite measure of health (SF-36), as well as a range of health indicators (risk factors and chronic conditions), to examine changes to baby boomers’ health. This allows us to identify changes in individual conditions as well as changes to overall health. In addition, the use of a longitudinal sample, in conjunction with a composite measure, enables us to construct a model to examine which health and demographic factors influence changes to overall health across time. Identifying these factors will contribute to the evidence base from which focused interventions can be developed to improve health in this cohort. The study is framed through the following research questions:</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>The study is based on a cohort of South Australian baby boomers (1946-1965) drawn from the North West Adelaide Health Study (NWAHS), a population-based biomedical cohort study that incorporates a representative cross-section of urban-based adults (18-90 years old; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0898264312464885">Grant et al., 2006</xref>). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0898264312464885">Table 2</xref> sets out the demographic profile of the baby boomer subsample. The conceptual framework of the NWAHS and the methods of selection have been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0898264312464885">Grant et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0898264312464885">Hugo, Taylor, &amp; Dal Grande, 2008</xref>). Persons aged ≥18 years from households selected at random from the electronic white pages directory were eligible. In Stage 1 of the Study, which was undertaken between 2000 and 2002, a total of 4,060 respondents completed surveys and underwent clinical assessments; 36% (<italic>n</italic> = 1,448) of these were baby boomers (1946-1965).

<title>Data Items</title>
<p>We use the physical and mental component summary scores (PCS and MCS) of the SF-36 as our composite measure of health. The SF-36 is a generic health profile based on 36 questions from which are constructed 8 scales that group into 2 clusters, physical and mental health, with the latter incorporating both an emotional and social component (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0898264312464885">Fryback, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0898264312464885">Sanson-Fisher &amp; Perkins, 1998</xref>). The use of norm-based scoring to compute the scales in the SF-36 makes it possible to identify how the health of individuals or groups differs from population norms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0898264312464885">Fryback, 2010</xref>). Originally developed to evaluate the outcomes of medical care on HRQoL, its encompassing of both physical and psychosocial health and its aggregate nature make it an excellent instrument for contrasting health in the same population across time.</p>
<p>Medical assessment of participants was undertaken at both Stage 1 and 2 and included measurements of height (to the nearest 0.5 cm using a stadiometer) and weight (to the nearest 0.1 kg in light clothing and without shoes using standard digital scales). Body mass index (BMI; kg/m<sup>2</sup>), waist circumference, and waist hip ratio were measured as continuous variables. A fasting blood sample of 10 ml was taken to measure total cholesterol, triglyceride, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and low-density lipoprotein (LDL). Blood pressure was obtained using a calibrated sphygmomanometer on the average of two recorded measures. Elevated cholesterol was determined if total cholesterol was ≥ 5.5 mmols/l; elevated blood pressure was determined by ≥90 mmHg diastolic or ≥140 mmHg systolic, or treatment; diabetes was determined by a fasting plasma glucose ≥7 mmol/l or a prior doctor diagnosis of diabetes. Respiratory symptoms were assessed with the chronic lung disease (CLD) Index (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0898264312464885">Selim et al., 1997</xref>) and spirometry. The CLD has been validated in Australian populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0898264312464885">Ruffin et al., 2000</xref>) and postbronchodilator spirometry (Microlab 3300 spirometer, Micro Medical LTD, Kent, UK) was conducted according to American Thoracic Society criteria. Asthma was identified by current self-reported physician-diagnosed asthma or demonstration of a significant acute bronchodilator response of at least 12% of baseline FEV1. Airways obstruction, consistent with chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD), was determined by the FEV1/FVC ratio of &lt;70%.</p>
<p>Questionnaire data were obtained on HRQoL (the SF-36 Health Status Questionnaire; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0898264312464885">Sanson-Fisher &amp; Perkins, 1998</xref>) measures, including alcohol consumption, smoking history, exercise patterns (calculated using National Health Survey methods; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0898264312464885">ABS, 2003</xref>), and demographic characteristics (marital status, employment status, income, country of birth, government pension, and education). A questionnaire was also used to collect data on previous doctor diagnosis of heart disease, angina, and stroke; a mental health problem (anxiety, depression, stress, any other mental health problem); and diabetes.</p>

<p>We then established the effect of key chronic conditions on HRQoL by comparing standardized SF-36 PCS and MCS scores for those with and without the chronic condition (Question 2, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0898264312464885">Figure 1</xref>). We interpreted the impact of each condition with reference to the size of its effect on HRQoL. This method draws on Kazis and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0898264312464885">Kazis, Anderson, &amp; Mennan, 1989</xref>), who discuss the use of effect sizes for interpreting the differences in standard scores between groups and identify an effect size of 0.2 or one fifth of a standard deviation as being small or mild, an effect size of 0.5 as being moderate, and effect sizes of ≥ 0.8 as being large. A more detailed description of the methods used to establish effect sizes has been previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0898264312464885">Buckley, 2011</xref>, p. 69).

<p>Drawing on theories and models put forward by Cheng <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0898264312464885">Hsiao (2003)</xref> we then used panel data analysis to assess which health and employment variables were associated with change over time in overall health, as measured by change in the PCS and MCS scores of the SF-36 over the same period<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0898264312464885">1</xref></sup> (Question 3, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0898264312464885">Table 4</xref>). Panel (longitudinal) data consist of repeated measures taken on individual sampling units. This allows the use of models with a separate intercept for each unit: y<sub>it</sub> = c<sub>i</sub> + βx<sub>i</sub> + u<sub>it</sub>. The constant term c<sub>i</sub> varies by units and is called individual (unobserved) heterogeneity. The slopes are the same for each unit. These models are applicable when there are a large number of independent units observed for only a few time periods (i.e., N&gt;&gt;T). This type of model allows us to assess the change in the dependent variables based on change in the independent variables. If the analyses show that change in the dependent variables (PCS, MCS) is associated with change in the independent variables then this provides more direct evidence of causality than is available from static cross-sectional designs or other cohort designs in which net change (i.e., overall change) alone is measured (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0898264312464885">Finkel, 1995</xref>).</p>

<p>Two of the models most commonly used in panel data analysis include random-effects and fixed-effects models. In a random-effects model, the individual effect c<sub>i</sub> is assumed to be independent of the exogenous predictors in the model. When this assumption is not met random-effects models produce biased estimates. Fixed-effects models deduct the average of all of an individual’s measures from each measurement and in doing so partial out the individual heterogeneity. Therefore, fixed-effects models are still unbiased when the exogenous predictors are correlated with the individual heterogeneity of the model. However, random-effects models are more efficient than fixed-effects models. The decision as to whether the individual heterogeneity is correlated with the exogenous variables in the model is made using a Hausman test.</p>
<p>To determine the most appropriate panel analysis model a Hausman test was performed on unweighted data. The fixed-effects model was selected and, since case weights can be applied in a fixed-effects model, the subsequent analysis was weighted. In a fixed-effects model we deduct the average over time for each individual from each observation and use these “personal mean centered” variables as input to an ordinary least squares regression. If a variable shows no variation, or if a unit (usually a person) shows no variation, it is dropped from the analysis.</p>
<p>The predictor variables that achieved significance levels of <italic>p</italic> &lt; .25 in bivariate tests were retained as candidate predictor variables for the panel analysis. The variables included in the panel analysis were income, country of birth, government pension, work status, education level, marital status, exercise level, smoking status, chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD), CLD symptoms (mild, moderate, severe), alcohol risk, diabetes, mental health problems, CVD, waist circumference, waist-hip ratio, BMI, high blood pressure, and cholesterol (including LDL/HDL).</p>
<p>Our panel data analysis was supplemented by a more detailed exploration of the relationship between HRQoL and movements into or out of different employment categories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0898264312464885">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0898264312464885">3</xref>). This was achieved by examining the mean changes in the PCS ad MCS for those leaving, staying in, or entering each separate employment status category.</p>

<list-item><p><italic>Research Question 1</italic>: How has the health and employment status of baby boomers changed over a four year period?</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Based on the bivariate analysis, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0898264312464885">Table 3</xref> shows the significant changes for each age cohort and gender between Stages 1 and 2. In the older cohort (1946-1955) there was a significant increase in cholesterol whereas for younger boomers (1956-1965) there were significant increases in CVD, asthma, and cholesterol and a significant decrease in smoking. A gender comparison shows a significant increase in CVD and asthma for men but a significant decrease in smoking, and for women the only significant change to health status was an increase of around 11% in the proportion with high cholesterol. There were also marked changes in employment status for younger boomers (1956-1965), with a significant increase in the proportion who were employed full-time at Stage 2 and a significant decrease in the proportion who were unemployed. The movement into full-time employment for younger boomers is probably largely related to women who may have experienced a reduction in child care commitments as children moved into adolescence. Indeed, the proportion of women in full-time employment had increased significantly by Stage 2. By contrast, there was a slight fall in the proportion of men who were full-time employed, a significant fall in the proportion of men who were unemployed, and a significant increase in the proportion of men nominating home duties/retirement.</p>

<list-item><p><italic>Research Question 2</italic>: What is the effect of key chronic conditions on baby boomers’ HRQoL?</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The effect of chronic conditions on HRQoL was assessed by comparing SF-36 PCS and MCS scores for those with and without the chronic condition. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0898264312464885">Figures 1.1</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0898264312464885">1.6</xref> show that arthritis, mental health conditions, and moderate or severe CLD have a substantial negative effect on QoL. Although the intensity of the effect varies slightly between younger (1956-1965) and older (1946-1955) baby boomers, the overall trends are consistent, with the data suggesting that the negative effect of chronic conditions on QoL tends to increase with age. This is particularly noticeable with severe CLD where the effect on the QoL of older boomers (PCS 2.320; MCS 2.304) is more than double the effect experienced by their younger counterparts (PCS 1.014; MCS .702).</p>

<list-item><p><italic>Research Question 3</italic>: Which variables are associated with changes to baby boomers’ HRQoL over time?</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The variables associated with changes to baby boomers’ HRQoL over time were identified through the panel analysis, which was conducted for the overall baby boomer population to retain power. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0898264312464885">Table 4</xref> shows no significant change to the PCS at the aggregate level over the 4-year follow-up period (β = 0.381, <italic>p</italic> = .104), but there was a significant improvement to the MCS (β = 1.495, <italic>p</italic> = .000).</p>
<p>Variables associated with a positive change in both the PCS and MCS included full-time employment, unemployment, and no or mild lung disease. Variables associated with a negative change to the PCS were home duties/retired, student/other, severe lung disease, sedentary behavior, self-reported mental health conditions, and obesity (BMI ≥ 30). Variables associated with a negative change to the MCS included home duties/retired, student/other, moderate or severe lung disease, sedentary behavior, self-reported mental health conditions, and CVD.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0898264312464885">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0898264312464885">3</xref> show the mean changes in the PCS and MCS for those leaving, staying in, or entering each separate employment status category and thus show how changes to overall physical and mental health are related to movements <italic>into</italic> or <italic>out of</italic> different employment categories. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0898264312464885">Figure 2</xref> shows that leaving either full-time employment or unemployment was associated with a large negative change in physical health. By contrast, <italic>leaving</italic> the retirement/home duties or student/other categories was associated with a large positive change in physical health whereas <italic>entering</italic> either of these categories was associated with a large negative change in physical health. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0898264312464885">Figure 3</xref> shows that <italic>leaving</italic> unemployment was associated with a large negative change in mental health whereas <italic>entering</italic> unemployment was associated with a large positive change in mental health. By contrast, <italic>entering</italic> the retirement/home duties or student/other categories was associated with a large negative change in mental health whereas <italic>leaving</italic> these categories was associated with a large positive change in mental health. It is notable that there was no negative change in either physical or mental health status for those whose employment status remained unchanged. Indeed, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0898264312464885">Figure 3</xref> shows that remaining in the same employment category had a slight positive association with an improvement in mental health.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Over the 4-year time frame of this study there has been a significant positive overall change in mental health. There has also been a slight improvement in physical health, but this is not statistically significant. However, overall change in these summary health status categories (PCS and MCS) is clearly influenced by employment status, lifestyle risk factors, and chronic conditions. The findings point to the complexity of the relationship between employment status and changes to health over time. The effect of employment on overall health varies by employment status and by movement into or out of the different employment categories.</p>
<p>Of marked interest is the minimal change in health status for those who are stable in an employment category over time. Indeed, the phenomena affecting health change, at least in relation to employment, seems to be associated with the phenomena of change itself. Why this is so requires further investigation. For instance, it will be important to determine why leaving full-time employment and leaving unemployment are both associated with negative health changes. We also need to understand why there was little positive health change for baby boomers who entered full-time employment during the study period.</p>
<p>Although answers to these questions will require further investigation, the data do provide some clues as well as a starting point for new hypotheses. For example, the negative change in the PCS for those who left full-time employment was considerably larger than the negative change in the MCS, suggesting that poor physical health may have triggered the decision to leave full-time employment. It is notable that the negative change in the PCS for those leaving either full-time employment or unemployment was substantially larger than that associated with leaving part-time/casual employment. Although further research is needed to accurately determine why this is so, one possible explanation is that exits from part-time/casual employment may be less influenced by physical health than exits from full-time employment and unemployment and more related to factors such as job opportunities, personal preference, women reentering the full-time workforce, and phased retirement. This interpretation is to some extent supported by the regression coefficients in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0898264312464885">Table 4</xref>, which show that part-time/casual employment was not significantly associated with changes to either the PCS or MCS. The improvement in the MCS for those who entered part-time/casual employment was also quite substantial, compared to the very marginal improvement experienced by those who entered full-time employment. This may point to the importance of part-time work as a facilitator of work–life balance, which, for some older workers, may be an important factor in the ability to maintain good mental health, particularly for those who face increased personal commitments or challenging health issues.</p>
<p>An unexpected finding from the panel data analysis was the association of unemployment with a positive change in both the PCS and MCS. The data available in this study do not allow a definitive explanation of this finding; however, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0898264312464885">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0898264312464885">3</xref> point to one possible explanation. Although <italic>staying</italic> unemployed, or never having been in the unemployed category, was associated with a small positive change in both dimensions of QoL, <italic>entering</italic> unemployment was associated with a negative change in the PCS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0898264312464885">Figure 2</xref>) but a marked improvement in the MCS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0898264312464885">Figure 3</xref>). The ability to establish causality requires multiple measurements per individual so that the temporal sequence of events can be determined, and the likelihood of one event preceding, versus following, the other can be assessed. Unfortunately, our data set only has measurements at two points; this allows a causal inference to be made but does not allow us to determine the direction of causality. Therefore, we cannot say with certainty whether unemployment contributed to poor health or poor health led to unemployment. However, if poor physical health led to unemployment this could explain the improvement in the MCS, as better mental health could be a response to no longer having to struggle with work while in poor physical health. This is to some extent supported by the fact that most of those who entered unemployment by Stage 2 were previously employed full-time.</p>
<p>A second possible explanation relates to the complexity of the causal pathways between work, depression, and psychological disturbance. If the work environment is poor and characterized by low levels of decision latitude, inadequate social support, and other such stressors, poor mental health may well be the outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0898264312464885">Karasek, 2008</xref>). If this is the case, then it is quite possible that unemployment may, at least in the beginning, result in an improvement in the MCS. Of course, the continuation of unemployment could result in deterioration of health, as work has been shown to have a beneficial effect on health and being unemployed can lead to psychological or psychiatric morbidity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0898264312464885">Department for Work and Pensions, 2006</xref>). In mature age workers, unemployment can also become a pathway to premature retirement. Indeed, this is suggested by the data in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0898264312464885">Table 3</xref>, which show that between Stages 1 and 2 there was a significant decrease in the proportion of men who were unemployed and a significant increase in the proportion who entered retirement, but negligible change for other employment categories. As exiting unemployment and entering retirement were both associated with a negative change to the PCS and MCS, it is likely that a substantial proportion of male retirement during this period was involuntary and probably precipitated by factors such as poor health and/or lack of employment opportunities. Given the importance of work for individual health and financial security, and given its strategic role in managing the challenges associated with population aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0898264312464885">Casey et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0898264312464885">Productivity Commission, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0898264312464885">Treasury, 2010</xref>), there is a need for future research to explore the nexus between the work environment, health, unemployment, skill levels, and retirement.</p>
<p>The impact that lifestyle risk factors and chronic conditions have on HRQoL (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0898264312464885">Table 4</xref>) is significant and reflects an urgent need to reduce the risk profile of this cohort. Both obesity and sedentary behavior, which are highly prevalent in the baby boomer cohort (35% obese, 68.4% sedentary/low levels of activity; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0898264312464885">Buckley, 2011</xref>), were independently associated with a reduction in QoL over time. In addition, either one or both of these risk factors contribute to cardiovascular disease, mental health problems, and CLD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0898264312464885">AIHW, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0898264312464885">Branca, Nikogosian, &amp; Lobstein, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0898264312464885">Chodzko-Zajko, Schwingel, &amp; Hee Park, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0898264312464885">Gill et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0898264312464885">Shovelton, 2009</xref>), all of which the panel analysis identified as being associated with reduced QoL over time. Obesity and sedentary behavior are also associated with arthritis, a condition that currently affects about 20% of baby boomers in this sample (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0898264312464885">Buckley, 2011</xref>) and is likely to increase in the future. As data on arthritis were not collected at Stage 1, it could not be included in the panel analysis; however, it is clear from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0898264312464885">Figures 1.2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0898264312464885">1.3</xref> that it has a strong negative correlation with QoL.</p>
<p>Significant negative changes to health between Stages 1 and 2 were primarily observed in the younger cohort and in men (CVD: <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, asthma: <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05). The only exception was a significant increase in the prevalence of high cholesterol for baby boomers of all ages and for women but not for men. There were small nonsignificant increases in the prevalence of obesity, sedentary behavior, and alcohol use, but these were mainly confined to the younger cohort (1956-1965). There was, however, a significant reduction in smoking prevalence for men and for younger boomers. Although the reduction in smoking is a positive development, ex-smokers are still likely to have a substantially increased risk of respiratory and cardiovascular disease. However, a significant reduction in smoking prevalence does suggest that there is some awareness among younger boomers of the need to adopt healthy habits if they are to optimize their health outcomes as they age. It also highlights the success of strategies to reduce smoking prevalence and indicates a need to tackle other lifestyle risk factors with equal intensity. Previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0898264312464885">Buckley, 2011</xref>) indicates that baby boomers are aware of the importance of healthy lifestyles and it will be important to capitalize on this by strengthening primary and secondary prevention initiatives in this age group. Indeed, this is likely to be an optimal use of resources, particularly in relation to the younger cohort (1956-1965) as findings from this study suggest that this stage of life coincides with the early manifestations of lifestyle-related illness.</p>
<p>The fairly low prevalence of diabetes in NWAHS baby boomers and the fact that it did not increase significantly over time is surprising, particularly given the higher prevalence rates in other Australian studies such as the Australian Diabetes, Obesity and Lifestyle Study (AusDiab; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0898264312464885">Dunstan et al., 2002</xref>) and the Florey Adelaide Male Ageing Study (FAMAS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0898264312464885">Martin et al., 2009</xref>). NWAHS prevalence rates are, however, comparable with those found in the 2001 and 2004-2005 Australian National Health Surveys (NHS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0898264312464885">AIHW, 2009</xref>). These differences in prevalence may relate to the use of different methods. For instance, the study population in FAMAS consisted solely of men and analysis was carried out with unweighted data whereas the NWAHS included men and women and used weighted data. In the NWAHS, the prevalence of diabetes was higher for men than for women. Equally, accurate comparisons with the AusDiab study are difficult to make because the age groupings used in the NWAHS do not match exactly with those used in the AusDiab. The relative stability of the prevalence rates between Stage 1 and 2 of the NWAHS may be related to respondents dropping out of the study and/or a discrepancy in respondent’s answers between Stage 1 and 2. Equally, the involvement of participants in a longitudinal study may have led to an increase in the health literacy of respondents with this leading to healthier behaviors and the prevention or delayed onset of diabetes.</p>
<sec id="section7-0898264312464885">
<title>Implications</title>
<p>Given the high prevalence of obesity and sedentary behavior, it seems reasonable to hypothesize that many baby boomers will experience a significant decrease in HRQoL as they age. This is contrary to popular rhetoric, which persistently tells us that future generations of older people will be healthier and more active than in the past. The findings from this study have, therefore, significant implications for future policies on health and work. First, there is a clear need to continue to develop and implement cross-sectoral preventative health programs and initiatives as identified in the National Preventative Health Strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0898264312464885">DOHA, 2009</xref>). In developing initiatives it will be important to take into account differences between older and younger boomers. For younger boomers, primary prevention initiatives will be important whereas for older boomers there will need to be a greater emphasis on secondary prevention and on the development of skills to effectively manage chronic conditions. Second, as the workforce ages it will become increasingly important to ensure that workplaces are age friendly and to build their capacity to meet the needs of older workers, more of whom may be managing chronic conditions and adapting to other changes in their lives. This implies a need for relevant stakeholders, such as employers, their organizational representatives, employees, unions, researchers, and government policy makers, to participate in an ongoing dialogue about how the issues associated with an aging workforce can best be addressed.</p>
<p>The study findings also highlight the importance of putting time, money, and energy into reducing the prevalence and impact of conditions such as arthritis and mental health problems, which generally contribute more to morbidity than mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0898264312464885">AIHW, 2010</xref>) and, therefore, tend to receive less attention than “headliner” conditions such as cancer or CVD. This is unfortunate, particularly as conditions such as arthritis and mental illness affect a substantial proportion of the baby boomer population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0898264312464885">Buckley, 2011</xref>), tend to be chronic in nature, and require ongoing treatment and management. For example, depression and arthritis are the two largest contributors to the disability burden in Australia, and the costs to the Australian health care system of treating mental disorders and arthritis are higher than the costs associated with treating conditions such as ischaemic heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and asthma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0898264312464885">AIHW, 2010</xref>). A failure to manage these conditions effectively will result in significant personal and social costs. At the individual level, the impact on QoL is likely to be experienced through a number of avenues such as chronic pain and discomfort, loss of functional ability, reduced ability to work, loss of autonomy, and difficulty maintaining social networks. The presence of a debilitating chronic condition may also increase a person’s vulnerability to other conditions by compromising their ability to initiate and/or maintain protective health mechanisms such as exercise and social contact. From a broader social perspective, a higher prevalence of chronic conditions will increase both the informal and formal caring load, impact on government health expenditure, increase costs associated with aged and community care, and compromise government strategies to extend labor participation in the older population.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0898264312464885">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>This study has several limitations. First, although the overall sample size (<italic>n</italic> = 1,179) is sufficient for identifying broad trends, there are some areas in which more detailed analysis is constrained by the size of variable categories. It would be useful to pursue some of the issues that emerged from this analysis with a larger sample. For instance, future research on how chronic conditions influence the employment decisions of older workers and on the extent to which their influence is mediated by work environments and policies would help to inform strategies designed to retain older workers. Second, it could be argued that the limited geographical area from which the study sample was drawn limits the generalizability of the study. However, this region includes the full spectrum of metro ecological contexts found in Australian capital cities in which 63.3% of the national population lived in 2001, and thus baby boomers from this area could be expected to bear some relationship to their counterparts across Australia.</p>
<p>A third limitation is the short 4-year follow-up; however, the high-quality population sample, the objective biomedical evidence, the range of issues covered, and the study analysis perhaps offset this. In addition, the study has shown that, given certain situations, both negative and positive changes can occur quite quickly in this cohort, thus highlighting the urgent need to encourage baby boomers to adopt lifestyles that contribute to positive change. There is also an internal consistency to the data in that changes in the metabolic variables included in the study would also help explain changes in some disease categories.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In the past, much of the health dollar has been focused on diseases that contribute to early mortality such as cancer and CVD. Most of the disease burden in these conditions is due to premature death (YLL) and only around 20% is due to years of life lost due to disability (YLD; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0898264312464885">AIHW, 2010</xref>, pp. 138-144). By contrast, a much higher proportion of the disease burden inherent in conditions such as asthma, arthritis, and mental health problems is due to YLD. As structural aging gathers momentum, the proportion of the population experiencing such conditions will increase substantially. Consequently, although preventing premature death will always be an important health objective, the demographic shift into population aging offers a compelling reason for broadening public health objectives to include the development of more effective prevention and management strategies for conditions that threaten the quality of life even if they do not threaten life itself. Population aging, particularly when combined with increased longevity, brings its own imperatives, such as the need to extend working lives and the need to develop strategies to foster good health across the whole of the life course. Life expectancy has been significantly extended, but the social impact of this achievement, within a context of population aging, has yet to be determined. The formula is simple: Longer life expectancies combined with a healthy older population will contribute to positive outcomes from population aging but longer life expectancies combined with an unhealthy older population will pose a significant social challenge.</p>
