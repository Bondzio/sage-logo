<title>Background:</title>
<p>Sialic acid binding immunoglobulin-like lectins (Siglecs) are cell surface receptors that recognize sialic acids and may attenuate immune responses and reduce inflammation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1352458512458718">
<title>Objective:</title>
<p>The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of two members of the Siglec family, SIGLEC1 and SIGLEC7, in the clinical course and disease activity of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1352458512458718">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>SIGLEC1 and SIGLEC7 expression was determined by flow cytometry in the blood monocytes of 16 healthy controls and 55 untreated MS patients (13 primary progressive MS (PPMS) patients, 13 secondary progressive MS (SPMS) patients and 29 relapsing–remitting MS (RRMS) patients (18 during clinical remission and 11 during relapse)).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1352458512458718">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>SIGLEC1 expression by CD14+ monocytes was significantly increased in MS patients compared with controls (<italic>p</italic>=0.025 for percentage of positive cells; <italic>p</italic>=0.007 for mean fluorescence intensity (MFI)). Stratification of patients into different clinical forms revealed increased SIGLEC1 expression in patients with progressive forms of the disease, particularly in those with PPMS (<italic>p</italic>=0.003 for percentage of positive cells and <italic>p</italic>=0.001 for MFI when compared with controls; <italic>p</italic>=0.031 for percentage of positive cells when compared with RRMS patients). Both inflammatory and resident monocytes contributed to the increase in SIGLEC1 expression observed in PPMS patients. SIGLEC7 expression was significantly up-regulated in blood monocytes from RRMS during relapse compared with patients during clinical remission (<italic>p</italic>=0.001 for MFI).</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The sialic acid binding immunoglobulin-like lectin (Siglec) family is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily. Structurally, Siglecs contain one N-terminal variable (V)-set immunoglobulin-like domain that binds sialic acid followed by variable numbers of C2-set immunoglobulin domains in their extracellular regions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1352458512458718">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1352458512458718"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1352458512458718">3</xref></sup> Siglecs are expressed by different cellular populations which include granulocytes, monocytes, B cells, NK cells, and CD8 cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1352458512458718">4</xref></sup> SIGLEC1 and SIGLEC7 are two members of the Siglec family that, because of their function and involvement in other autoimmune disorders, may also play roles in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis (MS).</p>
<p>An increased expression of SIGLEC1 has been observed in the peripheral blood monocytes of patients with autoimmune diseases such as systemic sclerosis,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1352458512458718">5</xref></sup> systemic lupus erythematosus,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1352458512458718">6</xref></sup> and primary biliary cirrhosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1352458512458718">7</xref></sup> SIGLEC1 is also known for its specific induction by type 1 interferons (IFNs) and Toll-like receptor agonists.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1352458512458718">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1352458512458718">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>It has been reported that SIGLEC7 is the target of suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3), a negative regulator of the Janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK/STAT) signaling pathway that is up-regulated during inflammation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1352458512458718">9</xref></sup> and with known roles in MS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1352458512458718">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>Based on these observations, in the present study we aimed to investigate the roles of SIGLEC1 and SIGLEC7 in MS by determining their expression levels in peripheral blood monocytes from patients with different clinical forms and activity phases of the disease.</p>

<title>Patients</title>
<p>Sixteen healthy controls and 55 patients with clinically definite MS who had not received treatment with corticosteroids in the three months before blood sampling were included in the study. Patients were labeled as relapsing–remitting MS (RRMS, <italic>n</italic>=18), secondary progressive MS (SPMS, <italic>n</italic>=13), or primary progressive MS (PPMS, <italic>n</italic>=13) according to the Lublin and Reingold classification.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1352458512458718">11</xref></sup> A group of RRMS patients whose blood was drawn at the time of an acute relapse was also included in the study (<italic>n</italic>=11), and was defined by the appearance of new neurological symptoms or worsening of pre-existing neurological symptoms attributable to MS which persisted for over 24 hours. None of these patients had ever received treatment with immunomodulatory or immunosuppressive therapies. The study was approved by the local ethics committees and all patient samples were collected with written informed consent.</p>

<title>Cell surface immunostaining to detect expression of SIGLEC1 and SIGLEC7 by flow cytometry in blood monocytes</title>
<p>Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated by Ficoll-Isopaque density gradient centrifugation (Gibco BRL, Life Technologies Ltd, UK) and stored in liquid nitrogen until used. Cells were stained with allophycocyanin (APC)-conjugated mouse anti-human CD14 (BD Biosciences, California, USA), fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated mouse anti-human CD16 (BD Biosciences), phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated mouse anti-human CD328/SIGLEC7 and CD169/SIGLEC1 (both from eBioscience, San Diego, USA), PE-conjugated mouse anti-human CD64 (DakoCytomation, Denmark, Europe), and isotype controls FITC- and PE-conjugated IgG1 (Biolegend, San Diego, California, USA).</p>
<p>Cells were acquired in a FACS LSR Fortessa (Becton Dickinson) and analyzed using FACSDiva software. The primary gate was established for the monocyte population based on the forward and side-scatter light properties of total leukocytes. A secondary gate was established by selecting CD14+ monocytes within the primary gate. Monocyte subpopulations, CD16+ monocytes (CD14+CD16+; resident monocytes) and CD16− monocytes (CD14++ CD16−; inflammatory monocytes) were selected based on CD14 and CD16 expression within the secondary gate. Results are presented as percentage of positive cells and as mean fluorescence intensity (MFI). Negative gates were established using the appropriate isotype controls prior to running each sample and substracted from the specific signals.</p>

<title>Determination of mRNA expression levels of SIGLEC1 in PBMC by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR)</title>
<p>Total RNA was extracted from PBMC using an RNeasy kit (Quiagen, Santa Clarita, USA) and cDNA synthesized using the High Capacity cDNA Archive kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). SIGLEC1 mRNA expression levels were determined with TaqMan® probes specific for the gene (Applied Biosystems). The housekeeping gene glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was used as an endogenous control (Applied Biosystems). Assays were run on the ABI PRISM® 7900HT system (Applied Biosystems) and data were analyzed with the 2<sup>-DDCT</sup> method.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1352458512458718">12</xref></sup></p>

<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>Statistical analysis was performed by using the SPSS 17.0 package (SPSS Inc, Chicago, Illinois, USA) for MS-Windows. A Mann-Whitney test was used to test for significant differences in SIGLEC1 and SIGLEC7 expression between healthy controls and the whole MS group, and between RRMS patients in clinical remission and during relapses. The Kruskal-Wallis test was used to analyze differences in SIGLEC1, SIGLEC7, and CD64 expression between controls and patients with different clinical forms of MS. If significant differences were found (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05), a Mann-Whitney test was then used respectively to test for significant differences between two groups. Bonferroni correction was used to correct the alpha level for multiple comparisons between monocyte markers and MS patients with different clinical forms of the disease (alpha=0.008). Correlations between SIGLEC1 mRNA expression levels (using the threshold cycle –C<sub>T</sub>- values, which are inversely related to quantity) and protein expression levels were assessed by the Spearman rank correlation coefficient. Partial correlations controlling for age were used to evaluate the relationship between SIGLEC1 and SIGLEC7 expression and clinical variables.</p>

<p>Siglecs are cell surface receptors with immunoglobulin domains that allow sialic acid-mediated recognition and cellular interactions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1352458512458718">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1352458512458718"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1352458512458718">3</xref></sup> It is also known that some members of the Siglec family are important sources of inhibitory signals that may attenuate immune responses and reduce inflammation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1352458512458718">13</xref></sup> Of the Siglecs that have been identified thus far in humans, in the present study we focused, because of their function and involvement in other autoimmune disorders, on SIGLEC1 and SIGLEC7. We investigated the potential roles of SIGLEC1 and SIGLEC7 in MS by determining their expression in peripheral blood cells from a cohort of patients with different clinical forms and activity phases of the disease. Insomuch as most Siglecs are expressed primarily in innate immune cells,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1352458512458718">13</xref></sup> and monocytes are among the main components of inflammatory infiltrates in MS brains and are known to contribute to the inflammatory process and to neuronal damage in the disease,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1352458512458718">14</xref></sup> SIGLEC1 and SIGLEC7 expression was mostly determined in the population of circulating blood monocytes.</p>
<p>When comparing the whole MS group with healthy controls, SIGLEC1 protein expression was increased in blood monocytes from MS patients. This finding was confirmed at the SIGLEC1 gene expression level by real-time PCR using PBMC. Further stratification of MS patients into clinical forms revealed that SIGLEC1 protein expression was predominantly up-regulated in patients with PPMS, and to a lesser degree in patients with SPMS. This increase was observed both in the frequency of SIGLEC1 positive monocytes and mean SIGLEC1 expression levels.</p>
<p>SIGLEC1 (also known as CD169) belongs to the group of Siglecs that lack inhibitory signaling cytosolic motifs in their cytoplasmic tails and primarily mediate adhesion events.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1352458512458718">13</xref></sup> Previous studies have shown increased expression of SIGLEC1 at the mRNA and protein levels in the blood monocytes of patients with autoimmune disease such as systemic lupus erythematosus,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1352458512458718">6</xref></sup> systemic sclerosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1352458512458718">5</xref></sup> and primary biliary cirrhosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1352458512458718">7</xref></sup> In patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, the frequency of CD14+ blood monocytes expressing SIGLEC1 positively correlated with disease activity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1352458512458718">6</xref></sup> In our study, SIGLEC1 expression did not correlate with acute disease activity, since its expression was similar between RRMS patients during clinical remission and acute exacerbations. In contrast, SIGLEC1 expression was increased during the chronic progressive phases of the disease.</p>
<p>The monocyte population in human peripheral blood is heterogeneous and can be divided into two circulating subsets based on the differential expression of CD14 and CD16,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1352458512458718">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1352458512458718">15</xref></sup> inflammatory monocytes (CD14++CD16−) and resident monocytes (CD14+CD16+), which resemble mature tissue macrophages. When SIGLEC1 expression was analyzed in these two monocyte subsets, it was observed that both inflammatory and resident monocytes contributed to the SIGLEC1 up-regulation seen in PPMS patients. The similar expression observed for the activation marker CD64 between patients with different clinical forms of MS rules out an increase in SIGLEC1 expression secondary to global activation of monocytes in patients with PPMS.</p>
<p>Whereas the frequency of SIGLEC7 positive monocytes and mean expression levels did not significantly differ between MS patients with different clinical forms of the disease and healthy controls, it was interesting to observe that SIGLEC7 expression was clearly up-regulated in RRMS patients during clinical relapses.</p>
<p>SIGLEC7 belongs to the group of Siglecs containing immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIM) in their cytoplasmic tails which are probably a source of inhibitory signals upon phosphorylation of ITIM tyrosines.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1352458512458718">13</xref></sup> SIGLEC7 is the target of SOCS3,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1352458512458718">9</xref></sup> a member of the SOCS family of inducible proteins that inhibit cytokine signaling in immune and central nervous system and has been implicated in MS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1352458512458718">10</xref></sup> Binding of SOCS3 to the phosphorylated ITIM of SIGLEC7 targets it for proteasomal-mediated degradation and blocks the inhibitory effect of SIGLEC7 on cytokine-induced proliferation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1352458512458718">9</xref></sup> Of note, SOCS3 expression by monocytes has been reported to decrease in RRMS patients during relapses compared with clinical remission.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1352458512458718">16</xref></sup> Given the inverse functional relationship existing between SIGLEC7 and SOCS3, the up- regulation of SIGLEC7 observed in the present study during acute relapses may well reflect the lack of the inhibitory effect that SOCS3 has on SIGLEC7 due to SOCS3 relapse-associated down-regulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1352458512458718">Figure 5</xref>).</p>

During clinical remission, SIGLEC7 binds to phosphorylated immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs) of SIGLEC7 and targets the protein for proteasomal-mediated degradation. Given the inverse functional relationship existing between SIGLEC7 and SOCS3, the decrease in SOCS3 expression observed at the time of clinical exacerbations results in a lack of the SOCS3-mediated inhibitory effect and subsequent up-regulation of SIGLEC7.</p>

<p>In summary, in the present study we investigated the roles of two members of the Siglec family, SIGLEC1 and SIGLEC7, in MS. SIGLEC1 expression was increased in monocytes of MS patients, particularly in patients with PPMS, and hence may play a role as biomarker of the progressive forms of MS. In contrast, SIGLEC7 expression in monocytes did not discriminate between healthy controls and patients with different clinical forms of the disease; however, SIGLEC7 expression was up-regulated during clinical exacerbations, suggesting that SIGLEC7 may be play a role as biomarker for acute disease activity in MS patients.</p>
