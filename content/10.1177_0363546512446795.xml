<p>Give me a clear blue sky over my head, and the green turf beneath my feet.</p>
<attrib>—William Hazlitt, “On Going a Journey”;</attrib>
<attrib><italic>New Monthly Magazine</italic>, January 1822</attrib>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>I’d wager that very few orthopaedic surgery residents have said to themselves, “I want to specialize in sports medicine so that I can study epidemiology! Consider the pleasures that await: Laborious data gathering! Endless number crunching! Abstruse statistics!” Despite the dubious allure of these enticements, epidemiology has always been a fundamental element of orthopaedic sports medicine and, specifically, of the <italic>American Journal of Sports Medicine.</italic> In his 1975 <italic>Journal</italic> article “Research in Sports Medicine,” Arthur Ellison called upon his colleagues to focus their research efforts on sports epidemiology.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546512446795">6</xref></sup> Ellison quoted prominent authorities including James Nicholas, James Garrick, and John Marshall to support his position. “John Marshall,” stated Ellison, “has said ‘Epidemiology is, of course, where it should begin.’ We should add, ‘Good epidemiology is where we should begin.’ ”</p>
<p>Over the years, articles in <italic>AJSM</italic> have reported the epidemiology of activities ranging from aerobic dance to luge to kite surfing. Football in all its forms has been a frequent focus of study, with American football a particularly popular topic. In an early issue of the <italic>Journal</italic>, Mueller and Blyth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546512446795">15</xref></sup> reported the ambitious North Carolina high school football injury study of 1968-1972. This complex undertaking in 43 schools included both observational and experimental components. Most prior studies of high school football injuries had based their conclusions on insurance claims or medical records; the North Carolina investigators visited every participating school on a weekly basis to verify their data.</p>
<p>One of the most fascinating aspects of the study was an examination of the possible effects of various styles of helmets (including a leather model!), shoulder pads, and footwear on the injury rate. At the time, there was increasing suspicion that traditional football cleats had a tendency to catch in the turf, leading to noncontact knee injuries. The <italic>Journal</italic> had already featured an extensive article about a “swivel shoe” designed to address this concern, with forefoot cleats affixed to a rotating turntable.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546512446795">4</xref></sup> Although this particular innovation did not achieve widespread popularity, many players did switch to “soccer-style” shoes with shorter, nubby cleats. Contrary to Mueller and Blyth’s intuition, their initial comparison of the injury rates for each shoe type failed to demonstrate any significant difference. Suspecting that the poor condition of the playing fields was masking potential differences between the shoe types, they took the extraordinary step of resurfacing and then maintaining the grass at 9 randomly chosen schools for the last 2 years of the study. The players at 3 of these schools were supplied with soccer boots, while those at the other 6 continued to play in traditional football cleats. An examination of the rates of knee and ankle injuries at all participating schools during these 2 years yielded interesting results: within the subgroup that played on well-maintained fields, boys who wore soccer-style shoes had a lower injury rate than those sporting traditional footwear. Whether they wore football cleats or soccer boots, however, all players at the 9 schools with carefully maintained playing surfaces had a significantly lower ankle and knee injury rate than those from the remaining schools, whose fields were presumably in less optimal condition.</p>
<p>The North Carolina study incorporated elements that would figure prominently in many future <italic>AJSM</italic> articles: American football, ankle and knee injuries, footwear, and playing surfaces. Subsequent studies have investigated the interaction of various combinations of these features at the recreational, scholastic, university, and professional levels. An article in the current issue of <italic>AJSM</italic>, “Incidence and Risk Factors for Injuries to the Anterior Cruciate Ligament in National Collegiate Athletic Association Football” by Dragoo and colleagues,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546512446795">5</xref></sup> examines recent experience with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries at all collegiate divisions of American football. This is indeed a fitting topic for the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) to study, since early 20th century concern for the alarming rate of serious injuries in football led to the establishment of that respected organization.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546512446795">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>Dragoo and colleagues searched the NCAA Injury Surveillance System (ISS) for all football-related ACL injuries from the 2004-2005 through the 2008-2009 playing seasons. The ISS samples about 10% of NCAA affiliates at each level of competition. Because schools can ask to participate, the sampling is not truly random but is felt to be representative of the general experience of NCAA member colleges and universities.</p>
<p>The overall rate of ACL injuries reported was 1.42 per 10,000 athlete-exposures (AEs) (95% CI, 1.27-1.59). Not surprisingly, players were about 10 times more likely to sustain an ACL injury in competition (8.06 per 10,000 AEs) than in practice (0.8 per 10,000 AEs). Scrimmages, which simulate game activity, had a much higher injury rate than more controlled practice scenarios. Linebackers and running backs had the greatest representation among the injured athletes. Although players tend to be larger and faster in the higher NCAA divisions, the level of competition did not significantly influence the ACL injury rate.</p>
<p>Since the advent of artificial turf, players, coaches, athletic trainers, and team physicians have wondered whether its use affected the risk of injury. While most athletes would rather gambol across a lush carpet of dense natural grass than a mat of verdant plastic, the prospect of greater durability and lower maintenance costs has always made synthetic turf an attractive option for those who must foot the bills.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546512446795">11</xref></sup> Dragoo and colleagues reported an incidence rate of 1.73 ACL injuries per 10,000 AEs on artificial surfaces (95% CI, 1.47-2.0) compared with 1.24 per 10,000 (95% CI, 1.05-1.45) on grass. Somewhat surprisingly, this apparent difference seemed to be largely attributable to the effect of third-generation artificial surfaces, consisting of grass-like fiber with particulate infill, which had a higher ACL injury rate than both first-generation synthetic turf and natural grass. This is a rather disappointing finding, as third-generation artificial turf was designed to simulate natural grass more closely than its predecessors in both performance and risk of injury.</p>
<p>This is not the first paper to examine the relationship between the nature of the playing surface and injury rates in American football. The findings have not always been consistent. Some studies of early types of artificial turf raised the specter of increased overall risk of injury<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546512446795">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546512446795">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546512446795">8</xref></sup> or of ACL injury in particular.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546512446795">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0363546512446795">19</xref></sup> Other investigations at the university<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546512446795">9</xref></sup> or professional<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546512446795">18</xref></sup> level have produced conflicting results. In addition, a recent review of 11 experimental studies across all football codes, which compared injury rates for natural grass and third- and fourth-generation artificial turfs, found only an increased risk of ankle injury on the synthetic surface.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0363546512446795">24</xref></sup> Just 2 of the included studies, however, involved American football. These 2 <italic>AJSM</italic> articles, which compared grass specifically with FieldTurf, actually found a higher rate of several grades or types of injury on grass in both high school<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0363546512446795">14</xref></sup> and college.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546512446795">13</xref></sup> Although it does not invalidate the findings, it should be noted that the latter study was funded by the manufacturer.</p>
<p>The relationship of playing surface to injury risk is a complex subject. It has often been pointed out that natural grass is a mutable entity that can vary greatly in its properties depending upon ambient temperature and state of hydration. Even artificial turf is not immune to the effects of environmental factors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546512446795">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546512446795">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0363546512446795">22</xref></sup> In addition, as the North Carolina study demonstrated, the playing surface cannot be considered in isolation from its interaction with the characteristics of the players’ footwear.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546512446795">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546512446795">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546512446795">20</xref></sup> Beginning with the foundational 1974 publication of Torg, Quedenfled, and Landau,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0363546512446795">21</xref></sup> numerous groups of authors have constructed mechanical devices to investigate the frictional forces between generations of shoes and playing surfaces, first in the laboratory and later on actual competition fields.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546512446795">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546512446795">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546512446795">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0363546512446795">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546512446795">23</xref></sup> Collectively, they demonstrate that specific shoe-turf combinations may lead to increased transmission of torque to the athlete’s lower limb and potentially increase the risk of injury.</p>
<p>Epidemiology studies often rely on the retrospective evaluation of prospectively gathered databases like the NCAA ISS. Ultimately, there are practical limitations on the amount of information that investigators working in the field can be expected to gather. Because so many different factors may influence injury risk, it is not surprising that the available data rarely seem detailed enough to yield all the answers we crave. In the case of the new NCAA football study of Dragoo and colleagues, it would have been productive to be able to drill down further and examine how the weather, condition of the playing surface, chosen footwear, and individual player characteristics might have influenced the rates of ACL injury reported for artificial turf and natural grass. Such additional details would have helped us discern what factors may influence and possibly modify the risk of ACL injury in American football.</p>
<p>Although the findings of this study would benefit from further confirmation, they certainly grab our attention and indicate the need for ongoing investigation of the interaction between playing surface and injuries of many types, in many sports, and at many levels of competition. Well-funded, patiently planned, and carefully conducted prospective studies are required to produce results that are detailed enough to suggest specific interventions. To paraphrase Arthur Ellison, good epidemiology is where we should continue to look for clues that may reduce the risk of injury for all athletes.</p>
