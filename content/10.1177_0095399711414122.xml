<abstract>
<p>This article presents an empirical study of the effect of middle manager quality on organizational performance. Using 6 years of data from more than 1,000 Texas school districts, the author finds that quality middle managers positively impact performance. In exploring the relationship between quality middle and upper managers, she finds that their interaction leads to improved organizational performance. This article makes two contributions to the public management literature. First, it introduces a measure of middle manager quality that allows researchers to explore the ways middle managers affect organizational performance. Second, the findings reveal that public management research has underestimated the impact of management.</p>

<p>The study of public management seeks to determine how management affects public organization performance. Researchers have been able to determine the impact of management on performance by focusing predominantly on managers at the top of the organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0095399711414122">Boyne &amp; Dahya, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0095399711414122">Hill, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0095399711414122">Meier &amp; O’Toole, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0095399711414122">O’Toole &amp; Meier, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0095399711414122">Walker &amp; Brewer, 2008</xref>). Another body of literature focuses on <italic>how</italic> public managers affect performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0095399711414122">Beam, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0095399711414122">Bertelli &amp; Lynn, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0095399711414122">Chase, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0095399711414122">Cohen &amp; Eimicke, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0095399711414122">Lynn, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0095399711414122">Morgan, Bacon, Bunch, Cameron, &amp; Deis, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0095399711414122">Riccucci, 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0095399711414122">2005</xref>). This literature provides a theory of public management generated from “best practices” research as well as organization theory and traditional public administration, and focuses largely on how to be a good career civil servant by focusing on middle-level bureaucrats.</p>
<p>Although those who study public management argue that management at all levels matters, the majority of this literature focuses on only one level of management. Large-N research focuses predominantly on top managers, whereas the best practices research focuses on middle managers. When considered together, these literatures form an incomplete picture of the relationship between management and performance. The picture is incomplete because we do not know about the importance of quality managers at different levels and of their impact together on an organization.</p>
<p>Rarely is public management studied at multiple levels despite the importance of determining the relative impact of public management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0095399711414122">Lynn, Heinrich, &amp; Hill, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0095399711414122">Riccucci, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0095399711414122">Walker &amp; Brewer, 2008</xref>). Within public organizations, there are multiple groups of managers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0095399711414122">Lynn et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0095399711414122">Mintzberg, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0095399711414122">Walker &amp; Brewer, 2008</xref>). These “echelons” or “tiers of hierarchy” include senior executives (upper managers or the strategic apex) and service managers (middle managers or the operating core) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0095399711414122">Brewer 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0095399711414122">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0095399711414122">Mintzberg, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0095399711414122">Walker &amp; Brewer, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>One’s position in an organization influences his or her behavior and perceptions. Upper managers are responsible for managing the whole organization and middle managers are responsible for managing the operations in a particular agency, unit, or program. Thus, their relative goals and behavior will reflect the demands and priorities of their agency at a given level. For example, upper managers are less likely to manage down or backward in the organization because they need to manage upward and out to politicians and the wider environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0095399711414122">Meier, O’Toole, &amp; Goerdel, 2006</xref>). In another study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0095399711414122">Walker and Brewer (2008)</xref> find that upper and middle managers have different perceptions regarding red tape. Middle managers perceive more red tape than upper level managers. Indeed, upper managers are often responsible for creating more red tape in the organization by “pushing decision making down and developing rules informally” (p. 1123). In other words, important differences in roles, tasks, responsibilities, and authority exist among these groups of managers, and these differences impact behavior and outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0095399711414122">Aiken &amp; Hage, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0095399711414122">Brewer, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0095399711414122">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0095399711414122">Walker &amp; Brewer, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0095399711414122">Walker &amp; Enticott, 2004</xref>). Thus, we would expect the quality of a manager, along a range from good to bad, to affect organizational performance differently depending on which echelon or level of the organization they are in. As it stands, our conclusions about the managerial quality–performance relationship are limited.</p>
<p>Moreover, although management at each level directly affects the organization, it also has an impact on other levels of management, which in turn influence the organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0095399711414122">Lynn et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0095399711414122">Riccucci, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0095399711414122">Thompson, 1967</xref>). Managerial levels are distinct and interrelated; they constrain and enable the functioning of the other levels and of the organization. Thus, the effect of managerial quality on performance is more than the summing of each level’s managerial quality influence; there is an interactive effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0095399711414122">Lynn et al., 2001</xref>). In other words, the relationship between management levels matters to overall performance as well.</p>
<p>In this article, I explore the effect of middle manager quality on organizational performance by creating a measure of middle manager quality. Other attempts to measure quality use survey-based measures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0095399711414122">Bloom &amp; Van Reenen, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0095399711414122">Brehm &amp; Gates, 2008</xref>). My measure of middle manager quality is based on salary. The assumption behind this approach is that better managers will have higher salaries. With a comparable measure of upper manager quality, I explore the relationship between performance and managerial quality at each level as well as the interactive effects of managerial quality on performance. This article adds to what we know about public management by attempting to answer two questions. First, what effect does middle manager quality have on organizational performance? Second, how does the relationship between quality upper and middle managers affect organizational performance?</p>
<p>The next section discusses the importance of middle managers to an organization. It presents two hypotheses. The first hypothesis addresses the effect of quality middle managers on organizational performance. The second hypothesis addresses the interactive effects of middle and upper managerial quality on performance. The third section presents the methods, including a description of the creation of a measure of middle manager quality. The final two sections summarize the results and discuss the implications of these results for public management research and practice.</p>

<title>The Importance of Quality Middle Managers</title>
<p>The literature tells us that middle managers are an integral part of an organization and that they matter to an organization in a variety of ways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0095399711414122">Brewer, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0095399711414122">Mintzberg, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0095399711414122">Morgan et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0095399711414122">Riccucci, 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0095399711414122">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0095399711414122">Wilkins, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0095399711414122">Wilson, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0095399711414122">Winter &amp; May, 2001</xref>). Research on middle managers in the private sector finds that middle managers are key strategic actors who are important for organizational performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0095399711414122">Currie &amp; Procter, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0095399711414122">Floyd &amp; Wooldridge, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0095399711414122">Nonaka &amp; Takeuchi, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0095399711414122">Wooldridge &amp; Floyd, 1990</xref>). The quality of middle managers matters because the tasks of middle managers are important to the organization.</p>
<p>Research in both the private and public sectors defines the tasks of middle managers to be similar. They are the direct supervisors of the workers in their unit and are responsible for the hiring, evaluation, and improvement of those workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0095399711414122">Brewer, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0095399711414122">Mintzberg, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0095399711414122">Wilkins, 2006</xref>). They allocate resources; create budgets, schedules, and reports; and set rules and guidelines for those below them in the organization. They build networks with those higher up in the organization, with other middle managers, and with those outside the organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0095399711414122">Morgan et al., 1996</xref>). They are responsible for creating a sense of teamwork within the unit and for motivating employees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0095399711414122">Rainey, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0095399711414122">Rainey &amp; Watson, 1996</xref>). As we have learned from research on upper level managers, how well managers perform their management tasks affects overall organizational performance.</p>
<p>However, managers at different levels have different roles, attitudes and behavior, and responsibilities that affect the organization in different ways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0095399711414122">Walker &amp; Brewer, 2008</xref>). One way that middle managers differ from upper level managers is through their location in the organization’s communication system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0095399711414122">Lipsky, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0095399711414122">Lynn et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0095399711414122">Mintzberg, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0095399711414122">Morgan et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0095399711414122">Thompson, 1967</xref>). More specifically, they play a coordinating role where they “mediate, negotiate, and interpret connections between . . . levels” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0095399711414122">Floyd &amp; Wooldridge, 1997</xref>, p. 466). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0095399711414122">Simon (1948)</xref>, communication is essential to an organization. How well middle managers communicate and coordinate can have a significant impact on organizational performance.</p>
<p>Another difference between upper and middle managers is in the implementation of policy. Although middle managers work below a policy-making level, they are largely responsible for how policy is implemented. Those at the top of the organization pass down directives and middle managers decide how those directives are best achieved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0095399711414122">Nonaka &amp; Takeuchi, 1995</xref>). The private sector literature calls this synthesizing, where middle managers “interpret ambiguous, diverse data [and frame] the perceptions of other managers and [change] the strategic agenda” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0095399711414122">Floyd &amp; Wooldridge, 1997</xref>, p. 466). They are responsible for getting what upper management wants done and do so by implementing and communicating the policies, missions, and goals of the organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0095399711414122">Lumsden, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0095399711414122">Rainey &amp; Watson, 1996</xref>). Good middle managers can make the difference in the success rather than the failure of policy.</p>
<p>Many of the qualities that the literature uses to define a quality manager are also used to define leadership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0095399711414122">Fernandez, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0095399711414122">Rainey &amp; Watson, 1996</xref>). Experience, promoting change, networking, gathering political support, granting and using discretion, and influencing others in the organization are qualities of good leaders and good managers. Given the various definitions of leadership in the literature, middle managers can be leaders in an organization just as upper managers can be (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0095399711414122">Rainey &amp; Watson, 1996</xref>). Although leadership and management are often treated interchangeably, in this article, management refers to management. Nonetheless, the quality of management is likely to be correlated with the quality of leadership.</p>
<p>The tasks of middle managers—the personnel function, resource allocation, networking, communication, and policy implementation—are essential to the operation of an organization. If these tasks are performed poorly, the organization will suffer. If these tasks are performed well, the organization will thrive. In other words, organizational performance is contingent on the ability of middle managers to perform their tasks well. My first hypothesis posits that as the quality of the middle manager increases, organizational performance will also increase. Specifically,</p>

<sec id="section2-0095399711414122">
<title>The Interaction of Upper and Middle Managerial Quality</title>
<p>In addition to the direct impact of quality middle managers on an organization, middle managers indirectly influence an organization through their relationship with upper level managers, who the literature tells us have a positive and significant effect on organizational performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0095399711414122">Meier &amp; O’Toole, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0095399711414122">O’Toole &amp; Meier, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0095399711414122">Wooldridge &amp; Floyd, 1990</xref>). In other words, good managers are important not only because of their separate influence on the organization but also because of their relationship with managers at other levels. These relationships can lead quality managers to have a greater impact on performance than they would individually. For example, upper and middle managers can complement each other’s efforts. The reasoning behind this is that quality managers will be more effective in their efforts to improve performance when they are working with quality managers at different levels in the organization. However, in a situation where one level of management is poor, quality managers will have to work harder to overcome the negative effects of poor quality management to have a positive impact on performance. Understanding how the levels of an organization interact with each other gives us the opportunity to understand more generally how management as a whole works (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0095399711414122">Kettl, 1990</xref>) and how management matters for performance.</p>
<p>In studying the relationship between managerial levels, we can see how one managerial level impacts the ability of another managerial level to affect the organization. For example, quality upper managers, when making hiring decisions, will try to hire quality middle managers because quality middle managers allow upper managers to better focus on their own tasks. This is because having quality middle managers means that upper managers can be confident in their delegation of tasks and responsibilities to middle managers. This confidence allows upper managers to focus on their managerial tasks such as strategic planning, gathering support from political principals, and mobilizing external support and resources instead of having to constantly oversee or micromanage middle managers and the organization. Without having to spend so much time managing those within the organization, upper managers are better able to motivate and lead employees, stabilize processes, and avoid or navigate shocks that may negatively impact the organization. Upper managers will be better able to perform their managerial tasks and improve performance when there are managers of quality at the middle level of the organization.</p>
<p>Moreover, research on strategic consensus finds that when there is agreement about organizational strategy at multiple levels of the organization, performance increases. Strategic consensus is a “shared understanding of strategic priorities among managers at the top, middle and/or operating levels of the organization” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0095399711414122">Kellermanns, Walter, Lechner, &amp; Floyd, 2005</xref>, p. 721). Quality middle managers improve the ability of top managers to set beneficial strategic priorities for the organization. Middle managers provide a variety of viewpoints and opinions by generating new ideas, experimenting with new behaviors, and then passing successful initiatives up to those in top management. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0095399711414122">Kellermanns et al., 2005</xref>). Input from various levels on strategy leads to a shared understanding of strategy that is important to organizational performance. Quality middle managers can affect the ability of upper managers to impact organizational performance via their role in strategic planning.</p>
<p>When middle managers have quality upper managers, middle managers are better able to focus on and perform their tasks as well. One way that quality upper managers make it easier for middle managers to do their job is that quality upper level managers provide political cover for middle-level administrators and street-level bureaucrats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0095399711414122">Meier &amp; O’Toole, 2002</xref>). This frees up valuable time and resources for middle managers to complete their tasks. Quality upper managers set clear goals for the organization, which allows middle managers to know which goals are important and thus which tasks to prioritize. Quality upper managers create a more stable and predictable system that better enables middle managers to make decisions about unit activities, materials, and resources. Finally, quality upper level managers help middle managers perform their managerial tasks by generating external support and resources for the organization and its subunits. The activities performed by quality upper managers affect the ability of middle managers to improve performance.</p>
<p>It is possible that quality management at one level may affect the ability of management at the other level to do their job but that quality managers at the other level may not. For instance, it is possible that upper manager quality may not have any impact on the ability of quality middle managers to do their tasks. In other words, a poor quality upper manager has the same effect on the ability of quality middle managers to affect the organization as a high-quality upper manager. In sum, the quality of management at one level affects the ability of managers at the other level to affect performance. Therefore,</p>
<list id="list2-0095399711414122" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 2a (H2a)</italic>: Upper level managers of higher quality will increase The impact of quality middle level managers on organizational performance.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 2b (H2b)</italic>: Middle level managers of higher quality will increase the impact of quality upper level managers on organizational performance.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>I test these hypotheses by interacting middle manager and upper manager quality in the model. Including an interactive term in the model allows me to calculate the marginal effects of management quality on performance given the quality of management at the other level. For instance, the marginal effects allow me to determine if and how the impact of middle manager quality on performance changes as upper manager quality increases or decreases. More specifically, in regards to H2a, the marginal effects of middle manager quality can tell me if middle manager quality has a lesser or greater impact on performance given various upper level manager quality. For H2b, the marginal effects of upper manager quality can tell me if upper level manager quality has a lesser or greater impact on performance given the quality of the middle managers.</p>
<p>In the next section, I present the methods and data used to explore the direct effect of middle manager quality and the interactive effects of middle and upper manager quality on organizational performance.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0095399711414122" sec-type="methods">
<title>Data and Method</title>
<p>To test these hypotheses, I have three data requirements. The first requirement is a measure of middle management quality. Moreover, I need a measure of middle management quality that can be compared with a measure of upper management quality for the same organizations. The second requirement is consistent performance measures for those same organizations. The last requirement is to have these measures over time so that I can see how middle and upper manager quality influences organizational performance over time.</p>
<p>Given these data needs, I draw from a data set of the most common public organization in the United States—school districts. Specifically, the data set includes information on all school districts in Texas.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0095399711414122">1</xref></sup> Texas is a large state and is diverse in terms of the location (urban, suburban, and rural), size, race, and class of the school districts. There is variation in this diversity as well. Some school districts are homogeneous in terms of race and class and others are extremely heterogeneous.</p>
<p>The unit of analysis is the school district because to test the hypotheses, the whole organization must be considered as we are interested in the interactive effects of multiple levels in an organization. School districts are independent local governments with their own taxing powers, are highly professionalized with certification processes for various occupations, and are fairly decentralized; there is discretion at each level of the organization, with the most discretion at the street level. School districts make an ideal case in which to study multiple levels of management. This is due to the fact that, unlike most other government agencies, it is easy to identify upper and middle managers within the organization. The structure of the school district is hierarchical with a superintendent at the top of the organization, principals in the middle, and teachers serving as street-level bureaucrats.</p>
<p>In school districts, principals are middle managers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0095399711414122">Hayes, 2004</xref>). They reside in the middle of the school district organization, between the superintendent and teachers. Moreover, the tasks they perform are those associated with middle management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0095399711414122">Lumsden, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0095399711414122">Mintzberg, 1979</xref>). They have to consult with the rest of the district team (i.e., teachers, staff, and upper levels of management) as well as the community, parents, and students when making administrative decisions regarding budgets, schedules, and the implementation of new policies. They are responsible for hiring, evaluating, and developing parallel staff. Principals also issue school status reports that district administrators and the community care about. Principals are responsible for student academic performance in ensuring that teachers are following the appropriate curriculum. They set the academic tone of the school by setting expectations and standards and by organizing the school around school achievement (i.e., goal setting and motivating employees) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0095399711414122">Hayes, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0095399711414122">Sergiovanni, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0095399711414122">Smith &amp; Andrews, 1989</xref>). Principals, because of the tasks they perform and because they bridge those at the top of the district (superintendents) with those at the lower level of the district (teachers), are middle managers.</p>
<p>Performance measures, organizational characteristics (size, location, resources, etc.), and managerial and worker data (i.e., superintendents, principals, and teachers) are provided at the district level by the Texas Education Agency (TEA). Due to missing data and a lack of variation in some variables over time, the number of observations ranges from 2,909 to 4,622. Out of 11 models, 8 have more than 4,000 cases.</p>
<p>This data set provides me with the necessary measures to test my hypotheses. First, the data set provides information about district managers so that comparable measures of middle and upper manager quality can be created. Second, the advantage of using Texas public school data is the availability of performance measures that are comparable across institutions and that are meaningful to the organization and to the community it serves. Finally, the time period of the panel data set is from 2000 to 2005, which provides me with multiple time points.</p>

<sec id="section5-0095399711414122">
<title>Middle Manager Quality</title>
<p>To test my hypotheses, I create a measure of middle management quality. What we know about managerial quality in the public sector usually comes from anecdotal evidence and case studies, and this research usually links managerial quality with leadership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0095399711414122">Beam, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0095399711414122">Rainey &amp; Steinbauer, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0095399711414122">Riccucci, 1996</xref>). To create a quantifiable measure of middle management quality, I develop a measure based on salary. This approach to measuring middle managerial quality is modeled after <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0095399711414122">Meier and O’Toole’s (2002)</xref> method for measuring upper manager quality. As with Meier and O’Toole’s validated measure of upper manager quality, the assumption behind this approach is that better principals will have higher salaries.</p>
<p>Attempts to measure middle management quality in the private sector focus primarily on managerial behavior, tasks, and leadership ability. Some researchers rely on surveys where one’s supervisor rates the quality of their subordinates. Other researchers use a case-study approach where quality judgments are based on what the observers see at those times when they are present to witness middle manager behavior. Other studies conduct interviews with superiors and subordinates to triangulate some aspect of middle manager quality. Rather than relying on the judgment of objective observers via case studies or conducting surveys and interviews of those who work with the middle manager, a salary-based method uses the observations of middle managers’ supervisors as revealed by their actions regarding monetary rewards for the middle manager.</p>
<p>The method used in this article determines quality from the observations of those who are knowledgeable about the organization, environmental demands, performance results, and the behavior of middle managers. These observations lead to judgments of the middle manager’s quality, and these judgments are revealed through supervisor decisions about salary. In other words, salary is an indirect measure of upper manager evaluations of the quality of middle managers. This method is similar to an interview or survey in that evaluations of supervisors are used. However, it is different in that it reveals an overall evaluation that is supported by a costly action, salary. Although in surveys and interviews there may be a bias to respond favorably to questions about the quality of one’s subordinates, evaluations through salary reveal the true worth of a manager’s quality.</p>
<p>Such a measure of quality relies on the idea that the market drives principals’ salaries; districts will pay more for quality principals in an effort to attract and reward talented managers. Indeed, in Texas there are no prenegotiated or base salaries for principals. Although not all principals may participate in the market (i.e., they may just accept what other principals in the district are getting), what is important is that at the margins, there is a market for principals. Marginal consumers (i.e., those districts or schools that gather information and seek out quality principals) can drive the market.</p>
<p>Moreover, those in charge of setting principal salaries are upper level managers. The principal hiring process starts with the school board and the superintendent, who get together to determine their ideal candidate. They may also form a search committee to advertise the job opening, review applications, select candidates to interview, and interview candidates. When there is not a search committee, central administration performs these tasks. Finalists, determined from the first round of interviews, visit the district and meet with administrators, teachers, and sometimes the school board. The school board, based on the recommendation of the superintendent, makes the final decision. The superintendent meets with the successful candidate to discuss the job and salary. In states without contracts and unions, such as Texas, individual negotiations occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0095399711414122">Hayes, 2004</xref>). This process occurs even if the candidate is from another school in the district. This means that professionals—those who know the worth of a quality principal—are the ones who set salaries. Thus, those districts that wish to attract quality middle managers and are able to identify them should generate a market that keeps the salary of all middle managers competitive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0095399711414122">Schneider, Teske, &amp; Marschall, 2000</xref>). The average principal salary is US$58,469 with a standard deviation of US$8,230.</p>
<p>Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0095399711414122">Meier and O’Toole’s (2002)</xref> approach of creating a salary-based measure of upper managerial quality, there are two steps to creating a measure of middle manager quality. The first step is to predict a district’s average principal salary. This variable has been logged to account for extreme values. There are multiple factors that affect salary such as the wealth of a district or if a principal has an advanced degree. The second step is to take the residuals of the model and standardize them. The idea behind this method is that what is left (i.e., what is not explained by these factors) is principal quality. For example, a principal with the reputation of turning schools around will be paid more because a district with a poorly performing school will try to attract a principal who can improve the school. The standardized residuals generated by the model predicting average principal salary is the measure of middle manager quality. In other words, the larger the residual, the greater the departure of a given district’s average principal salary from the overall average, thus indicating quality above or below the norm.</p>
<sec id="section6-0095399711414122">
<title>Step 1: Predicting average principal salary</title>
<p>To create a middle manager quality measure, it is necessary to identify the factors that influence a principal’s salary. According to a common salary model from the literature, these factors fall into four categories: district characteristics, human capital factors, personal characteristics, and past performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0095399711414122">Billger, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0095399711414122">Educational Research Service, 2008-2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0095399711414122">Ehrenberg, Chaykowski, &amp; Ehrenberg, 1988a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0095399711414122">1988b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0095399711414122">Stone, 1985</xref>). The first category comprises district characteristics. The measures for these factors are the district’s total expenditures, the tax rate, and the average revenue per student, all of which are logged. All things being equal, we would expect districts with more resources to pay higher salaries. Also included is a measure of population density to take into account the location and type of district, namely, if the district is more rural or more urban. This measure is the number of students in a district per square mile.</p>
<p>The second set of factors are human capital factors such as the principals’ education and experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0095399711414122">Stone, 1985</xref>). These measures may be problematic for predicting principal salary because we cannot include individual-level measures of experience, education, and training because there are multiple principals in a district. Therefore, the human capital factor measures are averages of these factors, specifically, the average principal experience, average principal degree, and average principal age in a district. We would expect districts to pay higher salaries for principals with more education and experience.</p>
<p>Personal characteristics, such as race and gender, also affect salary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0095399711414122">Billger, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0095399711414122">Landau, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0095399711414122">Tallerico, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0095399711414122">Weil &amp; Kimball, 1996</xref>). Minority principals may have a higher salary because of a district’s desire to increase diversity and attract and hire quality minority principals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0095399711414122">Landau, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0095399711414122">Tallerico, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0095399711414122">Weil &amp; Kimball, 1996</xref>). Minority principals may then increase the average principal salary in a district. Female principals may make either more or less money. To be a principal, one must have spent time in the classroom. Female principals may make less money because there are more women in the ranks to choose from as women comprise a large majority of teachers. However, women are less likely to move into administrative positions and so districts may pay more for female principals because they are scarce (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0095399711414122">Pounder, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0095399711414122">Stone, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0095399711414122">Tallerico, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0095399711414122">Weil &amp; Kimball, 1996</xref>). Including measures for the percentage of female principals in the district and the percentage of non-minority principals may account for the effect of personal characteristics on average principal salary.</p>
<p>The fourth factor is the relationship between salary and performance. This relationship is reciprocal in that past performance affects middle manager quality, and middle manager quality then affects future performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0095399711414122">Billger, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0095399711414122">Meier &amp; O’Toole, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0095399711414122">Stone, 1985</xref>). Therefore, to control for the effect of past performance on middle manager quality, it is necessary to adjust for this endogeneity, or the effect of middle manager quality will be biased downward. The past performance measure (past performance on the state standardized test for each district) has been purged via an instrumental variables technique to eliminate any reciprocal influence between past performance and middle manager quality. The instrumental variables are the district’s previous year’s performance on the state standardized test, revenue per pupil, and the percentage of Black, Latino, and low-income students in the district. The purged measure of prior performance is then included in the model. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0095399711414122">Table 1</xref> presents the results of the model predicting logged average principal salary. As the purpose of this model is to generate residuals, it is not necessary to comment on the findings in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0095399711414122">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<title>Step 2: Standardize the residuals</title>
<p>The middle manager quality measure is the standardized residuals from the model presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0095399711414122">Table 1</xref>. The residuals are centered on the mean of the residuals. A value of 0 means that a district has average middle manager quality. Values range from −3 to 4 where −3 is very low quality and 3 is very high quality. In districts where middle manager quality is 1 (i.e., a one <italic>SD</italic> change from 0), the average principal salary is around US$8,000 more than in those districts where middle manager quality is average (i.e., a value of 0). I expect that this measure is correlated with quality. Indeed, this measure sets up a tougher test because any measurement error creates a bias toward null findings. If my results are significant, I can be confident that middle manager “quality” matters. This measure allows for the testing of the first hypothesis, about the effect of middle manager quality on organizational performance. To test H2, I need a measure of upper management quality that is comparable with the measure of middle manager quality.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0095399711414122">
<title>Upper Managerial Quality</title>
<p>As with principals, better superintendents are rewarded in a competitive labor market with higher salaries. A measure of superintendent quality has been validated in research on the effect of superintendents on performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0095399711414122">Meier &amp; O’Toole, 2002</xref>). This measure of superintendent quality was created by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0095399711414122">Meier &amp; O’Toole (2002)</xref> who predicted superintendent salaries with variables that measure district financial resources, past performance, and the personal and professional characteristics of superintendents and then used the residuals to create a measure of superintendent quality. Values of superintendent quality range from −6 to 7, where positive values mean above average superintendent quality.</p>
<p>As both measures are standardized, they are on the same scale and therefore are comparable. To test the hypotheses about the relationship between upper and middle manager quality, the measures also need to be distinct. It is possible that the upper and middle manager quality measures are not distinct but rather the result of a salary pattern where districts that pay more/less for superintendents pay more/less for principals. If this were the case, the two measures would be correlated. They are not. The correlation between the two quality measures is .08. Now that we have measures of middle and upper manager quality, we can proceed in testing the hypotheses about how middle managers and the relationship between middle and upper managers affect performance.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0095399711414122">
<title>Performance</title>
<p>There are many ways to evaluate school district performance. In Texas, the most important and salient performance measure is student performance on the state standardized test, the Texas Assessment of Academic Skills. The federal “No Child Left Behind” policy is based on the Texas experience with this test. It is a basic skills test designed to measure if students have achieved basic reading and math skills and teacher effectiveness. All students in Grades 3 to 8 and 10 must take the test. Students in 10th grade must pass the test to graduate from high school.</p>
<p>Of course, standardized test scores are not necessarily the best way to measure all of the things that students learn in school. However, they are frequently what parents, legislators, and educators use to assess the effectiveness of schools and school districts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0095399711414122">Hanushek, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0095399711414122">Jencks &amp; Phillips, 1998</xref>). These test scores are used to rank districts and are widely reported in the news media; the state standardized test is the most visible indicator of school performance and the quality of schools. This performance measure is the percentage of students in a district who pass all (reading, writing, and math) sections of the test. The mean of this measure is 76 with a standard deviation of 13.</p>
<p>Additional measures of performance focus on more specific outcomes. The No Child Left Behind Act requires states to monitor the performance of historically low performing groups such as low-income students, African-American students, and Latino students. Districts are evaluated on the pass rates of these groups as well as the pass rate for all students. Latino and African-American communities monitor these measures closely and lobby the school board when these rates are considered unacceptable. Three other salient performance indicators are the pass rates for African-American, Latino, and low-income students.</p>
<p>Parents and educators are also concerned with how well schools are preparing children for college. In other words, parents and educators are concerned with providing children with skills that allow them to perform well and succeed beyond the K-12 system. District preparation of children for college is measured by the percentage of students who take either the Scholastic Assessment Test (SAT) or the ACT. College preparedness is measured with SAT or ACT performance. These measures are the average SAT and ACT scores. The TEA considers a student to be ready for college if he or she scores above 1,110 on the SAT (or its ACT equivalent). Thus, an indicator of college readiness is the percentage of students in the district who scored above 1,110 on the SAT or its ACT equivalent.</p>
<p>Two additional measures of school performance are attendance and drop-out rates. Attendance is important to a district for two reasons. The first reason is that children cannot learn if they are not in school. The second reason is that state aid is allocated based on average daily attendance. Daily attendance is a low-end indicator of the performance of a district and is measured with a district’s average daily attendance. Drop-out rates are another such indicator. Districts with high drop-out rates are considered to be poor-performing districts. Drop-out rates are measured with the percentage of students who drop out of school each year.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0095399711414122">
<title>Control Variables</title>
<p>More than just management influences school performance. According to education research on school performance, resources matter—schools with more resources perform better (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0095399711414122">Hanushek, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0095399711414122">Hedges &amp; Greenwald, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0095399711414122">Wenglinsky, 1997</xref>). Resources are also important because they can make the manager’s job easier; resources enable the manager to address problems and implement and fund needed programs. Monetary resources are measured with average teacher salary and the amount of state aid the district receives. Human resources are measured with a district’s average years of teacher experience and the percentage of teachers with an advanced degree.</p>
<p>The degree of difficulty of the manager’s job is also related to school performance. Difficulty is defined here in terms of resources and the heterogeneity of the district. Homogeneous districts are less difficult to manage than heterogeneous districts. For example, a homogeneous district with a wealthy student body is likely to have high performance no matter what management does (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0095399711414122">Burtless, 1996</xref>). A district with a poor and highly diverse student body will have greater difficulty in attaining high performance scores because the schools will have to make up for a less supportive home environment and deal with a more varied and complex learning environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0095399711414122">Jencks &amp; Phillips, 1998</xref>). The three measures that control for task difficulty are the percentages of Black, Latino, and low-income students in a district. These variables measure task difficulty because they reflect the homogeneity or heterogeneity of a district. Thus, all three task difficulty measures will have a negative influence on performance.</p>
<p>In addition to controlling for resources and task difficulty, the size of the district also matters. This is measured with the logged total enrollment of students in a district and the average class size. The model predicting performance is autoregressive because this year’s performance depends heavily on last year’s performance. A lagged dependent variable captures this. To test my hypotheses, I use a two-way fixed effects model where the model is fixed on the year and the district. With this model, I can make sure that there are no unique characteristics of individual school districts and years that correlate with performance. As two-way fixed effects models are often plagued with multicollinearity, I calculated the variance inflation factors for all variables. The variance inflation factors all fall below the critical value of 10. Descriptive statistics for all variables are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0095399711414122">Table 2</xref>.</p>

<p>The two hypotheses presented in this article focus on what effect middle manager quality and the interaction between middle and upper managers have on organizational performance. The first hypothesis is tested with the model presented above. The second hypothesis is tested with the same model but with the inclusion of an interaction term, where upper manager quality is interacted with middle manager quality.</p>
<sec id="section12-0095399711414122">
<title>H1: The Effect of Middle Manager Quality on Performance</title>
<p>To determine the effect of middle manager quality on organizational performance, the standardized residual measure from the model presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0095399711414122">Table 1</xref> is included in a model predicting performance. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0095399711414122">Table 3</xref> displays the results of the regression analysis for two models predicting performance on the state standardized test. The first model omits the measure for middle manager quality and the second includes it. According to <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0095399711414122">Table 3</xref>, middle manager quality exerts a positive and significant influence on state standardized test performance. Middle manager quality has a greater and significantly different effect (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) on pass rates than quality upper managers.</p>

<p>A one standard deviation change in superintendent (i.e., upper manager) quality increases performance on the state standardized test by 0.29 percentage points in the first column and 0.31 in the second column. Now let’s compare the effect of superintendent quality on the state standardized test with the effect of principal (i.e., middle manager) quality.</p>
<p>The impact of middle management quality is positive and significant for pass rates on the state standardized test. Substantively, this means that a one standard deviation change in middle manager quality increases performance on the state standardized test the next year by 2.49 percentage points. Although this effect may not seem large, it is important to remember that this is just the impact for the 1st year. The impact for the 2nd year is 0.70, the middle manager quality coefficient times the lagged dependent variable (2.49 × 0.28). Impacts for additional years can be calculated in a similar way (year 3 = .20, year 4 = .05, etc.). As the lag is geometrically distributed, middle manager quality will continue to have an effect on pass rates but at a gradually declining rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0095399711414122">Gujarati, 2002</xref>). Thus, by considering the impact of middle manager quality through the distributive lag, the impact is more substantial. Indeed, a one standard deviation change in middle manager quality ends up increasing performance on the state standardized test by 3.44 percentage points over 5 years. Moreover, because the full range of the quality measure is approximately −3 to +3, the total effect of middle manager quality on performance would be even greater.</p>
<p>The effects of middle and upper manager quality on additional measures of performance are provided in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0095399711414122">Table 4</xref>. The models are the same as in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0095399711414122">Table 3</xref>; the control variables are simply not reported. The results presented in this table further support the importance of middle manager quality to performance. As you can see from <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0095399711414122">Table 4</xref>, for 7 out of 10 of these other performance measures, middle manager quality has a positive and significant impact on performance. Upper level manager quality is only important for 1 out of 10 of these additional performance indicators.</p>

<p>The marginal effects of upper manager quality depending on various levels of middle manager quality are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0095399711414122">Table 6</xref>.</p>
<p>The impact of upper manager quality on performance changes from 0.06 to 0.56 as middle manager quality goes from low to high. This means that as principal quality decreases, the effect of superintendent quality on performance increases. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0095399711414122">Figure 2</xref> illustrates this relationship.</p>

</fig>
<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0095399711414122">Figure 2</xref>, the impact of superintendent quality on performance is only significant when principal quality is average or above. When principal quality is low, superintendent quality does not have an effect on pass rates. One implication of this finding is that a quality superintendent cannot compensate for low-quality principals. The other implication is that a quality superintendent can only improve performance when the quality of principals is at or above average.</p>
<p>For the additional measures of performance, of the six performance indicators that had a significant relationship with managerial quality, only two have a significant interactive effect. For SAT scores and the low-income pass rate, the impact of managerial quality on performance is influenced by the quality of management at the other level. These results provide moderate support for H2. The effect of quality at one level of management can be influenced by management quality at another level of the organization.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This research provides empirical support for the proposition that middle manager quality, as measured with salary residuals, positively influences organizational performance. These findings supplement what we know about the importance of management to organizational performance by demonstrating that middle managers matter. These findings conform with findings in the private sector about the importance of middle managers for performance through their contributions to strategy, the tasks they perform, and their connections throughout the organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0095399711414122">Floyd &amp; Wooldridge, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0095399711414122">Nonaka &amp; Takeuchi, 1995</xref>). As middle manager quality matters for more than just one or two performance measures, confidence in the measure and conclusions about the importance of middle managerial quality to performance is justified.</p>
<p>Middle manager quality has a larger impact on organizations than upper level manager quality. Intuitively this makes sense. Upper level managers are tasked with solving bigger, organization-wide problems that are oftentimes unsolvable in the short term. We see the direct impact from those who implement the solution (middle managers). We see a small direct effect from upper managers and likely an indirect effect of upper management through middle manager quality. The decisions middle managers make regarding the solutions to these small problems and the implementation of solutions from upper management can have a greater cumulative impact on an organization than just those decisions made at the upper levels of government. Middle managers affect the organization on a weekly or daily basis by solving smaller, more immediate problems and implementing solutions.</p>
<p>Communication is absolutely essential to organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0095399711414122">Simon, 1948</xref>). Thus, another reason why middle managers have a greater impact on an organization than upper level managers is due to the fact that middle managers comprise the key communication conduit for the organization. They decipher intricate information for both the top and bottom of the organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0095399711414122">Nonaka &amp; Takeuchi, 1995</xref>). Quality middle managers are important to an organization not only just for the general managerial tasks they perform such as resource allocation, personnel decisions, and policy implementation but also for their integral role in the organization’s communications network.</p>
<p>Moreover, this article finds that the impact of management in an organization is greater than the literature currently tells us when we include two levels of managerial quality in the same model. When the quality of both management levels is high, middle and upper managers combined have a positive impact on performance. However, poor management at one level derails the impact of quality managers at the other level.</p>
<p>These results agree with the conclusions of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0095399711414122">Walker and Brewer (2008)</xref> that there are important differences between echelons or managerial levels. Differences in quality affect the ability of the managerial levels to effectively impact the performance of their organization. These results reiterate the importance of studying management from a multilevel perspective so that we can more accurately study all of the ways that management matters to an organization.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-0095399711414122">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>The greatest limitation to this article is related to the specialized nature of the quality measure. The vast majority of salaries of public administrators are determined by preset pay scales that reward administrators for their education and experience with the organization and rarely incorporate pay for performance or a subjective judgment of quality. This situation makes it exceedingly difficult to use a quality measure like the one presented in this article to systematically study the impact of middle manager quality across government agencies.</p>
<p>Another limitation of this study is that the measure of middle manager quality is not an individual-level measure of quality but rather is an aggregate measure of the quality of all middle managers in the organization. This is problematic because the nature of aggregation cancels out the variations in middle manager quality in the organization. An aggregate measure prevents us from determining the impact of individual middle managers on other middle managers in the organization and on upper management. Nevertheless, the results of this study remain useful and valid. The results empirically demonstrate the importance of middle manager quality and the relationships between managerial levels to organizational performance. More generally, they reveal important implications for the management quality–performance relationship and the necessity for focus on multiple levels of management.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-0095399711414122">
<title>Future Research</title>
<p>Future research on middle manager quality needs to focus on two areas. The first is to focus on the tasks and behaviors of middle managers and how instrumental those are to organizational performance. These behaviors and tasks could include networking behavior; how ideas are synthesized, prioritized, and communicated; and the human resources function. These tasks, and how well they are performed, influence organizational performance. Case studies and interviews are an ideal method to determine which tasks and ways of performing them impact the organization and how.</p>
<p>A second line of research can further explore the relationship between managerial levels. Previous research finds that the levels are different and that how they interact is important for the workings in the organization and its performance. Interviews and case studies offer an ideal method for understanding exactly how the levels interact to impact the organization. To supplement the information gained from interviews and case studies, a large-N data set could be complied that includes individual, agency, and organizational level data on upper and middle managers and front line workers. Data could be collected from surveys and state databases and compiled into one data set. With such a data set, multilevel modeling could be used to account for individual, agency, and organization level effects to explore the relationships between managerial levels, performance, and any interactive effects. Methodologically, this is the ideal way in which to explore the impact of the various levels within the organization and their relationships with one another on an organization.</p>
<p>To summarize, the results presented in this article, both about the impact of quality middle managers on organizational performance and about the relationship between managerial levels, illustrate that the expansion of public management research to include middle managers is possible, essential, and beneficial to understanding the complex ways in which management affects organizational performance. The measure of middle manager quality presented in this article allows researchers to begin to explore the myriad ways in which middle managers affect an organization.</p>
