<p>This book contains three essays earlier published in the <italic>London Review of Books</italic> in the summer of 2012. It attempts to critically engage with the nationalist discourse, and the ensuing ‘hegemony of the edulcorated versions of the national past’ as represented by the ‘the liberal mainstream of Indian intellectual life’. The central concern is to re-contextualize the ideas of Gandhi, Nehru and Patel in the anti-colonial struggle and squarely foreground Gandhi₹s socially conservative frame, especially with the question of caste; Nehru₹s majoritarian impulse that was responsible for the partition, and Patel₹s uber-patriotism that sowed the seeds for the wanton use of force with impunity by the Indian State.</p>
<p>These essays convey a sense of urgency to respond to the representative liberal scholars who have come to firmly believe in the historically unprecedented achievements of India being not just ‘World₹s largest democracy’, but also a great one, given the conditions in which she opted for universal adult franchise, federalism, secularism, and socialism. Notwithstanding the limitations, liberal scholars, have long, projected Indian democracy as nothing short of a historical wonderland that had its roots in the inclusive, composite, cosmopolitan, socialist rhetoric of its national leaders, and the fine balance they achieved through mutually learning from each other. It is the myth of this fine balance and the strong-hold of these ideas in Indian democracy that Perry Anderson, attempts to break, through his critical insights and historical narrative, albeit all too familiar.</p>
<p>It has all the familiar ingredients of a critical recipe, including the Poona Pact and Ambedkar₹s humiliation; the inconsistent position of Gandhi on the question of caste; the history of Kashmir’s ‘accession’ to India; how Congress, and not the Muslim League, was primarily responsible for the partition in order to maintain its monopoly of power and ‘saturating its appeal with a Hindu imaginary’; the role of Patel in compelling the Princely states to submit themselves in recognizing the sovereign power of the Indian union; and finally the not too impressive post-independence record of Nehru, including his failure to implement land reforms, the neglect of primary education, and the policy thrust to protect the interests of rich farmers, traders and urban professionals.</p>
<p>While Anderson₹s myth-busting efforts are well taken, he has not considered previous critiques of the nationalist history, primarily, by Dalit and Marxist scholars in India. Those familiar with these writings will find very little that is new in the critique that Anderson offers, and would realize that hegemony of nationalist ideology is severely limited to certain kind of liberal-mainstream scholars and readers, beyond those horizons it is difficult to find ‘The Indian Ideology’, either in the Indian academia or in Indian politics. Given the sweep of Anderson’s scholarship and previous engagement with Gramsci, the book would have read better had it picked on more intriguing issues that are still open to historical audition. The significant among them being the subaltern studies/postcolonial approach to Indian history that has appropriated not only Gandhi₹s critique of the West but also the Dalit critique of Gandhi, without ever attempting to reconcile the two. While socially conservative views of Gandhi on caste are fairly rehearsed, there are new issues that need an opening, including how the Left approaches the role and legacy of Ambedkar, whose arduous efforts, given his historical context, are laudable, his emphasis on State, and law-making, and in the end somewhat naïve emphasis on Buddhism as a way out for modern complexities, need a fresh analysis instead of the same myth-making approach that Anderson (is actually critical of) adopts towards him, and indeed to Subhas Chandra Bose.</p>
<p>Ambedkar on the one hand was a modernist but on the other found solace in Buddhism, which, in a sense, was a scathing indictment of modern structures. This is akin to the puzzle of why Gandhi despite his critique of modernity, chose Nehru, who was a high-modernist, as his political heir. Did then, Gandhi₹s critique of modernity look more plausible riding on the cultural capital of Nehru? This reminds one of Sarojini Naidu₹s remark that it was way too expensive to keep Gandhi poor. What then was similar or dissimilar between the accommodation of modernity in Ambedkar and Gandhi? Had Anderson put his Marxist frame and Gramscian overtures into play, he would have undoubtedly been able to throw new light on some of these ‘antinomies’, instead of the kind of rather simplistic reasoning he presents. For instance, on the relation between Gandhi and Nehru, Anderson merely reduces it to ‘calculations of mutual interest’, ‘quasi-filial infatuation’ and ‘infantilism’.</p>
<p>Anderson makes sense of many of the decisions and historically contingent events through a very incisive reading of the kind of individuals that some of the national leaders were, especially Nehru. He takes delight in pointing to Nehru’s relation with Edwina, and Mrs Gandhi’s alleged affair with M.O. Mathai. He, insists that, many of the events, be it partition or the debacle of 1962, owed much to the inability of Nehru in judging the character of individuals around him, and also was vulnerable to self-deception, and ‘drifted easily away from realities resistant to his hopes and fancies’. These might look individual traits from certain viewpoint—‘a view from nowhere’—but if one were to politically analyse them, they could well be practices endemic to a communitarian context. Self-deception, the enduring gap between thinking and being, non-linear mode of operation, are practices through which the community finds its functional and sociological actualization. Such inflections would be imperative for any historical rendering, where the community continues to be the basic unit of the society.</p>
<p>What, however, comes through very convincingly in the book is the fact that making of any kind of heroes, legends and icons can only be achieved by ironing out ‘self-contradictions’, be they elite or even subaltern icons; as Gandhi has been sieved through history, so will Ambedkar. It is in critical engagement, as against iconoclastic rendering of nationalist heroes and the politics of patronage (reflected in uncritical glorification) practiced towards subaltern icons, that we actually and duly recognize their historical role. To that extent this book, even if partially, re-presents an agenda that is already well-set within the political and academic horizon of social scientists in India.</p>
