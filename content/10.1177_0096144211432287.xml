<p>The very notion of “medieval urbanism” was traditionally thought to be a kind of paradox, given that the features considered most characteristic of medieval society—monasticism and feudalism to name just two—were chiefly nonurban. Historians therefore viewed and evaluated medieval cities either as the decrepit ruins of great classical urban centers or the undeveloped nuclei of great modern metropolises to be. Yet scholars of the past fifty years have radically refined and expanded their understanding of the workings of the medieval world, and many “modern” phenomena once thought to have originated in the fifteenth century or even later have been recognized as having deep roots in medieval society. Recent publications have acknowledged and highlighted the significance of the urban experience for early as well as late medieval Europe. Furthermore, urban historians have usefully begun to abandon the tendency to evaluate medieval cities in relation to—or by the standards of—their classical predecessors and modern successors.</p>
<p>This process has naturally raised problems of definition: if we cannot evaluate medieval towns according to classical or modern criteria, we must establish new criteria, and numerous models have been proposed.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0096144211432287">1</xref></sup> Each of these privileges some combination of political, spatial, demographic, religious, economic, textual, and visual or architectural evidence as crucial for identifying a medieval <italic>city</italic> as opposed to a village, castle, trading post, or other center of population. For example, qualification might require the presence of a cathedral, a market, defensive walls, some degree of political autonomy, “urban”-style domestic architecture, or a certain density of population or economic diversification. The problem has been compounded by the great variety of medieval urban experiences, which make it difficult to define early medieval Islamic cities by the same criteria as the great commercial ports of late medieval England and the Low Countries, as well as the disagreement in medieval sources as to what constitutes and defines a city—starting with Latin terms such as <italic>urbs</italic>, <italic>civitas</italic>, <italic>communis</italic>, and <italic>burgus</italic>, all of which might be translated into English as “city” depending on context, but have subtle nuances of difference not always caught by historians and translators.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0096144211432287">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>Admirably, recent publications have emphasized the importance of evaluating medieval cities on their own terms, starting with the conceptualization of the “the city” in the medieval imagination, continuing with the design and/or development of actual medieval cities (planned or organic), and expanding to include the views and experiences of the people who actually lived and worked there.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0096144211432287">3</xref></sup> As elsewhere in urban studies, this has involved a radical broadening of focus beyond the relatively strict political or economic criteria by which such urban agglomerations had traditionally been evaluated, such as the existence of a charter of liberties or the presence of an annual fair. The medieval city has attracted interest from scholars in such diverse fields as literature, religion, political theory, art history, archaeology, geography, public health, ecology, and beyond.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0096144211432287">4</xref></sup> Some (although not enough) work has been done to integrate the perspectives and findings of these various approaches. At the same time, however, historians studying medieval cities have embraced a variety of methodologies, recognizing the value of comparative work as well as in-depth case studies; this breadth has enabled scholars to compare urban experiences regionally and chronologically to identify common concerns and assumptions as well as individual particularities. The works considered in the present review are all productively synthetic in this sense, although they treat different groups of material and each orients its comparisons in its own way.</p>
<p>The broadest and most innovative of the works under consideration is Keith Lilley’s <italic>City and Cosmos: The Medieval World in Urban Form</italic>. Lilley, a geographer whose research has focused on the Norman towns of England, here expands his realm of inquiry to explore the idealized images that medieval city founders, designers, and architects had in mind when they envisioned “the city.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0096144211432287">5</xref></sup> Lilley thus attempts to apply the well-known Neoplatonic principle of macrocosm–microcosm parallelism on an urban scale: the city is a microcosm of the universe as well as a macrocosm of human experience, with general principles (such as the necessities of balance and order) applying across all planes. He therefore begins his discussion with the heavenly Jerusalem—a theological construct as well as a physical place—and proceeds to Augustine’s distinction between the cities of God and man (as expounded in <italic>De Civitate Dei</italic>) as a way of explaining how medieval people understood the differences and similarities between ideal imaginary cities and imperfect physical ones: a relationship that parallels and enriches the Christian understanding of a sinful humanity in a fallen world.</p>
<p>The rest of Lilley’s book (chaps. 2–6) attempts to show how these mental images of the city translated into physical reality: how medieval people used cosmological principles to construct and understand real streets in actual cities. Understandably, he focuses particularly on “built” towns, which were either designed from scratch or substantially reconfigured by medieval patrons and architects. The author demonstrates how such designs are substantially based on circles, squares, and root-two geometry while stressing the cosmological significance of such geometries; he discusses some of the treatises on practical geometry that made this link explicit, such as those by the early-twelfth-century Parisian canon Hugh of St. Victor and Leonardo Fibonacci (ca. 1220). In part 3 (chaps. 5–6) Lilley moves from the material city to the human community that inhabited it, showing how civic laws and public rituals attempted to impose the same divine order on the body politic as on the physical space that it inhabited.</p>
<p>As this summary implies, Lilley brings an impressive range of evidence to bear on his ideas, ranging from diagrams and maps of numerous towns in Western and Central Europe to theological and political treatises; perhaps as a result, some of his arguments are more fully presented and persuasive than others. Nonetheless, the book is a much-needed introduction to how medieval people thought about cities, demonstrating clearly how philosophical and theological principles could take practical shape and physical materials could reflect heavenly ideals. The medieval world was full of signs and symbolism, and while the richness of this mental landscape is hard to reconstruct, Lilley’s book provides a fascinating and well-illustrated starting point.</p>
<p>A collection of articles rather than a monograph, Caroline Goodson, Anne E. Lester, and Carol Symes’s <italic>Cities, Texts and Social Networks, 400–1500</italic> also focuses on urban experience at the intersection of concept and practice. The result of a series of conference sessions at Leeds in 2007, the collection focuses on not only how people thought about cities and civic space but also how they tried to revise or reinforce other people’s perceptions of the same space using a variety of means: architectural, textual, and performative. The editors embrace an intentionally broad scope, from late antiquity to the fifteenth century and England to the Muslim Near East, although Central and Eastern Europe are weakly represented.</p>
<p>After a comprehensive theoretical introduction by the editors (chap. 1), parts 1 and 2 (“Constructing and Restructuring” and “Topographies as Texts”) focus on the physical materials of the medieval city and the role they played in shaping perception and experience. In part 1, Gregor Kalas and Meredith Cohen investigate the sociopolitical motives driving particular architectural phenomena in late antique Rome (Kalas) and thirteenth-century Paris (Cohen), while Hugh Kennedy explores the grey area between planned and organic development in early Islamic city foundations. In part 2, Ann Christys, Anne Lester, and (jointly) Joëlle Rollo-Koster and Alizah Holstein analyze particular topographical texts for how they reflect medieval city dwellers’ perceptions, ranging from Ummayad Cordoba (Christys) to thirteenth-century Champagne (Lester) and fourteenth-century Rome (Rollo-Koster and Holstein). Whether the “texts” in question are wills, descriptions of civic processions, or architectural façades, the essays in these two parts reveal how much meaning urban inhabitants read in the streets, buildings, and monuments they passed every day—whether that meaning was positive, as in Lester’s analysis of the charitable landscapes of the wealthy townspeople of Champagne, or negative, as in Rollo-Koster and Holstein’s description of efforts to purge Rome of the influence of the demagogue Cola di Rienzo. These essays also reveal the ambiguous relationship of the physical or textual monument to its subject: these objects and narratives (a mosque, a will, a statue) all claim to reflect a certain reality, but they play a major role in constituting as well as reflecting that reality.</p>
<p>Parts 3 and 4 of the book (“Citizens and Saints” and “Agency and Authority”) focus more on the social networks referred to in the book’s title; medieval efforts to shape the civic community are equally important in this half of the book, but they take less material form. Part 3, for example, focuses on the role of religion in reinforcing civic identity and hierarchies; while Scott Bruce focuses on Pavia’s championing of Abbot Maiolus of Cluny (d. 994), Sarah Rees Jones reveals the distinctly bourgeois interests behind the adoption of new civic saints in England. While these two chapters focus on the unifying value of a patron saint, Franz-Josef Arlinghaus analyzes how civic rituals in Braunschweig reinforced urban divisions and hierarchies. Finally, part 4 reveals the strategies of community formation in a number of twelfth- and thirteenth-century cities: Sethina Watson parallels charter acquisition and charitable foundation in English cities, while G. Geltner explores changing attitudes toward prisons in late medieval Italy. Finally, Carol Symes analyzes the negotiation of the public sphere in medieval Arras through the performative manipulation of the civic environment. These essays illustrate the collection’s theme across a wide variety of subjects and methodologies. At the same time, the contributions highlight the similar concerns of urban dwellers throughout medieval Europe as well as their similar strategies for negotiating the urban environment: for example, a concern with civic amenities and physical appearance, the need for a reputable (and, if possible, documentable) civic past, and the value of prioritizing certain physical spaces over others. The volume is thus a valuable addition to the growing body of interdisciplinary, comparative work on the medieval urban experience.</p>
<p>Similar in approach although not in scope is another collection from Ashgate edited by Derek Keene, Balázs Nagy, and Katalin Szende, <italic>Segregation, Integration, Assimilation: Religious and Ethnic Groups in the Medieval Towns of Central and Eastern Europe</italic>. Like the previous volume, this collection originates from a conference (held in Budapest in 2003), and its essays focus on the negotiations between social groups in the medieval cities of Central and Eastern Europe, with particular attention to strategies of inclusion and exclusion. Thus, it dovetails neatly with the volume by Goodson, Lester, and Symes: while the two collections feature similar topics and approaches, Keene et al. concentrate on the geographical area least well represented in Goodson et al. The value of comparative urban history is particularly evident here, especially when the volume is read in concert with Goodson et al.’s: both the series editors’ preface and Derek Keene’s introduction do an excellent job of characterizing the cities of Central and Eastern Europe in the Middle Ages. They emphasize the regional similarities that differentiated such towns from the cities of Western Europe (such as their relative sparsity of population, limited monetization, and greater diversity of ethnicity and religion) as well as the concerns they shared with their fellow townsmen throughout Western Europe and the Near East (such as immigration, urban political autonomy, and a town’s relationship with its hinterland).</p>
<p>Where Goodson et al. treat a broad range of subjects, this volume is much more focused: every essay deals in some way with social diversity in the medieval cities of Central and Eastern Europe. Essays focus variously on religious, ethnic, and linguistic diversity, but as several authors point out, these categories were often connected, and groups that could be isolated by ethnic or geographic origin often compounded that sense of otherness by their different language, cultural habits, and/or religious convictions—not to mention their congregation in particular neighborhoods, occupations, or social groups such as confraternities. Each of these categories could reinforce or undermine the others depending on the circumstances, and the essays in the collection do an admirable job of untangling the social webs within which members of these groups cohabited in an urban context, providing both evidence for and analysis of the relations between social groups in particular times and places.</p>
<p>Understandably, since the workshop from which these essays originate was held in Budapest, about one-third of the thirteen substantive chapters in the volume (following Keene’s synthetic introduction in chapter 1) deal with medieval Hungary: István Petrovics considers the treatment of foreign ethnic groups in the towns of southern Hungary, Balázs Nagy analyzes Western travelers’ depictions of Hungarian towns, and Katalin Szende explores the unifying qualities of multilingualism in late medieval Hungarian towns, while András Végh and Jozséf Laszlovszky both consider the interactions of different social groups in medieval Buda. Another third cover Germany and the Baltic states: for medieval German cities, Felicitas Schmieder assesses the evidence for the presence and treatment of ethnic minorities while Gerhard Jaritz explores visual representation of otherness; Anti Selart considers the role of Russians in Livonian towns, and Olha Kozubska-Andrusiv that of similar foreign minorities in Lviv (Ruthenia). A final third of the articles focus on the Balkans: Boris Golec, Nada Zečević, and Zdenka Janeković Römer deal with ethnic policies in Slovenian towns, a western Greek princedom, and Dubrovnik (Ragusa), respectively, while Kazimir Popkonstantinov and Rossina Kostova assess the evidence for the treatment of foreigners and minorities in medieval Bulgarian towns. While the individual essays employ a number of helpful maps and diagrams, this quick tour of locales suggests one missing feature: namely, a general map covering all the areas treated. The essays display a good breadth of scope and a variety of methodologies within relatively focused subject matter. The collection is notable not only because it provides an accessible entry point for scholars accustomed to Western materials but also because the particular circumstances of Europe’s “frontier” towns highlight urban phenomena that manifest themselves more subtly in Western European contexts. One example is the problems presented by religious diversity: where a Western European town might have a small Muslim and/or Jewish community, Eastern European towns frequently had to cope not only with Muslims and Jews but also with various kinds of “schismatic” Christians (as they were considered by Westerners: Byzantines, Armenians, Russians, Patarenes, etc.). The volume is therefore valuable both as a corrective to the Western-dominated historiography of medieval urban Europe and more generally for the valuable comparisons of urban experience it encourages within and between the different regions of medieval Europe.</p>
<p>Next to two such collections of great variety and scope, Michael Wolfe’s much more focused <italic>Walled Towns and the Shaping of France</italic> might seem a completely different undertaking. Yet Wolfe’s work echoes the concerns of these more peripatetic works in important ways, not least of which is its emphases on interdisciplinarity and the value of long-term chronological comparison. Instead of comparing the experiences of medieval townspeople across Europe, Wolfe employs the opposite cross-section of historical data, investigating urban fortifications in French towns between 900 and 1750. Wolfe’s methodology is synthetic but his interpretation is novel, mixing the expertise of regional specialists in urban development and military architecture with that of political historians on the centralization of the medieval and early modern French state. Like Lilley and Goodson et al., Wolfe pays close attention to the tensions between ideal and reality, theory and practice, in this case, the goals of a centralizing monarchy and their practical implementation: Did Capetian sponsorship of urban fortifications actually solidify royal authority in volatile areas? Did Richelieu actually manage to implement his policy of <italic>rasement</italic>, which sought to have French city walls demolished? Along with a separate conclusion, the book is divided neatly into three parts. Part 1 (“The Walls Go Up, 900–1325,” chaps. 1–3) outlines the urban legacy of Roman Gaul and early medieval Francia and charts the rise of walled towns in the eleventh and twelfth centuries. Part 2 (“The Walls Move Outward, 1325–1600,” chaps. 4–6) demonstrates how new forms of royal authority and military technology shaped French towns between the Hundred Years’ War and the Wars of Religion. Last, part 3 (“The Walls Come Down, 1600–1750,” chaps. 7–8) characterizes the impact of the centralized monarchic state of early modern France on the kingdom’s urban communities, with special attention to the differences in policy between “closed” frontier towns and the “open” towns of the interior.</p>
<p>Far from focusing strictly on the physical—the construction, architecture, demolition, and present-day ruins of such fortifications—Wolfe insists on the broader social significance of premodern French city walls, “the ways in which social and political practices, military technologies, physical geography, and shifting regional networks shaped the emergence of new forms of public authority and civic life,” and identifies these trends as key to understanding the “historical genesis of modern France” (p. v). Unfortunately, despite these admirable goals, Wolfe’s work is less interdisciplinary than his preface implies: his integration of architectural history, political trends, and developments in military technology is assured, but the book is uneven in connecting these developments to social practice and the lived urban environment more generally. Furthermore, it is sadly obvious that the author’s expertise lies in the latter half of the period covered by the book. Part 1 in particular contains errors of both detail and concept that distract considerably from Wolfe’s argument. For example, the appearance of the ungrammatical plurals <italic>castrums</italic>, <italic>oppidia</italic>, and <italic>castellums</italic> (along with the correct <italic>castra</italic> and <italic>oppida</italic>) for the plurals of <italic>castrum</italic>, <italic>oppidum</italic>, and <italic>castellum</italic> can be put down to poor editing, but the consistent references to an early type of castle fortification as “moat and bailey” instead of the correct “motte and bailey” suggest a total misunderstanding of early castle development (the “motte” is the hill, not its palisade-and-ditch accompaniment).</p>
<p>More generally, throughout part 1 Wolfe fails to distinguish adequately between castles and towns, often treating them indiscriminately as equivalent precursors of the walled towns of the later Middle Ages. From the later perspective, it might not matter whether a town grew out of domestic settlement around a feudal fortification (as at Nuremberg) or began as an urban settlement with a lord’s fortress being later built into or next to it (as at Paris). But taking the earlier period on its own terms, it matters a great deal whether the impetus for urbanization came from the presence of a court, trade fair, or religious site—and whether the decision to build urban defenses came from townspeople or lord. The construction of stone city walls might be a relatively successful negotiation between lord and commune, while the construction of an urban fortress might be a lord’s attempt to protect himself from and intimidate disaffected locals. To lump these actors and motivations together badly confuses the history of medieval urban development.</p>
<p>It is worth noting, however, that these problems are mainly confined to the first part of the book: Wolfe’s analysis in the second and third parts is much more assured, and the overall approach of the volume is certainly worthwhile. The book also provides a number of useful maps and illustrations. Its ultimate goal is to demonstrate the richness of urban experience in premodern France: Walls defined cities geographically, politically, and ideologically, so as different cities’ circumstances changed, so too did their relationships with their walls. They became more or less necessary for defense or differentiation from the local countryside, more or less a symbol of the city’s relationship with higher political authorities, more or less a locus of civic pride.</p>
<p>In the end, these are principles with which all of the books reviewed here engage: medieval cities featured a variety of actors (both individuals and groups) with particular concerns and ideals. They had particular sets of resources to draw on and particular circumstances to deal with in doing so. These parameters combined in different ways to create not only “the medieval urban experience” broadly conceived but also particular actors’ versions of it, which might or might not coincide with those of their fellow citizens or contemporaries. Given the diversity of these versions of history, and the variety of the evidence available with which to analyze them, it is only appropriate that medieval urban history be approached from as wide-ranging a perspective as possible. And since any single book cannot hope to achieve such breadth without sacrificing coherence, we can only be grateful that recent publications have begun to cover such a wide range of themes, subjects, and approaches. We have come far from dismissing medieval cities as ruins barely deserving of the description of “urban,” but we are only beginning to grasp the complexity of the material.</p>
