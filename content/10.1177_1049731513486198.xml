<p>What do you get when you ask 60 social work faculty to give their advice for a good meal for a student? This book is the answer. <italic>Food for Thought</italic>, by Kevin Corcoran and collaborators, published by Lyceum Books, includes over 100 recipes, organized around a four 14-week semester (2 year) social work graduate program, complete with exam week recipes, tailgate party options, a Pi Day meal plan for the data nerds among us, and for the finale: a graduation party plan.</p>
<p>The organization, Corcoran points out, is to put the largest recipes early in the semester, so as to have time to use up leftovers, to leave the complicated cooking to the weekends and the lighter meals to the weekdays, when the schedule is presumably more demanding. Each “chapter” begins with Tips, which may include things such as suggestions to buy items on sale when you see them, cautions to always squeeze water out of frozen spinach before using it, or directions to save pesto in plastic sandwich bags in the refrigerator so that it can be used easily for cooking. The Tips section is followed by a list of ingredients for the following recipe, then the step-by-step procedure. Variations on the recipe, vegetarian alternatives, side dish suggestions, and helpful ideas for leftovers wrap up each section.</p>
<p>The book starts with an introduction to food and social work, and some discussion of the place of food issues in our profession, with a brief nod to food programs and the history of food baskets as social lubricant for friendly visitors. There is a helpful brief acknowledgment that those newly liberated from their parents’ homes or from dorm environments will need to set up a kitchen, possibly for the first time, and a few guidelines are provided about both equipment (knives, cutting boards, colanders, pans, fire extinguisher, etc.) and pantry staples (matzo meal, turmeric, sugar, rice, Original Louisiana Hot Sauce, etc.), although we might suggest that tomato paste would be equally as useful as kasha or tahini in a learner’s kitchen.</p>
<p>This creative cookbook focuses on the idea that social work students are notorious for not eating well while in graduate school, and aims to provide a road map of manageable and interesting meals to last throughout the graduate school adventure. It offers omnivores a culinary tour of real-life American cooking, complete with shortcuts for saving time and money (and using leftovers), from across the country. There are standbys like pot roast and Thanksgiving turkey (two recipes!), alongside various soups and regional dishes from the South, Hawai’i, and Northwest, as well as options that give a nod to New Orleans, Texas, Harlem, the Caribbean, and a handful of international choices including Italian, Lebanese, Korean, Chinese, Hungarian, Norwegian, Japanese, and Cuban recipes.</p>
<p>This is a catalogue of the best, or at least most interesting, recipes of some of our favorite faculty, and they range from grilled cheese and chili to chicken and waffles, to mesquite-salted smoked turkey thighs with bruschetta mexicana and pork roast with apricot–cherry sauce. About half of the recipes offer glimpses into their cultures of origin or regional homes, along with some practical tips. Among our favorites, Howard Karger (of University of Queensland, Australia) shares his insight that store-bought hummus is “designed to not assault anyone’s tastebuds and it succeeds admirably,” for which he offers a recipe to enhance the taste; Michael Spencer (of University of Michigan) explains that Hawaiian consumption of Spam exceeds that of the other states, a piece of trivia that is followed up with a tip to prevent Spam from falling apart when making his Hawaiian Hoppin’ John and Rice; Bruce Thyer (of FSU) offers a Boiled Peanuts Tailgate Party with the note that “A winning team helps, but that is optional;” Tom Crofoot (of Eastern Washington University) recommends moving to the Pacific Northwest for inexpensive salmon and offers an easy to make recipe for pacific northwest salmon and cranberry sauce; Alice Lieberman (of University of Kansas) offers a chicken matzo ball soup that is well worth the effort, although she leaves out the caution passed down through time by Jewish mothers about the challenges of making matzo balls that do not resemble either beach balls or golf balls; and Corcoran’s veggie burger recipe appears as an alternative to two recipes (Week 28 and Week 45), and although we have not tried it yet, the recipe is straightforward and easy to follow. We wondered why this was not included as a main entry, particularly given the unique combination of ingredients.</p>
<p>
<italic>Food for Thought</italic> is a great leaping off point for omnivores looking for direction, possibly after decades of eating at one’s home of origin and at dorms. That said, this is not a book that we would recommend for vegetarians, as veggie recipes seemed in most cases to be afterthoughts. Although many of the herbivore alternatives were fairly creative, using a range of root vegetables and mushrooms in addition to the requisite tofu, many of the veggie alternative suggestions were tantamount to “go get take out, this requires meat.” Additionally, although there are certainly suggestions throughout the book about using and storing leftovers, these recipes really make too much food for a single student, so you will want to have roommates to share with.</p>
<p>Although the book points out that food and social work are closely aligned, whether through food security programs or free food at school events, the book is largely absent any further mention of social or environmental issues related to the topic. There is no mention of sustainable agriculture, the impact of food deserts on the populations that we serve (or our students who may find themselves in urban food desert centers), and only passing mention of the cost of the various options and how these choices may vary by the income and availability of funds of the students who read the book. As a lighthearted nod to Americana cooking, this cookbook is a fun choice; it is, however, a nod to classical recipes and tradition, and not emerging trends and awareness, something that we found a tad disappointing in a book aimed at developing social workers. With the current movements for safer and more just food (local, organic, BPA-free, non-GMO, community-supported agriculture and urban farming, slow food, etc.), it seemed a significant oversight among the commentary scattered throughout this book. Additionally, some of the suggestions to use store bought or canned ingredients, while realistic in terms of time and money, fail to recognize trade-offs related to healthy choices such as salt, fat, or preservatives.</p>
<p>The book includes one interesting appendix, titled “At the End of the Civil War with Malice to None and Charity to All: The Mystery of an 1864 Children’s Aid Society Cookbook,” written by Karen Staller (of University of Michigan). This fascinating story shares Staller’s discovery of an old cookbook in the archival records of the long-gone charity society, and places it not only in historical context but in the grander sweep of time and society, describing the gendered aspects of her find and wondering about the place of cookbooks in both our culture and our time periods. While tying into the context of the rest of the book, this section is the one serious piece of social commentary in the text, and readers would do themselves a disservice to skip reading it.</p>
<p>If you are a “cook from scratch with minimal meat and fresh ingredients” kind of person, this cookbook may not be up your alley; however, if you are a student beginning to explore your own kitchen, and willing to have a try at the favorite recipes of a few who have trod the path before you, this is an approachable and sometimes silly jump into some diverse and interesting options. Food is a very personal medium through which we grease lots of our social connections. The recipes in <italic>Food for Thought</italic> may not trigger much thinking, but will definitely give you some fun meals to make for sharing with roommates and colleagues, and will give you new things to talk about when you meet the contributing faculty at conferences.</p>
