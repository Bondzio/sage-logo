<abstract>
<p>The paper describes the development of a heating element material using recycled carbon fibre. The recycled carbon fibre was first characterised in terms of length and then manufactured into a non-woven sheet using a wet paper-making procedure. A heating fabric was subsequently created by sandwiching the non-woven sheet between adhesive Teflon sheets. Factors affecting the fabric heating performance and its usability such as binder content, durability, electrical conductivity and mechanical strength were investigated. The fabric electrical conductivity was around 2.8 × 10<sup>3 </sup>S m<sup>−1</sup> and was capable to withstand up to 3000 double folds under durability test. The robust and flexible fabric is potentially ideal for usage in various heating garment applications as well as for food packaging and delivery systems.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0021998312454033" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>The increasing use of fibre-reinforced composites in automotive, aerospace and industrial applications has caused a major concern as 3000 tonnes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021998312454033">1</xref></sup> of composite scrap is produced annually in USA and Europe. Environmental legislation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0021998312454033">2</xref></sup> has pressured the industry to look into alternative ways to dispose the composite scrap. Recycling of composites provides an option where potential use can be made of the recycled fibre while avoiding landfilling the scrap composites. Many recycling methods such as fluidised bed,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0021998312454033">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0021998312454033">4</xref></sup> pyrolysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0021998312454033">1</xref></sup> and the use of supercritical fluids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0021998312454033">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0021998312454033">6</xref></sup> have been proven to work for carbon fibre.</p>
<p>Currently, much work has been focussed on using recycled carbon fibre for structural applications with the focus on retaining the recycled carbon fibre tensile property. Exploration on other feasible options is critical in order to ensure a close recycling loop. In this regard, not much attention has been paid into recycled carbon fibre electrical properties<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0021998312454033">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0021998312454033"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0021998312454033">9</xref></sup> as carbon fibre are actually conductive in nature. A network of conductive structure can be created by creating a non-woven carbon fibre sheet using a wet paper-making method. These sheets are known to be used for electromagnetic interference shielding, static dissipation and radar signature management purpose.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0021998312454033">10</xref></sup> Taking advantage of the fact that the conductivity of the fibres remains the same after the recycling process<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021998312454033">11</xref></sup> while exploiting their good mechanical, electrical and durability properties of the recycled carbon fibre sheet, a highly robust and flexible resistive heating fabric can be developed.</p>
<p>Over the past half a century, nickel–chromium heating technology has been widely used as heating elements in many engineering applications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0021998312454033">12</xref></sup> The combined alloy however is very bulky as well as rigid and hence does not allow much flexibility which is essential in some applications, like electronic garments. Graphite, another commonly used heating element,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0021998312454033">13</xref></sup> also lacks similar feature. Virgin carbon fibre heating fabrics are currently sold in the market where its main application lies mainly in the garment and fast food industry.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0021998312454033">14</xref></sup> Utilising recycled carbon fibre sheets as heating elements not only provides a novel sustainable approach but it is also more flexible and robust compared to the existing counterparts.</p>
<p>In this study, the main objective is to investigate the feasibility of developing a flexible heating fabric using recycled carbon fibre. The fluffy recycled carbon fibre was first transformed into a non-woven sheet through a wet paper-making process and then process into a fabric to be used as a flexible heating element. The sheet’s main properties such as durability, electrical conductivity and tensile strength were affected by the quality of the non-woven fibre sheets in terms of fibre length, binder types and binder percentage. A detailed fibre-length distribution was also conducted to examine its effect on the recycled carbon fibre sheet in comparison with virgin counterparts. The fabric’s heating performance was also simulated and tested in real-life applications.</p>

<p>A PAN-based T-800s recycled carbon fibre was kindly provided by the Recycled Carbon Fibre Limited (RCF) Coseley, United Kingdom. The fibre had a diameter of 5 µm, specific density of 1.8, tensile strength and Young modulus of 5.88 GPa and 294 GPa, respectively.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0021998312454033">15</xref></sup> The fibre was recycled from a toughened cured epoxy composite scrap through a pyrolysis process and was cut into nominal lengths of 3, 6 and 12 mm, respectively, using a guillotine. The length distribution of these three samples was characterised. A virgin fibre, Tenax-A HT-C124-12 mm, coated with a water-soluble sizing was supplied by Toho Tenax Ltd. Three types of binders were used in this investigation and its properties are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0021998312454033">Table 1</xref>. Polyurethane binders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0021998312454033">16</xref></sup> were known to provide good flexibility while acrylic polymers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0021998312454033">17</xref></sup> have good durability. The glycerine used for this experiment was purchased from Univar Ltd, Cheshire, United Kingdom.

<sec id="sec4-0021998312454033"><title>Manufacture of recycled carbon fibre sheet</title>
<p>The fluffy recycled carbon fibre and virgin fibre were converted into a sheet using an in-house wet paper-making method comprising of a wet paper-making rig (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0021998312454033">Figure 1</xref>) and a fibre dispersion unit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0021998312454033">Figure 2</xref>). A range of grammage (gsm, g/m<sup>2</sup>) ranging from 10 gsm to 50 gsm was manufactured. The weighed fibres were initially mixed into a glycerol solution inside a dispersion tank to disperse the fibres. The fibre suspension was then poured into a filtration unit where the dispersing medium was filtered away leaving the fibres onto a polymer mesh. Residual of dispersing medium in the sheet was washed away using water spray and then cautiously vacuumed off before laying the sheet onto a flat plate. Various binders were then applied individually onto the sheet using a mechanical spray gun in order to minimise any damage to the surface finish of the sheet. The sheets were later dried at a range of 150℃–200℃ according to the binders curing temperature.

<sec id="sec6-0021998312454033"><title>Electrical conductivity measurement</title>
<p>The electrical conductivity of the recycled carbon fibre sheets were measured using a four-point probe measurement rig. The four-point probe relies on measuring the voltage and current across the material with the probes equally spaced at 1 mm for this particular setup. Appropriate corrections were used according to the thickness to probe spacing ratio. With the assumption of infinite plane sample of finite thickness, the recycled carbon fibre sheets’ electrical conductivity were calculated. The thickness of the sheet was measured separately according to the ISO 534:2005 standard.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0021998312454033">21</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="sec7-0021998312454033"><title>Folding endurance test</title>
<p>Given that many of the heating applications are in garments, the need to withstand constant and repetitive folding is generally essential. A folding endurance test is used to measure the ability of a paper to maintain its strength after a number of repetitive folding. A number of folding endurance tests were carried out in order to investigate the effects of various key factors on the sheet’s folding endurance The folding endurance tester used in this experiment is a Kohler-Molin type with a folding angle of 312° and a rate of 200 double folds per minute. The experiments were conducted according to the ISO 5626 standard with a standard loading weight of 200 g.</p>

<sec id="sec10-0021998312454033"><title>Recycled fibre length</title>
<p>The recycled carbon fibre is fluffy in nature with no visible binder present on them. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0021998312454033">Figures 3</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0021998312454033">8</xref> show the number and weight average length of the 3 mm, 6 mm and 12 mm batch fibres. The number average length is a fairly straight forward test that measures the arithmetic mean of the length. However, the average length does not give us a good representative value of the total fibres in the sample. The assumption of each fibre contributing evenly to the mean value is not a good way for gauging the effects on the dispersion quality. The weight-average length, which is a ratio of mass fraction, gives a better indication of the long fibre length effects on the sample length distribution therefore allowing a much better evaluation. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0021998312454033">Table 2</xref> shows the weight average length of all the fibre batches. The weight-average length for the 12-mm batch is around 8.8 mm, which is much lower than the expected 12 mm. This is due to the presence of many short fibres in the sample which attributes to a mean fibre length of around 6.8 mm. For the 3- and 6-mm batches, the weight average length is close to their expected value. Hence the consistency in fibre lengths are only valid for the 3- and 6-mm batches, while the 12-mm batches have much lower weight average length.

<sec id="sec11-0021998312454033"><title>Electrical conductivity</title>
<p>Since the main principle of a resistive heating element is to release heat, getting the right electrical conductivity is crucial in designing a heating element. The electrical properties of the recycled carbon fibre sheets consist of various fibre lengths, binder type and content were investigated. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0021998312454033">Figure 9</xref> shows the effects of varying fibre length on the 50 gsm recycled carbon fibre sheets’ electrical conductivity. The recycled carbon fibre sheets electrical conductivity was found to increase with increasing fibre length. This is because at the same given weight while assuming an isotropic fibre orientation, longer fibres tend to create more contact points with one another hence increasing the amount of direct conduction path. Similar reasoning applies for short fibre sheets therefore causing a lower electrical conductivity value. The effects on the nominal fibre length can also be observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0021998312454033">Figure 10</xref> when a direct comparison was made between the recycled and virgin fibre sheets. With a weight-average length of around 8.8 mm, the recycled fibre length was not entirely uniform in comparison with virgin fibres whereby the fibre lengths are almost fully 12 mm. The discrepancy in fibre lengths caused by the recycling process and poor control on the chopping process results in a lower sheet electrical conductivity value even though the individual fibre’s conductivity was not affected.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0021998312454033">11</xref></sup>
<fig id="fig9-0021998312454033" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><p>The effects of fibre length on the sheets’ electrical conductivity.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0021998312454033-fig9.tif"/>

</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0021998312454033">Figure 11</xref> shows the effects of varying binder percentage on the electrical conductivity value of the recycled carbon fibre sheets. Since the binder is non-conductive in nature, a higher number of binder percentages would yield a lower electrical conductive sheet. This is evident in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11-0021998312454033">Figure 11</xref> where an increase in binder creates a decrease in the sheet electrical conductivity. Another factor which crucially affects the sheets’ electrical conductivity is the binder type. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12-0021998312454033">Figure 12</xref>, different types of binder show various electrical conductivity range whereby resin HF-05A which is a type of acrylic thermoset resin yield the highest electrical conductivity value. This may be attributed to the high glass transition temperature of resin HF-05A yielding a much stiffer sheet. The major properties of the various binder used is displayed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0021998312454033">Table 1</xref>. Even though the polyurethane binder yields a much lower electrical conductivity sheet, its mechanical performance outweighs its electrical performance. This would be further discussed in the next section. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13-0021998312454033">Figure 13</xref> shows the grammage effects on the sheet’s electrical conductivity. The electrical conductivity of the sheet stays roughly the same with varying grammage value. This is not surprising since the electrical conductivity is independent of the sheet’s thickness as the binder type and content stays constant.

<sec id="sec12-0021998312454033"><title>Folding endurance test</title>
<p>Due to the nature of usage in garments and heating bag applications, heating fabrics are required to be highly flexible and durable.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0021998312454033">23</xref></sup> Similar variables from the electrical conductivity test completed in the previous section were investigated to determine the key factors that affect the folding endurance of the recycled carbon fibre sheet. The folding endurance experimental values were generally expressed in log scale.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0021998312454033">24</xref></sup> The effects of fibre length can be evidently seen from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14-0021998312454033">Figure 14</xref> whereby an increase in fibre lengths from 3 mm to 12 mm clearly increases the folding endurance of the paper. This can be attributed to the higher tensile strength created when using a longer length of fibres in the recycled carbon fibre sheet. With longer fibres, the recycled carbon fibre sheets are bonded better compared to shorter fibres hence yielding a more flexible sheet.
<fig id="fig14-0021998312454033" position="float"><label>Figure 14.</label><caption><p>Fibre length effects on the sheets’ folding endurance value.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0021998312454033-fig14.tif"/>
</fig></p>
<p>The effects of binder content on the folding endurance value are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15-0021998312454033">Figure 15</xref>. With an increase in binder content, the folding endurance of the recycled carbon fibre sheet also increases. The bonding of the fibres in the sheet becomes much stronger due to the increase in binder content resulting in an overall increase in folding endurance. However, with an increase in binder content, the conductivity of the sheet decreases, hence a trade-off is required whereby a balance between both of characteristic is required. It is important to note that excessive binder content would create a stiff non-woven sheet and hence compromise the sheets’ flexibility as shown in the 12 mm, 60% resin content binder in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig15-0021998312454033">Figure 15</xref>. An optimum binder percentage recommended would be around the region of 30–35%.

</fig></p>
<p>A direct comparison between the effects of binder type on the folding endurance is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig16-0021998312454033">Figure 16</xref>. The polyurethane, Emulder DS2361 creates a much better folding endurance in comparison with the HF-05A acrylic thermoset resin and ECO-19 acrylic polymer. However, binders which have high flexibility tend to create a low electrical conductivity sheet, hence a compromise is needed.

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig17-0021998312454033">Figure 17</xref> shows the various composition of the recycled carbon fibre sheets’ tensile strength. The highest obtained was the 6 mm, acrylic resin HF-05A 35%, which reached a tensile strength of 0.72 kN/m. The tensile strength reflects the intimate structure of the paper and also its individual fibres.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0021998312454033">25</xref></sup> As expected, the sheet consisting of longer 6 mm recycled fibre recorded a higher tensile strength compared to the 3 mm fibres. The tensile strength of the paper also increases as the binder content increases. This is due to the excessive binding structure interlinking the fibres. The HF-05A acrylic resin bonds well with the fibres in comparison to the ECO-19 polymer. This may be due to the higher stiffness properties of the HF-05A contributing to a higher tensile strength effect. A much bigger scatter can be seen with a fibre length of 6 mm in comparison with the 3-mm fibre sheets. This could be due to boarder fibre length distribution in 6 mm fibre sheets compared to 3 mm, which can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0021998312454033">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0021998312454033">7</xref>.

<p>The amount of heat generated by the recycled carbon fibre sheet depends on the resistance of the sheet. A higher current resulting in a higher power output would yield an elevated ambient operating temperature. Therefore, for a fixed voltage, a lower resistance sheet would yield a higher temperature. By knowing both the electrical resistivity of the sheet and the dimensions of the recycled carbon fibre sheet, the amount of heat generated could be calculated as well as the overall bag temperature.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig19-0021998312454033">Figure 19</xref> shows a direct comparison between the simulated bag temperature and the actual bag temperature. The simulation has underpredicted the end steady state temperature due to the change in the recycled carbon fibre sheet resistance as the temperature increases. In reality, its resistance does not stay uniform as its temperature increases. In fact, the resistance of the sheet decreases, subsequently increasing the current and the sheet’s temperature. A similar finding was also reported by Ageorges et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0021998312454033">26</xref></sup> Besides the slight decrease in resistance, the model managed to predict a fairly accurate bag temperature. There were some air and heat loss to the surroundings due to the small gap holes while conducting the experiment, and as a result the increase in bag temperature was not as smooth as the simulated version.

<p>The effects of fibre length, binder content and binder type on the electrical conductivity and folding endurance of recycled carbon fibre sheets have been investigated. The electrical conductivity and folding endurance value of the recycled carbon fibre sheets tend to increase with increasing fibre length. Simultaneously, for an increase in binder content, the electrical conductivity decreases but an increase in folding endurance value was observed. Binders such as polyurethane offer very high folding endurance value but lack in good electrical properties while the opposite is true for acrylic thermoset resins. Hence, a trade-off is needed when determining which binder should be used. A comparison between virgin fibre and recycled fibre electrical conductivity was also conducted. The latter was found to have a lower electrical conductivity even though the electrical conductivity of the individual recycled fibre was not altered. This was due to a lower weight average length found in recycled fibres in comparison to virgin fibre. Feasibility studies on using recycled carbon fibre as a heating element has been studied and encouraging results were achieved. Based on the concluded results, an ideal recycled carbon sheet optimised for heating application would consist of: 12 mm fibre length, Resin HF-05A binder and 15% binder content. As the amount of scrap carbon fibre composites are increasingly produced, the use of recycled carbon fibre in heating applications will be economically viable once recycled carbon fibre is being consistently produced. Real life applications and constraints have been achieved showing that a heating fabric could be developed utilising recycled carbon fibre.</p>
