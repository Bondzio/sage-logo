<abstract>
<p>As more hospitality companies use self-service technologies (SSTs), the industry is going through an evolutionary adoption process. Many hotels, resorts, and casinos have installed self-service check-in/check-out kiosks and have recently added new SSTs, such as self-service ordering devices at pool lounge chairs. To successfully implement and use SSTs, it is important for the hospitality operators to understand the factors that determine both willingness and resistance of the customers on using the SSTs. Thus, the purpose of this study is to explore factors that affect customers’ willingness to embrace the usage of SSTs. Having a comprehensive understanding of customers behavior related to their demographic factors and readiness will promote successful implementation of new SSTs as well as effective modifications of existing SSTs. Structural equation modeling was conducted to test hypotheses with a sample of 614 consumers. The results indicate that consumers’ extrinsic motivation had the most significant impact on their likelihood of using new SSTs (e.g., kiosks and touch screen tables for ordering food or other services at hotels, casinos, and restaurants or pools), followed by intrinsic motivation and role clarity. Younger customers and those who do not believe having interactions with employees at hospitality settings is important were also more likely to use these SSTs.</p>

<p>The use of self-service technologies (SSTs) is evolving as more companies adopt the technology and seek new applications for it. Many major hotel chains, including Hyatt, Hilton, Marriott, Carlson, and Starwood, have followed the lead set by airlines and installed self-service kiosks to expedite their check-in process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1096348011407311">Kasavana &amp; Connolly, 2005</xref>). It appears that resorts and casinos are also trying to leverage this trend in technology. For example, the Four Season Miami implemented a self-service ordering device at each of the pool lounge chairs as a way to improve guest service levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1096348011407311">Connolly &amp; Werbitt, 2005</xref>). Touch screen tables for food and bar orders were recently adopted by Harrah’s Rio All Suite Hotel &amp; Casino to meet the younger customers’ needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1096348011407311">KEPRTV, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Opportunities from implementing SSTs appear to be numerous not only because customers appear to have strong preference but also because there is cost savings involved for operators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1096348011407311">Connolly, 2005</xref>). Some hospitality companies could up-sell by providing more products or services available on the screen of a kiosk or in-room TV without increasing labor costs. Furthermore, using SSTs will be able to assist hospitality operators to increase customer retention, displaying more personalized information on the kiosk screen or other devices. When customers use SSTs, the software will recognize the customers, acknowledge their previous visits, recall their preferences, communicate with the customer in their native languages, and present other customized information (e.g., currency and units of measure) for each customer. For example, if customers use their handheld devices to order a coffee, the screen will display a list of favorite drinks based on the customer’s previous purchase history. This approach will eventually enhance customer relationship management.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1096348011407311">Rayport and Jaworski (2005)</xref> suggest that competitive advantage of corporations will depend on arranging the right combination of human and automated interfaces to go beyond any existing levels of performance and service. The traditional personalized service through employees may no longer be the best service delivery method because of the increase in availability of high-tech alternatives and its importance. Nevertheless, to successfully implement and use SSTs, hospitality operators should understand whether and why customers are willing to use SSTs. For instance, customers may value shorter wait times, the feeling of control, or the privacy that SSTs can provide. In contrast, some people may not prefer SSTs because they feel that they lack proficiency in technology and for that they are afraid of making mistakes. Thus, the purpose of this study was to explore influential factors related to individual differences and customer readiness on the likelihood of using SSTs.</p>
<p>The results of this study will not only contribute to academia by extending existing theories but also to the hospitality industry by increasing hospitality operators’ understanding of customers SST acceptance behavior. Hospitality managers and researchers will be able to identify how customers’ individual differences and readiness influence the SST adoption process. This study will assist hospitality operators to successfully implement the new SSTs or effectively modify their current SSTs. As a result, operators will be able to enhance customer intention to use SSTs or their satisfaction levels while experiencing SSTs. Furthermore, frequently used SSTs will result in higher return on a hospitality company’s initial investments in SSTs.</p>

<title>Theoretical Background</title>
<sec id="section2-1096348011407311">
<title>Innovation Diffusion Theory and Technology Acceptance Model</title>
<p>Innovation diffusion theory (IDT) is concerned with understanding the process by which the use of innovations spreads throughout a social system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1096348011407311">Rogers, 1983</xref>). Diffusion is the process by which an innovation is communicated through certain channels over time among the members of a social system. Each member of the social system faces an innovation decision that follows a five-step process: knowledge, persuasion, decision, implementation, and confirmation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1096348011407311">Rogers (1983)</xref> posits that in the persuasion phase, a number of factors influence potential adaptors’ decisions to adopt or reject an innovation. Particularly, customer experiences and attributes of innovations (e.g., relative advantages, compatibility, and ease of use) have an impact on the IT adoption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1096348011407311">Roger, 2003</xref>). However, some IDT constructs are more appropriate for employee-related applications rather than applications for hospitality customers. For example, visibility, compatibility, and result demonstrability are tasks-related constructs in a workplace.</p>
<p>In contrast, belief sets in technology acceptance model (TAM) by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1096348011407311">Davis (1989)</xref> are known to be generalizable across different settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1096348011407311">Taylor &amp; Todd, 1995</xref>). The two belief sets are “perceived usefulness,” which refers to the prospective user’s subjective probability that using a specific application system will increase his or her job performance within an organizational context, and “perceived ease of use,” which refers to the degree to which the prospective user expects the target system to be free of effort. Previous studies also compared these two constructs in TAM with the constructs in IDT. “Relative advantages” in IDT turned out to be similar with the “perceived usefulness” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1096348011407311">Venkatesh, Morris, Davis, &amp; Davis, 2003</xref>), and “complexity” in IDT was renamed as “ease of use” by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1096348011407311">Moore and Benbasat (1991)</xref> to be consistent with other emerging models of adoption in the information system literature.</p>
<p>Other previous studies adapted the “relative advantages” or “usefulness” constructs to examine whether technology-enabled service delivery methods are perceived to offer more advantages over traditional human means of service delivery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1096348011407311">Bitner, Brown, &amp; Meuter, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1096348011407311">Moore &amp; Benbasat, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1096348011407311">Zeithaml &amp; Gilly, 1987</xref>). In the SST context, a study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1096348011407311">Meuter, Ostrom, Roundtree, and Bitner (2000)</xref> applied these concepts to identify the sources of satisfactory evaluation in customers’ usage of SSTs. The result indicates that satisfaction with the SST was driven by improvements or additional benefits offered by the system, including ease of use, saved time, and overall convenience.</p>

<title>Need for Exploring Other Variables</title>
<p>In addition to the positive influence of perceived usefulness and consumers’ intention to use SSTs, recent studies suggest that it is critical for companies currently using or considering using SSTs to address customer readiness. Customer readiness is referred as a condition or state in which a consumer is prepared to try new technology services, and it can be conceptualized as role clarity, ability, and motivations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1096348011407311">Meuter, Bitner, Ostrom, &amp; Brown, 2005</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1096348011407311">Ho and Ko’s study (2008)</xref> measured the effects of customer readiness on the acceptance of Internet banking and claimed that customer readiness significantly affects continued use of SST. The positive effects of customer readiness were also discovered in a study of the adoption of new technology in the airline industry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1096348011407311">Liljander, Gillberg, Gummerus, &amp; Riel, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>The impacts of individual differences (e.g., age, gender, education levels, previous experience, and need for interaction) on SST adoption also need to be examined since there have been inconsistent findings. In general, previous studies postulated that the demographic profile of the people who adopt new technologies tend to be younger male with higher levels of education and income than those who do not adopt it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1096348011407311">Danko &amp; MacLachlan, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1096348011407311">Darian 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1096348011407311">Gatignon &amp; Robertson, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1096348011407311">Greco &amp; Fields, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1096348011407311">Sim &amp; Koi, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1096348011407311">Zeithaml &amp; Gilly, 1987</xref>). Nevertheless, a comprehensive review of the relationship between age and innovative technology adoption indicates that only half of the 228 studies showed a significant effect of gender on adoption behavior. Several studies also show that early adopters are younger, but some studies show that it is otherwise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1096348011407311">Rogers, 1983</xref>). Thus, it would be important for both researchers and practitioners to understand other determinants of intention to use SSTs, in addition to generally known influencers such as perceived usefulness and ease of use. In the following section, the literature and theory that supports each hypothesis are discussed.</p>

<title>Conceptual Model and Research Hypotheses</title>
<sec id="section5-1096348011407311">
<title>Impact of Consumer Readiness on Likelihood of Using SSTs</title>
<p>Consumer readiness is defined as a condition in which a consumer is prepared and is likely to use an innovation for the first time. Processing high levels of consumer readiness is likely to lead to usage of new technology; on the other hand, low levels of readiness may slow down the usage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1096348011407311">Bowen, 1986</xref>). This study conceptualizes consumer readiness as role clarity, ability, and motivation, which are adopted from human resource management literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1096348011407311">Bowen, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1096348011407311">Schneider &amp; Bowen, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>Understanding customer readiness is specifically significant in the adoption of new technology at hospitality settings because of characteristics of service: inseparability and variability. Service inseparability means that customers are a part of the product (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1096348011407311">Kotler, Bowen, &amp; Makens, 2006</xref>), indicating that a customer must know how to use SST used at a hospitality setting. Service variability means that service quality depends on who provides them and when and where they are provided (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1096348011407311">Kotler et al., 2006</xref>). That is, a guest who has had good experience at a hospitality setting can have unsatisfying experience during the subsequent visit if managers fail to match the capacity with fluctuating demand. One solution for the high demand will be getting the customer involved in operations, which can expand the number of people that a single employee can serve. For example, a hotel customer is given the option of checking out without assistance from a front desk agent. This option has altered the typical interface between the customer and the service provider and the task required of customers in the hotel industry. Without sufficient role clarity, ability, or motivation related to the tasks required, it is unlikely that the customer will use the check-out kiosk.</p>
<sec id="section6-1096348011407311">
<title>Role clarity</title>
<p>Role clarity refers to how well a consumer understands what role or performance is required to adequately produce a service using SSTs. Since services in the hospitality industry are usually provided by employees, the usage of SSTs requires new consumer coproduction behavior. In addition, many SSTs are performed separately from service firm employees or other customers, which reduces the opportunity for customers to learn or observe skills to use SSTs. Previous studies suggest that the consumers’ participation in using an innovation can be affected by their lack of understanding of their roles in the process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1096348011407311">Larson &amp; Bowen, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1096348011407311">Mills &amp; Morris, 1986</xref>). Thus, if potential users of an SST understand the role to be performed (how-to knowledge), they will be more likely to use it.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1096348011407311">
<title>Ability</title>
<p>The ability concept relates to what an individual can do rather than knowing how to do it. Ability also refers to having the necessary skills required to perform a certain task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1096348011407311">Globerson &amp; Maggard, 1991</xref>). Industrial psychology literature has supported the relationship between ability and the performance of a task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1096348011407311">Vroom, 1964</xref>). Other previous research proposed that the adoption of technology is influenced by users’ ability to develop the basic skills and their perceived confidence in the ability to engage in specific tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1096348011407311">Mahajan, Muller, &amp; Bass, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1096348011407311">Hoffman &amp; Novak, 1996</xref>). Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1096348011407311">Dabholkar (1994)</xref> contends that customers who use SSTs are usually found to have a high level of self-efficacy in using technology. As a study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1096348011407311">Walker, Craig-Lees, Hecker, and Francis (2002)</xref> suggested customer capability as a predictor of SST adoption, this study assumes that the likelihood of using SSTs will be affected by perceptions of individual capability to perform the task.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1096348011407311">
<title>Extrinsic and intrinsic motivation</title>
<p>Having alternative service delivery options available (human or SST), it is necessary to understand how to encourage customers to put their additional effort to produce service through the use of SSTs. This encouragement may come in the form of either extrinsic or intrinsic motivation. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1096348011407311">Gagne and Deci’s (2005)</xref> self-determinant theory, extrinsic motivation refers to doing something because it leads to a distinguishable outcome, and intrinsic motivation refers to doing something because it is inherently interesting or enjoyable. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1096348011407311">Staw (1976)</xref> described extrinsic motivational forces as increased pay, cost savings, time savings, promotions, and other fringe benefits and intrinsic motivational forces as feelings of accomplishments, personal growth, or those that occurred from the pleasure of engaging in the activity.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1096348011407311">Oliver (1974)</xref> found that there is a significant relationship between extrinsic motivation (incentives) and performance of life insurance salesmen. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1096348011407311">Ingram, Lee, and Skinner (1989)</xref> revealed that extrinsic motivation, such as pay and promotions, is superior to intrinsic motivation in predicting employee effort. In SST contexts, a study of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1096348011407311">Dabholkar (1996)</xref> suggests that extrinsic motivation is necessary if the intrinsic motivation is not sufficient to motivate consumers to use SSTs. It is rational to assume that offering extrinsic rewards, such as price discount or fast transaction, will increase the likelihood of using an SST.</p>
<p>Intrinsic motivation has been found to affect an individual’s technology acceptance level. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1096348011407311">Davis, Bagozzi, and Warshaw (1989)</xref> found that intrinsic motivation has a significant direct effect on the intention to use computers in the workplace. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1096348011407311">Teo, Lim, and Lai (1999)</xref> found the support for a positive relationship between perceived enjoyment and Internet usage. In hospitality settings, some customers will find participation in the production of service via SSTs to be intrinsically attractive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1096348011407311">Bateson, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1096348011407311">Dabholkar, 1996</xref>). Therefore, it is appropriate to assume that consumers with high intrinsic rewards, such as enjoyment or empowerment, will be more likely to use SSTs. As previous studies provide support for the impact of motivation on the likelihood of using SSTs, this study assumes that increased extrinsic and intrinsic motivation will increase the likelihood of using SSTs.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1096348011407311">Darian (1987)</xref> found that females with children and single males aged 40 years and younger were most likely to use SSTs, such as in-home shopping. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1096348011407311">Sim and Koi (2002)</xref> found that consumers who use new technology tend to be male, younger, and more educated. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1096348011407311">Danko and MacLachlan (1983)</xref> contend that males tend to be more inclined to adopt new technologies. Previously, it has been shown that males are more likely to use technology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1096348011407311">Breakwell et al., 1986</xref>), whereas recent literature revealed that females are increasingly using technology, limiting the influence of gender differences in technology adoption behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1096348011407311">Dabholkar, 1992</xref>). Thus, this study assumes that there will be an impact of consumers’ demographic factors on their SST adoption behavior.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1096348011407311">
<title>Previous experience and likelihood of using SSTs</title>
<p>The positive impact of previous experience on the technology adoption has been explored in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1096348011407311">Danko &amp; MacLachlan, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1096348011407311">Dickerson &amp; Gentry, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1096348011407311">Eastlick, 1996</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1096348011407311">Dickerson and Gentry (1983)</xref> suggest that consumers’ experience with technology-oriented products play an important role in their new technology purchasing decision. They explained that familiarity with technology from experience reduces the cognitive effort required to use it, thus increasing the likelihood of using it. Additionally, it has been found that early adopters of technology are more likely to use new technology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1096348011407311">Danko &amp; MacLachlan, 1983</xref>). A more explicit study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1096348011407311">Wener (1985)</xref> found that experienced users required little introduction to understand how to use a software package, whereas inexperienced users needed significant help. He concluded that the users with a higher level of computer experience will be more likely to try the new software. Based on these previous studies, this study proposes that customers who have previous experience with SSTs will be more likely to use SSTs than those without experience.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1096348011407311">
<title>Need for interaction</title>
<p>Need for interaction is defined as a consumer’s desire to have personal contact with others during service encounters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1096348011407311">Dabholkar, 1992</xref>). General SST studies found that the need for human interaction is significant to many customers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1096348011407311">Bateson, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1096348011407311">Langeard, Bateson, Lovelock, &amp; Eiglier, 1981</xref>). In the SST contexts, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1096348011407311">Dabholkar (1992)</xref> examined the determinants of customers’ attitudes toward SST options and found that need for interaction with service employees has a negative impact on attitude toward a new SST. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1096348011407311">Meuter et al. (2000)</xref> contents that some consumers prefer to use SSTs to stay away from the interpersonal interactions. If customers feel an increased need for interpersonal encounters at a hospitality setting, the need will have a negative effect on service quality of SSTs, and thus they will be less likely to use SSTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1096348011407311">Meuter et al., 2000</xref>). Thus, this study proposes that need for interaction will have a negative impact on the likelihood of using SSTs.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>The proposed research model for this article is depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1096348011407311">Figure 1</xref>. To explore the variables in the proposed research model, a self-administrated survey was developed. All items included in the survey appear in the <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-1096348011407311">Appendix A</xref>. The sample was randomly selected from the online survey company’s panel members. Out of 2,000 invitations sent out, 1,070 respondents agreed to participate in the survey. Two screening questions were used at the beginning of the survey to select participants who had stayed in a hotel, motel, or resort in the past 12 months and were 18 years and older. The 614 complete responses were used for data analysis, which equates to the effective response rate of 57.38%. Overall, the participants’ demographics reflected the U.S. Census data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1096348011407311">U.S. Census Bureau, 2008</xref>; see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table10-1096348011407311">Appendix B</xref>).</p>
<p>Most items in the survey were developed based on previous studies discussed in the previous section, except a list of SSTs. We used a multistep process to develop a list of 22 current or potential SSTs: brainstorming, reviewing academic articles/trade journals, and conducing pretest with graduate students and faculty members. We also added an open-ended question to explore any SST we did not include in the list of SSTs.</p>
<p>The next 12 items in the survey were adapted from existing scales to measure the four constructs of role clarity, ability, extrinsic motivation, and intrinsic motivation (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-1096348011407311">Appendix A</xref>: Q24-Q35 in the survey). To measure role clarity (i.e., the user’s comprehension of their roles in the SSTs process), we adapted four items from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1096348011407311">Rizzo, House, and Lirtzman (1970)</xref>. For ability (i.e., what the user “can” do versus what he or she “wants” to do when using an SST), we adapted four items from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1096348011407311">Oliver and Bearden (1985)</xref>. To measure extrinsic motivation (i.e., customer’s excitement to use an SST based on price discounts, time savings, or other extrinsic rewards), four items were adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1096348011407311">Tyagi (1985)</xref>. For intrinsic motivation (i.e., the user’s internal satisfaction such as a feeling of accomplishment when using SSTs), we adapted four items from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1096348011407311">Tyagi (1985)</xref>. The survey measured the respondents’ likelihood in using different SSTs and their readiness on 5-point Likert-type scales. The endpoints of scales were <italic>very unlikely</italic> and <italic>very likely</italic> or <italic>strongly disagree</italic> and <italic>strongly agree</italic>. Individual characteristics were measured on a nominal scale (e.g., male or female). By pretesting the survey instrument with 14 participants, we could assess its face validity and content validity. Minor modifications were made to make the questionnaires sound in both SST and hospitality contexts.</p>

<title>Data Analysis and Results</title>
<p>Data coding and the first part of data analysis were conducted in SPSS version 16.0: descriptive analysis and factor analysis. In the likelihood of using SSTs section, <italic>very unlikely</italic> was coded as number 1, <italic>unlikely</italic> as number 2, <italic>neutral</italic> as number 3, <italic>likely</italic> as number 4, and <italic>very likely</italic> as number 5. Individual differences were coded by number format: for example, female was coded as number 0 and male as number 1. Finally, error checking was completed to make sure that all codes were legitimate. The profile of participants in this study reflected the U.S. Census data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1096348011407311">U.S. Census Bureau, 2008</xref>) in terms of gender but consisted of somewhat older and highly educated sample (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table10-1096348011407311">Appendix B</xref>). The second part of the data analysis was conducted in EQS 6.1. The hypotheses were tested using structural equation modeling (SEM) to estimate and respecify the measurement model prior to the simultaneously estimated measurement and structural models: two-step approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1096348011407311">Anderson &amp; Gerbing, 1988</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section15-1096348011407311">
<title>Descriptive Analysis</title>
<p>A descriptive analysis was performed to understand different levels of preference toward each SST. The mean values of likelihood of using each SST were sorted from the most preferable to the least preferable SSTs (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table11-1096348011407311">Appendix C</xref>). As a result, (a) pay-at-the-pump, (b) online purchase (e.g., travel bookings and retail), (c) in-room check-out, and (d) ATMs were the SSTs used often (higher than 4.0 mean values in likelihood). More than 80% of the respondents were likely or very likely to use these SSTs.</p>
<p>SSTs with mean values of likelihood between 3.5 and 4.0 were the following: (a) Internet self-help (medical, computer support, etc.), (b) vending machines, (c) airline check-in/boarding pass printing kiosks at a hotel lobby or via Internet, (d) price checker in shopping malls, (e) check-out kiosks at grocery stores or other retail outlets, (f) check-in/check-out kiosks at a hotel lobby, (g) kiosks for ordering food at quick service restaurants, (h) touch screen table to order food or other service at restaurants or bars, and (i) Internet information access kiosks in a hotel lobby, convention center, or other public venue. Approximately 60% to 70% of the respondents were likely or very likely to use these SST.</p>
<p>SSTs with mean values of likelihood ranging from 3.0 to 3.5 were the following: (a) kiosks for ticket redemption or cash change at a casino, (b) kiosks for ordering food or other service at pool areas, (c) kiosks for theater ticketing, (d) kiosks for car rental return, (e) voice-automated response systems, and (f) DVD kiosks at a hotel lobby, supermarket, or other locations. About 40% to 57% of the respondents were likely or very likely to use these SSTs.</p>
<p>The least preferable SSTs (with less than 3.0 mean values in likelihood) include the following: (a) PDAs/smart phones for ordering food or other services, (b) kiosks for language translation at a business center, and (c) Internet information access kiosks in a bar. For these SSTs, only 22% to 29% of the respondents were likely or very likely to use them.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-1096348011407311">
<title>Factor Analysis</title>
<p>Factor analysis was performed (a) to see if each SST fell under one of factors based on the likelihood of using SST and (b) to select one factor that accounts for the largest amount of variance in the sample. This factor will be used as a dependent variable for the subsequent analysis (SEM) in this study.</p>
<p>If the Kaiser–Mayer–Olkin measure of sampling adequacy is close to 1, it means that the variables are linearly related. Bartlett’s test of sphericity tests the hypothesis that the correlation matrix is an identity matrix, which would indicate that the variables are unrelated and therefore unsuitable for structure detection. The large value of the Kaiser–Mayer–Olkin measure (0.933) and the small value of significance level in Barlett’s test of sphericity (less than 0.001) indicate that a factor analysis may be useful with the data of this study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1096348011407311">Norušis, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>With principle axis factoring, the total variance explained by each factor was calculated (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1096348011407311">Table 1</xref>). For example, Factor 1 has a variance of 8.64, which is 39.28% of the total variance of 22 items. Factor 2 has a variance of 1.49, which is only 6.76% of the total variance. The cumulative percentage column shows that about 57.50% of the total variance was explained by the first four factors. Commonly, it is recommended to include factors that account for variance (eigenvalue) greater that 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1096348011407311">Norušis, 2005</xref>). To make these factors easy to interpret and to achieve a simple structure, the oblimin rotation method was applied. This rotation method was used because the factors were correlated. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1096348011407311">Table 2</xref> shows a factor pattern matrix that has loadings that represent the unique contribution of each variable to the factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1096348011407311">Hair, Black, Babin, Anderson, &amp; Tatham, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1096348011407311">Norušis, 2005</xref>).</p>

</table-wrap>
<p>The first factor was labeled as “Kiosks and touch screen tables for ordering food or other services at hotels, casinos, restaurants, or pools.” SSTs that group under this factor include the following: (a) kiosks for ordering food at quick restaurants, (b) kiosks for ordering food or other service at pool areas, (c) touch screen table to order service at restaurant or bars, and (d) kiosks for ticket redemption or cash change at a casino.</p>
<p>The second factor was named as “Kiosks and Internet for ticketing, returning cars, or checking-out at hotels or theaters.” SSTs in this group include the following: (a) check-in/check-out kiosks at a hotel lobby, (b) kiosks for car rental return, (c) airline check-in/boarding pass printing kiosks at a hotel lobby or via Internet, (d) kiosks for theater ticketing, and (e) in-room check-out. The third factor was labeled as “Self-service technologies for routine purposes.” SSTs in this category were the following: (a) Internet self-help (e.g., medical or computer support), (b) online purchase (e.g., travel booking or retail), (c) check-out kiosks at grocery stores and other retail outlets, (d) ATMs, (e) voice-automated response systems, (f) vending machines, and (g) pay-at-pump at gas stations. The fourth factor was named as “Self-service technologies to obtain information or service at business center and bars.” SSTs that fall under this factor include the following: (a) kiosks for language translation at a business center, (b) Internet information access kiosks in a bar, and (c) PDA/smart phones for ordering food or other services.</p>
<p>When the sample size is larger than 300, a loading larger than ±.3 is considered significant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1096348011407311">Hair et al., 2006</xref>). Two variables, “Price checker in shopping malls” and “Internet information access kiosks in a hotel lobby, convention center, or other public venue,” had no significant loadings on any factor (i.e., their loadings were less than .3). In contrast, another variable, “DVD kiosks at a hotel lobby, supermarket, or other location,” was found to have more than one significant loading (cross-loading on Factors 1 and 4). One of the recommended actions would be deleting these variables and respecifying the factor model. However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1096348011407311">Hair et al. (2006)</xref> suggest that ignoring problematic variables (e.g., a variable with no significant loadings or with a cross-loading) is appropriate if the objective is data reduction. Since the factor analysis in this study was conducted for data reduction and for finding the most influential factor’s indicators to use them for the subsequent analysis (SEM), respecifying the factor model was not necessary.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-1096348011407311">
<title>Structural Equation Modeling</title>
<p>SEM was conducted using EQS 6.1 software to measure the relationship between independent variables (i.e., age, gender, education, previous experience, need for interaction, role clarity, ability, extrinsic motivation, and intrinsic motivation) and a dependent variable (i.e., likelihood of using SSTs). Based on the results of the aforementioned factor analysis, this study selected the likelihood of using the first SST category (i.e., kiosks and touch screen tables for ordering food or other services at hotels, casinos, restaurants, or pools) as a dependent variable in SEM. This group of SSTs explained the largest amount of variance (39.28%) in the sample (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1096348011407311">Table 1</xref>). In other words, about 40% of total variance in the likelihood of using 22 SSTs was explained by the first group. Compared with the first group, the other three groups explained a much smaller amount of variance (5% to 6%) in the sample. Furthermore, the first SST category represents relatively new SST applications, which seem more appropriate to test influence of “customer readiness” on “usage intention,” compared with other SSTs, which have already penetrated the society.</p>
<p>The researcher selected this technique because several aspects of SEM set it apart from the other multivariate procedures. First, SEM takes a confirmatory rather than exploratory approach to the data analysis. In addition, by demanding that the pattern of intervariable relations be specified a priori, SEM lends itself well to the analysis of data for inferential purposes. Most of the other multivariate procedures are essentially descriptive by nature (e.g., exploratory factor analysis), thus making hypothesis testing difficult. Second, SEM provides explicit estimates of measurement error variance parameters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1096348011407311">Byrne, 2006</xref>). Other methods rooted in regression assume that error in the explanatory (independent) variables vanishes. Thus, applying multiple regression analysis when there is error in the explanatory variables is equivalent to ignoring error that may lead to serious inaccuracies—especially when the errors are sizable. Third, SEM can incorporate both unobserved variables (latent variables or factors) and observed variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1096348011407311">Byrne, 2006</xref>). Finally, EQS uses a covariance-based SEM technique, which is mainly for theoretical testing in which parameter estimations are the main concern. In contrast, partial least square is a component-based SEM technique that aims to minimize errors in all endogenous latent variables. Thus, researchers suggest that the component-based SEM technique, such as partial least square, is primarily for predictive analysis in situations of high complexity but low theoretical information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1096348011407311">Fornell &amp; Bookstein, 1982</xref>).</p>
<p>In addition, the model-building task in this study can be considered as the analysis of two conceptually distinct models. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1096348011407311">Anderson and Gerbing (1988)</xref> suggest this two-step approach over a one-step approach, since separate assessments of the measurement model and the structural model prevent having good fit of one model compensate for poor fit of the other, which can occur with a one-step approach.</p>
<sec id="section18-1096348011407311">
<title>The measurement model</title>
<p>The confirmatory factor analysis measurement model specified five factors: role clarity, ability, extrinsic motivation, intrinsic motivation, and likelihood of using SSTs. The degrees of agreement on the statements for role clarity, ability, intrinsic motivation, and extrinsic motivation and the levels of likelihood of using SSTs are used as indicators (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1096348011407311">Table 3</xref>). Each indicator was constrained to load only on the factor it was designated to measure, the residual terms for all indicators were fixed to be uncorrelated, no equality constraints on the factor loadings were imposed, and the factor covariances were free to be estimated.</p>

<title>The structural model</title>
<p>After confirming the measurement model, the structural model shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1096348011407311">Figure 1</xref> was developed to test the hypotheses. In addition to four factors (role clarity, ability, extrinsic motivation, and intrinsic motivation), five more variables were added: gender, age, education, need for interaction, and experience. The EQS program recommends users to set the highly correlated variables as covariances. For example, in the case of a confirmatory factor analysis model, factors are usually allowed to correlate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1096348011407311">Bentler, 1995</xref>). Thus, four factors in this study (i.e., ability, role clarity, extrinsic motivation, and intrinsic motivation) were set as covariances to handle the multicollinearity issue.</p>
<p>The initially hypothesized structural model represented a good fit to the current data, χ<sup>2</sup>(179, <italic>N</italic> = 614) = 582, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, CFI = .947, IFI = .947, standardized RMR = .099, and RMSEA = .066 (CI = .055, .066). The EQS program is unique about its provision of (a) the LM test for suggesting more parameters (i.e., structural paths) to be added into an initial model and (b) the Wald test for suggesting redundant parameters to be dropped from the initial model. For the initial model of this study, the LM test suggested that no more parameter be added, but the Wald test suggested that four free parameters in the model be dropped. This suggestion was consistent with the results that these parameters (=structural paths) were statistically not significant (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05), and the estimates of standardized regression coefficients (β) were very small (all β values were less than ±.07; see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1096348011407311">Table 6</xref>).</p>

<p>Revision of the model in accordance with these results led to deletion of structural paths describing the impact of ability on likelihood of using SSTs, gender on likelihood of using SSTs, education on likelihood of using SSTs, and experience on likelihood of using SSTs. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1096348011407311">Byrne (2006)</xref> suggests, we closely examined rationale of dropping these paths with regard to the theories of relationship among the constructs. As discussed in the literature review section, the influence of individuals’ characteristics (e.g., gender) on their technology adoption behaviors have shown inconsistent findings. The impact of consumers’ perceived ability to use SSTs on their likelihood of using SSTs might have been decreased along with their increased experiences with SSTs.</p>
<p>Thus, the modified (final) model was analyzed after dropping these parameters. The fit index of the final model indicated that the model represented an excellent fit to the data, χ<sup>2</sup>(81, <italic>N</italic> = 614) = 212.695, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, CFI = .974, IFI = .974, standardized RMR = .045, and RMSEA = .052 (CI = .043, .060). All structural regression coefficients presented in the final model were statistically significant (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-1096348011407311">Table 7</xref>). In summary, significantly positive direct effects of role clarity, extrinsic motivation, and intrinsic motivation on likelihood of using SSTs were observed. The results indicate that consumers who believed SSTs provide clear instructions for users and understood the instructions clearly were more likely to use SSTs. Similarly, consumers who showed higher levels of extrinsic motivation (i.e., convenience, faster transactions, and no time constraint) and intrinsic motivation (i.e., feeling of accomplishment, enjoyment, and independence) in using SSTs were more likely to use SSTs. On the other hand, age and need for interaction had significantly negative direct effects on likelihood of using SSTs. That is, consumers who believed having interaction with personnel at a hospitality setting is important were less likely to use SSTs than consumers who did not. Older consumers (i.e., aged 43 years and older) were also less likely to use SSTs compared with the younger consumers (i.e., aged between 19 and 43 years).</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>The findings support that SSTs such as pay-at-the-pump, online travel purchases, in-room check-out, and ATMs had the highest rate of acceptance, with more than 80% of the respondents being likely or very likely to use them. This could be attributed to the technologies having been around for a number of years, and thus the consumers are familiar and within their comfort zones when using such SSTs. Vending machines and airline check-in/boarding pass printing also showed a high likelihood of usage.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, relatively new SSTs, such as the ability to use PDAs/smart phones for ordering food or other services, kiosks for language translation at a business center, and Internet information access kiosks in a bar were only preferred by less than 30% of the respondents. From the managers’ perspective, it would be vital to understand customers’ preference before actually implementing an SST system because an underused system could result in losses on their investments. On the other hand, if the SST system is well used, the company will be able to generate a new revenue stream. For example, corporations such as Marriott International, in the last quarter of 2008, experienced nearly $125,000 a day in transactions from users of mobile technology or more than $1.25 million in bookings for that period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1096348011407311">Hayward, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The model and findings in this study support that the proposed customer readiness variables (i.e., role clarity, intrinsic motivation, and extrinsic motivation) have significant impacts on the guests’ likelihood of using a certain type of SST (i.e., kiosks and touch screen tables for ordering food or other services at hotels, casinos, restaurants, or pools). In practice, hospitality customers may evaluate new SSTs positively, but they may choose not to try it if they do not understand their roles and perceive no clear benefit to using it. Also, the model suggests that some individual differences (i.e., age, need for interaction) have significant direct effects on the customer’s likelihood of using SSTs. Particularly, younger consumers and those who do not believe having interactions with employees are important demonstrated their inclinations toward the relatively new SSTs.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the findings indicate that gender differences in SST acceptance have decreased. Gender might not have significant impacts anymore since more technologies have been introduced into our daily lives. Furthermore, nowadays the education level of women has improved and they have become more involved in using technology as part of their education when compared with the past. Interestingly, previous experience turned out to be an insignificant factor. That is, in spite of having experience with SSTs, consumers may not be willing to try new SSTs. The result of hypotheses testing is summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table8-1096348011407311">Table 8</xref>.</p>

<title>Implications</title>
<p>First of all, the most distinctive variable introduced in this study, compared with the previous studies related to customer SST acceptance, was customer readiness. From the findings in direct effects of customer readiness on the likelihood of using SSTs, hospitality managers will be able to take several steps to influence the customer preference directly. The result suggests that a hospitality company must provide consumers with clear instructions as to how to use SSTs so that they can understand the steps and their expected roles. It will be necessary to educate customers with customer-friendly instructions or aids. Furthermore, it will be critical for the managers to confirm that the SST has reasonable steps for the users, including “confirm” or “cancel” options before making their final purchasing decisions. Adding a function that allows the users to cancel their purchases within next 12 hours will help decrease their fears of making mistakes. The results related to motivation suggest that hospitality managers should offer convenience and speed when customers order services or make transactions via SSTs as well as make sure consumer can have their personal feelings of enjoyment or independence while using SSTs.</p>
<p>In contrast, the consumers who indicated a high level of needs for interaction with hospitality employees had a lower likelihood of using SSTs. It is critical for hotel operators to provide the opportunity for those customers to interact with employees or learn from other customers and have personnel or education aids available for customers (e.g., sending mouse pads or magnets with instructions for customers or providing instruction cards in guest rooms). Especially, at the initial stages of implementation, hospitality companies can have an employee standing by a kiosk to assist the consumers with their SST check-in/check-out needs. This approach can take care of the perception of the need for interaction since the employee is available to interact with the customers. However, for the manager’s cost saving purposes, after 3 to 6 months of implementation, the company may need to introduce other assisting methods, such as free calling button attached on kiosks, sending text messages to a user’s cell phone if detailed instructions are requested, or providing customers with SST education session per month.</p>
<p>Another interesting finding from this study was that consumers aged between 19 and 42 years exhibited higher levels of likelihood of using SSTs than older customers. For a practitioner, this result contributes to the understanding of variables that underlie motivations to use SSTs. Hospitality firms may try to provide SSTs in areas where younger customers usually go (e.g., clubs, malls, bars, casual restaurants, coffee shops) or properties targeting younger demographics (e.g., Hard Rock Hotels or W Hotels).</p>
<p>To summarize how the results of this study are compatible with or different from related previous studies, we have constructed <xref ref-type="table" rid="table9-1096348011407311">Table 9</xref>. The results of this study concur with some of these previous studies, but not all. The similarities and differences found in this study can contribute to existing theories/studies by expanding their applicability to the hospitality field. Also, hospitality operators would be able to improve customers’ acceptance level of SST by prioritizing the key determinants revealed in this study.</p>

<p>A challenge that corporations are frequently faced with in the hospitality industry is to persuade consumers to use SSTs. The comprehensive findings in this study can be useful to those hospitality organizations that are currently using SSTs or are considering the use of SSTs in the near future. Hospitality researchers can now study role clarity, extrinsic motivation, and intrinsic motivation as a set of factors affecting their customers’ likelihood of using SSTs. Managers also can apply individual differences to increase customers’ SST trials based on their target markets.</p>

<sec id="section22-1096348011407311">
<title>Limitations and Future Research</title>
<p>In interpreting this research, two limitations should be of concern to the readers. The results and the implications of this study are limited to the hospitality industry and cannot be generalized to industries outside of this industry. Second, due to the timing of this study, no longitudinal data were available for comparison purposes; thus, time was also a constraint.</p>
<p>This study also did not answer why gender difference did not have a significant impact on SSTs adoption behavior. In previous research, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1096348011407311">Atan, Azli, Rahman, and Idrus (2002)</xref> had found that when a scale measures only the most basic computer skills (e.g., how to turn on a computer, how to create a folder using the operating system, and using a word processor), the gender gap appears to have dissipated. However, when a scale measures more advanced user skills and varied applications, then the gap seems to reappear. Thus, the gender differences might have turned out to be insignificant in this study, because advanced skills are usually unnecessary in the use of SSTs. Future studies could examine the influence of gender on SSTs adoption based on skills required to use different SSTs (e.g., check-out via TV and making reservations via mobile devices).</p>
<p>Extrinsic motivation turned out to be most important determinant of consumers’ likelihood of using SSTs. A future study could investigate antecedents of this factor. Without understanding the reasons of low motivation, it would be difficult for managers to encourage these customers to use SSTs. Finally, the long-term implications on guest loyalty through the use of SSTs and ultimately the increase in return on investment can be investigated.</p>
