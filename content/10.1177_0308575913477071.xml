            <p>During the last century, mass media joined the institutions which had traditionally provided the elements for shaping perceptions of reality. As a result, they became central to the process of constructing social reality and to the functioning of modern societies. Among these media, the press is especially significant in delineating dominant cultural patterns and social values and through its use of language, building collective ‘imaginaries’ that influence public opinion. Between 1997 and 2010, 46,638 children adopted from abroad came to live in Spain<sup>1</sup> and of those, 11,459 (24.5%) went to families in Catalonia. They came from 36 different countries, mostly included in the category of ‘Global South’. Thus, they carry phenotypes that are different from those prevailing in Catalonia but are similar to those of many immigrants living in the region. As media portrayals will affect the (re)construction and transmission of collective ‘imaginaries’ on adoption, adopters, adoptees and the originating and receiving countries, an analysis of the language used in 796 articles referring to intercountry adoption, published between 1997 and 2011 in two of the major newspapers in Catalonia, was undertaken.<sup>2</sup>

         <title>Introduction</title>
         <p>Since the end of the 19th century, the mass media have been added to the institutions which had traditionally provided the elements for understanding reality, such as family, school and religious organisations. As they are a means by which reality is socially constructed, they are now central to the functioning of modern societies. Therefore, ‘aiming at them as a study object, one is taking into consideration all the complexity of the contemporary social world’<sup>
               <xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0308575913477071">3</xref>
            </sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0308575913477071">Comas d'Argemir, 2008</xref>: 182). Among these media, the press is especially important in reiterating dominant cultural patterns and values. Through its use of language, it builds what I shall term ‘collective imaginaries’ that greatly influence public opinion. These are more fluid than stereotypes but more robust than perspectives and are ‘imaginary’ in the sense that, despite being widely accepted, much of their content flies in the face of empirical evidence.</p>
         <p>Intercountry adoptions currently involve the movement of just under 30,000 children every year between more than 100 countries and although this figure has fallen by over a quarter since 2004, it still involves a large number of children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0308575913477071">Selman, 2012</xref>). In Spain, it began in the mid-1990s – much later than in countries such as the UK, US or Norway – and coincided with the arrival of immigrants from outside the European Union. Intercountry adoption to Spain grew significantly to a peak of 5541 in 2004 and has since declined to under 3000. The autonomous region of Catalonia has been and is among the principal receiving communities.</p>
         <p>Between 1997 and 2010, 46,638 children born and adopted abroad arrived in Spain and, of those, 11,459 (24.5%) were adopted by residents of Catalonia. The children came from 36 different countries. The majority were born in nations from the Global South and carry phenotypes that are different from those prevailing in Catalonia but shared with many others who have settled there. According to demographic studies, three out of four people living in Catalonia have parents or grandparents who migrated to the region during the 20th century or are recent immigrants. Until the mid-1980s, immigration came primarily from other areas of Spain, but it has been, and still is, being gradually superseded by immigration from elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0308575913477071">Cabré, 1990</xref>: 281–283). Bearing these data in mind, and in order to study the kind of language that the press uses, which could affect the (re)construction and transmission of collective ‘imaginaries’ on intercountry adoption, all articles related to the subject published in two of the major newspapers in Catalonia have been analysed.</p>
         <p>The first analysis focused on articles published between 1997 and 2011 in <italic>La Vanguardia</italic>, the Catalan newspaper with the largest circulation in the region, and <italic>El País,</italic> the national newspaper with the biggest local readership. A start date of 1997 was selected because this was the first year for which complete statistics about intercountry adoption in Spain and Catalonia were published, following the introduction of a mandatory Suitability Certificate [<italic>Certificado de idoneidad</italic> – <italic>CI</italic>] for all adoption applicants (Spanish Organic Law 1/1996 on the legal protection of the child).</p>
         <p>The analysis was carried out in 2012 by searching keywords, such as ‘international adoption’ [<italic>adopción internacional</italic>] in the archives of<italic> El País</italic> (<italic>EP</italic>) and <italic>La Vanguardia</italic> (<italic>LVG</italic>) and extracting all material related to the topic. These include news items, opinion pieces, editorials, special editions, magazines, readers’ letters, debates and conferences, and reviews of TV and radio programmes. Initially, the predominant subjects addressed in the articles were scrutinised and an analysis made of their frequency and the importance attributed to each topic. Then attention was paid to the language used when reporting adoption – domestic or intercountry – adopters and adopted people, and the countries and regions involved. Using the methodology proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0308575913477071">Hammersley and Atkinson (2007)</xref> for analysing this type of evidence, the goal was to reconstruct the representations published in the media as they shape public perceptions on these issues.</p>

         <title>Quantitative analysis of newspaper articles</title>
         <p>Between 1997 and 2011, there were a total of 796 articles referring to intercountry adoption published by <italic>EP</italic> (480/60.3%) and <italic>LVG</italic> (316/39.7%). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0308575913477071">Figure 1</xref> shows the annual variation in the number of articles over the period. The peak year was 2007, even though applications and adoptions had both been declining in Catalonia since 2005.

         <p>The largest category is ‘general panorama’, which comprises broad discussions of intercountry adoptions, looking especially at the countries of origin and the situation in Spain nationally and in its autonomous regions. Particularly noticeable is the difference between the number of articles on intercountry adoption as opposed to domestic adoption and foster care, a contrast that has become especially marked in recent years. News concerning legal changes and reports of illegal practices such as child trafficking and bribery all increased during the research period.</p>
         <p>Articles describing intercountry adoption procedures closely followed and included discussions about eligibility, payment, agencies and the setting up of co-ordinating and/or control organisations. Less frequent were articles reporting on critiques, complaints, favourable opinions, interviews with managers and the agencies that mediate between adopting families, and children’s countries of origin (Collaborating Entities of International Adoption) <italic>[Entidades Colaboradoras de la Adopción Internacional – ECAI].</italic> Lower down the list came articles on domestic adoption and foster care, and on lesbian and gay adoption, the personal experiences of adoptive families and children, and descriptions of searches into the origins of adoptions. Discussions on the relative merits of domestic and intercountry adoption were particularly abundant in the early years of the study, when the press often pointed out the advantages of the former over the latter. Recently this has declined with a greater emphasis on the difficulties of intercountry adoption and the place of domestic adoption as a valid alternative. The remaining topics occurred rarely but are mentioned to give the full picture.</p>
         <p>When observing the corresponding percentages for each topic in relation to the total number of subjects mentioned in the articles published each year, one of the clearest findings is the variation in the distribution of topics over time. With the exception of 2006, many laws relating to all adoption and foster care were debated and passed, and articles on these appear each year but with an increase for domestic provision in 1998, 2009 and 2011. Irregular practices were also mentioned more frequently in the later years, mainly due to reports of attempted child trafficking in Chad and Haiti. This pattern contrasts with that for articles on standard intercountry adoption procedures which, although important early on, have declined since 2007. Similarly, references to <italic>ECAI</italic> fell to a point in 2009–11 where they were hardly mentioned at all. The highest percentages of articles referring to lesbian and gay adoptions occurred in 2004/5, reflecting a wider national debate about changes to the Spanish Civil Code and Catalan civil marriage laws that legalised such arrangements.
</p>
         <p>The issues of ‘adoption and health’, ‘adoption and adolescence’ and ‘adoption and origins’ have only appeared in the press from 2003. These subjects, along with ‘truncated adoptions’ and the ‘integration, cultural proximity/distance’ category, have been included in the analysis to highlight their variety and acknowledge the fact that the proportion of articles published each year on these topics rose slowly until 2009, probably because interest in these issues increased due to the young age of many of the children involved.</p>

            <p>Spanish professionals working in the field of intercountry adoption stress that its purpose is to find a family for a child, rather than the other way round. However, many journalists, adoptive parents, officials and legislators, and even some ‘experts’ quoted in the articles, do not acknowledge this. For instance, the focus is often on the desire of childless couples to start a family or increase their existing one. The reasons behind this are varied but dominated by philanthropy and problems with conception. Both of these motives are accepted and legitimised in the articles, even though the second conflicts with existing intercountry legislation, which states that the child is the most important part of this process, not the unsatisfied desires of adults.</p>
            <p>Articles on philanthropic motivation are especially contentious and many question the real motives behind the wish to ‘help the most needy’ by adopting from abroad. Critics find it difficult to understand why these people opt to adopt from abroad when there are so many Spanish children needing families. Some also question the legitimacy of intercountry adoption as a means of ‘rescuing’ a child from deprivation since the cost of caring for a child up to the age of 18 years in Spain would support 71 children in Ethiopia, almost five in Colombia, six in Ukraine and China and two in Russia (Gómez-Bengoechea and Berástegui, 2009). Further apparent contradictions arise in the discourse about the (non)existence of the adopters’ right to adoption. Experts insist that the only right is that of the child for a family, setting a distance between their views and those of respondents who persistently use expressions such as the ‘right to adopt’ or ‘equal rights’ for adopters.</p>
            <p>This almost triumphalist language has contributed to a distorted picture of the adoption process and might even have influenced what some have called the ‘fashion effect’. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0308575913477071">Brancós Coll (2008: 171)</xref> reported that Catalonia had the world’s highest rate of intercountry adoption in 2004, equivalent to 23.2 internationally adopted children for every 100,000 inhabitants, although the true figure is probably nearer 13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0308575913477071">Selman, 2012</xref>). But whatever the reality, government authorities have often prided themselves on the image of being ‘the world territory with the most intercountry adoption’. The Catalan administration contributes to this perception by favourably issuing suitability certificates (CI). There may be a hidden agenda in that Catalonia has an ageing population and a birth rate below replacement level but, paraphrasing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0308575913477071">Dorow (2006: 208)</xref>, the salient message from the research is that the representation of intercountry adoption in the press feeds the myth that Catalonia ‘benevolently educates and receives the world’.</p>
            <p>From 2005 onwards, and coinciding with the first year of a decline in the number of such adoptions, the media downplayed the significance of this fall. But since then, and especially over the last three years, there have been reports highlighting the ‘difficulties’ encountered by those who choose to adopt from abroad. Also starting in 2005, concerns about this practice have been expressed by national and regional administrations, in sharp contrast to previous years when intercountry adoption was explicitly encouraged. In Catalonia, the government went further, declaring domestic adoption the priority for the Department of Social Action and Citizenship [<italic>Departamento de Acción Social y Ciudadanía</italic>] – a radically changed message. Rather than boosting intercountry adoption through the <italic>ECAI</italic>, it now promoted domestic adoption and, above all, fostering. Perhaps the reason for this is the need to redirect certain groups of applicants, such as single-parent and lesbian and gay adopters, to these other groups of children with the aim of reducing the numbers living in residential care homes. This would radically alter the image of Spain as being the only EU country with 75% of children in care living in state institutions. These two groups of applicants have thus joined those barred by the increasingly strict requirements for intercountry adoption imposed by the countries of origin, or by their economic circumstances, to increase the pool of potential carers interested in domestic adoption and fostering.</p>
            <p>But, even though this policy was clearly established, the actions of government agencies have not moved in the same direction. Not only did the percentage of <italic>CI</italic>s granted in Catalonia stay the same but also, in October 2005, the government announced that as a result of the Law of Family Support application, Catalans adopting children from abroad would receive €2300 in aid. They began to apply this measure in 2006, although since 2010 the requirements have changed.</p>
            <p>Articles discussing intercountry adoption tend to use a vocabulary common in commerce or business; there are phrases such as the ‘cost of processing’ applications or descriptions of the adoptees as ‘available children’, ‘given child’ or ‘imported boy’. These articles appear to reinforce the idea of a passive role assigned to the children in the processes. The reason for this may lie in the fact that they are considered ‘objects’, stripped of humanity, without voice or vote, reified and sometimes even interchangeable, providing an example of what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0308575913477071">Constable (2009: 50)</xref> calls the ‘commodification of intimacy’.</p>
            <p>Many people who respond to press coverage question the legitimacy of the adoptive relationship. The language used sometimes implies a ‘second-category parent–child relationship’ in which the bonds are not as ‘real’ as biogenetic ones. Despite the process of intercountry adoption seeming to offer many alternatives, it is often perceived as a last resort for people wanting to have children, that is to say people only apply for it after having experienced difficulties with conception, having used assisted reproduction technology and after eliminating domestic adoption as an option. Journalists, legislators and adopters agree that the decision to request an intercountry adoption is usually motivated by the lack of ‘supply’ of the sort of children they want – very young and without special long-term needs – among those in care in Spain, as well as by the speedier process. The newspapers also reported other reasons mentioned by some specialists: the fact that unlike domestic adoption, intercountry adoption has no ‘trial’ period of pre-adoptive placement, with potential legal complications and the need to form some kind of relationship with the biological family. The ‘philanthropic’ facet and the social prestige attached to it also seem absent from domestic adoption.</p>
            <p>The effect of these factors could be reduced. For example, the time needed to complete an intercountry adoption application varies considerably depending on the country of origin. The average time needed to complete the intercountry process has increased, although it is still shorter than for domestic adoption, but saturation in the countries of origin may continue to affect these deadlines, increasing them further. In addition, the profile of the children involved has changed. They are now older and not always ‘healthy’, and many young children born in Spain and available for domestic adoption are the sons and daughters of immigrant mothers from the same regions as the children coming from abroad. Their adoptions are ‘perceived’ as being from abroad even though they are in fact domestic.</p>
            <p>The fact that, unlike the domestic alternative, intercountry adoption has no pre-adoption ‘trial’ period can be detrimental to the former for the reasons mentioned above. However, the Bill of Rights and Opportunities for Children and Adolescents [<italic>Ley de Derechos y Oportunidades de la Infancia y la Adolescencia</italic>], approved in May 2010 by the <italic>Parlament de Catalunya</italic>, limits to two years the period during which the biological family is entitled to reclaim its child. Nationally, the new Law on National Adoption and Foster Care [<italic>Ley de Adopción Nacional y de Acogimiento Familiar</italic>], still pending, should have the same effect, overcoming reluctance and boosting the incidence of domestic adoption.</p>
            <p>Processing an application for domestic adoption is free of charge, while applications for adopting from other countries are still expensive, despite aid being granted by some autonomous regions. In addition, all published adopters’ profiles have described families or individuals as belonging to the ‘middle or upper classes’, with average incomes well above the average for the general population. It is also reported that the vast majority own their home and are in regular employment. If we add the fact that most of the intercountry adoptions that occurred during the study period were from countries where the procedures are particularly expensive, such as Eastern Europe and China, it seems that for Spanish applicants the cost of the adoption process is not a limiting factor when choosing the country to which they will apply. Thus, adopting from abroad is presented in the press as only being accessible to candidates with a solid financial situation – perhaps a reason for the social prestige assigned to it.</p>
            <p>Although the newspaper articles rarely discuss these factors directly, they do imply that intercountry adoption is costly and therefore only feasible for certain groups. In addition, it is portrayed as showing generosity, sympathy and openness on the part of the adopters, an opinion mainly supported by government statements. However, this attitude is not shown in equal measure towards domestic adopters because domestic adoption has until recently largely been ‘invisible’.</p>
         </sec>
         <sec id="sec5-0308575913477071">
            <title>Adopters and adopted people</title>
            <p>The overall picture of the children involved in interountry adoption, as portrayed in the press, reflects stereotypes about their birth countries that are generally negative and tragic. Despite considering such adoption as a ‘last resort’ for forming or enlarging their families, many people have presented it as the only way that children in some countries can survive their circumstances, regardless of the fact that many of them might not be adoptable and governments may only allow intercountry adoption after exhausting every possible local alternative. They are often described as victims without families, ‘survivors’ presented with an opportunity to become members of a ‘privileged’ social group, incorporating not only a change of country and cultural context but also social class. For all these reasons, they are sometimes expected to show a degree of gratitude toward their new families. Consequently, the adoptive parents are seen as ‘saviours’ of these ‘rescued victims’. These ‘open’ and ‘generous’ people offer them a better future in the ‘First World’, the societies of which have a social responsibility to ‘adopt them’. In addition to the courageous, open, generous and progressive nature attributed to the adopters by the press, it is suggested that they are convinced that their children live in a Spain (and a Catalonia) that is non-judgemental in terms of ethnicity and race.</p>
            <p>The list of ‘specific’ features attributed to children adopted from abroad compiled from the newspaper content showed that in reality these ‘so much desired’ children are not considered ‘normal’ in comparison with other ‘Spanish children’. This perception of ‘abnormality’ is not only associated with a history that may or may not include being orphaned, abandoned, abused and deprived but also with their country of origin and traits associated with a phenotypical ‘otherness’. Added to this is a common belief that being born in another country implies the existence of cultural differences, regardless of the age at which the child is adopted. Phenotypic differences are often used to indicate cultural differences, with culture seen as inherited in an almost deterministic way.</p>
            <p>This phenotypic otherness associated with intrinsic cultural difference is also related to a non-membership in the host society. Thus, these children and young people are described as ‘foreigners’ or ‘outsiders’ attributed to a different country. In the eyes of the host society the child’s ‘different’ physical appearance reinforces a perception of national and cultural ‘otherness’, with little possibility of modifying these traits. This is irrespective of children’s ages upon arrival in Catalonia, the length of time they have lived there, their legal status as Spanish citizens, national and local strategies for their social inclusion and their feelings for the ‘culture’ of their country of origin.</p>
            <p>The message would be different if the press referred to these children as ‘born in …’ or ‘originating from …’ and avoided associating the adjectives used with an immutable affiliation to their birth country. This language results in the children being placed in the role of ‘the other’ and groups them, at least in the discourse of the media, with other immigrants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0308575913477071">Nash, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0308575913477071">van Dijk, 1997</xref>). In the last years of the study period, they were sometimes referred to as ‘children coming from abroad’, indicating that there may be increasing sensitivity towards this issue.</p>
            <p>In the newspaper articles, many agencies involved in intercountry adoption concur with specialists who recommend that adoptive families maintain links with their child’s ‘culture of origin’. In addition to the requirements in international treaties, such as Article 20(3) of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, this recommendation is usually based on a need to reinforce a child’s self-esteem. According to the press, some people and/or institutions argue that by valuing the culture of the child’s country of origin, parents help to build a positive image of the child’s phenotype, since the local society inexorably associates phenotypic otherness with ‘foreign’ citizenship. On the other hand, the same press describes Spanish adopters as ‘culturally close’ to Eastern European citizens, which would explain the large number of requests sent to those countries. But in arguing this, are they confusing ‘cultural proximity’ with ‘phenotypical’ proximity?</p>
            <p>Children adopted from abroad with phenotypes similar to people in the host society tend to be perceived as having a different culture but one closer to the Spanish and/or Catalan one. Those who are visibly different in appearance would be perceived as culturally more distant and therefore as non-nationals. The child’s biological origin is replaced by his or her exotic phenotype that invariably points to him or her as a ‘foreigner’, a ‘bearer of a different culture’, as suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0308575913477071">Ouellette and Méthot (2000: 8–9)</xref>. This hypothesis is reinforced by the behaviour of families who adopt from Eastern Europe. They seem less interested in ‘maintaining the culture’ of their children’s original country as they consider it to be very similar to their own (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0308575913477071">Marre, 2007</xref>: 83). For these children, the circle of ‘different phenotype– different home-country–cultural distance’ is consequently closed. Just as adoptive filiation supersedes the biological, cultural origins replace biological ones and come to be perceived as ‘natural’. The evidence gathered for this study suggests that until the host society revises its stereotypes, children who carry a different phenotype will continue to be seen as ‘outsiders’, regardless of the efforts of ‘Catalanisation’.</p>

            <title>Countries of origin</title>
            <p>When discussing children’s countries of origin, the press generally uses a tragic and violent vocabulary. However, these images do allow room for change: it is sometimes reported that when the economic situation of these countries improves, measures are taken to protect children, leading to the decrease of intercountry adoption. If an economic downturn is prompting a government to allow people from economically powerful countries to adopt certain children born in their territories, why not take action to avoid this, rather than taking advantage of the inequality? Thus, the child would rightly be placed at the centre of the process, neglecting the unsatisfied desires of wealthy people to be parents while respecting universal declarations and national and regional legislation.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, in some cases the press denies the cultural and ethnic diversity that is present in many of these territories and creates confusion when speaking of continents or sub-continents as if they were countries. Four major regions are identified as adopted children’s places of origin: Latin America, Asia, Eastern Europe and Africa.</p>
            <p>Latin America is often mentioned as if it were a country. The image of these countries is generally associated with war, violence, insecurity and political instability, as well as with poverty and lengthy intercountry adoption procedures. The countries described in the press articles studied are Colombia, Guatemala, El Salvador, Brazil, Haiti and Nicaragua. Nicaragua’s image is associated with extreme poverty, illegal adoptions and child trafficking whereas that of Colombia has changed according to circumstances, the only permanent factor being misery. When a Spanish couple was kidnapped, there was talk of ‘guerrillas’, ‘crime’ and ‘insecurity’ until the release of the last hostage when it became a place where intercountry adoption processes were ‘rigorous and transparent’, ‘low cost’ but ‘slow’. Both El Salvador and Guatemala have been described as nations where war, violence and missing persons are commonplace, creating a network of child trafficking linked to intercountry adoption. Both these countries and Brazil have also been reported as places where ‘the slow pace is frustrating’. Haiti changed from being a country recommended for intercountry adoption in 2002 to one, in 2004, where the political situation prevented it. Later, in 2010, reports following the massive earthquake contain shocking descriptions of destitute children and attempts by outsiders to help them.</p>
            <p>The Asian continent is never cited as a whole and some of its countries are described as separate entities. Thus, the press refers to China, Vietnam, Cambodia, India and Nepal. There is a substantial amount of information on China, with fairly consistent trends. At first, the one-child policy and the orphanages filled with girls, whose living conditions are described as ‘subhuman’, are depicted. But from the moment when Spanish adopters began applying to China, the newspapers write about ‘speed’, ‘transparency’ and ‘effectiveness’. The few articles referring to Vietnam and Cambodia describe quite negative images, such as difficulty and complexity in the first case, and a lack of transparency in the second. Meanwhile, up to 2004, India was cited as a good example, but since 2007, journalists have written about child trafficking and corruption. Both newspapers paint an especially negative picture of Nepal.</p>
            <p>‘Eastern Europe’ is another region referred to as if it were a homogeneous unit, although some articles describe certain countries individually, for example, Russia, Romania and Ukraine. Articles referring to Russia as a country of origin for adoption have depicted intercountry adoption processes as ‘fast’ and ‘serious’ yet ‘expensive’. While recognising that there are irregularities, these are minimised in the press because they seem to affect ‘just a few’. Russia is presented as a place where one can adopt with all the guarantees and where the only disadvantage may arise from the negative image of intercountry adoption held by the local population. Romania has been described as the anti-model: corruption, trafficking, and lack of legislative frameworks consistent with international laws involving a very expensive process. Similar caution is expressed about Ukraine where the economic crisis, the harsh living conditions for children, the corruption and the inability to adopt through an <italic>ECAI</italic> confound the adoption process.</p>
            <p>Africa, nearly always seen as a homogeneous unit, is described as the ‘Fourth World’ and presented as ‘the great reservoir of helplessness’, lacking infrastructure and legal security. Morocco, Ethiopia, the Democratic Republic of Congo, the Republic of Congo, Malawi, Chad and Guinea-Bissau are all featured. Morocco is shown to be a country that does not recognise intercountry adoption but to which Spanish adopters nevertheless apply. There are references to a large population of orphans and to a long but possible adoption process. Ethiopia’s image is generally very good, although in recent years it has hardened its requirements for applicants, stopping intercountry adoption without <italic>ECAI</italic> intervention owing to irregularities uncovered in the process. The country’s precarious judicial system, explicitly mentioned, did not bother either the applicants or the Spanish or regional authorities, as evidenced by the fact that in a very short time it became the third most popular source of children adopted by Spanish citizens. An event reported throughout the world in which attempts were made by the NGO Zoe’s Ark, to fly supposedly orphaned children from Chad to Europe received wide coverage and led to the banning of intercountry adoption by the Republic of Congo, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Guinea-Bissau. But a quite different situation occurred in Malawi with the adoption of a child by the pop singer Madonna and a perceived opportunity for celebrities to bypass the usual protocols and adopt quickly. As elsewhere in the world, these two events were widely reported in the Spanish press.</p>
            <p>As we have seen, when describing the country of origin of a child adopted abroad by Spanish citizens, the press often writes of war, instability, despair, insecurity, violence, corruption, devastation and/or extreme poverty. However, some countries are reported in a much more positive way. It is not surprising that these include the top three countries in the list of intercountry adoptions to Spain in recent years: China, Russia and Ethiopia.</p>

            <title>The host societies</title>
            <p>In the press, Spain is described as the adoptive parents’ country, as opposed to the country of children who have been adopted from abroad. This shows that, at least to some journalists, the host country is not the adopted children’s country, even if they have lived here for some time. Spain is also described as a ‘rich country’ with the ‘lowest birth-rate in Europe’, and ‘the third (and later, the second) in numbers of intercountry adoptions’. Its modern administration, low levels of ‘failed’ adoptions and more open intercountry adoption legislation are also indicated. When speaking of the ‘Spanish people’, the press refers to their compassionate nature, their solidarity and their consciousness of what happens elsewhere.</p>
            <p>As for Catalonia, the reviewed newspapers point out that its birth rate is lower than in Spain as a whole and emphasises repeatedly, with a vocabulary suggestive of complacency, that it is a world leader in intercountry adoption. It is also mentioned as ‘getting ahead’ or being a ‘pioneer’ in youth protection measures. Describing the Catalan population, politicians and journalists use expressions like ‘great sensitivity’, an ‘open and universal vocation’ and ‘high levels of solidarity and public spirit’. This probably reinforces the idea that Catalan applicants or adopters think they are part of a social network open to diversity, in which their children will not face problems on account of their birth place or physical appearance.</p>

         <title>Conclusion</title>
         <p>This analysis of the coverage and reporting of intercountry adoption in two leading Spanish newspapers reveals how a clear perspective is embraced. The language used to describe the adopters, children, countries of origin and receiving populations reinforces stereotypes about the process and, given the multicultural nature of EU countries, is not helpful to the children involved or the societies in which they live. It conveys images unsupported by evidence and reinforces perspectives that are out of sync with national and local policies on the social integration of all immigrants and their descendants.</p>
         <p>The idealisation of their society might explain the adopters’ difficulties in anticipating and being prepared for the serious discrimination that their children can experience. In countries like Canada (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0308575913477071">Ouellette and Méthot, 2000</xref>: 9), France (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0308575913477071">Fréchon and Villeneuve-Gokalp, 2004</xref>: 66) or regions like the Community of Madrid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0308575913477071">Berástegui, 2003</xref>: 239), prospective intercountry adopters do consider the possible consequences of having a child with physical characteristics that are very different from most local children. In Catalonia, however, different phenotypic traits do not appear to be considered as a possible stumbling block to successful inclusion into society. Because of this, children and young people adopted from abroad, those who immigrated with their families, the children of immigrants born in Catalonia and the sons and daughters of mixed-race relationships will be asked throughout their lives, ‘Where are you from?’.</p>
