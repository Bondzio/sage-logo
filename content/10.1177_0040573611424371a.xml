<p><italic>Thinking in Tongues: Pentecostal Contributions to Christian Philosophy</italic></p>
<p>James K.A. Smith</p>
<p>Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 2010. 155 pp. $19.00</p>
<p>Given the frequent charges of anti-intellectualism leveled against Pentecostalism and the scarcity of distinctly philosophical considerations of Pentecostalism, a book such as James K.A. Smith’s <italic>Thinking in Tongues</italic> has been needed for a long time. This book not only defends a substantive philosophical thesis about the possible “Pentecostal contributions to Christian philosophy,” but also articulates a conception of professional philosophy itself as, hopefully, a receptive site for such contributions. That said, this book attests to an increasing vibrancy and vigor in the contemporary philosophical landscape as it concerns Christian belief and practice.</p>
<p>Operating from an inclusive conception of “pentecostalism” (without the capital-P), Smith contends that it should be understood as a “social imaginary,” or “form of life,” that is defined more by rituals and practices than by beliefs and doctrines. In this way, pentecostalism represents the lived dimension of the Christian faith in all its depth, rather than a narrow conception of propositionally expressible claims to be intellectually affirmed. Accordingly, Smith offers an almost existential critique of what is often understood to be the defining characteristic of membership in the Christian community (a set of beliefs) and also of the dominant mode of discourse in contemporary philosophy of religion (a focus on belief rather than believers). In this way, Smith’s text is reminiscent of Kierkegaard’s critique of the Hegelian abstraction operative in the philosophical community of his day.</p>
<p>In light of the hyper-specialized and highly technical operative vocabulary of contemporary philosophy of religion, I expect that many readers will rightly be sympathetic to Smith’s overarching suggestion that Christian philosophers need to be more receptive, responsive, and responsible to the “saints who don’t have much time for ontology or epistemology but are nonetheless empowered by the Spirit for mission” (151). Even if one agrees with Smith on this point, however, it is unclear whether this book succeeds in, as he says, “articulating an epistemology for the rest of us” (122). Smith quite remarkably attempts to wear the “two hats” of the Christian philosopher by speaking both to the church and to the academy (9). Yet, despite always demonstrating clarity of expression and rigor of analysis (which are common characteristics of Smith’s authorship), this book seems to walk between the two audiences rather than speaking simultaneously to each of them. Accordingly, Smith’s suggestion that pentecostalism offers distinctive contributions to Christian philosophy by providing an “affective, narrative epistemology” (chapter 1), an ontology defined by an “enchanted naturalism” (chapter 4), a proto-postmodern challenge to the assumptions of contemporary philosophy of religion (chapter 5), and (due to glossolalia) a limit case for the philosophy of language (chapter 6) are all quite plausible. Nonetheless, it is unclear whether any of these ideas are really meant for “the rest of us,” or if they are more accurately philosophical accounts about “the rest of us.”</p>
<p>On the one hand, Smith is still clearly writing and thinking as a philosopher about very complicated ideas that become quickly a matter of debate for those who can track with his readings of Husserlian phenomenology, Gadamerian hermeneutics, and criticisms of process thought, for example. On the other hand, because Smith so consistently attempts not to get bogged down in matters of technical scholarly debate in order to speak to the larger audience of the church, the arguments for his claims are often left underdeveloped. No one book can do everything and this book is remarkable for its suggestiveness, even if it is not fully convincing on the specifics. Moreover, Smith makes clear that this book is not meant to be the last word on the matter, but merely an “outline” that stands in need of added “color.” Smith’s book is a text that calls for others to come along and fill in the details of the basic outline he has provided.</p>
<p>While Smith’s call on this front represents an admirable goal, I worry that, despite the state of the discipline reflected by the publication of this book, it would be a very risky career move for any non-tenured philosopher to openly admit to being a pentecostal (with or without the capital-P) and much less to claim to do philosophy from that perspective. Accordingly, as a pentecostal myself (Church of God, Cleveland), I have personally seen how risky professing such an identity can be (especially when working in the Continental philosophical tradition). My hope is that Smith’s book will encourage philosophers to rethink some of their basic assumptions about pentecostalism, while also encouraging pentecostals to become more motivated to see their “form of life” as philosophically robust.</p>
