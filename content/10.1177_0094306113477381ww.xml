<p>Social scientists routinely ignore sexuality or deem it less important than pressing issues like economic inequality, racism, and sexism. In <italic>Being Female: The Continuum of Sexualization</italic>, criminologist Jennifer K. Wesely asks us to take sexuality seriously as a fundamental aspect of girls’ and women’s sense of self as well as their vulnerability in an increasingly pornified culture. Wesely’s continuum of sexualization spans the gamut from gender socialization at one end of the continuum to abuse and violence at the other. This continuum restricts all girls’ development of healthy identities, Wesely argues, forcing girls and women to think of themselves primarily in terms of their bodies and sexual attractiveness which in turn makes them vulnerable to sexual victimization.</p>
<p>To illustrate how all girls and women are at risk of developing unhealthy sexual identities and of experiencing sexual objectification and violence, Wesely draws heavily on the American Psychological Association’s <italic>Report of the APA Task Force on the Sexualization of Girls</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0094306113477381">2007</xref>). The report documents four components of sexualization, all of which impede healthy sexuality: (1) believing one’s value comes solely from sexual appeal, (2) holding oneself to a narrow definition of physical attractiveness that is equated with sexiness, (3) being sexually objectified, and (4) having sexuality inappropriately imposed on oneself. Wesely focuses primarily on the third and fourth elements, locating the source of girls’ sexualization in “an increasingly pornographic media landscape” (p. 25) including music videos that link sexuality with young girls, such as Britney Spears’ sexualized school-girl performance in “Baby One More Time,” and pole-dancing dolls and other “prostitution-themed items” (p. 25) marketed to girls. These pornified images and messages, Wesely fears, inhibit girls’ ability to “generate healthier identities for themselves” (p. 23). She writes: “When I consider the experiences of adolescent girls in light of the increasingly pornified gender expectations, I am concerned that their power to lovingly tend to the developing complexity of their identities is dying on the vine, or at least being driven deeply underground” (p. 32). Wesely worries about girls being unable to refuse sex or to negotiate safer sex and having sex at ever younger ages. Yet these concerns are out of sync with current realities: according to the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0094306113477381">2010</xref> <italic>Youth Risk Behavior Survey</italic>, conducted biannually since 1991 by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, far more teens today than two decades ago are delaying first sex, using condoms when they do have sex, and having sex with fewer people. The ubiquity of sexual images and messages notwithstanding, teens are engaging in less and safer sex. Wesely’s argument relies primarily on secondary data, such as the <italic>APA Task Force</italic>, largely excluding the voices of girls and women, which may explain this disconnect.</p>
<p><italic>Being Female</italic> does, however, offer a compelling window into how girls and women, whom Wesely defines as “in-risk” (p. 117)—meaning they face immediate and ever-present dangerous life conditions—grapple with sexuality. For this, Wesely draws on in-depth interviews she conducted with 20 exotic dancers and 20 homeless women. Her intent is to examine what the continuum of sexualization means for women whose lives are “characterized by few outside resources or support” (p. 40). The women’s stories are a painful recounting of neglect, abuse, violence, harassment, and survival, underscoring Wesely’s argument that while all girls and women are at risk along the continuum, “other structural conditions beyond gender inequality contribute to the limitations on the healthy growth of girls” (p. 38), including poverty, racism, and a history of abuse. Wesely indicts the “larger structural conditions and institutional arrangements…putting [these women] at higher risk for destructive experiences of sexualization” (p. 53), using terms such as “empty families” (p. 46) to depict their families of origins and “multiple deficits” (p. 49) to capture their lived realities, language that at times elides the complexities of the women’s narratives. More effective is Wesely’s critique of the criminal justice system’s treatment of girls and women. By relabeling juvenile offenses previously classified as non-criminal—like “runaway” and “person in need of supervision”—into violent offenses, growing numbers of girls who may be fleeing unsafe living conditions are now arrested, “categorized as delinquent and shunted into the juvenile justice system” (p. 76) where they are penalized and punished rather than helped. Wesely calls for reforming the criminal justice system in ways that take into consideration the role of race and gender inequalities, poverty, and abuse in girls’ and women’s lives.</p>
<p>Ultimately, <italic>Being Female</italic> tells us much about unhealthy sexuality—we learn that it is directed outward as performance rather than inward as feeling, and involves “self-sexualiz[ation]” and “oversexualization” which can lead to “eating disorders, low self-esteem, and depression” (pp. 56–7). Less clear is what healthy sexuality looks like or how girls and women attain it. Implicit throughout the book is a notion that, without the negative influences of culture, girls would be less sexual and this would be safer and healthier for them. Wesely writes: “Without a sense of autonomy over their sexual health and desires, girls cannot be agents in their sexuality or truly assert what they want and—perhaps more important—what they do not want for themselves sexually” (p. 67). Yet can girls (or anyone for that matter) experience sexuality autonomously, as unmediated by culture and interpersonal relationships? To what extent is sexuality a process that develops over the life course and what do sexualized media images and messages mean to girls and women as they navigate this process? <italic>Being Female</italic> offers a launching point to explore these and other critical questions.</p>
