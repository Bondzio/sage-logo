<abstract>
<p>This article argues that in medieval India processes of identity formation and hierarchies within the Jain community were drawn upon temple consecration and pilgrimages. The various events described in the Jain sources include pilgrimages, installation of idols, building and renovation of temples and interaction of the Jain pontiffs with the rulers. The presence of inscriptions and the writing of religious texts in Rajasthan and Gujarat on a very large scale clearly establish that this region was the hub of Jain religious activities, even when the sultanate and later-day Mughal forces made successful military campaigns to this region. The acumen of the Jain monastic community and the laity, rather than so-called spiritual superiority or charismatic powers, played a defining role in gaining concessions for the community. The religious symbols were used as forms of social manipulation. The Jain religious <italic>sangha</italic> was not a break with the lay society. The community formed itself by the efforts of individual elites who allied themselves through various symbolic acts and religious activities. Philanthropy was a part of a well-structured community organization. The relative independence of an ascetic institution was used as an agency by the Jain laity to ensure social dominance. The objective of this article is to set out certain areas for future research, as the range of the period under consideration is broad. Sources such as inscriptions, memoirs, historical narratives and hagiographical accounts substantiate the basic arguments as a prelude to deeper research on this theme.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In medieval India, the elites of the religious community of the Jains formulated and reconstituted their religious and social authority through engagements with pilgrimage centres, temples, <italic>sangha yātrās</italic>,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0257643013477249">1</xref></sup> festivals and rituals. The Jains deeply cared for their <italic>math</italic> and temple buildings. Constructing temples was one way to achieve good <italic>karma</italic> and Jain temples are found in huge concentration in some places for the period of this study. In fact, organizing pilgrimages, visiting centres of pilgrimage and temple-building activities were all invariably interconnected, through which the individual became part of the community. So, temple renovation at pilgrimage centres and <italic>sangha yātrās</italic> to pilgrimage centres were continuous activities for the Jain community of northern and western India. The renovation of temples destroyed either by natural calamities or due to enemy invasions symbolized the resurgence, prosperity and commitment of the community. Jain pilgrimage narratives sought to map a landscape through the details of pilgrimages undertaken to various centres and to praise the individuals who made such efforts. The formation of Jain identity and hierarchy in the period of the present study was dependent upon temple consecration and pilgrimages. In this process, literary and religious texts glorified the significance of the concerned temple within both the local and larger communities. The community was identified not just on the basis of individuals abiding by the ethical norms prescribed in the religious texts; rather, the sharing of common interests and the spirit of togetherness was a significant aspect of the formation of community identity.</p>
<p>The social hierarchy of the medieval Jain community is very easily understood from the descriptive analysis, in contemporary documents, of salutations and titles. Usually a Jain <italic>sangha</italic> had a fourfold structure (<italic>chaturvidha sangha</italic>): <italic>sādhus, sādhvīs, shrāvaks</italic> and <italic>shrāvikas</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0257643013477249">2</xref></sup> It was headed by an <italic>acharya</italic>, or preceptor, who was respected as its ruler. The <italic>acharya</italic> had a community of disciples and followers residing in different places. The <italic>acharya</italic>, being the head, guided the moral and pious actions of his followers. In fact, unlike Buddhism, Jainism never adopted a reclusive approach. It admitted to its <italic>sangha</italic> not only <italic>munis</italic> and <italic>sādhvīs</italic>, but <italic>shrāvaks</italic> and <italic>shrāvikas</italic> as well. Thus, the laity secured a well-established place along with ascetic members, which helped in the formation of the Jain community and in furthering its cause.</p>
<p>The relationship between the leaders and the community was established through activities like pilgrimages, idol installation and temple construction sponsored by Jain <italic>acharyas</italic> and <italic>sanghapatis</italic> (patrons or leaders). These activities were a way to acquire community leadership, instead of being just religious activities performed by the laity at the instigation of the Jain <italic>munis</italic>. The activities were processes of secular networking as well. The patrons of pilgrimages and temple construction could be naturally inspired to become, and were indeed elevated to, the status of community leaders. Community mobilization for <italic>sangha yātrās</italic> and religious deeds gave the <italic>sanghapatis</italic> an upper hand in the community affairs in their given localities. The <italic>sanghapatis</italic> were necessarily affluent and were those who could establish equilibrium of interests between the state and the community. Thus, it was not just the assertion of sanctity of the great deeds that was demonstrated; rather, the moral authority of the <italic>munis</italic> and <italic>sanghapatis</italic> in the contemporary society and state was heightened for all practical and materialistic considerations. The possession of spirituality and wealth alone was not significant; rather, its demonstration via the moral route of the community was an essential requirement to claim status as well as to get a shield of protection against the nitty-gritty of medieval polity and economy. The vocabulary used in the characterization of the ruling classes was no doubt religious but nowhere does one find a sense of hatred. Here one has to accept that identities were not just religious or monolithic: rather, interactions among individuals of different communities occurred at various levels, based on multiple overlapping interests.</p>
<p>Evidences from the Jain sources suggest that the progress of Jainism in Rajasthan and Gujarat was the outcome of the presence and efforts of celebrated Jain <italic>munis</italic> of various orders. The Khartar, Tapā, Añchal and Sāgar <italic>gacchas</italic> had a large following in this region and a large number of temples were constructed under their leadership.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0257643013477249">3</xref></sup> Commending the settled life in monasteries, Hemchandra in his <italic>Yogsastra</italic>, written in <sc>AD</sc> 1160 declared that, ‘most beneficial to the life of the ascetics is the provision of lodging, for an <italic>upāshraya</italic> furnishes them with food and drink and clothing and beds at the same time, and protects them from cold and heat, and thieves, and stinging insects’. Similarly, the Tapā <italic>gaccha muni</italic> Devendra Sūri in his <italic>Shraddha-Dina-Krtya</italic> written in the thirteenth century <sc>AD</sc>in Prakrit discusses various legitimate alms for a <italic>sadhu</italic>. The best of all of them ‘is the gift of a dwelling-place (<italic>vasati</italic>) for, in addition to food and shelter, this gives the possibility for study and meditation and development of righteous life’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0257643013477249">4</xref></sup> Another source echoing similar sentiments, the <italic>Vividhatīrthakalpa<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0257643013477249">5</xref></sup></italic> (<italic>The Guidebook to Various Pilgrimage Sites</italic>) was written by the Shwetambara Jain monk Jinaprabha Sūri (<sc>AD</sc>1261–33). It was composed just after the Delhi Sultanate took direct control of Gujarat in western India from the Hindu Chaulukya–Vaghela (Solanki) dynasty that patronized Jains. The <italic>acharya</italic> Jinaprabha Sūri himself took the trouble of travelling to distant places like Raivataka, Shatrunjaya, Stambhatirtha, Arbuda, Satyapura, Anahilpura, Naskiya, Pratishthana, Mathura, Kausambi, Ahicchatra, Kampilya, Sravasti, Champa, Patliputra, Varanasi, Hastinapur, Kanyanayana, Phalavardhika and other <italic>tīrthas</italic>. He has not only given detailed accounts of these Jain <italic>tīrthas</italic>, but has also recorded some very significant historical events connected with those places.</p>

<title>Patronizing the <italic>Tīrtha</italic></title>
<p>The growth of a Jain pilgrim centre as a result of the religiosity and piety of the Jain elites can be cited to strengthen our case. The sacred hill of Śatruñjaya is located in Palitana, an erstwhile princely state in the Saurashtra<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0257643013477249">6</xref></sup> region of the state of Gujarat, 51 km south-west of Bhavnagar, at 2,000 feet above sea level. Śatruñjaya, or the Place of Victory, is considered to be one of the holiest pilgrimage sites for the Jains. A temple complex was built up here during the Chalukya dynasty, beginning from the tenth century <sc>AD</sc>, with renovations and new construction continuing well into the medieval period.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0257643013477249">7</xref></sup> It has been acknowledged as ‘the first of places of pilgrimage’. Abul Fazl acknowledged Śatruñjaya as <italic>Mo‘bad-i Jain</italic>, that is, ‘it is in great veneration with the Jains’. Abul Fazl also noted the importance of the hill of Girnar as a place of ‘worship of the Jains’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0257643013477249">8</xref></sup> The <italic>Mir’at-i Ahmadi</italic> mentions that the most important pilgrimage centre situated in Gujarat was Śatruñjaya in Palitana.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0257643013477249">9</xref></sup> In olden times Palitana was also called Pundrikagiri. James Ferguson, who visited Palitana in 1840, compared its style to Gothic architecture. In the Jain tradition, Śatruñjaya remains the symbol of all piety, alms-giving and liberation of humankind. The most well-known work on Śatruñjaya was the <italic>Śatruñjayamahātmya</italic> by Dhaneshvar Sūri.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0257643013477249">10</xref></sup> Two other significant literary works about this pilgrim centre were the <italic>Tīrthakalpas</italic>. The first <italic>kalpa</italic> in Prakrit was written by the Tapā <italic>gaccha acharya</italic> Dharamghosh Sūri. The second <italic>Vividhatīrthakalpa</italic> in Sanskrit as mentioned earlier was written by the Khartar <italic>gaccha</italic> pontiff Jinaprabha Sūri. As we learn from Jinaprabha Sūri, this site is significant because twenty-three <italic>Jinas</italic> preached there. In the Jain tradition, there is great merit in erecting a temple or consecrating an idol in the Śatruñjaya site. According to Jain mythology, the first Jain <italic>tīrthankar</italic> Rishab Dev, or Adinatha, attained <italic>kewal gyan</italic> and his son King Chakravartin Bharat built a magnificent temple here. Out of the twenty-four <italic>tīrthankars</italic> of the Jains all except Neminath remained associated with the place. Further, countless numbers of ascetics, kings, princes, royal seers and even the Pandava brothers and their mother, Kunti, attained liberation here.</p>
<p>Most of the Jain temples of Śatruñjaya date back to between <sc>AD</sc>1000 and 1300 when the Solanki dynasty of western India patronized the Jain religion. One thousand two hundred and fifty temples sheltering over 10,000 statues are bracketed into nine enclosures called <italic>tonks</italic>, each being named after its principal benefactor. The construction of temples spanned a period of 900 years. These temples were built in two phases. The first phase was from the eleventh to thirteenth centuries <sc>AD,</sc>as a part of resurgence in temple-building all over India. The second phase was from the sixteenth century <sc>AD</sc>onwards. Political uncertainties during the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries <sc>AD</sc>put a hold on temple construction, though renovations and idol consecration continued. The existing temples date back to the sixteenth century <sc>AD</sc>onwards. There was only one temple belonging to Digambaras at Śatruñjaya. It was built in <sc>AD</sc>1629 by <italic>sanghvi</italic> Raghavaji Ranji of the Hummad Vania caste, a native of Ahmedabad. The temple contains fourteen images of Shantinath.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0257643013477249">11</xref></sup> It seems that due to continuous efforts by the Shwetambaras to establish their control over the hill from the medieval time onwards, the Digambaras lost their control over, as well as their interest in, the hill.</p>
<p>The establishment of the Delhi Sultanate and its expansion into the new regions created a new challenge for the Indic religious communities. Hitherto living under the political patronage of the Rajput rulers, these religious communities and their leadership had now to negotiate with the new political realities. It was not just an issue of dealing with alien rulers of a different religion; rather, a new social fabric had to be created for coexistence and legitimacy of the various religious communities in the new political regime. This dilemma was more explicit in the context of the religious elites who, in the process of ensuring the unity of, and rights for, their communities, had to negotiate with the new rulers. They had not only to legitimize their dealings with the new political order but had to co-opt new rulers and their communities within the ambit of the existing social composition.</p>
<p>The tradition of leading groups of pilgrims visiting religious centres and renovation activities flourished during the sultanate period as well. Jagdu Shah of Kutch took a Jain congregation to Siddhāchal<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0257643013477249">12</xref></sup> and Śatruñjaya in VS 1319/<sc>AD</sc>1262 and established seven idols. He was disciple of Paramdev Sūri.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0257643013477249">13</xref></sup> This practice was continued by Pethad Shah (Prithvidhar) of Mandavgarh, who, according to tradition, was the disciple of Tapā <italic>gaccha acharya</italic> Dharmaghosh Sūri. In VS 1320/<sc>AD</sc>1263 he took a big congregation to Siddhāchal and built the temple of <italic>tīrthankar</italic> Shantinath. He is said to have built eighty four <italic>jinālayas</italic> (Jain temples) at various places, including Girnar, Junagarh and Prabhas Patan.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0257643013477249">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>Under Sultan Alauddin Khalji this relationship entered a new phase. The Digambara pontiff Mahasen came to Delhi from South India to explain Jain theology in the royal court. As per the Jain narrative, the sultan respected the <italic>acharya</italic> for his insightful learning and asceticism. Alauddin Khalji also honoured the Shwetambara <italic>acharya</italic> Rāmchandra Sūri.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0257643013477249">15</xref></sup> The <italic>Nābhinandanoddharaprabandha<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0257643013477249">16</xref></sup></italic> of the Jain pontiff Kakkā Sūri written in VS 1392/<sc>AD</sc> 1335 gives details of the pious deeds of the Gujarati merchant Samra Shah, a Jain <italic>shrāvak</italic> of Upkesh (Oswal) caste and Vesata <italic>gotra</italic>. His friend and well-wisher was ‘Alalpa Khana’, the governor of Gujarat. He can certainly be identified as Alp Khan, the governor of Gujarat during Alauddin Khilji’s period. Alp Khan gave the necessary <italic>farman</italic> (edict) to Samra Shah to rebuild the temple of Adinatha at Palitana. He received permission for the renovation of Śatruñjaya from Alauddin Khalji. The Emperor also permitted him to mine marble from the Mammaad mines. Ultimately, in VS 1371/<sc>AD</sc> 1314–15 Samra Shah took out a <italic>sangha yātrā</italic> from Patan to Śatruñjaya and consecrated the idol. The occasion was graced by many pontiffs, including Tapā <italic>gaccha acharya</italic> Ratnakar Sūri. The <italic>Vividhatīrthakalpa<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0257643013477249">17</xref></sup></italic> of Jinaprabha Sūri, a contemporary text belonging to the time of Samra Shah, narrates that the <italic>mūla nāyak</italic> (main idol) of the Adishwar temple in Śatruñjaya was built by a merchant in VS 1371/<sc>AD</sc> 1314 after it was destroyed by <italic>mlecchas</italic> (barbarians) in VS 1369/<sc>AD</sc> 1312. Two epigraphs<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0257643013477249">18</xref></sup> found from Śatruñjaya dated VS 1371/<sc>AD</sc> 1314 confirm this detail. At the same time, the Jain sources pretend as if the permission granted by the ‘Muslim ruler’ Alauddin Khalji for the renovation of the temple and the mining of marble was more an act of strategy by Samra Shah instead of being a conciliatory or friendly gesture by the ruler. It could not have been that temple desecration was a ‘conscious’ act but the permission for its renovation was an unconscious one instigated by others. Qutubuddin Mubarak Shah Khilji invited Samra Shah to Delhi in <sc>AD</sc>1320. Samra Shah was favoured by Sultan Ghiyasudin Tughlaq as well. Samra Shah died in VS 1393/<sc>AD</sc> 1336 and the text <italic>Nābhinandanoddharaprabandha</italic> was written to narrate his pious activities, by his guru Kakkā Sūri.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0257643013477249">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>As per the Jain tradition, the Khartar <italic>gaccha</italic> pontiff Jinaprabha Sūri won the admiration of <italic>Asapti<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0257643013477249">20</xref></sup></italic> (Qutu’b ddin Mubarak Khalji). Later on he was also invited to Delhi by Sultan Muhammad Tughluq, to be greatly honoured by him.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0257643013477249">21</xref></sup> The other Jain religious figures known for their interaction with Muhammad Tughluq are Rājshekhar Bhim, Mahendra Sūri, <italic>bhattārak</italic> Simha Sūri, Somprabha Sūri and Som Tilak. But Jinaprabha Sūri was the most influential Jain personality. He belonged to Tambi <italic>gotra</italic> of Srimāl caste. According to <italic>Vividhatīrthakalpa,</italic> in VS 1385/<sc>AD</sc> 1328–29 Jinaprabha Sūri’s command over Persian played an important role in his interactions with, and influence over, the Sultan.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0257643013477249">22</xref></sup> Impressed by his poetic flair and thorough knowledge of the various religious and philosophical schools in India, the Sultan rewarded Jinaprabha with some blankets and other gifts, which the latter reluctantly accepted. On one occasion Jinaprabha was called back to Delhi to settle some religious matters for the Sultan. One of his chief ministers was ordered to wipe the mud from Jinaprabha’s feet.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0257643013477249">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>The <italic>Vividhatīrthakalpa</italic> discusses Jinaprabha Sūri’s relations with Sultan Muhammad Tughluq in great detail and furnishes an account of all the Jain pilgrimage centres that were extensively toured by the pontiff. The final verse of Chapter one of <italic>Vividhatīrthakalpa</italic>, named <italic>Śatruñjayakalpa</italic>, is addressed specifically to Sultan Muhammad Tughluq: ‘The king of kings has been pleased by my beginning of this, and so this <italic>kalpa</italic> will always be victorious as the Grace of the King.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0257643013477249">24</xref></sup> As per <italic>kalpānka</italic> 22 of the text, entitled <italic>Kanyānayana Mahāvirapratimākalpa,</italic> Jinaprabha was not only honoured but also secured a <italic>farman</italic> in favour of Shwetambaras, making their <italic>tīrthas</italic> secure against Muslim ravages. The text further narrates that Muhammad Tughluq, under the influence of Jinaprabha Sūri, restored the idol of Lord Mahāvira to Kanyānayana, from where this icon was brought forcibly to Tughluqabad in VS 1385/<sc>AD</sc> 1328. After getting the image back from the Sultan’s treasury, Jinaprabha was taken on a parade around the town on an elephant, as an acknowledgement of his pre-eminence in a religious debate.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0257643013477249">25</xref></sup> The Sultan also supported the building of a <italic>Jina</italic> temple dedicated to Lord Mahāvira in Delhi and allowed both the Shwetambaras and Digambaras to offer worship.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0257643013477249">26</xref></sup> <italic>Kalpānka</italic> 51, entitled <italic>Kanyānaya Mahāvirakalpa Parishesha,</italic> written by Vidyātilak Sūri informs us that even the Sultan’s mother respected Jains. A new <italic>Jina</italic> temple built by the Sultan was opened in Delhi in VS 1389/<sc>AD</sc> 1332, where Jinaprabha’s disciple Jinadeva was appointed and he too maintained cordial relations with the Sultan. Jinaprabha had so impressed the Sultan with his knowledge and skills that he could ask for a <italic>farman</italic> for the protection of Jain pilgrimages at Śatruñjaya, Girnar and Falaudi (Falvardhi). Some legends even claim that under the influence of Jinaprabha Sūri, Sultan Muhammad Tughluq visited both the temple complexes at Śatruñjaya and Girnar. The pontiff accompanied the Sultan over a period of at least four or five years to different places, leading to the procurement of various rights pertaining to Jain pilgrim centres. Jinaprabha accompanied the Sultan on his military campaigns and upon his return was awarded a quarter of the town of Tughluqabad for the Jain community, including a hall for Jinaprabha to teach in. Amid great fanfare and celebrations the Jain community emerged as a prosperous community and,
<disp-quote>
<p>[J]ust as when the Hindus ruled and times were not so bad, the glorious Jinaprabha Sūri teaches all those who come to him, even those of other faiths, and all rush to serve him. Jinaprabha also secured <italic>farman</italic>s to allow Jains to go on pilgrimage unharmed and untaxed.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0257643013477249">27</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Ultimately, the Sultan allowed Jinaprabha to return to his own place, Hastinapur, through a <italic>farman,</italic> which also mentioned that Digambaras and Shwetambaras could move freely in the realms of the sultanate without any obstacle.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0257643013477249">28</xref></sup> Jinaprabha Sūri justified his interactions with the Sultan to his readers in the textual narrative. In the opening <italic>kalpa</italic> of the first chapter, <italic>Śatruñjaya</italic>, he unfolds Śatruñjaya’s importance to his contemporaries, revealing a rich understanding of exactly why this pilgrimage site is important to the Jain community and how its long historical association with the Jain community renders it supreme and powerful for the latter. Jinaprabha Sūri begins the <italic>Vividhatīrthakalpa</italic> by eulogizing the site in 133 Sanskrit verses. As per contemporary norms, a pilgrim acquired immense merit (<italic>punya</italic>) by doing the simplest devotional acts, such as performing image worship, or by feeding mendicants or other pilgrims. Quantifying the merits for those who build and maintain temples and images on the mountain, Jinaprabha says that ‘there is 100 times as much merit in installing an image as in doing <italic>pūja</italic>, 1,000 times in building a temple, and endless times in maintaining a temple’. Raising the concerns of his age, Jinaprabha Sūri cautions people not to interfere with those who go on a pilgrimage to, or perform ascetic practices in, Śatruñjaya, and praises those who support pilgrims and ascetics,
<disp-quote>
<p>Whoever oppresses pilgrims to this place, or steals goods, will from the weight of his sin fall into a fierce hell along with his descendants. One who performs pilgrimage, <italic>pūja</italic>, protection of wealth, praise of pilgrims, or hospitality here is praised along with his lineage even in heaven.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>He then goes on to narrate the destruction and restoration of an image from one of the temples, offering a theodicy of sorts for how it was allowed to happen. ‘In 1369 of the Vikrama era the image established by Javali was thrown down by the <italic>mleccha</italic>s, due to the strength of the Kali yuga. In 1371 of the Vikrama era, the god-blessed Samara restored the main image.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0257643013477249">29</xref></sup> This attitude towards the destruction of images by ‘barbarians’, repeated in other chapters, seems to reflect a certain acceptance that this was prone to happen due to the degenerate age in which he lived. It offers an opportunity for Jains, then, by restoring these images and temples, to acquire ‘endless merit’. Echoing the tone of the first chapter in which the images at Śatruñjaya were cast down by ‘barbarians’ Jinaprabha declares, ‘Seeing the great deeds that Muhammad Shah did in the service of the Jain faith, people thought that perhaps this was not the evil age [<italic>kala-Kali-ta</italic>] after all.’ In Chapter 51, Vidyātilak, a junior monk in Jinaprabha Sūri’s order, writes ‘an addendum to the account of the Mahāvira from Kanyānayana’. The <italic>kalpa</italic> narrates events that happened three years after Jinaprabha Sūri recovered the Mahāvira image:<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0257643013477249">30</xref></sup>
<disp-quote>
<p>The chief head of the monastic community, the Glorious Jinaprabha Sūri, prevented the Muslims from destroying the temples made by the Jain lay devotees … by showing them an edict of the Muslim overlord that granted freedom of worship to the Jains. He performed many great deeds that redounded [to] the glory of the Jain faith.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The largesse of Muhammad Shah was not to be continued by his successors. Within a few years the idols at Śatruñjaya were again desecrated. It was only in the sixteenth century <sc>AD</sc>that Karma Shah, an inhabitant of Chittor, took the initiative to renovate the temple complex. He was persuaded to undertake this work by Tapā <italic>gaccha acharyas</italic> Dharmaratan Sūri and Vinaymandan Sūri. Karma Shah was given the <italic>farman</italic> for the renovation by Sultan Bahadur Shah of Gujarat in return for an earlier personal favour. Ultimately, a big Jain congregation celebrated the consecration of a new Rishabdev temple in VS 1587/<sc>AD</sc>1530. The installation ceremony of the main idol was performed by Tapā <italic>gaccha acharya</italic> Sri Vidyamandan Sūri.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0257643013477249">31</xref></sup> Another renovation of the Śatruñjaya took place in VS 1650/ <sc>AD</sc>1593 by Tejpal Soni of Khambat. He was a disciple of Sri Hīravijaya Sūri. The consecration of the temple was performed by Hīravijaya Sūri.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0257643013477249">32</xref></sup> One common factor in all the renovations is the presence of and persuasion by Tapā <italic>gaccha acharyas</italic>, indicating their dominance in the community affairs over Śatruñjaya at the time. Second, the hagiographical literature treats the occasions of rebuilding of Śatruñjaya, particularly after the temple desecrations, as moments of triumph for the community on account of its pious members.</p>
<p>The temple of Sampratri Raja was built in <sc>AD</sc>1618 by Shah Kamalsi Sonavala Bhansali. Another temple was built by Manet Jayamalji of Jodhpur in <sc>AD</sc>1629.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0257643013477249">33</xref></sup> A central temple is on the <italic>Khartarvāsi tuk</italic>, sometimes called <italic>chauk</italic> or square of Siva Somji, a wealthy <italic>shrāvak</italic> of Ahmedabad of the Khartar <italic>gaccha</italic>, who repaired or rebuilt the shrines and surrounded them with a wall in <sc>AD</sc>1618, and whose munificence tradition was strong enough not to diminish. <italic>Sanghapati</italic> Som Ji and his brother Siva Ji of Ahmedabad were ardent followers of Khartar <italic>gaccha acharya</italic> Jinachandra Sūri. With the permission of the latter, they led a congregation to Śatruñjaya from Ahmedabad in VS 1644/<sc>AD</sc>1587. On this occasion <italic>yug pradhān</italic> Jinachandra Sūri conferred the title of <italic>sanghādhipati</italic> on Somji. Somji also got released many prisoners in lieu of money in VS 1648/<sc>AD</sc>1591. Somji built a temple of Shantinath in Ahmedabad, whose consecration was performed by Jinachandra Sūri in VS 1653/<sc>AD</sc>1596. ‘As per the narrative, in the <italic>Khartar vasati</italic> of Śatruñjaya hills, constructed by Somji, Jinraj Sūri consecrated more than seven hundred icons in VS 1675/<sc>AD</sc> 1618’. Somji died before the consecration and so his son, the <italic>sanghapati</italic> Roopji, led the rituals. In the narrative their contribution is applauded. So enormous was the cost that ‘the sum of eighty-four thousand rupees was expended in cordage alone to bring up the materials’, and a sum greatly less to transport from the marble quarries of Mokharno (Makrana in Rajasthan) the single block from which the principal image in the great temple was cut. According to the <italic>Mir’at-i Ahmadi</italic>, in <sc>AD</sc>1618 ‘a shrāvak bania Somji built the temple [of Adishwar Rishabdev] spending seventeen lakh rupees’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0257643013477249">34</xref></sup> Another shrine was dedicated to Pundrika, the leader or <italic>ganadhara</italic> of Adinatha’s disciples.

<p>Sūri also led a <italic>sangha</italic> organized by Thiru Sah of Jaisalmer. In VS 1677/<sc>AD</sc> 1620 the temple constructed by Asakaran Chopra at Medta was consecrated by him. He died in VS 1699/<sc>AD</sc> 1642 at Patan.</p>
<p>During the rest of the seventeenth century <sc>AD</sc>a great deal of construction activity took place at the <italic>Khartarvāsi tuk</italic> of Śatruñjaya. From <sc>AD</sc>1618 onwards at least seven temples were built, along with the principal Chaumukh temple. One is dedicated to Shantinath and contains forty eight images; two towards the west, built by the <italic>sanghvis</italic> Khimji Somji and Lalaji Siva of Ahmedabad, who dedicated them respectively to Parshvanath and Shantinath, have between seventy and eighty images each; another temple built by Lalaji Siva, is near the cloister (<italic>bhamati</italic>), enshrining three images of Dharmanatha and four pairs of feet; a Chaumukh temple built by Rupaji Somaji, a <italic>sanghvi</italic> of Ahmedabad, has two pairs of feet. It is ‘near the Rana tree’, frequently found growing in other small temples over the feet of Adinatha—the <italic>paduka</italic> under the tree being considered as symbolical of the dominion of Adinatha. A sixth temple built by Sah Lakharaj Kamalsi of Ahmedabad has nineteen images of Adinatha, two <italic>sādhu mūrtis</italic>, an image of Chakresvari mata and another of Kavada Yaksha; another Chaumukh, close to the principal one, on the north side, is the seventh temple built by Sah Gopala Devraja, is furnished with seven images of Adinatha and others.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0257643013477249">37</xref></sup></p>
<p>The continuous temple-building activities at the Jain pilgrimage centres in Gujarat particularly during the first half of the seventeenth century <sc>AD</sc>are an evidence of the religious independence enjoyed by the community under the Mughals, as Gujarat was one of the most important <italic>subas</italic> of the empire. In fact, it is quite interesting that most of the inscriptions associated with idol installation or temple-building are the efforts of families of particular kinships and lineages and sometimes, of the local <italic>sangha</italic>. Thus, the social and commercial networking was reflected in the religious orthodoxy of the community as well, which in turn helped the community to identify and locate itself with known boundaries and members.</p>

<title>Constructing the Community through Temples</title>
<p>Temple-building and renovation was an inter-regional activity and not just a localized affair. In Rajasthan, the initial consecration of the Ranakpur temple was held in <sc>AD</sc>1439, presided over by an influential Tapā <italic>gaccha</italic> ascetic named Somasundar Sūri. Texts record the gifting of the temple by its merchant-patron and the land on which it is situated by the ruler of Mewar, as well as the participation of the lay and monastic community in its elaborate consecration festivities. One Kheta of Gujarat presented forty eight gold bars studded with pearls for the balcony of the temple at Ranakpur in VS 1647/<sc>AD</sc> 1590.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0257643013477249">38</xref></sup> In Jaisalmer (VS 1673/<sc>AD</sc> 1616) Todarmal got constructed the doorway of the Begad <italic>gaccha</italic> monastery.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0257643013477249">39</xref></sup> Then in the year VS 1686/<sc>AD</sc> 1629 the golden staff and pinnacle of the Lodharo Bas temple at Pali were erected at a cost of five thousand rupees.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0257643013477249">40</xref></sup> At Nadlai the whole community contributed towards the installation of the votive image at the Adinatha temple situated on Jakham hill fort, in VS 1686/<sc>AD</sc> 1629. Besides the new construction work, the devotees also renovated the old temple of Adinath.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-0257643013477249">41</xref></sup></p>
<p>In this period, too, the Jain Oswal merchant Thahru Shah of Bhansāli <italic>gotra</italic> from Jaisalmer constructed the Parshvanath temple at Lodrawa in <sc>AD</sc>1618. The stone inscription by Sahaj Kirti, engraved on the <italic>shatdal padamyantra</italic>, records that Thahru Shah not only renovated this temple but also constructed five new temples in the same complex. The inscription mentions that Srimal was the name of his father; Chapalde, his mother and Kankade, his wife. He had two sons, Harraj and Meghraj. The idols in this temple were installed by <italic>acharya</italic> Jinaraj Sūri.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-0257643013477249">42</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Mewar region, that is Chittor, Mandalgarh, Chawand, Sadri, Kumbalgarh, Bijolia, Panarva, Kandhar and Udaipur, remained disturbed throughout the latter part of the sixteenth century <sc>AD</sc>due to continued Mughal campaigns to capture the region and often both the sides—Rajputs and Mughals—suffered heavy casualties. As soon as Jahangir assumed power he initiated a series of expeditions from November <sc>AD</sc>1605 against Mewar. From <sc>AD</sc>1613 the Emperor himself took over the affairs of Mewar and arrived at Ajmer to oversee the campaigns. During this phase of disturbances and military expeditions, we find a lot of references in the Jain sources to temple desecration and idol breaking by the Mughals. In an emergency, the Rajputs did not hesitate to take shelter in the Jain temples. Maharaja Jaswant Singh’s son Ajit Singh took refuge in the hills of Abu against Aurangzeb’s rage.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-0257643013477249">43</xref></sup> Thus these religious places suffered the wrath of royal forces. The human cost of this bitter struggle was incalculable. The relentless Mughal pressure, the heavy toll of life among the Rajputs, the depopulation of the country and the ruination of agriculture at last produced their effects. The Mewar <italic>sardars</italic> pressed for peace and opened negotiations with the Mughals through Prince Khurram.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-0257643013477249">44</xref></sup> Ultimately in <sc>AD</sc>1615 a settlement was reached between Rana Amar Singh and Prince Khurram with the consent of Emperor Jahangir.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-0257643013477249">45</xref></sup></p>
<p>As soon as peace was restored, the activities of temple renovation and idol installation received a new impetus. In Ranakpur, Nadlai and Barakana, among other places, temples were renovated and new icons installed after the peace settlement in <sc>AD</sc>1615. The inscriptions of the Ranakpur temple indicate that in <sc>AD</sc>1611, after a fight between the forces of Mewar and the Mughals, some parts of the temple might have been destroyed.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-0257643013477249">46</xref></sup> The Parshvanath temple at Bhinmal, the centre of Srimal Jains, is associated with some myths exaggerating the miraculous powers of the icon. According to the <italic>Tīrth Mālā</italic> composed by Punyakalash and the <italic>Tīrth Mālā Satavan,</italic> VS 1746/<sc>AD</sc> 1689, of Shilavijay, Ghazni Khan Jalori, who wanted to demolish the temple and remove the icon, was forced to abandon his plan due to a miraculous intervention. Thereafter, he handed over the icon to Virchand Mutha, a resident of Bhinmal, who renovated the temple in VS 1671/<sc>AD</sc> 1614. The Mughal forces also carried out depredations in the Sirohi region, taking away more than a hundred Jain bronze idols. They were later handed over to the maharaja of Bikaner and <italic>mantri</italic> Karamchandra Bachhawat preserved them in the Chintāmani temple of Bikaner.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-0257643013477249">47</xref></sup> From several inscriptions we learn that between VS 1561 and 1673 (<sc>AD</sc> 1504–1616.), some important Jain temples were constructed in Bikaner of which the temples of Shantinath, Bhanda Shah, Rishabdeva and Ajitnath were important Jain shrines.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-0257643013477249">48</xref></sup></p>
<p>After the settlement of <sc>AD</sc>1615, several Jain temples were built at Udaipur both by the Shwetambaras and Digambaras. The Jain temple at Ranakpur had its eastern gate demolished by the authorities. It was rebuilt at an expense of forty eight gold coins by the Pragvat Jain family of Usmanpur in VS 1647/<sc>AD</sc> 1590. This temple was again renovated during the reign of Maharaja Karan Singh by a Pragvat Jain named Baradha, and some others, on the instructions of Vijaydev Sūri, as recorded in an inscription of VS 1678/<sc>AD</sc> 1621. An icon of Adinatha was also installed here in VS 1679/<sc>AD</sc> 1622, which was consecrated by Pandit Kela Jayvijay. At the foothills of the Nadlai fort, the temple of Suparshvanath had its icon installed in VS 1669/<sc>AD</sc> 1612 during the reign of Rana Amar Singh by Pragvat Jain Ranatusha and others of Nadol. In Nadol, the Padamparbh Jain temple had three icons installed in VS 1686/<sc>AD</sc> 1629 by Munhot Jaimal of Jodhpur. A grand <italic>pratisthā mahotsava</italic> was celebrated in Nagor in VS 1674/<sc>AD</sc> 1617 and many icons were installed in the various temples on the occasion. In Medta two <italic>pratisthā mahotasava</italic> were held in VS 1677/<sc>AD</sc> 1620 and VS 1686/<sc>AD</sc> 1629, wherein a good number of icons were consecrated by the <italic>acharyas</italic> of Tapā <italic>gaccha</italic>. The opposing sect retaliated. Ashakaran Chopra, an ardent follower of Khartar <italic>gaccha,</italic> also consecrated several icons there. In Jawar, the temple of Shantinath was renovated in VS 1694/<sc>AD</sc> 1637 by Pancholi Virsen, Chaudhri Mohan and others. In Achalgarh five stone sculptures were installed by the family of Shah Ganga Porwal of Sirohi in VS 1698/<sc>AD</sc> 1641. The Parshvanath Jain temple at Barkana in Mewar carries an inscription dated VS 1686/<sc>AD</sc> to the effect that Maharana Jagat Singh I had granted remission in custom duties to people coming to attend the annual fair in <italic>poshbudi</italic>. The Naulakha temple of Pali was also completely renovated in VS 1686/<sc>AD</sc> 1629 by a Srimal family of Shah Dungar and Shah Bakhar, at a cost of five thousand rupees. Several icons were installed by other <italic>shresthis</italic> as well. The <italic>mūla nāyak</italic> icon was also installed.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-0257643013477249">49</xref></sup> The Digambara Jain temple inscription of VS 1726/<sc>AD</sc> 1669 of Udaipur furnishes details concerning several battles fought by Maharana Rajsingh.</p>
<p>Ajmer, Amer and Sanganer also remained quite important centres of the Shwetambara and Digambara sects. Ajmer was particularly well known as a centre of Digambara <italic>bhattāraks</italic>. The Kachwahas of Amer rose to power during Akbar’s reign and then the Digambara Jains strove hard to propagate their religion. The fervour they created in the Delhi area for copying old religious manuscripts permeated also to the Dhundhar area. Bhonsa Mohandas, a trusted minister of Mirza Raja Jai Singh, constructed a Vimalnath Jain temple at Amer in VS 1716/<sc>AD</sc> 1659. This temple is now famous as Juntharam’s temple. One of the inscriptions of this temple bears the dates ‘VS 1714/<sc>AD</sc> 1657’ and ‘VS 1716/<sc>AD</sc> 1659’ and this is the only detailed Jain inscription known from Amer.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50-0257643013477249">50</xref></sup></p>
<p>Chatsu in Rajasthan mentioned as Champavati in the Jain literature has two interesting <italic>pattavali</italic> inscriptions, dated VS 1661/<sc>AD</sc> 1604 and VS 1706/<sc>AD</sc> 1649. Both these <italic>pattavali</italic> pillars contain the images of several <italic>acharyas</italic> of the Digambara Jain sect. The first inscription erected by the orders of <italic>bhattārak</italic> Chandra Kirti belongs to the reign of Maan Singh. The second inscription was engraved by <italic>bhattārak</italic> Narendra Kirti. Malpura, 70 km from Jaipur, was also an important centre for both the sects. <italic>Muni</italic> Suvrta Swami’s massive temple was constructed in VS 1672/<sc>AD</sc> 1615. The inscription of the temple, dated VS 1672/<sc>AD</sc> 1615, records that Bhānuchandra and Siddhīchandra were venerated by Akbar, who bestowed the title of <italic>upādhyāya</italic> upon Bhānuchandra (<italic>Patisaha Shri Akbar pradatta upadhyaya pada dharak</italic>) and some other title on Siddhīchandra. Originally this temple was dedicated to Chandraprabhu. Its <italic>sutradhar</italic> was Parasa. In VS 1691/<sc>AD</sc> 1634 the temple was renovated by some Srimal Jain <italic>shresthī</italic> and an icon of <italic>muni</italic> Suvrta was installed as <italic>mūla nāyak</italic>. The inscription of VS 1672/<sc>AD</sc> 1615 has the words <italic>prasada karita</italic>. Similarly the inscription of VS 1691/<sc>AD</sc>1634 mentions the words <italic>jin bhavan saha shri muni suvrita bimbam karita</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn51-0257643013477249">51</xref></sup> Thus, the renovation took place within nineteen years of construction. Vijaydev Sūri of Tapā <italic>gaccha</italic> is referred to in an inscription of VS 1678/<sc>AD</sc> 1621. He also consecrated the icon of Hīravijaya Sūri in VS 1690/<sc>AD</sc> 1633. Six footprints in stone, those of Adinatha, Chandraprabhu, Shantinath, Neminath, Parshvanath and Mahavir, were installed in VS 1695/<sc>AD</sc> 1636 by <italic>singhvi</italic> Rai Singh and others. Malpura also remained an important centre of the Digambara Jains. During the rule of Arjun Gaur a <italic>dash lakshan yantra</italic> was prepared by Patani Khanu and others and consecrated by Narendra Kirti. Several Digamber manuscripts were also copied here. During Akbar’s reign, Khima Shah, minister of <italic>jagirdar</italic> Jagannath Kachhawa, constructed a Jain temple and a step well in Ranthambor, a part of the <italic>jagir</italic>. Details of the manifold activities of Khima Shah are available in <italic>Khimasaubhāgya Kavyā</italic>. In VS 1687/<sc>AD</sc> 1630, Jayaswal Singhvi Thakurasi got a <italic>rishi mandal yantra</italic> set up at Ranthambor (<italic>Shri Ranthambor idam patram nirmapitam</italic>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn52-0257643013477249">52</xref></sup></p>
<p>Bikaner remained an important centre of the Shwetambaras, particularly the Khartar <italic>gaccha</italic>. The Chintamani Parshvanath temple was completed in VS 1561/<sc>AD</sc> 1504. Later, Bohithara Vachharaj, one of the most important figures accompanying Rao Bika to Bikaner, renovated the temple. Thereafter, the Bachhawat family also brought some icons to the temple. During Akbar’s reign some hundred and fifty idols looted from Sirohi region during the Mughal campaign in VS 1633/<sc>AD</sc> 1576 were handed over to Maharaja Rai Singh of Bikaner. The latter handed over these icons to <italic>mantri</italic> Karamchandra Bachhawat, who had a grand celebration to install the idols in the temple.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn53-0257643013477249">53</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Rishabdev temple at Bikaner was built in VS 1662/<sc>AD</sc> 1605 during the reign of Maharaja Rai Singh. The inscription engraved on the <italic>mūla nāyak</italic> furnishes a great deal of information. Sumati Kallola, a Jain writer, calls this temple the <italic>Śatruñjaya avatar</italic>. Nearly forty icons were consecrated here during the time of the <italic>pratishtha</italic> by Jinachandra Sūri of Khartar <italic>gaccha</italic>. The inscriptions on other icons are also quite informative. One inscription records that Jahangir, who had abolished taxes levied on several Jain temples, including Śatruñjaya, received religious instruction (<italic>Shri Śatruñjayaadi mahatīrtha karmochakai shri salemshahi pratibodhakai</italic>) from Jinachandra Sūri of Khartar <italic>gaccha</italic>.

<p>Lodarava was the first capital of the Bhati rulers of Jaisalmer in the early medieval period. Thahru Sah Bansali, a <italic>shrāvak</italic> of Khartar <italic>gaccha</italic>, renovated a Parshvanath temple in VS 1675/<sc>AD</sc> 1618. This temple is not only important for its architectural value but also for a particular family’s patronage over many generations.

<title>The Making of <italic>Sanghapatis</italic></title>
<p>From the Jain evidences we learn that in the Jain community there were <italic>sanghas</italic> consisting of all adult Jain members, regardless of gender. The function of these <italic>sanghas</italic> was to take vital decisions pertaining to the organizing of religious functions, inviting religious teachers of the community and hosting the groups accommodating such teachers. The leader of a <italic>sangha</italic> was called <italic>sanghapati</italic>. While the Jains used to take out <italic>sangha yātrās</italic> to visit their <italic>tīrthas</italic> or pilgrimage centres throughout the year, the fifth day of <italic>Kartik Suddha</italic>, called <italic>Paryushan Parva, Gyana Panchami</italic> or <italic>Shrut Panchami,</italic> was the most auspicious for pilgrimage purposes. As per the <italic>Śatruñjayamahātamaya,</italic> the most pious act was to take out a <italic>sangha yātrā</italic> and only a <italic>sanghapati’s</italic> life was regarded as being successful. According to the <italic>Śatruñjayamahātamaya</italic>: <italic>‘Indram padam chakripadam shalaghyam shalaghyataram punah sanghadhipapdam taabhyam na vina sukritaajarnaat’</italic> (The status of Indra and Chakravartin is the best in the world but the status of <italic>sanghapati</italic> is higher than theirs, which can’t be attained without good deeds. Being liberal is not enough to be a true <italic>sanghapati</italic>, but justice, mercy, self-control and other such virtues need to be embodied).</p>
<p>‘Many local <italic>sanghas</italic> were grouped together into what was called a <italic>samudāya</italic>’. The head of the <italic>samudāya</italic> was known as <italic>samudāya pramukh</italic>. Besides, at some places there were occupational and professional committees called <italic>gosthi</italic> (guilds). They were not just normative organizations active in the welfare of, and control over, the members; they also functioned as corporate governors to look after the local administration. At some places they also managed the affairs of temples. Non-Jain sources have also described the work of a <italic>sanghapati</italic> in the following manner:
<disp-quote>
<p>Sometimes one of the rich of this community, starting on his pilgrimage, invites all other pilgrims to accompany him, paying the travelling expenses and so on, and thus spends a large amount of money, for which act he receives the title <italic>sanghvi</italic> and is publicly honoured.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn58-0257643013477249">58</xref></sup></p>

<p>The term <italic>pravartaka</italic> has been translated as ‘founder’ in the English translation of the <italic>Ain</italic> but subsequent explanations establish his identity as a religious leader of the <italic>sangha</italic>. According to Abul Fazl, the <italic>pravartaka</italic> ‘on account of his zeal and experience is nominated by the chief religious authority of the time over the pilgrims in this desolate wilderness, to supervise their daily actions and appoint suitable penance for such as are indolent and inclined to ease’. It is surprising that this view is altogether absent in the Jain narratives of the pilgrimages, according to which it was the <italic>sanghapati,</italic> the financial sponsor of the pilgrimage, who dominates the whole discourse; the accompanying <italic>acharya</italic>, guiding and inspiring the pilgrims, remains somewhat eclipsed in the Jain narratives. There was another person who led the <italic>sangha</italic>, as mentioned by Abul Fazl: the ‘<italic>sthavira</italic> [elder], is an assistant to the preceding who controls the refractory and aids the languishing’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn59-0257643013477249">59</xref></sup></p>
<p>The Khartar <italic>gaccha Brhadguruvavali</italic> gives descriptions of many <italic>sangha yātrās</italic>. Whenever a prominent person wanted to organize a pilgrimage he used to send letters of invitation (<italic>kumkum patrikā</italic>) to the worthy men of the community, requesting their participation in the proposed trip.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn60-0257643013477249">60</xref></sup> The first reference is of <sc>AD</sc>1314 when a congregation of pilgrims travelled to Falaudi.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn61-0257643013477249">61</xref></sup> Another description of pilgrimages has been given by Jinaprabha Sūri of Khartar <italic>gaccha</italic> in his <italic>Vividhatīrthakalpa</italic>, an account of the holy places the <italic>acharya</italic> visited. A common factor between the narratives of both the pre-Mughal and Mughal period Jain pilgrimages is the official permission granted through royal <italic>farman</italic>, which the organizers of the <italic>sangha yātrā</italic> had to seek from the rulers. Some of them also sought official protection.</p>
<p>During the <italic>sangha yātrā,</italic> work—overseeing rations, camp, treasury and so on—was allotted among a few notables. It was customary for large groups to move together to perform a pilgrimage under the leadership of a merchant or religious preceptor. The contemporary literature and inscriptions throw light on the organization and methods of pilgrims groups. The pilgrims travelled about twelve to fifteen miles a day either on foot or by bullock cart. They would visit every locality on their way for religious preaching. The pilgrimage used to end with the presentation of gifts to the participants by the <italic>sanghapatis</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn62-0257643013477249">62</xref></sup> Twenty miles was the average distance travelled in a day, given the walking pace of man and animal.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn63-0257643013477249">63</xref></sup> For the convenience of travellers, several villages and towns of Mewar had boarding and lodging facilities.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn64-0257643013477249">64</xref></sup></p>
<p>As per the Jain sources, there was a full-fledged protocol to be followed before the onset of the <italic>yātrā.</italic> Not just personal discipline had to be followed, but the permission of the ruler in lieu of gifts was an essential part of pilgrimage manual. Permission from the ruler was a pre-condition to take out a pilgrimage; in particular, the formal <italic>parwana</italic> of travelling was required to venture into other territories.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn65-0257643013477249">65</xref></sup> As per the Jain pilgrimage manual <italic>Shraddhā Vidhī</italic> an invitation to all the community brethren was an essential duty of the person taking out the pilgrimage. Whosoever was ready to join the pilgrimage had to be taken care of, by offering money or transportation as required. Particularly, the destitute and pessimistic people had to be encouraged. For the travel, camp equipment, utensils and different types of vehicles had to be arranged. To defend the congregation brave soldiers equipped with weapons had to be recruited. A band of singers and musicians (<italic>bhojaks</italic> and <italic>gandharvs</italic>) had to be engaged. Competent volunteers had to be assigned different responsibilities for the smooth journey of the group, as it was the responsibility of the <italic>sanghapati</italic> to take care of each and every aspect of the travel. On the way, temples in every village and town had to be visited to make offerings and, if required, arrange for renovation work. After reaching the destination, multiple offerings had to be made, including some expensive ones. In fact, the Jain pilgrimage manual has been presented in a way that would have deterred all but the affluent and wealthy from organizing pilgrimages. The money and effort required could not be made by the common person, however willing. Thus the class barrier of community leadership was pre-decided.</p>
<p>Thahru Shah also took out a <italic>sangha yātrā</italic> to the Śatruñjaya shrine. There he established stone replicas of the footsteps of the twenty-four <italic>tīrthankars</italic> and many Ganadhars. During this <italic>sangha</italic> procession Samaysundar Upadhyaya composed his famous <italic>Śatruñjaya Raas</italic>. For having organized such a large community gathering Thahru Shah was conferred the title of <italic>kachhwaha</italic> by the state of Jaisalmer. Thahru Shah also got many religious Jain manuscripts transcribed at his own cost, between <sc>AD</sc>1602 and 1627. At the end of these manuscripts are the words ‘<italic>Thahru Shahe sanshodhitam</italic>’ (that is, edited by Thahru Shah). Epigraphic records have frequent references to Jain pontiffs from other regions visiting Jain localities in Rajasthan for the purpose of <italic>chaturmās</italic> and attending, or presiding over, religious functions. ‘Preceptors like Sundar Dev Sūri, Gunvir, Hīravijay Sūri and Jinachandra from Viramgam, Anhilwada, Cambay and Multan respectively visited place after place and organized religious ceremonies in Jain temples.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn66-0257643013477249">66</xref></sup></p>
<p>A narrative of sixteenth century <sc>AD</sc>explicitly brings out the process of religious invocation for a pilgrimage by the Jain pontiff Jinachandra Sūri and the material support given to him by the trader brothers Somji and Sivaji.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn67-0257643013477249">67</xref></sup> Jinachandra Sūri mobilized people in Patan, Khambat and Rajnagar through sermons for the Śatruñjaya pilgrimage. Ultimately, on the insistence of community, Somji and Sivaji requested Jinachandra to take out a <italic>sangha yātrā</italic>. <italic>Kumkum patrikās</italic> were sent out to different regions. Thus <italic>sanghas</italic> from Malwa, Bikaner, Sirohi, Surat, Patan, Radhanpur, Khambhat, Jaisalmer and other regions assembled and started the journey in VS 1644/<sc>AD</sc> 1587. As per the narrative, the pontiffs of all the eighty <italic>gacchas</italic> had a harmonious assemblage for this <italic>sangha</italic>. One hundred and twelve <italic>sādhus</italic>, 303 <italic>mahatamas</italic>, 220 <italic>rishis</italic>, twenty-five <italic>acharyas</italic> and <italic>sādhvīs</italic> from the Khartar <italic>gaccha</italic> and other sects patronized this <italic>sangha yātrā</italic>. Sah Ranka Mandad Bhandari and Sah Bhit’s son Vitam were the two eminent personalities accompanying the <italic>sangha</italic>. Two hundred Rajput cavalry men and 232 <italic>bandukchis</italic> (gunmen) were on the front, rear and both sides of the <italic>sangha</italic>. The length of the caravan was claimed to be four <italic>kos</italic> long (12 km). The security was led by Sri Ratanji, elder son of Somji. At Khamidhanai some danger on the journey ahead was foreseen and the <italic>sanghapati</italic> decided to camp at Khamidhanai for two days. The pilgrims from Bikaner and Sirohi, however, decided to move ahead quietly. After just three <italic>kos</italic> they were confronted by the Mughals and Kabulis. The trader warriors of Bikaner fought with spears under the leadership of <italic>sanghvi</italic> Nahta and, it is believed, that the miracle of <italic>Dada Guru</italic> Jinadutt Sūri’s prayer saved the day for them.</p>
<p>After a journey of twenty one days the <italic>sangha</italic> camped at Palitana near Lake Lalit Sarowar. A meeting with the Diwan Raja (a local authority) took place and, through the gift of desired wealth, the pilgrimage to Śatruñjaya was made tax-free for one month. The pilgrimage was accomplished with great success and the <italic>sanghapati</italic> was bestowed with all the blessings. Jinachandra Sūri bestowed Somji with the title of <italic>sanghadhipati</italic>. <italic>Mir’at-i Ahmadi</italic> also mentions that a <italic>shrāvak baniya</italic> named Somji built the temple of Śatruñjaya, spending seventeen lakh rupees.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn68-0257643013477249">68</xref></sup> During the course of final worship, the ruler of Junagarh, Ami Khan, surrounded Palitana with a big army but ultimately this danger was also averted.</p>
<p><italic>Khartar</italic> muni Samay Sundar in his <italic>Kālpālātā</italic> has referred to <italic>sangha yātrās</italic> taken out by the brothers Somji and Sivaji to Ranakpur, Girnar, Abu, Gaudia Parshvanath and Śatruñjaya. On the return journey they gifted <italic>lāhad</italic> (token gift of thanksgiving) of two <italic>rukna</italic>s (coins) each to the members of their own <italic>gaccha</italic>. The leadership of the brothers in the Dassa Porwad caste of Ahmedabad was well established. They initiated many new traditions in the community. The wedding invitations of the community used to cite: ‘<italic>Sivaji Somji ki riti pramane</italic>’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn69-0257643013477249">69</xref></sup></p>
<p>The text <italic>Sah Rajsi Raas</italic> describes a Jain congregation taken out by a layman of the Añchal <italic>gaccha</italic> sect. Belonging to Nawanagar, a princely state located in Kathiawar, was one Rajsi, a wealthy Oswal Jain. He performed many social acts. He decided to lead a Jain congregation to Śatruñjaya and spent a lot of money on the pilgrimage. He arranged for the proper maintenance of the holy place. In whichever village or town he camped, he gifted money and two seers of jaggery. After returning home he distributed <italic>lāhad</italic> among the followers of the Añchal <italic>gaccha</italic>, an act that seems to have been another way to aquire legitimacy as community leader. This modus operandi was quite similar to the thanksgiving by Karamchandra Bachhawat of Bikaner. The narrative flashback discusses the visit of the Añchal <italic>gaccha acharya</italic> Shri Dharammurti Sūri to Nawanagar in VS 1660/<sc>AD</sc> 1603. He was highly regarded even by the Jam (ruler) of Nawanagar. On Sūri’s inspiration Rajsi led the above-mentioned congregation, which resulted in his elevation to the position of <italic>sanghapati</italic> and, ultimately, to the establishment of a <italic>jinālaya</italic> with the permission of the Jam. This Jain temple was consecrated in VS 1675/<sc>AD</sc> 1618 under the auspices of the Añchal <italic>gaccha</italic> pontiff Shri Kalyansagar Sūri, who it was claimed was close to Emperor Jahangir. On this occasion, again, <italic>lāhad</italic> was distributed in the form of platters full of jaggery and money. The <italic>mahajans</italic> of eighty eight clans were invited on the occasion. Rajsi also took out another congregation to Gaudia Parshvanath in <sc>AD</sc>1615.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn70-0257643013477249">70</xref></sup></p>
<p>The narrative of Banārsidas is quite similar to the above-mentioned account. Pilgrimages were frequent features of a Jain’s life in the Mughal period. Kharagsen accompanied a large group of Jains under the leadership of Raidhana, who had secured the permission of the sultan of Bengal for the purpose of the journey to the hill of Sammet Shikhar.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn71-0257643013477249">71</xref></sup> After the birth of his second son (that is, Banārsidas), Kharagsen, visited Parshvanath in Sammet Shikhar along with his family and a large group of his kinsmen.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn72-0257643013477249">72</xref></sup> In <sc>AD</sc>1603–04, Hīrānand, a Jain jeweller of Agra, belonging to the Oswal community took out a pilgrimage from Prayag (Allahabad) to Sammet Shikhar. Hīrānand was a representative (<italic>mukim</italic>) of Jahangir. The narrative clearly highlights how Hīrānand used this to his advantage in taking out the <italic>sangha yātrā</italic>. The journey commenced from Agra in <sc>AD</sc>1603 in the month of <italic>Magh</italic> (January–February), Hīrānand sought for permission for the <italic>yātrā</italic> from ‘Prince Salim’, (Jahangir), who was then in Prayag. Though Banārsidas in <italic>Ardhakathānak</italic> narrates that this journey started from Prayag only during the Hindi month of <italic>Chaitra</italic> (March–April), it seems that Hīrānand joined the advance group from Agra at Prayag. From there onwards Hīrānand took over the responsibility for the whole congregation. This was a <italic>sangha yātrā</italic> in which a large body of Jains accompanied him.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn73-0257643013477249">73</xref></sup></p>
<p>The journey of such a large congregation from Agra to Sammet Shikhar would not have been possible without the full support and protection of the authorities. The question arises whether Prayag was chosen as a starting point due to its proximity to the Sammet Shikhar hills as compared to Agra, or if Prince Salim’s stay in Allahabad made matters easier for Hīrānand. Being the client of Prince Salim, Hīrānand might have avoided beginning his <italic>sangha yātrā</italic> from Agra. In fact, Virvijay Muni’s account of the pilgrimage seems to be chronologically more correct then that of Banārsidas as the former’s dates of commencement of the journey corroborate with Prince Salim’s stay in Allahabad. He took permission for the <italic>yātrā</italic> from the Prince. Hīrānand brought with him a large body of troops comprising cavalry, infantry and a sizeable contingent of elephants. He also assumed responsibility for providing food for the entire travelling congregation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn74-0257643013477249">74</xref></sup> Hīrānand’s <italic>sangha</italic> set up camp in the vicinity of Jaunpur and through letters he invited the Jains of the region to join his congregation of pilgrims. Kharagsen, father of Banārsidas, too received the invitation, and to join Hīrānand’s <italic>sangh yātrā</italic> he took along his horse as well. Kharagsen’s decision to take his own mode of transportation, an expensive proposition, clearly indicates that all pilgrims were not dependent on the <italic>sanghapati</italic> for their travel arrangements.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn75-0257643013477249">75</xref></sup></p>
<p>The narrative of the return journey of some pilgrims recounts the exigencies involved in the travel. Many of them succumbed to fatal diseases. Banārsidas’s father Kharagsen himself contracted a severe stomach malady. Certainly, the unhygienic living conditions over a long period were responsible for this. The main contingent set up camp at Jaunpur, from where ultimately the pilgrims dispersed.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn76-0257643013477249">76</xref></sup> The young Banārsidas himself set out on a pilgrimage to the famous Parshvanath shrine at Benaras and successfully returned to Jaunpur after staying in Parshvanath for over ten days. Banārsidas also joined a congregation of Jains under the leadership of Kanwarji Vardhman, a well-known broker, to visit the holy cities of Ahicchatra and Hastinapur. Vardhman was among the prominent Shwetambara Jain merchants of Agra mentioned in the <italic>vigyaptipatra</italic> of <sc>AD</sc>1610.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn77-0257643013477249">77</xref></sup> Banārsidas took his mother and wife for this pilgrimage as well and again a carriage was hired for transport. On the return journey the group camped at Meerut where Banārsidas interacted with his maternal relatives. Thus pilgrimages were also occasions for the pilgrims to renew, where possible, family ties.</p>
<p>The narrative of Banārsidas brings out two aspects of medieval social life. First, the communities were mobile enough to travel frequently and interact with each other, although the raison d’ être could vary from pilgrimage to trade. Second, these short term migratory trends were well protected by the resourceful community leaders. Unlike the congregation of <italic>sanghapati</italic> Somji, the congregations of Hīrānand and Kanwarji Vardhmān were not patronized by any Jain pontiff; thus, the company of religious figures was not always necessary for the touring religious congregations. But the patronage of wealthy community leaders was a common factor in all the <italic>sangha yātrās</italic>. Thus, even for a spiritual and religious experience in the medieval times, the material support of well-off individuals was essential. In a way, wherever the medieval state could not function, the individuals patronized by it could take care of the lower rungs of the hierarchy. The implications were, first, that the state could indirectly control the community with apparent harmonious relations; second, the emergence of community leadership was clearly associated with the performance of community work, leaving no scope for selection and election, and thus avoiding conflict and intervention by the state. Rather, these leaders themselves could work as agencies of communication between the community and the state. These developments further ensured intra-regional and intra-community, as well as inter-regional and inter-community, interaction in a big way. The <italic>sanghapati</italic> in his status of negotiator on behalf of his temporarily mobile community became a leading personality in the eyes of the communities and localities he negotiated with. Such interaction in the course of a pilgrimage would have certainly resulted in the formation of extended and durable community networks and trading nexuses. Given the proximity of the Jain pilgrimage places to the trade routes, one can surmise that <italic>sangha yātrās</italic> also provided opportunities to establish bonds for business purposes between the local communities and travelling <italic>sanghas</italic> belonging to the same religion. Pre-modern modes of transport and roads compulsorily ensured a longer duration of journey for the pilgrim groups, which in turn required the support of and interaction with the communities and localities falling on the way.</p>
<p>One can clearly make out that even the successful <italic>sangha yātrās</italic> had to face hurdles that could have been very well the outcome of the <italic>yātrās</italic> being led by wealthy <italic>sanghapatis</italic>. The above-mentioned narrative refers to the confrontation with the Mughals and the offering of gifts to the local authorities. These exigencies were certainly forced upon the <italic>sanghas</italic> as the extractors were well aware of the great potential to extract wealth from the <italic>sanghapatis</italic>. The pilgrimage and the pilgrimage centres were not just an issue of religious reverence; they could be the platform for sectarian conflicts as well. According to Tod’s narrative, the conflict between the Khartar <italic>gaccha</italic> and the Tapā <italic>gaccha</italic> led to the destruction of many monuments and inscriptions on the <italic>Śatruñjaya</italic> hills. Whenever the Tapā <italic>gaccha</italic> had an upper hand it erased the <italic>Khartar</italic> symbols on the hills, replacing them with their own. Retaliation being a natural outcome, not a single temple or monument on the hill can claim historicity as all of them were built in later times or renovated. In fact, over the centuries, the historicity and sanctity of Śatruñjaya was earned largely due to the relationship between the place and the community, established through pilgrimages sponsored by the Jain pontiffs and the <italic>sanghapatis</italic>. Shantidas Jawahir of Ahmedabad himself used the institution of <italic>mahajan</italic> for his personal as well as community interest. The <italic>vigyaptipatra</italic> to Tapā <italic>gaccha acharya</italic> Vijaysen Sūri inviting him to Agra, carried the names of eighty eight affluent Jains of the city of Agra under the patronage of Emperor Jahangir.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn78-0257643013477249">78</xref></sup> In Bikaner also the Khartar <italic>gaccha</italic> pontiff Jinachandra Sūri was hosted by <italic>mantri</italic> Karamchandra Bachhawat with the consent of Raja Rai Singh.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Temple-building, pilgrimages and religious congregations are just three examples of a multi-layered relationship between the individual, the community (in reality, the affluent of the community) and the state. The Jains in medieval India, instead of being just a ‘given entity’, were recreated and realigned as a ‘community’ on a day-to-day basis. This vibrant community required intra-community relations, religious processions, temple rituals, pilgrimages, scriptures and <italic>chaturmās</italic> by both the monastic order and the laity to establish a notion of unity. The commercial transactions, trading concerns and business partnerships are some more dimensions that bring out the dynamics among the individual, the community and the state, with each having its logical relevance. An ideal Jain householder’s image projected in the Jain narratives also revolved around community relations. The general narratives do not talk about the political developments as such: rather, the attempt is to portray harmony. The materialistic considerations that sustained the identity of the group and that of its religious leaders certainly had an effect on the norms and value systems, rituals and symbolic expressions of authority and control. No doubt the dominant religious moral mechanism controlled and guided the functioning of Jain <italic>sanghas</italic>; yet the local role of the elites in conjunction with the <italic>gacchas, jinālayas</italic> and ‘wandering’ ascetics was significant.</p>
