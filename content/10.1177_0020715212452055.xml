<p>There is much to appreciate in Margaret Somers’s <italic>Genealogies of Citizenship</italic>. As she rightly notes, sociologists have been reluctant to theorize citizenship and rights, seeing normative political theory as the domain of political scientists and philosophers. Yet sociologists have long engaged in empirical studies of rights and citizenship, and many of the substantive topics central to sociological inquiry – from social movement activism to the evolution of the welfare state – is fundamentally about competing claims over who is worthy, who deserves which rights and what the nature of justice and fairness is in societies characterized by multiple inequalities.</p>
<p>Somers thus proposes a new sociology of rights and citizenship, one grounded both in the empirical study of society, but also informed by a desire to theorize ‘the conditions that constrain and/or enable greater degrees of social justice and a democratic culture of human rights’ (p. 50). This is no lab-coat sociology, where the scholar depicts herself as an objective observer neutral toward the subject of study.</p>
<p>Of course, distinctions between objective science and subjective interpretation are artificial in any case, and Somers demonstrates a knife-edged analytical acumen at key points throughout the book. First, she challenges the empirical/normative distinction in citizenship studies by underscoring that the very ‘right to have rights’ rests on judgments about people’s moral worth, and that this in turn reinforces – for those who enjoy rights – legitimacy and standing in society. Drawing on cultural sociology as one tool of explanation, she persuasively argues, ‘Citizenship, however much an empirical institution of governance, is perceived as a <italic>desideratum</italic> and a good, and these normative qualities have causal powers’ (p. 23). Much of the inspiration for Somers’s sociology of rights and citizenship comes from Polanyi, Arendt and Marshall, who she argues have been unrecognized by cultural sociologists. She thus fosters a conversation between political sociologists (and their cousins in political science, legal studies and philosophy) and cultural sociologists and scholars of inequality.</p>
<p>Somers’s also offers a pointed analysis of why, in the contemporary period, this right to have rights is under assault. Since being a rights-bearing individual brings with it moral dignity and recognition, citizenship rights must be construed as a public good centered on social inclusion. Such robust citizenship is best achieved when three spheres of social life balance against each other, namely the relative power of the state, the market and civil society. Today, according to Somers, market fundamentalism puts citizenship in peril. The push to marketize social relations and impose market-driven valuations of worth produce a conversion ‘of a socially inclusionary citizenship to one of contractual morality’ (p. 37). Those who do not fulfill the contractual quid pro quo obligation of market exchange – that is, doing their productive duties in exchange for rights – are stripped, for all practical purposes, of substantive citizenship.</p>
<p>Somers makes this argument most passionately in her chapter on the destruction of New Orleans by Hurricane Katrina. She focuses on those left behind, the people who did not or could not evacuate out of the city before the hurricane hit. These residents, mostly poorer and largely African American, symbolize for her the people losing the right to have rights in the contemporary neo-liberal era. As she puts it, ‘Unable to fulfill their side of the newly marketized exchange called citizenship, the left-behind of New Orleans, being contractual malfeasants, did not elicit much concern at any level of government because with their social exclusion they were no longer recognized as moral equals’ (p. 72). Reflecting the broader purpose of her book, this is a case of citizenship and human rights where the lack of moral recognition not only puts into question these Americans’ citizenship, but also their very standing as equal human beings.</p>
<p>I am sympathetic to Somers’s project of establishing a sociology of citizenship and rights, and her arguments deconstructing the formerly sharp distinction between the empirical and normative scholarship in this field. In building her case, Somers brings to bear an impressive range of literatures and thinkers, across multiple disciplines and time periods. At the same time, this very breadth produces somewhat disjointed chapters, rendering the overall architecture of her argument difficult to follow. Somers places great faith in civil society as the balance against the state and market in order to ensure a socially inclusive citizenship. At the same time, she sharply criticizes the recent articulation, by scholars and political decision-makers, of civil society as reducible to social capital. As she vigorously argues, social capital reduces ‘social’ relations to individual network interactions directed at smoothing transaction costs; such social capital ultimately helps the market and stands in for the hollowing-out of the welfare state. Less clear, however, is Somers’s alternative: what, exactly, is a robust civil society and how does one promote this sphere so it has the power to stand up to the state and market? Somers makes a brief reference to Poland’s Solidarity movement of the 1980s, but throughout the book one is left wondering what generates a robust civil society, especially if the individualizing force of market fundamentalism is so strong.</p>
<p>Somers also fails to push the logic of her argument far enough to provide a clear answer to the question of how individuals come to be seen as socially recognized moral beings worthy of citizenship rights. Solidarity and social cohesion are leitmotivs throughout the book, but what delineates the circle of inclusion? The broadest reading of Somers’s argument would be that all human beings should enjoy citizenship rights. But the importance of the state in her account clearly requires some attention to how nation-states delineate rights and enforce them for people who they deem to be members. Put another way, what rights should foreign migrants receive under this approach? Should rights and the moral worth that comes from them be different for those born in a country compared to those who enter it later? What about distinctions between people who arrive with the state’s approval and those who migrate without permission?</p>
<p>Somers very briefly touches on the large scholarship centered on migrants’ rights and (post)national citizenship, but she largely puts this work to the side. As she states explicitly, she focuses on the borders of exclusion that are internal to nation-states. It is entirely understandable that she imposes such a constraint – her book is already far-ranging – but at a minimum, a more extended discussion of internal versus external borders would have helped specify the processes by which people are deemed morally worthy of rights.</p>
<p>In this context, undocumented migration might well raise further concerns for those worried about market fundamentalism. Residents without legal standing have a hard time bringing state power to bear on rights given their status. Civic mobilization is a possibility – as seen in the millions of people who took to the streets in 2006 for immigrant rights in the United States – but it is a dangerous route for those who can be deported with no recourse, especially given the sharp increase in deportations since 2006. Furthermore, while some civil society organizations of native-born residents might make common cause with immigrants, many others do not. Perhaps as a result, the dominant frames for justice and migrant rights in the United States frequently appeal to the market: activists advocate rights and inclusion into the citizenry because migrants ‘do the jobs Americans won’t’. In this case, then, migrants’ superior moral worth – and the basis on which they should gain rights – rests precisely on the contractual quid pro quo that Somers decries.</p>
