<abstract>
<p><italic>Aims</italic>: To (a) describe the prevalence, trend, and amount of hypnotic drug use, (b) determine the prevalence of chronic diseases among hypnotic drug users, and (c) determine levels of recurrent hypnotic drug use (2007–2011), among 0–17 year old Norwegians. <italic>Methods</italic>: Data were obtained from the nationwide Norwegian Prescription Database (NorPD) in the period 2004–2011. <italic>Results</italic>: Hypnotic drug use in 0–17 year olds increased during the period, from 8.9 to 12.3 per 1000, mainly owing to doubling of melatonin use. Hypnotic drug use peaked at 15 per 1000 among those aged 1–2 years. Melatonin use increased steadily from 6 to 12 years of age, most pronounced in males. Among females, hypnotic drug use increased threefold from 13 to17 years of age. Melatonin was dispensed in the highest annual amount of all hypnotic drugs; accounting up to a median of 360 defined daily doses in 9–13 year old boys. A total of 62% and 52% of all male and female hypnotic drug users were co-medicated with reimbursable drugs for chronic diseases. Levels of recurrent use (2007–2011) were 12% in boys and 8% in girls, of whom 76–77% were co-medicated with drugs reimbursed for chronic diseases. <bold><italic>Conclusions</italic>: There is a trend of increasing use of hypnotic drugs among 0–17 year olds, mainly owing to increasing use of melatonin, used in high amounts. Still, melatonin is not recommended in Norway for use in this age group because of insufficient data on safety and efficacy. A threefold increase in hypnotic drugs among females from 13 to 17 years of age warrants attention.</bold></p>

<title>Background</title>
<p>Difficulties initiating and maintaining sleep is a widespread problem and affects around 15%–25% of the paediatric and adolescent population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1403494812464446">1</xref>]. Thus, topics related to the management of sleep difficulties in this population have aroused increased interest in the last few years.</p>
<p>There are variations in overall psychotropic drug use between countries. Psychotropic drugs are prescribed to children and adolescents in the US at three times the rate of some European countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1403494812464446">2</xref>]. Although the prescription rates of most psychotropic drugs, such as antidepressants, antipsychotics, and stimulants were higher in the US, there were higher prevalences of hypnotic drug use in European countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1403494812464446">2</xref>]. Most drug use studies in Europe and the US have focused on antidepressants, stimulants, and antipsychotics. There is less detailed information in the literature on the use of hypnotics among children and adolescents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1403494812464446">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1403494812464446"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1403494812464446">4</xref>].</p>
<p>The few studies published on hypnotic drug use in Norway have been cross-sectional, and do not provide any detailed information on hypnotic drug use patterns by age or by specific substances [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1403494812464446">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1403494812464446"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1403494812464446">7</xref>]. One study called for attention to the observed increase in hypnotic drug use, and melatonin in particular, among 15–16 year old Norwegians in the period 2006–2010 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1403494812464446">8</xref>]. The nationwide Norwegian Prescription Database (NorPD) has complete data on dispensed prescribed drugs to individuals in ambulatory care, which makes it possible to do studies on patterns of drug use over time in children and adolescents in Norway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1403494812464446">9</xref>].</p>
<p>The aims of this study were to explore the following in the entire Norwegian population aged 0–17 years.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section3-1403494812464446">
<title>Study population</title>
<p>Our study sample constituted all Norwegian inhabitants aged 0–17 years (1.1 million) during the years in question, registered with a valid personal identity number in the NorPD.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1403494812464446">
<title>Data source – NorPD</title>
<p>Data on dispensed prescribed hypnotic drugs in 2004–2011 were drawn from the NorPD, which covers the entire nation (4.9 million inhabitants) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1403494812464446">9</xref>]. From January 2004, all Norwegian pharmacies have been required to send data electronically to the Norwegian Institute of Public Health on all prescribed drugs (irrespective of public reimbursement or not) dispensed to individuals in ambulatory care. The drugs are classified according to the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification system. The data collected for our study were patients’ unique identity number (encrypted), sex, age, the date of dispensing, and drug information (ATC-code, defined daily doses (DDDs), and recorded diagnosis codes (ICD/ICPC) for drugs reimbursed for chronic diseases).</p>
<p>Information was retrieved for the period 2004–2011 on the use of all drugs classified as hypnotics and sedatives (ATC-group N05C in the ATC classification system). Substances registered as hypnotics in Norway in the study period were: benzodiazepines (nitrazepam, flunitrazepam, midazolam), benzodiazepine related drugs (zopiclone, zolpidem, also called z-hypnotics), melatonin, barbital, clometiazole, and scopolamine. Barbital, clometiazole, and scopolamine were not dispensed to any 0–17 year olds during the study period, and were therefore omitted from the results.</p>
<p>Systemic antihistamines, ATC-code R06AD (phenotiazines), which have long been used for childhood insomnia in Norway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1403494812464446">6</xref>], were also included. All these drug subgroups will be referred to as ‘hypnotic drugs’.</p>

<title>Analyses and statistics</title>
<sec id="section6-1403494812464446">
<title>Prevalence, trends, and amount of hypnotic drug use</title>
<p>Period (1 year) prevalence of use of hypnotic drug, overall, and in hypnotic drug subgroups, was estimated by identifying individuals &lt;18 years who had at least one prescription dispensed during each year; 2004–2011, per 1000 inhabitants. The denominator is based on the total number of inhabitants 0–17 years in Norway per 1st of January for the actual year, as registered by Statistics Norway.</p>
<p>In 2011 more detailed 1-year prevalences of hypnotic drug use were calculated according to age and gender. Further, the annual amount of hypnotic drugs dispensed in 2011, measured as DDDs, were presented as mean and medians with interquartile ranges, according to age and gender.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1403494812464446">
<title>Proportions of individuals with chronic diseases among hypnotic drug users</title>
<p>Prescriptions for hypnotic drugs are not reimbursed, thus information on indication for use of hypnotic drugs is not available in NorPD. However, to study the prevalence of chronic diseases among hypnotic drug users in 2011, information on reimbursed co-medication, with belonging ICPC/ICD codes, was retrieved from NorPD. Distribution of reimbursed co-medication for chronic diseases among hypnotic drug users in 2011 was calculated and presented as proportions. Individuals were registered as co-medication users for chronic diseases if they filled at least two reimbursed prescriptions for co-medication.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1403494812464446">
<title>Level of recurrent hypnotic drug use in the period 2007–2011 among incident users in 2007</title>
<p>Incident hypnotic drug users in 2007 was defined as individuals filling a prescription in 2007 without any recorded prescription of any hypnotic substance during the 730 days (2 years) prior to that prescription. Among incident hypnotic drug users in 2007, the proportion of recurrent users throughout the period 2007–2011 was calculated and presented as proportions with 95% confidence interval (CI), according to age and gender. Recurrent use was measured in subsequent 1-year intervals (365 days), starting from each incident patient’s first prescription in 2007. Recurrent use was defined as a hypnotic drug dispensed at least once during each of the following four 365 days periods (at least one prescription the 1st, 2nd, 3<sup>rd</sup>, and 4th year). All analyses were done using SPSS 19.0 for Windows.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<sec id="section11-1403494812464446">
<title>Overall trends of hypnotic drug use during 2004–2011</title>
<p>Overall, the prevalence of hypnotic drug use increased during the period, from 8.9 to 12.3 per 1000 inhabitants, and this was attributed to the use of melatonin more than three-doubling (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1403494812464446">Table I</xref>). In 2011 melatonin accounted 55% of all hypnotic drug users. Use of antihistamines (phenothiazines) declined by 20% over the period. Use of benzodiazepines increased, but use of both benzodiazepines and z-hypnotics was low throughout the period.</p>

<title>Pattern of hypnotic drug use in 2011 by age, gender, and hypnotic drug subgroups</title>
<p>Overall use of hypnotic drugs showed a peak among 1–2 year olds, with a higher level of use in males, 14–15 per 1000 males compared with 10–11 per 1000 females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1403494812464446">Figure 1</xref>). Phenotiazines, of which alimemazine constituted 98%, was dispensed almost exclusively to this age group. Thereafter, hypnotic drug use decreased threefold, reaching a low of about 5–7 users per 1000 in 5–6 year old males and females. Use of antihistamines decreased correspondingly and remained low in older children.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1403494812464446-fig1.tif"/></fig>
<p>During the ages of primary school (6–12 years of age) hypnotic drug use increased steadily, but was much more prominent in males. At 12 years of age, 20 per 1000 of all males were dispensed a hypnotic drug compared with 10 per 1000 of all females. Melatonin was the hypnotic drug of choice throughout this age-interval. During the age of secondary school and onwards (13–17 years of age), the level of hypnotic drug use stabilized in males. In females, however, a steep increase in use was observed from 13 years of age; constituting an almost threefold increase from 13 to 17 years of age (9.0–25.5 per 1000). Except for benzodiazepines, use of all subgroups of hypnotics increased throughout this age interval for both genders.</p>

<sec id="section13-1403494812464446">
<title>Annual amount of hypnotic drugs dispensed among hypnotic drug users in 2011</title>
<p>Among the hypnotic drugs, melatonin (ATC-code N05CH) was prescribed in highest annual amounts in both boys and girls (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1403494812464446">Table II</xref>). Whereas the median annual amount dispensed of melatonin accounted up to 360 DDDs in 9–13 year old boys, the median annual amount dispensed for all other hypnotic drugs did not exceed 50 DDD in neither gender nor age groups. Thus, half of the 9–13 years old male melatonin users in 2011, were dispensed an amount of melatonin corresponding to a DDD per day or more during that year.</p>

<p>Of all individuals who were dispensed a hypnotic drug at least once during 2011, 62% of all males and 50% of all females were also co-medicated with reimbursed drugs for some kind of chronic disease (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1403494812464446">Table III</xref>). Nearly all patients receiving benzodiazepines (boys 94%, girls 94.2%), and a majority of patients receiving melatonin (boys 72.6%, girls 59.9%), were co-medicated with reimbursed drugs. With respect to z-hypnotics this was true for only about half of the patients (boys 51.6%, girls 48.4%), while the proportion was lowest for patients receiving phenothiazine derivatives (boys 43.0%, girls 35.4%). About a third of all male hypnotic drug users were dispensed a drug for attention deficit/hyperactivity, compared with 16% of all female users. Drugs for the chronic conditions, such as asthma and epilepsy, were dispensed to 8–11% of both male and female hypnotic drug users.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<sec id="section17-1403494812464446">
<title>Overall trends in hypnotic drug use in individuals &gt;18 years</title>
<p>This nationwide study showed a relative increase of hypnotic drug use above 30% from 2004 to 2011 in the entire population aged 0–17 years old in Norway, which was mainly attributed to the use of melatonin. The phenotiazine alimemazine was the dominating hypnotic dispensed to children below seven years of age, with a peak around 1–2 years, while melatonin was the most dispensed drug to older children. In the ages of primary school, boys used considerably more hypnotics than girls, but a steep increase in use among girls from 13 years and onwards resulted in girls using more hypnotics than boys at the age of 17.</p>
<p>Studies in both Canada and several European countries also show an increase in the use of hypnotic drugs over time, which corresponds well with our findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1403494812464446">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1403494812464446">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1403494812464446">11</xref>]. The time trend may on the one hand be explained by an increase in sleep-onset problems among children and adolescents, as documented among 11–15 year old Norwegian adolescents during the last two decades [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1403494812464446">12</xref>]. On the other hand, our observations may reflect a lowered threshold of starting hypnotic drug therapy, with hypnotics assumed to be less problematic, such as melatonin, available on the market. Thus, as observed in a Danish longitudinal study; although use of drugs for sleep problems increased over time, the proportion of adolescents who reported nervousness and difficulties in falling asleep did not change much in this period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1403494812464446">11</xref>].</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-1403494812464446">
<title>Presence of chronic diseases among hypnotic drug users</title>
<p>Unfortunately our data could not reveal information on indications for the use of the hypnotic drugs. However, in our study, above 60% of all the male and half of all the female hypnotic drug users received other drugs reimbursed owing to a chronic disease, most commonly for attention deficit/hyperactivity. Further, three out of four of all recurrent users were dispensed reimbursable co-medication for chronic diseases. Our observation may reflect findings from a recently published study, which showed that chronic and transient sleep problems are significantly more common in children with a chronic illness compared with healthy children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1403494812464446">13</xref>]. On the other hand, it is interesting to observe that 40% of all male and half of all female hypnotic drug users did not retrieve additional drugs indicative of other concomitant chronic diseases. Thus, about half of all users are otherwise ‘healthy’, except for sleeping or other problems considered severe enough to require prescription drugs. This was even more pronounced for children that received alimemazine (boys 57% and girls 65%). It is questionable if medical treatment of these otherwise healthy young children is the right choice of treatment, especially when specific behavioural interventions have shown both short term efficacy and possible longer term effects for dealing with settling problems and night waking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1403494812464446">14</xref>].</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-1403494812464446">
<title>Increasing use of melatonin – different patterns of use by age among boys and girls</title>
<p>The most striking observation was the increase in use of the hormone melatonin. Whereas a quarter of all hypnotic drug users were dispensed melatonin in 2004, above half of all users were dispensed melatonin in 2011. Further, the annual amount of melatonin dispensed indicates that the use is more than sporadic. Half of all male melatonin users aged 9–13 years in 2011 were dispensed melatonin corresponding to a DDD every day or more throughout the year, and up to 2 DDDs or more per day in every fourth user. Obviously, melatonin has acquired a major role in the treatment of paediatric sleep disorders in Norway, at least from the ages of primary school (6 years) and through the teens, where melatonin was the hypnotic drug of choice.</p>
<p>The increase in use of melatonin from 6 years of age was marked in boys in particular. Parallel, sleep problems in children with ADHD are common, and even more prevalent in ADHD children receiving long-term stimulant medication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1403494812464446">15</xref>]. The stimulants are not approved for use in children under 6 years of age (pre-school children), and use below this age is very limited in Norway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1403494812464446">16</xref>]. In 2008, about 1.3% of all children below 18 years of age were treated with a stimulant in Norway, of whom three out of four were males [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1403494812464446">16</xref>]. In boys ADHD treatment prevalence increased until the age of 11–15 years and decline thereafter, while the increase in girls was much less pronounced until the same age and then levelled off and fell only after 16–20 years of age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1403494812464446">17</xref>]. Thus parallel age trends in the use of melatonin and stimulants, particularly in boys, may reflect the use of melatonin to overcome sleep problems in stimulant treated ADHD children. In girls the steep increase in use of melatonin from the age of 13 years, however, is not easily explained by ADHD treatment, but corresponds to an increase in use of several psychotropic drugs in this age group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1403494812464446">9</xref>]. Many studies so far suggest that melatonin may be safe and effective for managing some primary and secondary sleep disorders in children and adolescents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1403494812464446">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1403494812464446">19</xref>]. In the EU and Norway, however, melatonin (Circadin™) is indicated as monotherapy for the short-term treatment of primary insomnia characterized by poor quality of sleep in patients who are aged 55 and older [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1403494812464446">20</xref>]. Melatonin is not recommended for use in children and adolescents below age 18 because of insufficient data on safety and efficacy. Some researchers have called for caution when using melatonin for preventive and therapeutic purposes, because of the complex effect of the hormone on sleep regulation and the circadian system, in addition to visual, reproductive, and other effects not yet thoroughly explored [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1403494812464446">21</xref>]. In this context, extensive use of melatonin during puberty may call for attention.</p>

<sec id="section20-1403494812464446">
<title>Use of alimemazine in young children – rationale for use</title>
<p>The second most common hypnotic drug in 2011 was alimemazine. Although there has been a decrease in use of this drug over time, alimemazine was dispensed to almost half of all 0–17 year old hypnotic drug users in 2011. The use of alimemazine was responsible for the observed peek in hypnotic use observed in very young children. Unfortunately, we do not have information on whether alimemazine was prescribed as a hypnotic drug, or for other possible indications, such as allergy or itch. However, irrespective of the indication for use, the peak in use among 1–2 year old needs to be debated for several reasons. Pharmaceutical companies discourage use of alimemazine to children less than two years old because of indications of heavy hang-over as a commonly reported side effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1403494812464446">22</xref>], and a few reports of fatale adverse reactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1403494812464446">23</xref>]. Further, randomized controlled trials exploring the hypnotic effect of alimemazine in children have showed that the effect was at best small, transient, and associated with a ‘rebound’ phenomena on withdrawal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1403494812464446">24</xref>]. In Norway, a study concluded that the documented effects and safety for its use as a hypnotic drug were too inadequate to support use among children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1403494812464446">6</xref>]. Still, however, medical students are taught and textbooks recommend that alimemazine may be used for children with sleep problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1403494812464446">25</xref>].</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section21-1403494812464446">
<title>Market increase in hypnotic drug use among girls from 13 to 17 years of age</title>
<p>An interesting observation was the threefold increase in use of hypnotic drugs among females from 13 to 17 years of age. Except for the benzodiazepines, the use of all other hypnotic subgroups (phenotiazines, melatonin and z-hypnotics) increased for females in the period 2004–2011. Medicine use among young people in general is documented to be widespread and increasing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1403494812464446">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1403494812464446">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1403494812464446">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1403494812464446">26</xref>]. This is especially true for young females, in whom use of drugs for a variety of complaints grows considerably during the teenage years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1403494812464446">27</xref>]. So far, this phenomenon seems to be a neglected area of research. However, one qualitative study exploring the use of analgesics revealed that young women relied on analgesics to cope with perceived pressures and social anxieties, as part of their attempt to meet everyday goals involving performance and participation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1403494812464446">28</xref>]. In trying to understand the kind of problems and challenges facing our modern teenagers and their increasing demand for drugs, we must not forget the impact of significant biological processes that are going on at the same time. During adolescent maturation there is a shift in the circadian sleep pattern from a more advanced sleep–wake rhythm towards a more delayed sleep phase, indicating a preference for later bed and rising times [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1403494812464446">29</xref>].</p>
<p>This shift develops earlier in females than males, and may be a contributing factor to the marked increase in hypnotic drugs observed in girls from the age of 13 years.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section22-1403494812464446">
<title>Strengths and limitations</title>
<p>A strength of this study is the use of a complete national prescription register, which eliminates recall errors and under-reporting in the respondents. However, compliance is always an issue when using prescription data in studies of drug use. We do not have information on the extent to which dispensed drugs were actually taken.</p>
<p>Use of prescription drugs obtained from relatives or peers, are not recorded in this study. Thus, the real number of 0–17 year olds who use hypnotic drugs, sporadically or more long term, may be even higher than our study has shown.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section23-1403494812464446">
<title>The need of evidence-based guidelines of hypnotic drug use in 0–17 year olds</title>
<p>Given the evidence of early consolidation and tracking of health-related behaviour into adulthood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1403494812464446">30</xref>], exploring the increasing use of hypnotic and other drugs during adolescence is an important challenge to our society. More research is needed in paediatric pharmacology on indications, effects, and potential side effects of long term use of melatonin and other hypnotic drugs. More focus is also needed on current prescribing practice and indications for hypnotic drug treatment for sleep-related problems in children and adolescents.</p>
<p>Guidelines on prescription of hypnotic drugs in this age group are not yet available in Norway. Thus, hopefully our observations will constitute useful background information to the discussion and presumably development of guidelines of appropriate use of hypnotics in younger people.</p>
</sec></sec>
<sec id="section24-1403494812464446" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>There is a trend of increasing hypnotic drug use in children and adolescents in Norway. The overall increase is mainly attributed to increasing use of melatonin, which seems to have taken on a major role in the treatment of paediatric sleep disorders in Norway. Although overall use of systemic antihistamine for childhood insomnia now seems to be in decline, it still constitutes the hypnotic drug of choice for 1–2 year old children. A threefold increase in hypnotic drug use among females from 13 to 17 years of age warrants further attention from a public health point of view.</p>
