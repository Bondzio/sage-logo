Post-structuralist political thinkers have pushed Gramsci’s insights to what they see as their logical conclusions. This is most clearly evidenced in the post-Marxist project of Ernesto Laclau and Chantal Mouffe. In their <italic>Hegemony and Socialist Strategy </italic>(hereafter <italic>HSS</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0191453712473080">2001</xref>[1985]), they retold the story of Marxist theory as one of an ever-expanding role for contingency. The crucial figure was Gramsci: Laclau and Mouffe ‘completed’ his project by arguing for the impossibility of any social necessity (reductionism), or of social closure (society itself). There are no pre-determined political identities or interests: politics consists in the ongoing attempt to construct identities and mobilize them around discursive tropes. These are themselves an artificial and unstable attempt to foreclose the social. Politics, defined in this way, is the practice of <italic>hegemony.</italic></p><p>Laclau and Mouffe have each subsequently developed a research programme still framed by <italic>HSS</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0191453712473080">Wenman, 2003b</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0191453712473080">Laclau (1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0191453712473080">2005</xref>) has continued to grapple with the question of hegemony, focusing on the relationship between the universal and particular, the contemporary meaning of emancipation and the politics of populism. But the subject of this article is Chantal Mouffe’s programme for what is broadly labelled radical democracy, developed over a series of publications and which has attracted a considerable following (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0191453712473080">Smith, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0191453712473080">Wenman, 2003b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0191453712473080">Tønder and Thomassen, 2005</xref>). Much of the critical commentary on Mouffe’s work – important contributions to which have appeared in this journal – has challenged her ontology of the political as being inevitably antagonistic and/or has sought to defend the deliberative tradition which Mouffe rejects (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0191453712473080">Erman, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0191453712473080">Thaler, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0191453712473080">Trainor, 2008</xref>). However, this article turns the focus to the lack of an adequate account of <italic>the social</italic> in Mouffe’s work: such an account is necessary for Mouffe’s radical democracy to be effective on its own terms, that is, as a left political project. In particular, Mouffe’s relationship to Gramsci is integral to addressing this deficit. It was by seeking to go ‘beyond’ Gramsci that Mouffe took post-Marxism onto the terrain of post-structuralism – it is by recovering this Gramscian heritage that post-Marxism can be strengthened, without losing the important critical insights that its engagement with post-structuralism has brought.</p><p>The first part of the article sets the context to Mouffe’s project by briefly summarizing the relationship between Gramsci’s thought, post-Marxism and post-structuralism. The second part identifies the key elements of Mouffe’s radical democracy from across her publications, and its substantial contribution to rethinking democratic politics and left strategy. However, the final part argues that, despite its merits, radical democracy is simultaneously hampered by the post-structuralist assumptions that also provide its critical edge. It is shown how Mouffe’s project would be more theoretically and politically effective if it were to recover key elements of its Gramscian heritage. Throughout, I readily accept that Gramsci’s writings are fragmented, highly contested and subject to what Alastair <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0191453712473080">Davidson (2008</xref>) has identified as numerous ‘uses and abuses’. My own deployment of Gramsci draws on his original writings and – as importantly – the way these have been taken up and inflected in the work of subsequent Gramscian theorists, most notably Stuart Hall. Through this reading, I argue that in contrast to privileging discourses in an entirely open and contingent political field, Gramscian theory offers a more realist – but non-determinist – account of the structural, enabling and constraining properties of <italic>ideologies</italic> as framing democratic subjectivities. It also allows a distinctive institutional space for <italic>society</italic>, where political identities are articulated and power relations challenged. But a conception of society also points to the institutional <italic>limits </italic>to politics, including those posed by obdurate capitalist relations: these are underplayed in post-structuralism and Mouffe’s radical democracy.</p><sec id="section1-0191453712473080"><title>I Gramsci and post-Marxism</title><p>To situate Mouffe’s project, we need to understand how it grew out of the post-Marxism she developed at first with Laclau, and in particular the central role of Gramsci in this enterprise. In <italic>HSS</italic>, Laclau and Mouffe renarrated the story of Marxism in terms of increasing contingency. The more Marxism abandoned epiphenomenalism (viewing politics as secondary to the economic infrastructure) and economic reductionism (seeing political activity as determined by given class relations), the more advanced it became. It was Gramsci’s fragmented writings which heralded a more open-ended Marxism, foregrounding the autonomy of politics. However, Laclau and Mouffe developed an immanent critique of Gramsci’s own residual essentialism – for example, his insistence on ‘fundamental classes’ derived from the mode of production – as a springboard for a fully post-Marxist project. In their own words, they sought to ‘recover the basic concepts of Gramscian analysis, although it will be necessary to radicalize them in a direction which takes us beyond Gramsci’ (<italic>HSS</italic>: 136).</p><p>Gramsci’s achievement – with his account of ‘historic blocs’ – was to develop a more expansive version of hegemony than that found in classical Marxism (<italic>HSS</italic>: 42). He replaced Lenin’s avant-gardist leadership over pre-determined interests with ‘moral and intellectual leadership’, which <italic>constructs</italic> social and political identities and interests. Gramsci also pointed to the <italic>materiality </italic>of ideologies, which are the basis of intellectual and moral leadership:</p><disp-quote><p>Ideology is not identified with a ‘system of ideas’ or with the ‘false consciousness’ of social agents; it is instead an organic and relational whole, embedded in institutions and apparatuses, which welds together a historical bloc around a number of basic articulatory principles. (<italic>HSS</italic>: 67)</p></disp-quote><p>Ideological practices cement historic blocs which are not objectively given classes, but active, ‘collective wills’ with no <italic>necessary </italic>class belonging. Gramsci thus breaks from economic and class reductionism, emphasizing the role of ideological articulation in constructing social and political identities. In sum, for Laclau and Mouffe, ‘[Gramsci] defines a new series of relations among groups which baffles their structural location within … economism. At the same time, ideology is signalled as the precise terrain on which these relations are constituted’ (<italic>HSS</italic>: 67).</p><p>Having pointed to the significance of Gramsci, Laclau and Mouffe nevertheless see him as ultimately confined by orthodox Marxist assumptions. They lament that Gramsci still insists on a ‘<italic>single</italic> unifying principal’ to articulatory practices, in the form of a ‘fundamental class’ of bourgeoisie or proletariat: politics remains a ‘zero-sum game among classes’ (<italic>HSS</italic>: 69). This residual reductionism limits Gramsci’s concept of ‘war of position’, in which the quest for hegemony in civil society is famously compared to the complex struggle for territory in trench warfare, as opposed to the full-frontal revolutionary assault of a ‘war of movement’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0191453712473080">1971</xref>: 229–39). Laclau and Mouffe note that while the concept of war of position rightly points to the social as permanently contested, Gramsci implies a single political space necessarily divided into two opposing camps (the fundamental classes). They argue that the political space <italic>itself </italic>is a form of hegemonic articulation: it has no necessary basis and could assume multiple different forms. The simply bifurcated political space is one such possible form – which Laclau and Mouffe label as populist – but <italic>democratic </italic>struggles imply a plurality of spaces (<italic>HSS</italic>: 136–8). Of related concern to them is that if political articulation is tied to economic classes, then the economy as such remains beyond politics. For Laclau and Mouffe this is the fatal limitation in Gramsci: they regard demonstrating the political constitution of the economy itself as central to making the full break into post-Marxism (<italic>HSS</italic>: 77–85).</p><p>Jacob Torfing identifies the post-Marxist project as developing through a neo-Gramscian theory of discourse followed by a more fully postmodern phase (1999: 35–54). In the first of these – as we have seen – Laclau and Mouffe abandon Gramsci’s reliance on fundamental classes, and instead present hegemony as the articulation of identities in the context of antagonistic social relations. This process apparently reveals the contingent, discursive nature of structure itself (ibid.: 14). In the postmodern phase, Laclau and Mouffe turn the logic of contingency upon the subject. They replace a lingering conception of subject position with a Lacanian-inspired account of the subject being based on <italic>lack</italic>. In this scenario, the subject continually seeks to ‘complete’ itself in the context of the dislocated social structure. By this point, then, the radical contingency of both ‘structure’ and the ‘subject’ are fully affirmed – along with the absolute primacy of politics in constituting both (ibid.: 14, 55–80).</p><p>Laclau and Mouffe have subsequently developed the more substantive political implications of their work. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0191453712473080">Laclau (1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0191453712473080">2005</xref>) has stayed closer to the Marxist problematic and pursued the question of hegemony, particularly in the context of populism. But what follows is concerned with Mouffe’s elaboration of a model of radical democratic politics. The next section distils the key elements of Mouffe’s understanding of the political in general, and radical democracy in particular. It draws from across her publications, and identifies the considerable theoretical and political strengths of the radical democratic project, prior to a critique and reconstruction through the reintroduction of Gramsci.</p></sec><sec id="section2-0191453712473080"><title>II Mouffe and radical democracy</title><p>The themes of radical democracy were first sketched out at the end of <italic>HSS</italic>, and Mouffe has developed the project across a series of publications. <italic>The Return of the Political </italic>(hereafter <italic>RP</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0191453712473080">2005a</xref>[1993]) brings together articles in which she engages with liberals and communitarians on the nature of liberalism, citizenship and democracy, setting out the agenda for an ‘agonistic pluralism’. This is elaborated more systematically – albeit again in a compilation of essays – in <italic>The Democratic Paradox </italic>(hereafter <italic>DP</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0191453712473080">2000</xref>). Here, Mouffe undertakes a sustained critique of both aggregative and deliberative forms of democratic reasoning. In so doing, she deploys Wittgenstein’s notion of language games and stresses the antagonistic nature of politics through Schmitt’s friend/enemy distinction. Mouffe also turns her fire on the claims of Third Way centrism to have developed a consensual politics without adversary; she regards this as ontologically impossible given the constitutive nature of antagonism. This critique is developed in <italic>On the Political </italic>(hereafter <italic>OP</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0191453712473080">2005b</xref>) and projected onto the international scene. Opposing global cosmopolitan democracy, Mouffe argues for a multipolar world embodying conflict and pluralism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0191453712473080">Thaler, 2010</xref>). But the key theoretical feature of <italic>OP </italic>is Mouffe’s use of Heidegger to distinguish between the ‘ontic’ level of conventional political practices, and the ‘ontological’ level of the political itself:</p><disp-quote><p>… by ‘the political’ I mean the dimension of antagonism which I take to be constitutive of human societies, while by ‘politics’ I mean the set of practices and institutions through which an order is created, organizing human coexistence in the context of conflictuality provided by the political. (<italic>OP</italic>: 9)</p></disp-quote><p>From this body of work, we can identify three main theoretical propositions: that identities are relational; that as such they always hold the potential for antagonism; but that it is nevertheless possible to ‘domesticate’ antagonistic relations in the form of ‘agonistic’ political arrangements – these recognize the right of ‘adversaries’ to exist, rather than seeking to construct and obliterate ‘enemies’. Given these propositions, which are elaborated on below, the work of radical democratic politics is to develop the subjectivities which foster agonism, in particular by foregrounding the affective dimension of political life (‘passions’).</p><p>The starting observation in Mouffe’s theory concerns the relational nature of identities. In one of her earliest essays (1979), Mouffe pointed to potential resonances between Gramsci and Derrida. The Derridean conception of identity as relational and based on a ‘constitutive outside’ is then elaborated at length in <italic>HSS</italic>, and also acknowledged in both <italic>DP</italic> (12–13) and <italic>OP </italic>(15). On this view, following post-structuralism and psychoanalysis, the identity of an object is always constituted in relation to an ‘other’ or outside, part of a discursive exterior which always ‘overflows’ the initial object’s meaning. However, it is also the very presence of the external other which <italic>prevents</italic> the initial object’s identity from ever being fully constituted. Consequently, the ‘constitutive outside’ is the pre-condition of, but also the inevitable obstacle to, the (always precarious) realization of identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0191453712473080">Wenman, 2003a</xref>).</p><p>However, more significant for Mouffe’s political analysis is a second proposition, concerning how relational identities generate the <italic>antagonism </italic>that defines the political. Theoretically, antagonism is a permanent possibility given how objects are always (unsuccessfully) attempting to realize their identity in relation to their ‘constitutive outside’. However, why this relationship is <italic>necessarily</italic> antagonistic is not convincingly demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0191453712473080">Erman, 2009</xref>). As if aware of this, Mouffe offers further explanations for the ontological primacy of antagonism. One derives from the irreducible plurality of values in social life, which Mouffe demonstrates using Wittgenstein on language games (<italic>DP</italic>). The other is a straightforward invocation of a conflict-oriented human nature, which is surprising given Mouffe’s rejection of essentialism. The human nature theme runs from earlier work in <italic>RP</italic> where, in the introduction, Mouffe asks us to ‘acknowledge that the “state of nature” in its Hobbesian dimension can never be completely eradicated but only controlled’ (6), right through to the final page of the more recent <italic>OP</italic> where she notes that ‘It is not in our power to eliminate conflicts and escape our <italic>human condition</italic>’ (130; emphasis added).</p><p>Mouffe explores the democratic implications of the ever present possibility of antagonism by using Carl Schmitt (e.g. <italic>DP</italic>: ch. 2). For Schmitt, the individualist premises of classical liberalism were false, as politics is characterized by acts of <italic>collective </italic>identification, based on a sense of ‘us’ and ‘them’, or friends and enemies. Aspirations towards universal rational consensus are similarly flawed, as the drawing of the friend/enemy distinction necessarily involves acts of <italic>exclusion</italic>. Mouffe notes that:</p><disp-quote><p>We have to take Nietzsche’s idea of the ‘war of the gods’ seriously and accept that, if there is no creation of an ‘us’ without delimiting a ‘them’, this relation may at any time become the site of an antagonism and the other may come to be perceived as an enemy. (<italic>RP</italic>: 127–8)</p></disp-quote><p>Schmitt’s solution was the authoritarian call for a homogeneous <italic>demos </italic>of ‘the people’, in a direct and unmediated relationship to the state. Critics such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0191453712473080">Dyrberg (2009</xref>) argue that Schmitt’s association with totalitarian politics undermines his utility as a resource for democratic thought or leftist politics. However, Mouffe parts company with Schmitt by arguing that the only democratic solution to the friend/enemy problem is to embrace and deepen pluralism in a manner compatible with democratic forms of subjectivity.</p><p>This takes us to Mouffe’s third key proposition, that irreducibly pluralistic and potentially antagonistic relations can nevertheless be managed so as to avoid violence. Mouffe advocates a model of agonistic pluralism in which the various identities would coexist in a struggle for hegemony. However, they would do so as ‘adversaries’ who share a symbolic space and the rules of the game, rather than as ‘enemies’ seeking to destroy one another. In this sense, while antagonism can never be eradicated, it can at least be <italic>domesticated</italic>:</p><disp-quote><p>The novelty of democratic politics is not the overcoming of this us/them opposition – which is an impossibility – but the different way in which it is established. … Envisaged from the point of view of ‘agonistic pluralism’, the aim of democratic politics is to construct the ‘them’ in such a way that it is no longer perceived as an enemy to be destroyed, but as an ‘adversary’, that is, somebody whose ideas we combat but whose right to defend those ideas we do not put into question. (<italic>DP</italic>: 101–2)</p></disp-quote><p>Given these theoretical propositions, Mouffe argues that the function of democratic politics is to foster political identities appropriate to an agonistic polity. In her earlier work (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0191453712473080">Mouffe, 1992</xref>; <italic>RP</italic>: ch. 4), she focused on <italic>citizenship</italic> as the nodal point which might, from among the many sites of identity formation in plural societies, crystallize agonistic sensibilities. Subsequently, Mouffe has stressed how her understanding of citizenship is not static or one-dimensional; multiple subject positions need to be available. This will involve competition between ‘diverse conceptions of citizenship which correspond to the different interpretations of the ethico-political principles’ in a democracy (<italic>DP</italic>: 104). The best guarantor of this is vibrant competition between established political perspectives, such as social democracy and neo-liberalism. Mouffe warns that in the absence of such competition, there is a risk of extremist populisms which seek to exclude or even destroy competing ‘others’ (<italic>OP</italic>: 30, 120). Mouffe emphasizes the positive role of what she refers to as ‘passions’ in mobilizing the democratic subjectivities she calls for. She points to the ‘predominant role of passions as moving forces of human conduct’ (<italic>RP</italic>: 140) and sees them as the ‘various affective forces which are at the origin of collective forms of identifications’ (<italic>OP</italic>: 24). Elaborating on the specifically democratic function of passions, she argues that ‘democratic politics needs to have a real purchase on people’s desires and fantasies and … instead of opposing interests to sentiments, and reason to passions, it should offer forms of identifications conducive to democratic practices’ (ibid.: 28). Indeed, in her critique of the rationalist tradition which eschews the role of emotions in politics, Mouffe goes so far as to say that ‘Politics cannot be reduced to rationality, precisely because it indicates the <italic>limits</italic> of rationality’ (<italic>RP</italic>: 115).</p><p>Finally, while Mouffe says little about the specific institutions and practices which might deliver agonistic politics, it is noteworthy that she does envisage an important role for national parliaments (and, by implication, political parties). Parliaments are the institutional embodiment of antagonistic relations, but also the best means of turning them into agonistic ones which respect the rules of the game. Mouffe cites Niklas Luhmann’s observation that ‘modern democracy calls for a “splitting of the summit”, a clear divide between the government and opposition, and this supposes that clearly differentiated policies are on offer, giving the possibility for citizens to decide between different ways of organising society’ (<italic>OP</italic>: 120). Following Elias Canetti on the nature of the parliamentary system, Mouffe observes how parliaments diffuse the potential for violent confrontation. This is symbolized specifically at the moment of the vote, in which the loser is willing to admit defeat in the context of shared rules, but is nevertheless still able to maintain their ‘rightness’. Thus, we must ‘grasp the important part played by the parliamentary system in the transformation of antagonism into agonism and in the construction of a we/they compatible with democratic pluralism’ (<italic>OP</italic>: 23; see also <italic>RP</italic>: 5, 130).</p><sec id="section3-0191453712473080"><title>The progressive potential of radical democracy</title><p>The outline above shows how Mouffe moves curiously from a radical post-structuralist theoretical account of the nature of power, the political and identity, through to a traditional liberal advocacy of the practical merits of the parliamentary system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0191453712473080">Fossen, 2008</xref>). This move chimes with the original critics of <italic>HSS</italic>, who accused Laclau and Mouffe of abandoning even a loosely defined left project and/or retreating into liberal pluralism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0191453712473080">Geras, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0191453712473080">Hunter, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0191453712473080">Rustin, 1988</xref>). Mouffe continues to insist on radical democracy’s leftist, anti-capitalist character (e.g. <italic>RP</italic>: 10; <italic>DP</italic>: 111–12; <italic>OP</italic>: 50–63), but similar doubts persist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0191453712473080">Grebe, 2009</xref>), and are elaborated in the next section. However, the progressive potential of Mouffe’s work should not be dismissed. Radical democratic thinking resonates with the complexity of late-modern societies, offers a dynamic supplement to liberal pluralism and has reinvigorated the left’s occasionally half-hearted engagement with democratic theory.</p><p>Mouffe’s post-structuralist political ontology has the merit of expanding our sense of what politics is. On Mouffe’s account, all social relations and identities are the outcome of acts of <italic>power</italic>: these are based on the exclusion of a ‘constitutive other’, but this is only ever temporary given that antagonistic identities can never be fully realized. Thus, political contestation is forever; there is no possibility of a closure in which social relations might be frozen, nor of a <italic>telos</italic> in which antagonism might come to an end. This is a radical supplement to liberal democratic theory, in its stress on the permanently contested and unstable nature of both the agent and the wider political order (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0191453712473080">Wenman, 2003a</xref>).</p><p>Mouffe contrasts her agential model of ‘adversaries’ with that of ‘competitors’ in liberal theory (<italic>OP</italic>: 20–1). The latter have a pre-given set of interests and a fully formed identity, and operate alongside other competitors in a neutral political space. But for Mouffe, the agent is the temporary crystallization of a set of power relations, and a continual work in progress. Indeed, this precarious identity will itself become modified through democratic participation. At the macro level, the rules of the political game are ultimately provisional reflections of hegemonic interventions and as such they can always be subverted and/or reconstituted (ibid.: 31–3). This keeps the prospect of alternative political arrangements permanently alive. It also engenders a sense of democracy as something which must constantly be defended and renewed – but never finally achieved (<italic>DP</italic>: 137).</p><p>More substantively, Mouffe emerges as a perhaps unlikely crusader for established liberal democratic institutions. Parliaments are integral to domesticating antagonisms into peaceful, agonistic relations, while preserving the right to disagree. However, Mouffe’s account of political identities implies that such established institutions need to open up to the range of social identities currently marginalized from organized politics. In addition, Mouffe offers an original and provocative account of the democratic function of emotions (passions). This contrasts to the more traditional view that increasing public displays of emotion are bereft of political content and represent the dumbing-down of civic culture. Ultimately for Mouffe, democracy is seen as being progressive in itself, rather than a smokescreen for other forms of domination, or a precursor to a superior set of social and political arrangements:</p><disp-quote><p>The problem with ‘actually existing’ liberal democracies is not their ideals, but the fact that those ideals are not put into practice. So the task for the left is not to reject these ideals, with the old argument that they are a sham or a cover for capitalist domination, but to fight for their implementation. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0191453712473080">Mouffe, 1999</xref>: 20)</p></disp-quote><p>The left should thus fight for democratization across all social domains, such as the workplace or the family. Power relations and acts of inclusion/exclusion may be constitutive of social and political life, but for Mouffe expansive democratization at least gives the marginalized the chance to contest these frontiers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0191453712473080">Fossen, 2008</xref>). More controversially, some radical democrats suggest that their position sustains the more traditional left concern with redistributing power and material resources, in order to facilitate such democratic inclusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0191453712473080">Little, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0191453712473080">Smith, 1998</xref>).</p><p>Notwithstanding these important contributions, the following sections outline radical democracy’s limitations in terms of developing a hegemonic left politics. The critique focuses on the ontological status in Mouffe’s work of political values and, vitally, of society itself. Mouffe’s treatment of both presents problems for developing the democratic subjectivities and transformative left politics she seeks. Crucially, it is argued that it is through a reintegration of aspects of the Gramscian heritage, which, as we have seen, Mouffe sought to transcend, that her work can more credibly be developed as a platform for left politics. Such a move could also be seen as the first step in a wider project of restoring society to post-structuralist politics.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section4-0191453712473080"><title>III The limits of radical democracy, bringing Gramsci back in</title><sec id="section5-0191453712473080"><title>Values and ideology</title><p>If politics is a hegemonic struggle to articulate political identities, then values are clearly a key mobilizing resource. Whether one understands values as being transhistorical, as the reflection of underlying social structures, or as entirely contingent, they are the mechanism through which individuals are won over politically. Although Mouffe eschews foundationalism of any kind, her arguments suggest that she recognizes that at some level agents must be motivated to act at all. For example, at the close of <italic>HSS</italic>, Laclau and Mouffe point to the ongoing need for ‘utopia’, because:</p><disp-quote><p>… without ‘utopia’ … there is no possibility at all of the constitution of a radical imaginary – whether democratic or of any other type. The presence of this imaginary … is absolutely essential for the constitution of all left-wing thought. (<italic>HSS</italic>: 190)</p></disp-quote><p>We have seen that Mouffe has pursued this theme in her account of the role of passions in democratic politics. Indeed, in presenting her own arguments, Mouffe consistently invokes the rallying values of the left in the form of tropes such as liberty, equality and anti-capitalism. However, the broader assumptions of radical democratic theory cast doubt on its capacity to mobilize values. Mouffe stresses that a preference for deconstruction does not entail relativism (e.g. <italic>RP</italic>: ch. 1). Despite this, her post-structuralist insistence on discursive contingency means that ‘values’ can only be a provisional and always unsuccessful attempt to stabilize discourses. But broad values of the sort consistently invoked by Mouffe (liberty, equality) are more enduring than this, both across generations and in the way they are internalized by individuals over the life-course (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0191453712473080">Trainor, 2008</xref>). This is not to essentialize values; how exactly they are interpreted and mobilized will vary depending on the empirical context (discussed as ‘resonance’, below). But the a priori assumption that liberty and equality are empty of substantive content is not a promising basis from which to build enduring political support. From the point of view of the left (itself a problematic term for post-structuralists), it is precisely the malleable treatment of concepts such as ‘equality’ which enabled the rhetorical convolutions of Third Way centrism about which Mouffe is so scathing. Mouffe’s work thus recognizes the political importance of values, but simultaneously undercuts their ontological status.</p><p>A related problem is that although Mouffe speaks of the need for passions and invokes values, her account of values is surprisingly functionalist. For Mouffe, values are politically useful not because of any intrinsic meaning or representation of something substantive, but because they highlight the social condition of antagonism per se. Thus, writing of the ‘integrative role that conflict plays in modern democracy’, Mouffe suggests that:</p><disp-quote><p>A well functioning democracy requires confrontation between democratic political positions. Without this there is always a danger that democratic confrontation will be replaced by confrontation between non-negotiable moral values or essentialist forms of identification. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0191453712473080">2002</xref>:10)</p></disp-quote><p>On this view, the function of values (‘democratic political positions’) is primarily to make various subject positions available, thus providing an outlet for antagonisms and facilitating what we might see as Mouffe’s own meta-value of democratization (<italic>RP</italic>: ch. 9). The <italic>content</italic> of the values at stake seems to be of secondary importance; it is their democratic function which matters. With this treatment of values, Mouffe – contrary to the post-Marxist ethos of expanding the boundaries of politics – offers a surprisingly restricted vision; politics appears in terms of available, rather mainstream, ‘subject positions’. For example, Mouffe tends to cite the familiar schemata of social democracy and neo-liberalism as democratic subject positions par excellence. Although she stresses the need for democracy to provide ‘political forms of collective identification around clearly differentiated democratic positions’ (<italic>OP</italic>: 31), she further narrows this to the need for ‘a clear divide between the government and opposition’ (ibid.: 120). This is in contrast to the much broader vision of the political field in complex, plural societies that Mouffe’s post-structuralist theoretical assumptions imply. Such a narrow, traditional sense of politics is reinforced by Mouffe’s valorization (via Canetti) of the moment of ‘the vote’ in parliament (ibid.: 21–5).</p><p>There are further difficulties attached to Mouffe’s foregrounding of formal political subject positions. Mouffe is clear that she does not want pluralism itself to drift into an essentialism ‘of the elements’ (<italic>RP</italic>: 7). The latter, characteristic of much postmodern theory, presents a political field consisting of an infinite variety of subject positions, potentially undermining coherent, strategic political action. However, Mouffe’s use of overarching positions such as neo-liberalism and social democracy risks the essentialism and voluntarism she wishes to avoid. On the one hand, these traditions are invoked in a reified fashion, rather than as historically contingent and contested articulations. But, at the same time, Mouffe implicitly exaggerates the autonomy of individual citizens to choose between these apparently fully formed yet also contingent political products. The result is an unlikely mix of Althusserian ideology analysis with postmodern, identity politics: the very two things Mouffe has successfully distanced herself from elsewhere.</p><p>The argument here is that Mouffe’s project would benefit from recognizing values as having structural, recursive properties, and that the recovery of a Gramscian (not a rigid Althusserian) sense of ideology would assist in achieving this. It is the stable and enduring nature of ideologies – rather than rare moments of rupture – which calls for the most theoretical attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0191453712473080">Hunter, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0191453712473080">Torfing, 1999</xref>). Gramsci stressed the <italic>material </italic>character of ideologies, in terms of the production of everyday common sense at the level of civil society: indeed, in her earlier work, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0191453712473080">Mouffe (1979</xref>) identified this as his great achievement. Gramsci contrasted this practical, material understanding of ideology with the abstract ‘philosophies’ (e.g. 1971: 201). These are the formalized, public political discourses which Mouffe has since come to see as being essential to democracy (e.g. social democracy, neo-liberalism). Such philosophies are associated with ‘traditional’ intellectuals, rather than the ‘organic’ intellectuals Gramsci identified as bridging ideas and the lived reality of classes (e.g. ibid.: 5–14, 418–19). The effect of prioritizing abstract political positions is, as Richard Johnson argues, to reinforce a mode of theorizing ‘that separated a realm of “philosophy” – here of democratic political discourses – from the combined effects of economic and social pressures on people’s lives’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0191453712473080">2007</xref>: 101).</p><p>A Gramscian approach to ideologies corrects this problem in two key respects. First, where Mouffe’s image of political subjectivity neglects how the agent’s choices over the life-course are framed by material and ideological influences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0191453712473080">Hill, 2008</xref>), Gramsci had a sociologically richer conception of agency. He argued that man [<italic>sic</italic>] ‘cannot be conceived of except as historically determined man – i.e. man who has developed, and who lives, in certain conditions, in a particular social complex or totality of social relations’ (1971: 244). However, while being alert to the weight of past and present power relations upon individual subjectivity, Gramsci certainly did not see agents as imprisoned by them, given that ‘the will and initiative of men [<italic>sic</italic>] themselves cannot be left out of account’ (ibid.: 244). Thus, Gramsci famously described human personality as ‘strangely composite’ in its mix of ‘Stone Age’ received wisdoms as well as intimations of a better future society (ibid.: 324). Gramsci sought to understand not just the historical origins of consciousness, but also the means for changing it, to fight the battle for hearts and minds so that individuals might be <italic>won over </italic>to a new conception of themselves and society. By contrast, as Brennan Wood argues, ‘Discourse theory … implies identities so frail that they can be “won” only fleetingly. Such analyses fail to understand meaning as <italic>enduring</italic> domination; they fail to grasp what makes ideology worth studying in the first place’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0191453712473080">1998</xref>: 409). Seen in this light, Mouffe’s view of political action tends towards being – in the language of political science – preference-accommodating: individuals have their primeval passions, and democratic politics must be sufficiently diverse to reflect them. This underplays the preference-shaping capacity both of social experiences <italic>prior</italic> to political action and, of course, political action itself. Specifying the content of values – projecting an image of the good society (or even utopia) – is integral to this process of preference-shaping, or winning hearts and minds. Mouffe seems reluctant to engage in such advocacy beyond promoting the benefits of radical democracy itself as a master imaginary.</p><p>Second, Mouffe’s claim that a spread of available value positions acts as a cooling valve, ensuring peaceful, agonistic relations, ignores potential <italic>incommensurability</italic> between values. Following Gramsci’s sense of ideologies being grounded in concrete practices and interests, it is clear that certain ideas and practices are not just conceptually in tension or contradictory (e.g. liberty/equality) but empirically so. Furthermore, such positions may necessarily seek to obliterate one another as enemies, in precisely the way Mouffe claims an agonistic, radical democracy would circumvent. To take the two organized value positions that Mouffe repeatedly draws on, the logic of neo-liberalism is to obliterate the regulatory constraints of social democracy which, in its more radical versions, seeks not just to temper or roll back the market but qualitatively to go beyond (and therefore ‘obliterate’) the market form itself. Ironically, the only political position which claims to be able to finally reconcile these tensions is the Third Way, which Mouffe criticizes for precisely this reason (<italic>DP</italic>; <italic>OP</italic>). If we recognize that values are grounded in material practices and interests, it follows that for appeals to values to be politically successful, they need to achieve <italic>resonance </italic>with people’s lived experiences of the social world. However, Mouffe’s post-structuralist refusal of society precludes such resonance. An account of society is necessary for radical democracy to achieve its stated objectives, and we shall see below that Gramsci again provides the resources for such a move.</p></sec><sec id="section6-0191453712473080"><title>Restoring society to post-structuralist politics</title><p>We have in part judged Mouffe against her claim that radical democracy is a left political project. A key assumption of leftist politics has been that society is a verifiable entity, and that consequently political action can intervene in and improve it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0191453712473080">McLennan, 2002</xref>). Despite this, Mouffe’s work oscillates between extremes with regard to the status of an empirical, social referent. Thus, she praises the ‘marxist tradition as having made an important contribution to our understanding of the dynamics of the capitalist system and its consequences over the ensemble of social relations’ (<italic>OP:</italic> 53–4). However, alongside this background assumption of a society framed by the effects of capital accumulation, Mouffe continues to reflect the strong anti-realism of <italic>HSS</italic>: she implies that society as such does not exist, or at least not outside of discourse. In <italic>HSS</italic> we were left in no doubt about this, with its claim that ‘“Society” is not a valid object of discourse’ (111). Even where society is referred to, it is always instantiated by infinite political decision-making. Mouffe continues in this vein in her most recent work, summarizing that:</p><disp-quote><p>Power is constitutive of the social because the social could not exist without the power relations through which it is given shape. What is at a given moment considered as the ‘natural’ order – jointly with the common sense which accompanies it – is the result of sedimented practices; it is never the manifestation of a deeper objectivity exterior to the practices that bring it into being. (<italic>OP</italic>: 18)</p></disp-quote><p>Given this, Mouffe is scornful of sociology, and in particular the political-sociological theories of those such as Ulrich Beck and Anthony Giddens that present ‘supposedly neutral … sociological evidence’ which is the ‘typical post-political gesture’ (<italic>OP</italic>: 55). Certainly, highlighting the role of power and political action in generating social arrangements enables proper consideration of agency, avoiding the view of political actors as cultural dupes. However, the ultimate defining of ‘society’ as simply another imaginary, means that necessary sociological analysis of the institutions and processes which permeate political action is shut down.</p><p>It is precisely this refusal of prior social structures that limits Mouffe’s analysis <italic>on its own terms</italic>. For Mouffe’s account of the construction of democratic subject positions to work, there need to be actually existing social structures and relations for articulatory practices to resonate with. Addressing this deficit again means restoring to Mouffe’s analysis some of the key insights offered by Gramsci. Kate Nash argues that ‘Because post-Marxism cannot develop an adequate analysis of “the social” from within its own terms, it needs political sociology as a supplement’ (2002: 111). In what follows, the theoretical dimensions of such a supplement are developed by restoring a Gramscian reading of the social to Mouffe’s analysis of political subjectivities, without returning to Gramsci’s class reductionism. This involves, first, understanding social structures as being prior to agents, as shaping but not determining action. Second, a notion of society is necessary for political appeals to resonate with enduring, material social relations and experiences. Third, a conception of social structure enables a theorization of <italic>civil society – </italic>so integral to the Gramscian analysis – as the concrete space where hegemonic struggles are fought. Armed with an account of <italic>institutions</italic> – again underplayed in post-structuralism – we can theorize civil society as subject to pressure from ‘above’ in the form of the state, and from ‘below’ in the form of social and economic relations. Such a conception also enables theorization of the effects (but not determinations) of the economic sphere upon political identities.</p><p>Post-Marxism implies an open-ended political space, with apparently infinite possibilities for constructing subjectivities. The first step in restoring society to Mouffe’s analysis is to recognize that social structures exist, and are prior to political action. Against the more voluntarist and idealist readings of Gramsci, Jonathan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0191453712473080">Joseph (2008</xref>) points to his insistence on both the existence of an objective social reality and, vitally, the constraints this imposes upon social and political possibilities. What Gramsci offers is a reading of the structural pre-conditions of politics which rejects vulgar reductionism, while acknowledging that the political is not an entirely contingent and open-ended field. This is best captured by Stuart Hall, who suggests that for Gramsci:</p><disp-quote><p>… one must understand the fundamental structure – the objective relations – within society … for these set the most fundamental limits and conditions for the whole shape of historical development. From here arise some of the major lines of tendency which <italic>might</italic> be favourable to this or that line of development. The error of reductionism is then to translate these tendencies and constraints <italic>immediately</italic> into their absolutely determined political and ideological effects. … In fact, they structure and determine only in the sense that they define the terrain on which historical forces move – they define the horizon of possibilities. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0191453712473080">1996c</xref>: 421–2)</p></disp-quote><p>This approach to structure can be applied to the cultural terrain upon which political subjectivity is formed, and which is critical to Mouffe’s work. Culture consists in the practices, ideas and ways of living which individuals are born into and which shape processes of identity formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0191453712473080">Hill, 2008</xref>). By contrast, in Mouffe’s account, identities are only constructed through political acts on the part of agents. Mouffe and other post-Marxists neglect that it is upon the <italic>social</italic> terrain of culture that subjectivities are constituted prior to their entering the hegemonic game in the political field. Post-Marxism thus lacks a thicker sense of how social and cultural forms of association are a source of identity.</p><p>An example of a corrective approach is found in Michael Burawoy’s use of Gramsci in calling for a ‘sociological Marxism’. Burawoy points to the importance of specific forms of collective life and community <italic>prior</italic> to the emergence of the English working class. This class, he suggests, ‘could not be regarded as a blank slate, defenceless against market forces. It was already embodied in community, which gave it the weapons to defend itself and advance active society in its own name’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0191453712473080">2003</xref>: 222). Interestingly, drawing on Wittgenstein’s account of the thicker, cultural underpinnings of language games, Mouffe acknowledges that ‘It is because they are inscribed in shared forms of life … that procedures can be accepted and followed’ (<italic>DP</italic>: 68). This indicates that identity formation cannot be made sense of without reference to prior traditions and practices. Mouffe herself notes that Gramsci was ‘perhaps the only Marxist to have understood the role of tradition’ (<italic>RP</italic>: 18). However, unlike Mouffe, Gramsci did not see culture and tradition as purely or even predominantly discursive entities, but as complex historical forces with their own materiality and the capacity to shape (but not determine) current political practices. A more sociological understanding of identity formation also throws a different light upon the passions, which Mouffe presents as motivating political action. Gramsci, too, stresses the affective dimensions of politics, but argues that ‘popular feelings’ need to be ‘studied in the way in which they present themselves objectively’ (1971: 419). Thus, the passions themselves are the historically produced, messy and complex outcomes of concrete traditions and practices, not some primeval political force.</p><p>Recognizing that the social is prior to politics has important strategic consequences: political subjectivities need to resonate with actual social forces and lived experiences. This theme is pursued in Hall’s Gramscian work on the method of articulation. He criticizes Laclau and Mouffe’s collapsing of the social into an open discursive field, as this gives rise to the sense that ‘there is no reason why anything is or isn’t potentially articulatable with anything’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0191453712473080">1996b</xref>: 146). By contrast, Hall observes that ‘No ideological conception can ever become materially effective unless and until it <italic>can</italic> be articulated to the field of social and political forces’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0191453712473080">1996a</xref>: 42). On this view, as Joseph more recently explains of Gramsci, ‘Hegemonic projects are most successful when, on the one hand, they are grounded in deeper social processes, while on the other, they are further developed through state strategy’. As such, Joseph continues, ‘Rather than undermining agency [as Mouffe claims], such an approach <italic>gives agency a terrain on which to operate</italic>’ (2008: 128; emphasis added). Thus, the recognition of actual social forces does not diminish the space for politics but, on the contrary, enhances the possibilities for political articulation. By reducing identity to a matter of political instantiation, Mouffe bypasses the critical, prior influence of the social-cultural terrain. We have already seen that Mouffe presents a rather thin and abstracted conception of political philosophies (e.g. social democracy); we can now add that these are offered up for articulation with an equally thin and abstracted subject. This is no basis for a political project to resonate with people’s experiences.</p><p>Of course, prior structures and historical forces do not just enable the articulation of political values with experiences – they can also present significant <italic>constraints </italic>upon what is politically possible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0191453712473080">Nash, 2002</xref>). The post-structuralist account of the political lacks an adequate account of such constraints upon progressive political ambitions. This is no bad thing from the point of view of promoting the ‘optimism of the will’ famously called for by Gramsci, but fails to maintain his simultaneous call for a ‘pessimism of the intellect’. The latter means confronting the obduracy of the social relations and institutions of capitalist societies. For Gramsci, the struggle over identities is played out in <italic>civil society</italic>. As Burawoy notes, Gramsci certainly sees civil society as a ‘terrain of struggle’ (as do post-Marxists), but it nevertheless ‘occupies a specific institutional space within capitalism between economy and the state’ (2003: 198), and is subject to structural pressure from both. This is in contrast to the post-Marxist reading in which the social and the political are collapsed into a single discursive field. Mouffe suggests pluralist and complex late-modern societies are particularly conducive to hegemonic politics. Given this, it is surely necessary to theorize the institutional and historical specificity of civil society as the terrain of hegemonic struggle. This is particularly true of liberal democratic capitalist societies, in which a supposedly autonomous civil society continues to confound the left by reproducing dominant (neo-liberal) interests and ideologies.</p><p>The issue of structural constraint brings us to the final advantage of a Gramscian supplement to radical democratic theory, and one which returns us to the heart of post-Marxism’s political ambitions. To self-identify as a left project, or to be even tangentially connected with Marxism, requires a political economy that is at least prepared to recognize how economic relations and imperatives can shape politics. Post-Marxism’s refusal of society means it cannot adequately theorize the increasing <italic>commodification </italic>of social and political institutions and identities. We need not claim any necessary relationship between the economy and other domains of social life. However, once we admit the existence of society per se, we can discuss more or less causal influences upon its character and development. This in turn allows recognition that economic logics and relations play a key role in the social and political sphere under capitalist conditions. While Gramsci had already perceived the importance of treating what we today call discourse in combination with economic analysis, in post-Marxism, as Peter Ives notes, ‘in order to expunge the “essentialist remnant” from Gramsci, economic analysis has to be denied altogether as does the Marxist critique of capitalism (or any systematic critique of capitalism)’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0191453712473080">2005</xref>: 466). Instead, I have argued that we should see Gramsci as the means to ‘bring society back in’, providing post-Marxist radical democracy with the tools to justify itself as a left project, concerned with understanding and challenging the basic structures of capitalism.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section7-0191453712473080"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The post-Marxist project – and in particular Mouffe’s programme of radical democracy focused on here – has drawn on post-structuralism to offer invaluable theoretical and political insights. Originally acknowledging its debt to Gramsci, it has shown how the left can abandon determinism and develop a hegemonic politics under social conditions of pluralism and indeterminacy. Specifically, Mouffe has suggested how the left can reclaim the mantle of democracy, thus banishing the spectre of authoritarianism. But this article has argued that the ‘postmodernization’ of Gramsci has limited the post-Marxist project in general, and Mouffe’s radical democratic theory in particular. Restoring key elements of the Gramscian heritage could address these limitations, without jettisoning radical democracy’s contemporary insights.</p><p>In contrast to a discourse-centric conception of the political, with its formally elaborated ‘philosophies’, a Gramscian approach can understand values and ideologies in relation to everyday practices – including organized, systemically produced interests. In particular, such an approach can account for the structured, recursive character of ideologies. In addition, a Gramscian approach accepts the existence of society itself, rather than refusing it or subordinating it to the political. This actually enhances Mouffe’s account of political subjectivity, by allowing for the prior cultural and social terrain upon which identities are articulated and mobilized, as well as again accounting for recursive structures of domination. In particular, Gramsci allows the analytical space for civil society as a set of institutions with complex relations to both state and economy. In recovering Gramsci in this fashion, we need not go all the way back down the road with him to positing, for example, ‘fundamental classes’ as the axis of hegemony. What a Gramscian supplement to Mouffe restores are the resources for thinking about democratic left strategies <italic>within </italic>an enduring, and intensifying, capitalist environment.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bibr1-0191453712473080"><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Burawoy</surname><given-names>Michael</given-names></name></person-group> (<year>2003</year>) <article-title>‘For a Sociological Marxism: The Complementary Convergence of Antonio Gramsci and Karl Polanyi’</article-title>, <source>Politics &amp; Society</source> <volume>31</volume>(<issue>2</issue>): <fpage>193</fpage>–<lpage>261</lpage>.</citation></ref><ref id="bibr2-0191453712473080"><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Davidson</surname><given-names>Alastair</given-names></name></person-group> (<year>2008</year>) <article-title>‘The Uses and Abuses of Gramsci’</article-title>, <source>Thesis Eleven</source> <volume>95</volume>(<issue>1</issue>): <fpage>68</fpage>–<lpage>94</lpage>.</citation></ref><ref id="bibr3-0191453712473080"><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Dyrberg</surname><given-names>Torben Bech</given-names></name></person-group> (<year>2009</year>) <article-title>‘The Leftist Fascination with Schmitt and the Esoteric Quality of “The Political”’</article-title>, <source>Philosophy &amp; Social Criticism</source> <volume>35</volume>(<issue>6</issue>): <fpage>649</fpage>–<lpage>69</lpage>.</citation></ref><ref id="bibr4-0191453712473080"><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Erman</surname><given-names>Eva</given-names></name></person-group> (<year>2009</year>) <article-title>‘What is Wrong with Agonistic Pluralism?
