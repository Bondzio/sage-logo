<sec id="sec1-0265691411428783an"><title>Morag Martin, <italic>Selling Beauty: Cosmetics, Commerce, and French Society, 1750–1830</italic>, Johns Hopkins University Press: Baltimore MD, 2009; viii + 228 pp.; 9780801893094, $55.00 (hbk)</title>
<p>The title of Morag Martin’s well-written and enjoyable <italic>Selling Beauty</italic>: <italic>Cosmetics, Commerce, and French Society, 1750–1830</italic> conveys much of the subject of her book. She is interested in the business of make-up: how French merchants marketed cosmetics. But she also engages centrally with histories of consumption, medicine, social status, gender, and the body. In so doing, she casts new light on the question of long-term continuities and ruptures across the French revolutionary divide.</p>
<p>Martin begins with the common perception that the artifice and frivolity associated with early modern elites gave way to a new emphasis on restraint and naturalness over the course of the eighteenth century. This entailed a series of changes in the use of cosmetics as well as fashion more generally; men ceased to wear make-up by the early nineteenth century and the only women to do so regularly were actresses and prostitutes. Martin shows that while this account of changing practices corresponds to an important cultural shift in how people viewed beauty, it is also deceptive. Sales of cosmetics actually expanded in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, as merchants developed innovative marketing techniques and ways of appealing to non-elite customers.</p>
<p>The first three chapters focus directly on commerce. Martin begins with the courtly world of white-powdered wigs, rouge, and black silk beauty spots. Most cosmetics were homemade before the eighteenth century; Martin traces a shift from esoteric and expensive recipes to more accessible ingredients, and by the second half of the century, a further shift to store-bought products. She uses account books of bankrupt perfumers to explore their clientele, contending that make-up became a relatively cheap way for both women and men to participate in the consumer revolution.</p>
<p>Chapter 2, ‘A Market for Beauty’ investigates how merchants of beauty learned to sell new products, which did not fall neatly under the ambit of any one guild. Here her focus is on the strategies of individual entrepreneurs, especially the vinegar-maker Maille, most associated today with the brand of mustard. In the following chapter, ‘Advertising Beauty’, Martin turns to the <italic>affiches</italic>, popular newspaper advertisements. While French advertising was less sophisticated than its English counterpart, Martin argues that it reveals innovative marketing ploys. She succeeds in showing a variety of creative business practices, from patents designed to assuage fears of charlatanism and reduce the risks of counterfeiting, albeit often with limited effectiveness, to lists of fixed prices that served to make purchases more predictable.</p>
<p>In the next three chapters, Martin directly tackles critics of make-up. In some of the most innovative parts of her book, she shows the increasing importance of doctors in both attacking and legitimating cosmetics. Critics associated cosmetics with corrupt aristocracies, ridiculous <italic>petit maîtres</italic>, and deceptive <italic>coquettes</italic>, but also with physical depravity. Over half of the beauty manuals written between 1750 and 1818 referred to medical opinion. In Chapter 5, Martin shows how medical testimonials about the safety of particular beauty aids could also provide practical solutions for those wanting to use cosmetics without being deemed immoral. In Chapter 6, ‘Selling Natural Artifice’, she explores how savvy merchants were able to use medical language and patents to associate their products with health, hygiene and natural beauty. Here she focuses especially on the rouge industry’s attempts to repackage its goods.</p>
<p>The two concluding chapters address more specific themes. Chapter 7, ‘Selling the Orient’, shows that the harem was associated with exotic desirability and secret knowledge, but also with sexual depravity. Martin argues that merchants increasingly solved this tension by removing images of harem women or odalisques from advertisements; the ‘new hero was the astute entrepreneur who ferreted secret goods out of the East into the arms of French women’ (153). Her argument is intriguing, but it would be interesting to see further how such advertisements intersected with the continued prominence of early nineteenth-century paintings of harem women, like Ingres’ 1814 <italic>Grande Odalisque</italic>.</p>
<p>Martin considers both women and men as sellers and consumers of cosmetics throughout the book, but her final chapter looks most directly at male beauty culture. Here she nuances the ‘great masculine renunciation’, the idea that by the early nineteenth century, most men had ceased to wear colourful clothes or use beauty aids. Men actually remained active consumers of cosmetics – at least for hair products. Hair powder disappeared as artificial wigs fell out of fashion, and as the starch used to make hair powder became associated with bread shortages. But creams and oils to stop hair loss became a major market, as did more realistic wigs. Men, as well as women, could be enticed to buy aids for an attractive ‘natural’ appearance.</p>
<p>Martin creatively and effectively combines different kinds of source materials, juxtaposing portraits with bankruptcy ledgers and advertisements with medical treatises. The illustrations are well chosen, although it is a shame that a work about beauty and make-up could not include colour plates. The book’s thematic structure can also sometimes make it difficult to be clear about the timing of the changes Martin documents and to gauge the impact of the French Revolution in accelerating or reframing trends. Nonetheless, <italic>Selling Beauty</italic> suggests both remarkable continuities and innovations over the course of the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries – not only in the direct realm of cosmetics, but also the connected arenas of consumption, physical appearance, gender roles and social status. Pots of rouge and powders may disguise, but Martin shows that looking closely at their history can also reveal much about broad social and cultural developments.</p>
