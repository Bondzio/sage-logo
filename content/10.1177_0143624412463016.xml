<abstract>
<p>This paper investigates ‘future-proofing’ as an unexplored yet all-important aspect in the design of low-energy dwellings. It refers particularly to adopting lifecycle thinking and accommodating risks and uncertainties in the selection of fabric energy efficiency measures and low or zero-carbon technologies. Based on a conceptual framework for future-proofed design, the paper first presents results from the analysis of two ‘best practice’ housing developments in England; i.e., North West Cambridge in Cambridge and West Carclaze and Baal in St. Austell, Cornwall. Second, it examines the ‘Energy and CO<sub>2</sub> Emissions’ part of the <italic>Code for Sustainable Homes</italic> to reveal which design criteria and assessment methods can be practically integrated into this established building certification scheme so that it can become more dynamic and future-oriented.</p>
<p><bold><italic>Practical application:</italic></bold> Future-proofed construction is promoted implicitly within the increasingly stringent building regulations; however, there is no comprehensive method to readily incorporate futures thinking into the energy design of buildings. This study has a three-fold objective of relevance to the building industry:

<sec id="sec1-0143624412463016" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Buildings of the future should be sustainable, low-energy and able to accommodate social, technological, economic and regulatory changes, thus maximising lifecycle value.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0143624412463016">1</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0143624412463016">3</xref></sup> Despite advances in the energy efficiency of individual building elements and systems, the increase in total energy consumption of the building stock continues unabated in many European countries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0143624412463016">4</xref></sup> With growing global concern regarding climate change, there is also the risk of summertime overheating, which impacts negatively on the thermal performance of building envelopes. Buildings today should use less energy and provide thermal comfort under warmer climatic conditions and addressing this dual challenge with conventional building design processes can have a negative impact on the total energy performance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0143624412463016">5</xref></sup> Given the slow turnover of the building stock, an existing design that cannot respond to both present and future circumstances is vulnerable to becoming poorly utilised and prematurely obsolete.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0143624412463016">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>The issue of futures thinking in energy and buildings is inherent to the principles of sustainable development. Applying the Brundtland Commission’s definition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0143624412463016">7</xref></sup>: sustainable buildings should meet present needs without compromising the requirements of future users in relation to energy efficiency, thermal comfort and utility. Minimising the need to apply energy-saving measures in the future entails ‘future-proofing’ by incorporating durability and flexibility for ‘technology-readiness’ and occupants’ changing behaviours from an early design stage. Buildings able to respond to future changes may avoid complex, costly and energy-intensive refurbishments. Nevertheless, designing for future requirements and changes is challenging and little research has been conducted into building design processes that adopt explicitly future-oriented perspectives.</p>
<p>The UK has one of the oldest and least efficient domestic stocks in Europe, which accounts for around 25% of the national carbon emissions and approximately 40% of buildings are built before 1944.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0143624412463016">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0143624412463016">9</xref></sup> Apart from an aging stock, the UK suffers from a slow turnover, as it is estimated that over 75% of buildings in use today will still be standing in 2050.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0143624412463016">10</xref></sup> To counteract this, the Government is committed to increasingly more stringent regulations and standards, such as the constant update of<italic> Part L (Conservation of Fuel and Power) of Building Regulations</italic>,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0143624412463016">11</xref></sup> the <italic>Climate Change Act</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0143624412463016">12</xref></sup> and the proposals to deliver <italic>zero carbon new homes</italic> from 2016 onwards.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0143624412463016">13</xref></sup> Nevertheless, as the energy use has changed rapidly over the past 50 years, the type and pace of future change may be wholly different compared to past experience.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0143624412463016">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0143624412463016">14</xref></sup></p>
<p>This study relates to domestic buildings in the UK and has a twofold objective:
<list id="list3-0143624412463016" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>to examine the extent to which current ‘best-practice’ dwelling energy design processes in the UK incorporate future-oriented design criteria and assessment methods based on an existing conceptual framework for ‘future-proofed’ design and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>to reveal the gap and suggest the integration of future-proofed criteria into the <italic>Code for Sustainable Homes</italic> (CfSH), thus providing useful and practical guidance in future-proofing its energy-related methodology.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>From a wide range of methods, the focus is on the CfSH, since it is considered the leading tool to drive the ‘step-change’ required for achieving zero-carbon homes in England by 2016.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0143624412463016">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>In this study, the term ‘building solutions’ refers to fabric energy efficiency measures and on-site Low or Zero Carbon technologies (LZCs) either micro-generation or district networks.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-0143624412463016" sec-type="methods"><title>Methodology</title>
<p>The research follows the approach of methodological triangulation. Triangulation refers to the use of multiple sources for gathering data and offers the prospect of enhanced confidence in the findings, as the application of a single method may lead to limitations associated with that method or from its specific application.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0143624412463016">16</xref></sup> The research builds on a previously established conceptual framework for future-proofed design<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0143624412463016">17</xref></sup> and is organised into two parts:
<list id="list4-0143624412463016" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>A case study method, which focuses on two ‘best practice’ sustainable and low-energy housing developments in England.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Identifying and integrating practical guidelines into the ‘Energy and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions’ part of the CfSH, based on the comparison and cross-examination of the findings from the conceptual framework and the analysis of the two case studies.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>The selected case studies are: North West Cambridge in Cambridgeshire<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0143624412463016">18</xref></sup> and West Carclaze and Baal in St. Austell, Cornwall.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0143624412463016">19</xref></sup> Fieldwork was conducted to gather empirical data and reveal the extent to which these exemplary settlements accommodate the future-proofed design criteria identified by the literature survey. The data protocol includes document analysis and in-depth semi-structured interviews. To date, eleven one-to-one or group interviews have been carried out and an interview template is issued to the respondents one week prior to the scheduled dates to allow a certain degree of preparation. The target audience includes building industry professionals working for the developer (client) side, energy consultant side and local authorities. These comprise architects, building services engineers, technical directors and senior planning officers, who are themselves or work closely with independent CfSH assessors.</p>

<sec id="sec3-0143624412463016"><title>Conceptual framework for future-proofed design</title>
<p>A significant barrier for integrating futures thinking into the energy design of buildings is the lack of common understanding regarding what the term ‘future-proofed’ design actually means. This is an evolving concept, which has not been explored sufficiently by researchers and building industry professionals and, therefore, a widely accepted definition is challenging to be established. This section gives insight into the definition of future-proofing and introduces the design criteria and assessment methods for its achievement.</p>
<sec id="sec4-0143624412463016"><title>Definition</title>
<p>Existing definitions of future-proofing focus on a particular vulnerability, such as the risk of overheating or the increasingly stringent regulatory requirements.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0143624412463016">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0143624412463016">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0143624412463016">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0143624412463016">21</xref></sup> However, a comprehensive definition should acknowledge a wider spectrum of trends and drivers that affect the energy consumption.</p>
<p>Georgiadou et al<italic>.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0143624412463016">17</xref></sup> define future-proofing as ‘<italic>stress-testing building solutions against a range of possible (predictable and uncertain) futures.’</italic> The objective is to ensure that low-energy strategies are based on designing for longevity, thus increasing the likelihood that dwellings remain ‘fit for purpose’ and avoiding the need for disruptive and costly refurbishment upgrades. A low-energy building is a necessary but not sufficient step towards achieving a future-proofed design, but does represent a point of departure from which to further develop this concept.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0143624412463016">22</xref></sup> There are two key features that enhance future-proofing in relation to the energy performance of dwellings, which need to be considered from an early design stage:
<list id="list5-0143624412463016" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>adopting full lifecycle perspectives to minimise the environmental impact of building solutions from ‘cradle to grave’&#128;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0143624412463016">23</xref></sup> and</p></list-item>

<sec id="sec7-0143624412463016"><title>Accommodating risks and uncertainties</title>
<p>The terms ‘risk’ and ‘uncertainty’ are unavoidably associated with adopting a long-term perspective and even though they are often used synonymously, they are not the same. Abaza et al<italic>.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0143624412463016">30</xref></sup> explain that risk refers to situations where probabilities can be assigned to the likelihood of an event occurring; i.e. for predictable outcomes. In contrast, under uncertainty there is insufficient information to determine the probabilities associated with an outcome.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0143624412463016">30</xref></sup> Factors that can lead to uncertain outcomes are sometimes referred to as ‘unknown unknowns’ or ‘asymmetric outcomes’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0143624412463016">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0143624412463016">32</xref></sup> In this context, Taleb<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0143624412463016">32</xref></sup> argues that:<disp-quote>
<p>I will never get to know the unknown since, by definition, is unknown. However, I can guess how it might affect me and I should base my decision around that [… To] make a decision you need to focus on the consequences (which you can know) rather than the probability (which you cannot know).</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Design criteria for accommodating such risks and uncertainties include (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0143624412463016">Table 1</xref>):

<p>A barrier to accommodating uncertainty is the difficulty in accurately predicting future energy requirements.

The Foresight project on Sustainable Energy Management in the Built Environment (SEMBE) brought together research on energy and buildings with scenario planning.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0143624412463016">26</xref></sup> Focusing on the UK built environment, it identified four possible futures to 2050 using a scenario-based (explorative) analysis. These plausible states unfolded mitigation and adaptation challenges that the UK society might face in relation to climate change, new energy systems, energy behaviours and building practices.</p>

<sec id="sec8-0143624412463016"><title>Case study research</title>
<p>This section presents the analysis of the two case studies, namely North West Cambridge and West Carclaze and Baal. Due to their high energy and environmental standards, these projects are expected to provide the best platform for planning and energy design processes from which to develop any improvements with regard to ‘future-proofing’.</p>
<sec id="sec9-0143624412463016"><title>Description</title>
<p>The <italic>North West Cambridge </italic>site is an area of around 141 ha located on the edge of Cambridge owned and managed by the University of Cambridge.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0143624412463016">18</xref></sup> The vision is to create a new mixed-use eco-quarter, which will contribute to meeting the needs of the University and the wider city up to 2021 and beyond while embodying best practice in environmental sustainability. With regard to the domestic stock, the planning application provides for 1500 private houses and 1500 homes for University staff and student accommodation. In terms of climate change and energy consumption, all dwellings have to meet the Fabric Energy Efficiency Standard (FEES), CfSH Level 5 and there are also provisions for decentralised energy generation.<sup>18</sup> According to the Zero Carbon Hub recommendations, the Fabric Energy Efficiency Target is 39 kWh/m<sup>2</sup>/yr for apartment blocks and mid terrace properties and 46 kWh/m<sup>2</sup>/yr for semi-detached and detached houses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0143624412463016">36</xref></sup></p>
<p>The China Clay Area in Cornwall was one of the four first eco-towns identified in 2009.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0143624412463016">19</xref></sup> The vision was to regenerate the existing post-industrial settlements to help address the decline of the mining operations in the area. Although the coalition Government has altered the eco-town initiative, the key principles of the regeneration plan are still promoted by the Cornwall Council and Eco-Bos (the private developer) with the <italic>West Carclaze and Baal</italic> site being the first eco-community proposal. This is a mixed-use development of 310 ha including 2000 dwellings with 40% affordable housing. All homes will achieve the FEES as a minimum. Terraced properties will achieve CfSH Level 4 and detached properties Level 6 [19].</p>

<sec id="sec12-0143624412463016"><title>Background information</title>
<p>The CfSH is a checklist-type environmental assessment tool for rating and certifying the performance of new homes in England.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0143624412463016">15</xref></sup> It became legally binding in 2008, taking over the EcoHomes version of Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method (BREEAM).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0143624412463016">38</xref></sup> It is the single national standard to drive continuous improvement and innovation towards achieving sustainable home building practice and to meet the target of zero carbon new homes by 2016. The tool is also set to comply with international schemes and objectives, such as the PassivHaus standard and the EU 2010/31/EC Directive on the Energy Performance of Buildings.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0143624412463016">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0143624412463016">38</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0143624412463016">41</xref></sup></p>
<p>The assessment is based on nine categories of sustainable design, namely: energy and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, water, materials, surface water run-off, waste, pollution, health and well-being, management and ecology. The assessment is carried out in two stages:<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0143624412463016">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0143624412463016">38</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0143624412463016">41</xref></sup> design stage and post-construction stage, for an evidence-based evaluation of all the information provided in the design specification stage.</p>
<p>The Code uses a star system (1 to 6 stars) to rate performance, with 6 stars equating to a zero carbon home, at the end of the two stages. Each category holds a different weighting factor depending on its significance in both stages. Energy is the most important category in the Code with a maximum percentage of 36.4% of all assessment criteria (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0143624412463016">Table 4</xref>). This category aims to, amongst other, ‘<italic>future-proof the energy efficiency of dwellings over their whole life by limiting heat losses across the building envelope</italic>’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0143624412463016">15</xref></sup> Consequently, the minimum standards for Code compliance have been set above the Part L through compulsory changes to the Building Regulations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0143624412463016">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0143624412463016">38</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0143624412463016">41</xref></sup> Since 2010, proposals involve a 25% improvement in energy efficiency over 2006 Part L (Code Level 3), rising to a 44% (Code Level 4) in 2013 before finally moving to zero carbon homes by 2016.

<sec id="sec13-0143624412463016"><title>Future-proofed design criteria</title>
<p>Although there is a clear long-term focus, the Code lacks assessment criteria that promote explicitly a futures perspective (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0143624412463016">Table 4</xref>). The only indication of future-proofing is in the ‘Home-Office’ criterion, which assigns only one credit for internal space flexibility. Not all of the design criteria and assessment methods presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0143624412463016">Table 1</xref> can be practically integrated into the Code. The interview respondents highlighted four areas of enhancing the future-orientation of the tool. These are:</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec14-0143624412463016"><title>Lifecycle thinking</title>
<p>The highest Code level aims for ‘zero carbon’ dwellings; i.e. zero net carbon emissions over a year. However, the interviewees reveal that this target may be hampered by the failure to consider the full lifecycle of the selected materials, building components and energy systems. In both eco-communities, the developers seek to design dwellings for a long lifecycle between 60 and 100 years. The developer of North West Cambridge states explicitly that ‘<italic>given their longevity, building envelopes in domestic buildings can have the most significant long-term impact on the energy performance, as they are unlikely to be radically modified during the lifecycle.</italic>’ In practice, however, the vision for a long lifecycle is expressed only via the reduction of carbon emissions at the operational stage of the building (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0143624412463016">Table 2</xref>). According to the eleven respondents, the poor expression of long-term thinking in the energy design is mainly due to the lack of comprehensive building environmental assessment methods and certification schemes that adopt full lifecycle perspectives.</p>
<p>First, the Code does not take into account energy audits via PCA or POE. Hence, it does not consider the ‘performance gap’ between the design intent and the level of energy consumption achieved in practice. Including actual energy consumption data on the CfSH will act as a reality check against which calculated energy performance could be compared.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0143624412463016">10</xref></sup> With the advances in smart metering technologies, the use of actual (instead of estimated) consumption data will improve the accuracy of assessing the cost of energy saving technologies. For instance, the CfSH can be improved by using government-approved energy price forecasts.</p>
<p>Second, the tool overlooks the embodied energy of the most commonly used materials, building components and energy systems, such as concrete, insulation materials or solar photovoltaics (PVs). The selection of low embodied energy solutions affects significantly the total energy consumption in the process of achieving a zero carbon home, as it determines the end-of-life stages and whether a building will go under an uplifting refurbishment or demolition. As the construction industry moves towards achieving the zero carbon target, improvements in energy efficiency have led to reduced energy consumption at the operational stage, and therefore the relative significance of embodied energy has increased, as it forms a higher proportion of the total amount of energy used during the lifecycle.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0143624412463016">42</xref></sup> Embodied energy has not been incorporated in the Code’s ‘Energy and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions’ category to date.</p>
<p>The case studies analysis shows no comprehensive use of the LCA or LCC methods in either project. There are key barriers that inhibit the application of rigorous LCAs to inform the selection of low-energy building solutions, namely<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0143624412463016">28</xref></sup>: the need for large datasets; complicated calculations; lengthy process; a range of LCA tools displaying non-comparable results; high costs and a low demand for LCA amongst building designers.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec15-0143624412463016"><title>Climate change adaptation due to overheating</title>
<p>All respondents agree that strengthening building codes and energy-related standards requires the adoption of adaptation measures to address the increasing frequency and severity of temperature extremes that may lead to overheating. They argue that the focus has been predominantly on mitigation; i.e. use of energy efficiency measures and renewable energy technologies to reduce Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions and achieve energy cost savings during the operational stage of buildings. Nevertheless, many future impacts of the energy use in dwellings are already ‘locked-in’ as a result of past GHG emissions. Even with effective mitigation, global GHG emissions will continue to grow unabated at least up to 2050; hence, more extensive adaptation is required to reduce vulnerability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0143624412463016">43</xref></sup></p>
<p>The case studies analysis shows that the need to design for future climate impacts and, in particular, overheating due to temperature increase is a common objective (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0143624412463016">Table 3</xref>). Both projects demonstrate the commonly-used passive design techniques (e.g. orientation, external shading) and energy efficiency measures (e.g. insulation, air tightness, thermal mass, natural ventilation and mixed-mode operations) to minimise the need for mechanical cooling and, therefore, reduce the energy use. However, the need for adaptation is not yet fully acknowledged amongst building professionals and, unfortunately, treated separately to mitigation. As one interviewee suggests, ‘<italic>appropriate performance indicators that account for climate change adaptation in building energy assessment methods need further development</italic>,’&#128;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0143624412463016">44</xref></sup> which currently hinders the inclusion of adaptation-related criteria in certification schemes, such as the CfSH.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec16-0143624412463016"><title>Design for resilience and flexibility</title>
<p>Although the rate of replacement of the housing stock in the UK remains low, the interview responses underline that the life expectancy of the building facade (e.g. walls and floors) is a lot longer than that of the building services and partitions, which are likely to be replaced after about 15–20 years.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0143624412463016">45</xref></sup> This is due to the diversified lifetime’ of buildings, namely, the fact that they are constituted from elements (components and technologies) with different design lives.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0143624412463016">46</xref></sup> This means that elements with long lifespans that are difficult to change should be designed for maximum resilience. Conversely, elements with short lifespans that are easy to be modified should be designed for maximum flexibility. According to five out of the eleven respondents, the independence of elements is an important gap in the Code’s assessment criteria. This is also supported by Russell and Moffatt,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0143624412463016">6</xref></sup> who state that ‘<italic>the more each element is uncoupled from the other, the more adaptable a building becomes</italic>.’</p>
<p>All respondents agree that future-proofed construction should be durable, with low maintenance costs and sufficiently flexible to cope with extension, alteration and changes in performance requirements. The Code introduces the ‘Home-Office’ criterion, which encourages change in working and living patterns via maximum internal space flexibility. It also applies the Lifetime Homes standard under the ‘Health and Well-being’ category, which seeks to promote the construction of homes that are accessible and easily adaptable to meet the changing need of present and future occupants.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0143624412463016">47</xref></sup> To further enhance flexibility, the Code should combine the ‘Home-Office’ and ‘Lifetime Homes’ options with additional criteria, such as the ‘Building for Life’ assessment methodology.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0143624412463016">48</xref></sup> Apart from the socio-economic benefits, this will enhance the ability to anticipate change in regulatory requirements or to accommodate new technologies when they become cost-effective, such as space for energy storage or PV-ready roofs, thus delivering significant energy and cost savings.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec17-0143624412463016"><title>Building performance evaluation and certification</title>
<p>At present, the CfSH uses the Standard Assessment Procedure (SAP) model, which is the UK Government’s established methodology for assessing and comparing the energy and environmental performance of dwellings.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0143624412463016">49</xref></sup> SAP is a steady-state calculation, which assesses the annual energy performance of dwellings. A ‘steady-state’ model refers to calculations that explore variations over time using a constant value for each time step. The April 2010 update of SAP shifted from an annual to monthly calculations for the demand of space heating, allowance for space cooling, explicit inclusion of parameter estimates for the thermal mass of a dwelling, improved calculation of thermal bridging and updated weather data tables and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions factors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0143624412463016">10</xref></sup><sup>–</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0143624412463016">50</xref></sup></p>
<p>The respondents, however, show a lack of confidence in using SAP for domestic energy and carbon compliance calculations, as it does not fully consider the dynamic characteristics of buildings.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0143624412463016">51</xref></sup> SAP estimates measure the annual unit cost of space and water heating from set values about heating patterns, internal temperatures and future price of different fuels. Occupants’ behaviour is also one of the biggest uncertainties in estimating household energy consumption, which SAP does not touch upon.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0143624412463016">10</xref></sup> Finally, SAP uses a simple payback calculation, which is a poor estimate for costs that arise in the present and savings that accrue in the future. A more accurate method would use Net Present Value (NPV) or Internal Rate of Return (IRR) calculations to allow for the time value of money.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0143624412463016">10</xref></sup> Hence, a dynamic model would assess more adequately the impact of changes on the above key variables affecting the total energy demand. A ‘dynamic’ model accounts for the element of time and variable values are presented with differential equations.</p>
<p>All interviewees agreed that there is a need to shift away from deterministic models to probabilistic building simulations, especially when future climate impacts are considered. To account for climate change, there has been significant progress over the past decade in developing stochastic weather data representative of future temperatures, which can then be integrated into building thermal simulations. At present, the UK Climate Projections (UKCP09) programme is a leading provision of risk-based regional climate information.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0143624412463016">52</xref></sup> There are then algorithms that help to create realistic hourly future weather files using the CIBSE Test Reference Year dataset or the future climate data of the UKCP09 weather generator, although the former often involves a deterministic description of future climates rather than accounting for uncertainty.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0143624412463016">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0143624412463016">54</xref></sup> Designing for future overheating is not seen as a pressing concern and, therefore, there is no standardised method that accounts for it. Also, the findings reveal that unless user friendly, there will be a small uptake for probabilistic climate projections. In North West Cambridge, the design team has used the Integrated Environmental Solutions (IES) dynamic tool to incorporate the UKCP09 probabilistic weather data in overheating analysis. In Cornwall, the energy consultants have followed a deterministic approach using SAP.</p>
<p>However, an important finding from the interviews is that there is no such thing as ‘perfect models’ and simply assuming existing default values is incorrect, as long-term forecasts can be notoriously erroneous. This means that even in the case where models are perfectly accurate, uncertainty still remains, as future impacts can be highly unpredictable due to ‘unknown unknowns.’ The responses reveal that the use of futures techniques, and particularly tools, such as Scenario Planning, can help to plan for the wider spectrum of trends and drivers affecting the energy consumption of dwellings by at least 2050 as presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0143624412463016">Table 1</xref>. At present, however, the two projects do not demonstrate any use of this ‘family’ of tools.</p>

<sec id="sec18-0143624412463016"><title>Concluding discussion</title>
<p>The concept of future-proofing is contested as definitions are evolving and many aspects are yet to be defined. Time, cost and regulations are still the dominant considerations in the energy design and construction of buildings; however, long lifecycles, climate uncertainty, along with social, technological, economic, environmental and regulatory trends and drivers of change set the grounds for further research. This paper has initially examined how future-proofed is the energy design of domestic buildings in two exemplary eco-communities in England. This refers to the extent to which the energy design fosters lifecycle thinking and accommodates risks and uncertainties that affect the energy performance over the long term. Based on a set of predefined design criteria and assessment methods as well as expert interviews with building industry professionals, it is concluded that traditional decision-making processes assume that buildings will never experience significant change and are based primarily on standard practice or intuition. The building industry is responding slowly to long-term perspectives and changing circumstances; however, future-proofing can be an innovative concept that encourages multidisciplinary thinking and a systems approach in the energy design.</p>
<p>In order to achieve a comprehensive energy assessment method, building performance evaluation methods and certification schemes that grant a ‘zero carbon’ status need to be refined in order to better integrate futures thinking. Focusing on future-proofing the ‘Energy and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions’ category of the CfSH, aspects that should be promoted by its assessment criteria include:
<list id="list8-0143624412463016" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Full lifecycle thinking that can be achieved via criteria for PCA/POE, embodied energy considerations, and design for deconstruction (re-use and recycle). At present, the use of the LCA/LCC tools in certification schemes is challenging and requires further research and market incentives.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Promoting adaptation strategies that address the risk of overheating.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Designing for resilience and internal space flexibility in order to accommodate new working and living patterns (e.g. home-office) and ease the process of technology upgrades via cost-effective and/or novel technologies.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Use probabilistic climate projections for stochastic analysis of overheating risk (via UKCP09 weather files).</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Shifting away from steady-state to dynamic estimates for evaluating the dwelling’s total energy consumption.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Use of futures techniques (e.g. scenario planning, backcasting, horizon scanning, and wind tunnelling) at an early masterplanning stage to explore a spectrum of plausible scenarios to account for uncertainties and, hence, avoid external shocks.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>Lastly, it is important to realise that future-proofing should be incorporated at the start of the energy design process and not to be added as an extra later on. Considering the above implications at the outset can reduce costs and provide solutions for achieving the maximum number of credits in the CfSH.</p>
