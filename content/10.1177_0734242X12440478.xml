<abstract>
<p>Medical waste management (MWM) is an important public health concern worldwide. Although physicians must participate in medical waste management, their personal and organizational predictors in this process are unknown. This study aimed to the determinants of physicians’ knowledge, attitudes and practices related to MWM in eight hospitals of Mazandaran province, northern Iran. A validated, reliable self-administered questionnaire was used including 30 questions about the respondents’ knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) and personal and professional variables. Of a total of 200 physicians, 150 persons completed the questionnaire (response rate of 75%). The average score (± SD) for physicians’ knowledge was 6.50 (± 1.50) out of 10, whereas those for attitudes and practices were 4.44 (± 0.88) and 4.02 (± 1.35) out of 5, respectively. Surgeons and orthopaedists had the lowest scores, whereas para-clinical specialists and internal medicine specialists had the highest scores. The score of knowledge showed significant differences among speciality groups and the various speciality groups’ scores differed significantly only for knowledge (<italic>P</italic> = 0.024) and the mean of total KAP was significantly different between educational and non-educational hospitals (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). As hospital type and physician speciality was related to the KAP concerning MWM, therefore it is recommend that all hospitals should develop appropriate protocols for medical waste management based on the this variables using a participatory process with teamwork and continuous training</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Medical waste includes materials produced in different stages of health protection, medical diagnosis, treatment, and scientific research processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0734242X12440478">Cocchiarella et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0734242X12440478">Massrouje, 2001</xref>). According to a 2004 report of the World Health Organization, around 85% of medical wastes are non-hazardous, 10% are infectious (and hence hazardous), and the remaining 5% are non-infectious but hazardous (chemical, pharmaceutical and radioactive wastes) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0734242X12440478">WHO, 2004</xref>). Medical waste management (MWM) is an important public health concern that requires attention worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0734242X12440478">Massrouje, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>In transitional countries such as Iran, medical waste management processes have received little attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0734242X12440478">Bassey et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0734242X12440478">Taghipour and Mosaferi, 2009</xref>), and recent studies have mostly focused on the quantity and composition of waste generated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0734242X12440478">Taghipour and Mosaferi, 2009</xref>). These studies have revealed that medical waste collection, sorting and disposal processes do not conform to the standards recommended by Iran’s Waste Management Act of 2004 (Waste Management Regulation of Iran, 2009) and have warned of the risks of human exposure to these wastes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0734242X12440478">Hassan et al., 2008</xref>). Inappropriate management of medical waste may pose serious risks to hospital staff, the general public and the environment. Therefore, all hospital personnel should be made aware of the potential risks of mishandling waste (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0734242X12440478">Dehghani et al., 2008</xref>), especially supervising doctors (top managers, middle managers, executive managers and heads of health teams), who can and should play a key role in medical waste management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0734242X12440478">Imamura, 2007</xref>). Physicians should participate in waste management programmes that fulfill national regulations. In addition, they can considerably reduce the quantity and costs of medical waste disposal by providing effective leadership for other hospital personnel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0734242X12440478">Cocchiarella et al., 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>In Iran, research on this critical issue has been very limited, and the role of physicians in MWM is unknown. Similarly, adequate and efficient rules have not been compiled for different categories of hospital personnel. No useful information is available concerning the performance of hospital personnel in medical waste management in Iran (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0734242X12440478">Dehghani et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>MWM planning is necessary to reduce health problems and to eliminate potential human health risks for both hospital personnel and patients and other people in the surrounding environment. For the successful development of any MWM plan, adequate information about the quantity and composition of the waste produced is an essential prerequisite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0734242X12440478">Taghipour and Mosaferi, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Ideally, each hospital should designate a special group with the responsibility to oversee medical waste management. A waste management team should include the hospital manager and representatives of the physicians, nurses, environmental staff and waste collectors. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0734242X12440478">Johannessen et al., 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>Several studies in developing countries have shown that most physicians, nurses, and housekeepers have inadequate knowledge of, unsatisfactory attitudes towards and little practice in medical waste management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0734242X12440478">Mostafa et al., 2009</xref>). Previous studies, such as those conducted in recent decades in Tehran (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0734242X12440478">Dehghani et al., 2008</xref>), Tabriz (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0734242X12440478">Taghipour and Mosaferi, 2009</xref>), Fars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0734242X12440478">Askarian et al., 2004</xref>), Mazandaran (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0734242X12440478">Mohseni et al., 2002</xref>), Golestan and other parts of Iran, have focused on the importance of MWM, especially with respect to its quantity and composition. However, very little information is available in the literature about physicians’ roles in MWM in Iran. Mazandaran province, with a population of about 2.9 million, is located in northern Iran along the southern coast of the Caspian Sea. This ecologically diverse province features plains, prairies, forests and jungles (Parsa, 1957). Due to the geographical and climatic conditions of the area (e.g., vast forests and jungles, high rainfall, and high groundwater levels), the management of municipal, industrial and medical wastes are a major environmental challenge in this region. The present study, aimed to assess the personal and organizational determinants of hospital physicians’ knowledge, attitudes and practices regarding MWM in Mazandaran province, Iran.</p>

<title>Materials and methods</title>
<p>This descriptive-analytic cross-sectional study was performed in Mazandaran province during the summer of 2010. A total of 200 questionnaires were distributed to randomly selected physicians of the study population of which 150 questioner were completed with a response rate of 75% . This sample size fulfilled the criteria of six to ten samples per item of questioner in exploratory studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0734242X12440478">Kutner et al., 2005</xref>). Two-stage sampling was used to select study participants. In the first stage the hospitals were selected (eight hospitals in different cities in Mazandaran province) and in the second stage physicians were randomly selected from the staffing list of hospital doctors of Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences. The physicians in this study served in different organizational posts within the hospitals, including academic members, non-academic member, top managers, mid-level managers and residents. Questionnaires were distributed in eight of the 27 public hospitals in different cities in Mazandaran province, northern Iran. The selected hospitals were chosen in order to cover the total area of the province and be representative of the study population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0734242X12440478">Figure 1</xref>). Data were gathered using a self-administered questionnaire containing 20 questions about knowledge, attitudes and practices regarding waste management and 10 questions about personal and professional variables. The personal and organizational variables used in this study included age, sex, medical speciality, service record, type of employment, organizational position, teaching or non-teaching status, and general or speciality domain of hospital activities. Hospital performance in MWM was classified into three levels, acceptable, unacceptable, and relatively acceptable, based on the expert opinions of the research team (through site visits, observations, and conversations). The research team included: two assistant professors of hospital management, one associated professor of environmental health, two M.S.-level environmental health researchers and the manager responsible for hospital waste management from Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences. The knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) questionnaire was originally developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0734242X12440478">Taghipour et al. (2007)</xref>, who confirmed its validity and reliability. In addition, the reliability of each factor was investigated using Cronbach’s alpha coefficient. The Cronbach’s alpha values for knowledge (0.502), attitudes (0.50) and practices (0.526) showed reasonable reliability (internal consistency). Each item of the KAP scale were coded as 1 and 0 for positive and negative responses, respectively The score for each component was constructed by summing over the positive responses for knowledge, attitudes and practices. The scores of these corresponding items included 10, five and five questions, respectively; for which the possible range of the scores was (0–10), (0–5), and (0–5) for knowledge, attitudes and practices, respectively. The percentage of positive responses was also used as a summary measure for evaluation. Based on this measure, values of &lt; 50%, 50–75% and &gt; 75% were considered to be ‘unacceptable’, ‘acceptable’ and ‘good’, respectively.</p>

<p>The criteria used by the research team for classifying of waste management practices included items such as: allocation of enough budget for the management of medical waste; purchasing and selection of supplies and goods that are less wasteful or less hazardous; using a colour-coded container for segregation of medical waste; appropriate use of colour-coded containers for segregation; quality of on-site transportation of medical waste; use of safety boxes for sharp waste; using of protective measures by medical waste workers; training of medical waste workers; method and quality of on-site treatment; final treatment quality and disposal method; etc.</p>

<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>The data were summarized by means ± standard deviations for each variable. Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test was used to determine whether the results differed between sexes or between hospital types (speciality or training). One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to test for differences between categories defined by age, length of service, physician speciality (13 specialities grouped into six categories), occupational group (four categories based on employment status) or responsibility group separately for each KAP component. In addition, the relationships of these variables with KAP were simultaneously tested using a multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0734242X12440478">Zar, 2007</xref>). <italic>P</italic>-values less than 0.5 (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.5) was considered to be significant. The data were analysed using SPSS (version 16) software.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>According to the expert opinion of the research team, the waste management practices were acceptable in three hospitals, relatively acceptable in three hospitals and unacceptable in two hospitals.</p>
<p>Furthermore, hospital waste management was acceptable in two of the general hospitals and one of the speciality hospitals studied. Two of the teaching hospitals (67%) had acceptable waste management practices. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0734242X12440478">Table 1</xref> reports some of the main characteristics of the hospitals studied and their waste management practices.</p>

<p>Of the 150 physicians who completed the questionnaire, 64.7% were male and 35.3% were female. Furthermore, 32% were general practitioners and 68.2% had other specialities.</p>
<p>In terms of their employment status, 56.7% of the respondents were permanent employees and the remaining respondents were temporary employees. In terms of organizational position, 31 respondents were academic members, whereas the others were non-academic physicians, managers and residents. The average (± SD) age was 42.56 (± 8.10) years, and the average (± SD) length of service was 11.09 (± 7.24) years.</p>
<p>The respondents’ overall knowledge scores were unacceptable for the proportion of infectious wastes (32%), the best method of non-hazardous waste disposal (41.3%), the responsible organization of medical waste management (26.4%), and hospital waste categories (25.3%). Their knowledge about the management of sharp wastes was acceptable (66%), and their knowledge about the importance of hazardous waste management (96%), the best method of waste disposal (97%), objectives of waste management (93%), and the first step in waste management (91%) was good. The average (± SD) score for individual physicians’ knowledge was 6.50 (± 1.50) out of 10.</p>
<p>The respondents exhibited positive attitudes toward the effects of waste management on various subjects, such as hospital infection control (89%) and vector control (90%). They also appreciated the necessity of allocating special funds to waste management (97%), collecting waste into coloured and coded bags (86%) and implementing better methods to improve physicians’ knowledge about waste management (80%). Further analysis of the last question showed that the physicians’ preferred methods to improve their knowledge about MWM were participating in educational courses (15.3%); studying handouts, brochures and pamphlets (80.7%); and self-study of media resources (4%). The average (±SD) score for attitude was 4.44 (± 0.88) out of 5.</p>
<p>To assess the physicians’ hospital waste management practices, five questionnaire items were analysed and it was found that the physicians paid good attention toward the use of coloured and coded bags (83.1%). Their practices in correct methods of waste management were acceptable (71.3%). The respondents reported appropriate practices where there was only one waste receptacle in their working room (81.3%), and their reactions were considered to be good if they have noticed organizations or groups separating plastic from other hospital wastes (79.3%). They also reported good compliance with the rules related to waste incineration (80.5%). The average score for physicians’ practices was 4.02 (±1.35) out of 5.</p>
<p>In total, the average (± SD) scores for physicians’ knowledge, attitudes and practices in non-teaching hospitals were 6.64 (± 1.48), 4.60 (± 0.71) and 4.25 (± 1.53), respectively. These scores were higher than those for teaching hospitals average (± SD) equal to [6.40 (± 1.51), 4.38 (± 0.98) and 3.48 (± 1.19), respectively]. However, teaching and non-teaching hospitals did not differ significantly in any single domain of KAP. For total KAP scores, the teaching and non-teaching hospitals did exhibit a mean ± SD equal to (14.58 ± 2.49 and 15.49 ± 1.73, respectively; <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). There were no statistically significant differences between general and speciality hospitals, although the average (± SD) KAP score of physicians in general hospitals (15.15 ± 1.93) was higher than that of physicians in speciality hospitals 14.88 (± 2.39).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The present study demonstrated the personal, professional and organizational predictors of physicians’ knowledge, attitudes and practices related to MWM.</p>
<p>The physicians in this study scored 6.5 out of 10 for MWM knowledge, which is an acceptable but not good level. Similarly, Pandit et al. found that physicians in India are well aware of the hazards of biomedical wastes and risk of communicable diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0734242X12440478">Pandit et al., 2005</xref>). However, the findings of the present study differ from those of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0734242X12440478">Ramokate and Basu (2009)</xref>, who reported that physicians in South Africa have a weak knowledge of MWM, particularly concerning key regulatory documents. Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0734242X12440478">Sharma and Chauhan (2008)</xref> have reported a lack of awareness of biomedical waste management among dental physicians.</p>
<p>In the present study, physicians’ attitudes toward MWM scored 4.44 out of 5, a level categorized as good. These results are consistent with those of other studies, which have generally reported positive attitudes toward medical waste management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0734242X12440478">Laraqui et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0734242X12440478">Massrouje, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0734242X12440478">Shafee et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Furthermore, physicians’ MWM practices received a score of 4.02 of 5, which was categorized as good. These findings are supported by those findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0734242X12440478">Yadavannavar et al. (2010)</xref>, who have reported satisfactory knowledge, attitudes and practices of hospital staff in India (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0734242X12440478">Yadavannavar et al., 2010</xref> ). Another study in India also found that key personnel involved in waste management are aware of the importance of this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0734242X12440478">Kedar and Ashok, 2007</xref> ).</p>
<p>The most interesting finding of the present study is the lack of significant relationships between personal, professional and organizational variables and physicians’ KAP scores. Results showed significant differences in knowledge scores among speciality groups and in attitude and practice scores between teaching and non-teaching hospitals. In addition, the average KAP score of general hospitals was higher than that of speciality hospitals; male respondents scored higher than female respondents; and semi-permanent employees (committed to serving), managers, internal medicine specialists and young physicians had higher scores than other groups (although not significantly so).</p>
<p>Otherwise, these findings may be attributable to a lack of relevant training and to a lack of interest and reluctance to participate in such programmes due a lack of leadership by physicians in charge of health-care teams. Recent research has recommended that general assistants and doctors as well as other personnel should be trained together with the personnel belonging to their units and departments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0734242X12440478">Mostafa et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Another important finding is the low concern of physicians in hospital management positions toward MWM (although there was no statistically significant relationship between organizational position and MWM scores), consistent with the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0734242X12440478">Sharma and Chauhan (2008)</xref>, who have observed most authorities, administrators and other hospital staff are not concerned about medical waste management. Thus, hospital physicians tend to believe that the responsibility for waste management processes belongs to lower-level personnel.</p>
<p>According to the World Health Organization, all doctors and hospital personnel require the same basic set of skills, information and attitudes toward appropriate waste management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0734242X12440478">WHO, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>One issue that emerges from these findings is the unsatisfactory waste management situation in the hospitals studied (only 37.5% of which exhibited an acceptable level) in spite of the good attitude and practice scores and acceptable knowledge scores of the hospital physicians. Furthermore, no predictive relationship between personal, professional and organizational characteristics and MWM knowledge, attitudes and practices was found. It is necessary to clarify the primary obstacles to physicians’ active involvement in MWM. These results may reveal the lack of appropriate policies, laws, supervision and defined responsibilities related to MWM for hospital staff.</p>
<p>One of limitation of the present study might be the small sample size and hence the small power of statistical tests and so larger studies by incorporating more participants and more hospital units is recommended, especially a country-based study similar to the present study is suggested.</p>

<title>Conclusions:</title>
<p>This study indicates that physicians’ personal, professional and organizational characteristics are not strongly related to their KAP scores concerning MWM. Although the physicians’ KAP scores were high, their actual practices in medical waste management were often unacceptable. Based on these results, the following recommendations are made.</p>
<list id="list1-0734242X12440478" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Hospitals should develop appropriate medical waste management protocols based on a participatory process.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Hospitals must design special programmes to oversee and monitor physicians’ medical waste management practices.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>These monitoring programmes should incorporate incentives for compliance and punishments for inadequate compliance.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The continuous preparation and distribution of educational materials for different groups of hospital staff, especially physicians, along with appropriate incentives, would help to improve medical waste management outcomes.</p></list-item>
