<abstract>
<p>The aim of this study was to identify factors that most influence the perception of sleep quality in postmenopausal women. We used the methodological strategy of the Collective Subject Discourse (CSD), which is based on a theoretical framework of social representations theory. We obtained the data by interviewing 22 postmenopausal Brazilian women who were experiencing insomnia. The women gave accounts of their difficulties with sleep; a variety of dimensions were identified within the data. The onset of sleep disorders might have occurred during childhood or in situations considered to be stressful, and were not necessarily associated with menopause. We found that hormonal alterations occurring during menopause, psychosocial factors, and sleep-breathing disorders triggered occasional sleep disturbances during this time of life. Participants were aware of the consequences of sleep deprivation. In addition, inadequate sleep hygiene habits figured prominently as determinants in the persistence of sleep disturbances.</p>

<body>
<p>Sleep is extremely relevant to the preservation of good health and strongly impacts quality of life during aging. A study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1049732311422050">Vigeta and Brêtas (2004)</xref> found that women experienced alterations in sleep following menopause. The postmenopausal period begins 1 year after the last menstrual bleeding and is a biological milestone regardless of whether menopause was natural or induced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1049732311422050">Organización Mundial de la Salud [OMS], 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>Insomnia is one of the most common symptoms reported by postmenopausal women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1049732311422050">Goberna, Francés, Paulí, Barluenga, &amp; Gascón, 2009</xref>). The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1049732311422050">American Psychiatric Association (2000)</xref> defined sleep disorder as the difficulty to initiate and/or maintain sleep during a period of at least 3 weeks. The main risk factor in women for the onset of insomnia is increased age. This is readily observable when considering the statistic that the prevalence of chronic insomnia in the general population is approximately 10% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1049732311422050">Leger, Guilleminault, Dreyfus, Delahaye, &amp; Paillard, 2000</xref>), whereas after menopause, that percentage soars and ranges from 28% to 63% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1049732311422050">Campos, Bittencourt, Haidar, Tufik, &amp; Baracat, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1049732311422050">Von Mühlen, Kritz-Silverstein, &amp; Barrett-Connor, 1995</xref>). We argue that the occurrence of postmenopausal sleep alterations observed in present day society extend beyond those expected as consequences of hormonal hypoestrogenism, inasmuch as one would expect insomnia related to hot flashes or nocturia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1049732311422050">Hsu, Chen, Jou, Na, &amp; Tsao, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>There is little difference in the signs and symptoms reported by perimenopausal and postmenopausal women. These symptoms might vary in intensity and/or frequency, and are characterized by a progressive shortage of estrogen. Nevertheless, during both periods, women undergo an aging process in which there is a gradual loss of estrogen receptors. The signs and symptoms are generally the result of chemical events that tend to promote hormonal homeostasis with increasing age and following menopause (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1049732311422050">Penteado, Fonseca, Bagnoli, Assis, &amp; Pinotti, 2003</xref>). The most frequent neuropsychiatric symptoms of menopause become intensified in women with insomnia, and include the following: irritability, anxiety, nervousness, depression, fatigue, loss of concentration, and memory difficulties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1049732311422050">Kafanelis, Kostanski, Komesaroff, &amp; Stojanovska, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1049732311422050">Soares &amp; Murray, 2006</xref>). Moreover, sleep disturbances in premenopausal women might become more aggravated in the postmenopausal period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1049732311422050">Owens &amp; Matthews, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>Demographic factors might explain the growing interest in themes related to menopause. The generation of women in their 50s, an age typified as a threshold in the cessation of ovarian function, is presently the highest on record (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1049732311422050">OMS, 1996</xref>). With the increase in life expectancy, women now survive long enough to experience alterations in their bodies that previous generations did not. During insomnia, the hormonal physiology of the hypothalamus<italic>–</italic>hypophysary axis is altered. These hormones perform critical functions as neurotransmitters and neuromodulators within the central nervous system. As a result, alterations in their chemistries result in modified hypothalamic function, which is often observable as abnormalities in the regulation of basal temperature, in respiratory and cardiovascular systems, and in extrahypothalamic functions, such as pain perception, mood, locomotor activity, sexual behavior, food and water intake, sleep, and other functions that are vital to survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1049732311422050">Coren, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1049732311422050">Longcope, Franz, Morello, Baker, &amp; Johnston, 1986</xref>). The physiology of the postmenopausal period and of the sleep/wake cycle are connected, highlighting the complexities of these processes. In one investigation, French researchers examined over 1,000 middle-aged women and demonstrated that sleep disturbances were associated with menopause. They also verified that reduced sleep efficiency was a result of vasomotor symptoms and nocturia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1049732311422050">Bliwise, 1993</xref>).</p>
<p>An epidemiological study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1049732311422050">Young, Rabago, Zgierska, Austin, and Finn (2003)</xref> assessed both quantitative and qualitative measures related to sleep among premenopausal, perimenopausal, and postmenopausal women. Polysomnographic measures revealed that menopause was not associated with a reduction in the quality of sleep. Nevertheless, in a subjective assessment, twice as many perimenopausal and postmenopausal women indicated a lack of satisfaction with their sleep than did their premenopausal counterparts. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1049732311422050">Kravitz et al. (2003)</xref> reported sleep difficulties in 38% of middle-aged women. Multivariate analysis demonstrated statistically significant correlations for menopause, ethnicity, health-related behavior, and education. Their research did not find aging to be associated with sleep difficulties.</p>
<p>In a study conducted among postmenopausal women presenting to an ambulatory clinic with climacterial symptoms, the prevalence of self-reported insomnia was 61%. However, when that same population underwent polysomnography, 83% were found to have objective insomnia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1049732311422050">Campos et al., 2005</xref>). In a Brazilian study, researchers examined the effects of climacterium on women and concluded that there was a worsening of sleep quality during the perimenopausal period in women who described themselves as unhealthy. The investigation also revealed that the study participants knew very little about basic rules of sleep hygiene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1049732311422050">Souza, Aldrighi, &amp; Lorenzi Filho, 2005</xref>). Therefore, we sought to identify the factors that most influence sleep quality among postmenopausal women by examining the perceptions of postmenopausal women with insomnia.</p>
<sec id="section1-1049732311422050" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>To achieve the goals established in this article, we used the Collective Subject Discourse (CSD) strategy, which was proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1049732311422050">Lefèvre, Lefèvre, and Teixeira (2000)</xref>. They based their studies on a theoretical framework of Social Representations Theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1049732311422050">Galam &amp; Moscovici, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1049732311422050">Spink, 1993</xref>). Social representations are a guide for action in social contexts, and are important for navigating social relationships. These representations reflect systems of preconceptions and include images and values that have their own cultural significance. Such representations survive regardless of individual experiences, and are transmitted from one generation to another in an unconscious manner. The perception of reality that is manifested in the representation is usually solidly grounded within the person who owns it and is the parameter by which the subject will relate to another’s representation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049732311422050">Moscovici, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>In this study, we considered sleep to be an active process that involves many complex physiological and behavioral mechanisms in the central nervous system. The temporal sleep pattern, the sleep/wake cycle, is characterized by alternating periods of sleep and wakefulness. In addition, there are sensory stimuli that accrue from sleep to consciousness. Given the complexity of sleep, we believe that a true understanding of sleep must include an understanding of the vigil. The first step in our study was to hear the narratives of postmenopausal women with insomnia as they discussed their feelings, ideas, and attitudes about the postmenopausal period. These interviews clarified the meaning that postmenopausal women attributed to the sleep disturbances that occurred during this period.</p>
<sec id="section2-1049732311422050">
<title>Design</title>
<p>In this study, we interviewed postmenopausal women with insomnia and asked them to give voice to and reflect on their experiences of menopause and insomnia. Through the uniqueness of their stories, we aimed to build and preserve their collective memory, thus producing a social imagination of the perceptions of sleep in postmenopause (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1049732311422050">Jodelet, 1989</xref>). More specifically, we used a semistructured interview that contained open- and closed-ended questions, which facilitated free dialogue between the researcher and the interviewee. This technique enhances the investigated object and offers numerous opportunities for the informant to experience both the freedom and spontaneity needed to enrich the study. We asked the participants to specifically address certain aspects of their lives related to their habits when preparing for sleep, their actual sleep, their daily routine in relation to sleep deprivation, the experience of waking up, and what it meant to them to be experiencing sleep difficulties during the postmenopausal period.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1049732311422050">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>The participants included 22 postmenopausal women who presented to an ambulatory clinic of climacteric in Sao Paulo, Brazil. Participants varied in age from 46 to 60 years, with a mean age of 54.5 years. Half of the participants had completed less than the eighth grade (50%), whereas the other half had completed high school or higher (50%). We did not collect socioeconomic data. The sample consisted of those with paid employment (<italic>n</italic> = 8), those without paid employment (<italic>n</italic> = 10), and those who were retired (<italic>n</italic> = 4). There was not much variation in the professions presented. Most of the participants said that they were day laborers, nursing assistants, kitchen assistants, and retired teachers. Of the sample, 65% were married, 2% were widowed, and 33% were separated, divorced, or never married. A total of 87% of the sample had children, whereas the remaining 13% did not.</p>
<p>Patients who had experienced amenorrhea for at least 1 year and reported sleep difficulties were eligible for the study. We conducted this study between August and December, 2005. After we informed them of the objectives of the study, the various stages of the project, and the confidentiality/anonymity of their information, participants agreed to enroll in the study. Subsequently, all participants provided written informed consent. We determined the number of participants while we collected the data. We based our choice on the arguments put forth by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1049732311422050">Thiollent (1987)</xref>, who indicated that the adoption of the interview technique in a qualitative investigation does not require sampling determination for the purpose of screening. However, this definition depends on the quality of the information collected at each testimonial. Moreover, we should not discontinue the interviews, because they continue to produce novel ideas that provide new perspectives for the investigation. Therefore, enrollment of new participants ceased only after outside researchers agreed that we had reached a saturation point (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1049732311422050">Bauer &amp; Aarts, 2000</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1049732311422050">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>A researcher conducted the individual interviews in a private room to ensure the comfort of each participant. We recruited participants in the waiting room of the climacteric clinic. The interviews lasted an average of 50 minutes. The recorded interview technique utilized the semistructured script that combined closed-ended and open-ended questions. Although we requested specific information from all participants, we allowed them to expand on the proposed theme without the interference of any predefined answers or the bias of preestablished conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1049732311422050">Triviños, 1992</xref>).</p>
<p>The questions that we asked of each participant were as follows: Have you noticed any difference in your sleep since menopause began? What is your routine like during the day and night? When did you start to notice that you had trouble sleeping? Do you know anybody else who has trouble with sleep? Was there a time when you thought your sleep was getting better? Do the difficulties in coping with poor sleep hamper your life? Do you notice the difference in your sleep on weekends or during vacations? Do you experience daytime sleepiness? Do you take medication that helps you to sleep?</p>
<p>During the transcription of the recordings, we assured confidentiality, and the outside researchers abided by the ethical principles that govern research. We transcribed the interviews and imported the responses to CSD computer software. We organized this qualitative data in four steps to better express the thought of the community, as articulated in the concept of CSD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1049732311422050">Lefèvre et al., 2000</xref>).</p>
<p>The first step consisted of copying the answers to Question 1 for the entire sample, and thus, we sequentially copied the entire contents of each answer for all respondents interviewed into the column for the key expressions of the instrument of discourse analysis. There were a total of 198 text responses. In the second step, we began reading the verbal material we collected using the text editor software and highlighted the key phrases in the texts that revealed the essence of the content on the topic. In the third step, we filled the second column with a linguistic expression that described in a more succinct manner the meaning of the key expressions, thus forming the central ideas. In the fourth step, after rereading the central ideas and key phrases, the software assisted us by writing out the key expressions for the various fragments that reflected significant responses of similar discursive content. This process occurred for the data, which reflected both shared and divergent ideas around a central idea, emitted by different people, the construction of 65 speeches between empirical categories of the collective subject.</p>
<p>The CSD program allows one to individualize certain themes that correspond to a given social representation. The collective discourse creates what we call ordinary knowledge and common sense in modern society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049732311422050">Moscovici, 2003</xref>). We focused on the reading of the speeches in conjunction with the representations of a given imagination for the analysis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1049732311422050">
<title>Analysis</title>
<p>At this point, the reading of the CSD no longer referred to the women as individuals, but rather of the collective ideas, perceptions, and feelings of postmenopausal women with insomnia. The use of comprehension by reading to capture a sense of the text is supported by explanatory procedures in the areas of gerontology, menopause, and sleep. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1049732311422050">Minayo (1998)</xref> led us to apprehend the interpretation of the meaning of the experience of sleep disorders in postmenopausal women. We identified two thematic axes during the course of the analysis. Thematic Axis 1 concerned the participants’ perceptions of the causes of their insomnia. We used <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1049732311422050">Spielman and Glovinsky’s (1991)</xref> model to evaluate the likelihood of insomnia. This model presents the interaction of predisposing (constitutional), precipitating, and perpetuating factors in the onset of insomnia.</p>
<p>In acute insomnia, precipitating factors, including everyday stressors such as losses, diseases, and environmental changes are the triggers for insomnia; whereas in chronic insomnia, the presence of a precipitating factor is less clear, because the precipitating factor might have occurred months or years before the assessment, and the patient might not consider it relevant. In this setting, the presence or continuation of perpetuating factors, including acquired fear of sleep, misconceptions about the habits that would be healthier with regard to sleep, in addition to the existence of a predisposing constitutional factor such as genetics, might explain the persistence of insomnia after an initial episode (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1049732311422050">Stepanski, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Based on the interviews from our sample, several patterns emerged within the data, including alterations in natural sleep patterns, impact of the perimenopausal/postmenopausal periods, confounding factors, perceived etiologies of sleep disturbances (obstructive sleep disorders), and inappropriate sleep hygiene. We related thematic Axis 2 to the participants’ knowledge concerning the consequences of sleep deprivation. Each of these axes is described in detail below.</p>

<title>Perception of the Causes of Insomnia in Postmenopausal Women</title>
<sec id="section8-1049732311422050">
<title>Alterations in natural sleep patterns</title>
<p>Even with a well-structured daily routine and regular bedtime hours, some women reported having sleep patterns that were adversely modified. They often reported fragmentation of sleep, i.e., difficulty in maintaining sleep, or awakening at excessively early hours:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>My bedtime is between 10:00 and 11:00 p.m. It’s the same thing every day. . . . I lie in bed, and there are times I sleep well and there are others I don’t. It has gotten worse from four years ago until now. I lie and sleep, but I sleep in batches of three to four hours, and that kind of interrupted sleep goes on for weeks.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Negative consequences of a poor night’s sleep manifested in the form of sleepiness and fatigue, demonstrating an impact on the state of alertness for the subsequent day:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The day after I have a poor night’s sleep I can’t work right. I do the cleaning, I sweep, but I can’t do these things without stopping to rest a bit. I feel drowsy. It feels as if I am tired.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>We should note, however, that there were women who remained in high spirits even though they were not able to sleep well:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I can’t sleep, and so, I wait for the day to come. During the day, I do the laundry, I do the cleaning, and I have a normal day. I don’t even sleep during the day or while watching TV [television].</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Ontological alteration descriptions address the fact that an aging individual typically presents with alterations in the rhythm and quantity of sleep. In our study, there were comments from participants that led us to consider that the basic chronotype present within a population (morning, night, and indifferent) could impact individual differences in the preference for bedtime and awakening hours. The amount of time required for restorative sleep among these participants ranged from 6 to 10 hours, with 8 hours being the average. Some women required only 6 hours to feel rested (small sleepers), whereas others required 10 hours (big sleepers):</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I always had the need to sleep eight to ten hours a night. When I was a child, I would get spanked because of my drowsiness; I just couldn’t get up. My siblings and I would spend time talking at night, and I wouldn’t sleep enough, and I would go to school feeling tired.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>During the interviews, the women reported napping, the habit of sleeping for a short period in the afternoon, with some women indicating that they required a nap to improve their performance during the remainder of the day: “I wake up really early, so after lunch time I bend over the machine and nap for five minutes. It seems as if I slept for two hours, and I am no longer sleepy.” This was in contrast with comments from other participants, who believed that napping disturbed the subsequent night’s sleep.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1049732311422050">
<title>Impact of the perimenopausal/postmenopausal period</title>
<p>Some of the women acknowledged the presence of insomnia since childhood, but noted that these episodes were accentuated in their perimenopausal period. For others, the perimenopausal period was the first time that they noticed alterations in their sleep. None of the postmenopausal women with insomnia who took part in this investigation knew precisely when they had entered menopause. Still, many reported the presence of vasomotor symptoms, such as hot flashes and nocturnal perspiration. These are the most prevailing symptoms that trigger awakening among women in the perimenopausal phase and during the menopausal period:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I feel at ease, but when that horrible hot flash comes, I feel like taking all my clothes off. It is a very bad feeling that lasts all night long. I put my clothes on; I take them off, and it really keeps me up. My sleep is chopped into pieces.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Another typical symptom of perimenopause and postmenopause that was mentioned in the interviews as disturbing sleep was nocturia, or the need to awaken to empty the bladder during the night.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1049732311422050">
<title>Confounding factors</title>
<p>Precocious awakening was identified within the interview data as a confounding factor influencing the ability of the participants to maintain sleep. Participants reported waking up too early, generally at 3:00 a.m. or 5:00 a.m., and taking too long to fall back asleep. This pattern often led the participants to make the decision to get out of bed. For some, precocious awakening might be a symptom of depression rather than insomnia. Participants identified another factor that disturbed their sleep: pain. The following comment describes the presence of a headache:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I sleep and wake up several times because of the headache. I have to take a pain killer or topical medicine on the forehead or apply some potato slices, or I may cover my head to see if the pain eases.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1049732311422050">
<title>Perceived etiologies of sleep disturbances</title>
<p>Participants identified several issues that they perceived to be etiological factors for their sleep disturbances. They identified the following causes of sleep disturbances: physiologic changes, grief, and inappropriate sleeping conditions characterized by uncomfortable temperature, the presence of light, noise, or other environmental disturbances. In addition, we considered social commitments, physical activity at inappropriate times, and the stressors associated with modern life etiologic or related factors to sleep pattern disturbances, including variation in bedtime hours and the inadequate manifestation of natural sleep architecture. Participants also indicated that sleep disturbances were related to other physiologic conditions, such as psychiatric and cardiovascular diseases. Participants also identified grief related to the loss of a loved one, or to other losses such as the need for hysterectomy or divorce, as a precipitating factor for subsequent sleep alterations:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I underwent a hysterectomy; you know I had my womb removed, and I regret it so much I can’t sleep.</p>
<p>It took me ages to schedule this appointment because I am 99.9% sure why I can’t sleep. It is because I used to be able to sleep but I lost my youngest brother 6 years ago, and he was the person I most loved in this world.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>According to the interview data, the women associated sleeping in an environment that had light or noise with difficulties in progressing into deeper stages of sleep. The participants reported their perceptions of light and sound, and how such factors acted as stimulants to awaken them from sleep:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>If I awaken, I try keeping my eyes shut. If I open my eyes, then I have to get up. Right now, even in this silence, if a dog walks by, I’ll awaken to the noise of the dog walking past. I am always on the alert.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>One woman expressed doubt as to whether insomnia could be a causal factor for psychiatric disturbances:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I thought it was normal. That’s because there are times I can’t sleep. But there was a time when I would take psychiatric medication on account of this problem I had, and I spent three days without any shuteye [sleep].</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>We also encountered a clear perception that poor sleep was associated with cardiovascular disease, which might lead to death:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I think my brother, who passed away previously, had a heart attack. They don’t say so, but he had sleep problems. Some time ago, my brother and I went to the countryside and we slept in the same room. I could see he would move around a lot. I think it had to do with hypertension. My brother was hypertensive all his life. It was after I became hypertensive that I started to have insomnia, and that was at the same time menopause happened.</p>

<title>Obstructive sleep disorders</title>
<p>Some of the participants described direct disturbances of sleep, such as snoring, which most often had been triggered by the obstruction of airways or by pathologies affecting the thyroid. Snoring appeared to be the primary culprit in disturbing the sleep of a roommate, and was the primary reason for seeking medical help: “I myself have noticed that no sooner do I fall asleep [than] I start snoring, and I am awakened by my own snoring. My husband fears I might die in my sleep one of these days.” The participants also reported symptoms considered to be secondary to obstructive sleep apnea/hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS), including mood swings and irritation: “The interruption of sleep by snoring isn’t much, really. It is the state of mind that really matters. I’ve been unstable, you know. I didn’t use to be like this. Anything irritates me nowadays.”</p>

<title>Inappropriate sleep hygiene</title>
<p>We identified situations in which women who were considered to be insomniacs spent excessive time in bed trying to sleep, without success. These individuals ended up using the bed for other purposes, such as watching television, reading, eating, and so forth: “I stay at work until midnight or one o’clock, depending on what I have to do. I don’t go straight to sleep. It is at this time that I watch some series on TV. I like to watch films.” Participants also included reports of the consumption of psychoactive drugs (stimulants), such as cigarettes and coffee, which contain substances known to interfere with the quality of sleep (i.e., nicotine and caffeine, respectively):</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>And the next thing I know it is either midnight or two o’clock. I turn to the side and I think to myself, “I’ll get up to prepare coffee.” You can take my food away from me, but not coffee. And my coffee is kind of like a drunkard’s coffee; really strong, without sugar, and I sit there, waiting for the day to dawn. I turn on the TV and smoke.</p>

<title>Knowledge of Postmenopausal Women With Insomnia Regarding the Consequences of Sleep Deprivation</title>
<p>Women in this study recognized that having poor or inadequate sleep produces disturbances that are apparent the very next day. These symptoms included forms of fatigue, shadows under the eyes, feeling sick, and somnolence. However, when poor or inadequate sleep continues over a series of nights, participants also reported easy fatigability, irritability, anxiety, and phobias. These symptoms result from the impairment of concentration and difficulties with the maintenance of attention and retention of memory. Moreover, such consequences sometimes led to accidents within the household or at work:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>If I don’t get a good night’s sleep, I am not well in the head the next day. It affects my memory, and I become slower. You lose your wits. And I’ve noticed that lack of sleep affects learning. If there is something cooking on the fire, I sometimes forget about it, even if I am in the kitchen.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Participants reported that the shortage of sleep they endured on a daily basis made them feel the need for sleep replenishment at some other time:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>On the night after two sleepless nights, I get to have some of this sleep that seems to be sleep caused by a tranquilizer of some sort. So, I keep the TV on because if there is no movement, I start getting sleepy. And when I am serving a client, I get distracted. I can’t think. It’s horrible.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>During this research, we encountered reports by women who had faced sleep difficulties since childhood, and in some cases had been experiencing insomnia, regardless of external factors. However, it was only during their postmenopausal life stage that the aggravation of their condition prompted them to seek medical assistance. For other women, it was during postmenopause that they first noticed they had some form of sleep pattern disturbance. They did not give much thought to their condition until the consequences of sleep deprivation were recognized, especially the impairment of concentration and memory retention; it was only then that these women chose to seek medical help.</p>
<p>We adopted the model by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1049732311422050">Spielman and Glovinsky (1991)</xref> that organized the perceptions of postmenopausal sleep difficulties. The model indicated that precipitating factors were the first theme the discourse of the participants exposed. This finding was perhaps a result of their “common sense” understanding that stressful situations triggered insomnia. Participants reported pathologies, such as metabolic syndromes (represented by abdominal obesity, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and resistance to insulin), an increased tendency to develop OSAHS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1049732311422050">Sawyer, Deatrick, Kuna, &amp; Weaver, 2010</xref>), chronic disease comorbidities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1049732311422050">Hachul et al., 2009</xref>), persistent nocturia, and the onset of various psychiatric conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1049732311422050">Dennerstein &amp; Soares, 2008</xref>); these disorders contribute to sleep alterations. Although participants mentioned predisposing and perpetuating factors in their interviews, they did not always identify them as disturbing agents that interfered with their sleep. We saw examples of this when the women discussed their habits or their strategies in coping with the daily ordeal of falling asleep, which included watching television, smoking cigarettes, drinking coffee, ingesting hypnotics, and taking daytime naps. All of these behaviors are contrary to good sleep hygiene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049732311422050">Cheek, Shaver, &amp; Lentz, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1049732311422050">Sin, Ho, &amp; Chung, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The sleep/wake cycle is a powerful synchronizer of the biological rhythms in the human species, as well as in other species that possess some photosensitive pigmentation. Hence, alterations in photo stimuli are capable of promoting modifications in the expression of biological rhythms. In addition to a photo stimulus, other stimuli, such as social/cultural factors, are also capable of modifying the expression of biological rhythms and are called nonphoto synchronizers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1049732311422050">Martinez, Lenz, &amp; Menna-Barreto, 2008</xref>). In the interviews we identified accounts of grief, divorce, betrayal, retirement, the role of being caretakers of grandchildren, and other such factors; these life events might have contributed to the disorganization or modification of daily sleeping habits. As a consequence, such women might lose their diurnal time reference, which has profound effects on the sleep/wake cycle.</p>
<p>Menopause is, within the normal course of life, a time when a woman must cope with a series of losses. The women, in their interviews, revealed experiences of loss surrounding reproductive capacity, youthful appearance, and sexuality. In addition, there was the recognition of the participants’ sense of their own mortality, because menopause was seen as a reminder that one was changing, aging, or dying. We viewed the difficulty in maintaining sleep during menopause as an effect secondary to vasomotor symptoms.</p>
<p>Specialists are still researching the cause and effect relationship between hot flashes and sleep disturbances through the use of polysomnography exams; nevertheless, not all hot flashes are associated with awakenings. In a study conducted in Sweden, 9% of 72-year-old women still reported hot flashes; there were no complaints of sleep disturbances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1049732311422050">Landis &amp; Moe, 2004</xref>). Such findings suggest that other factors are linked to sleep disturbances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1049732311422050">Santoro et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>In the absence of time references, sleep physiology is hampered. This results in the modification to and a possible loss of the daily structure that upholds rhythms underlying normal biological behavior. One such example is the accentuation of fragmented sleep. Fragmentation is manifested by the difficulty in maintaining sleep, which was a frequent complaint expressed in the interviews of the women, and might engender undesirable consequences that are detrimental to sleep and quality of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1049732311422050">Krieger, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1049732311422050">Martinez et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1049732311422050">Ohayon et al., 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>The participants in this study often reported being awakened by nocturnal perspiration and had trouble falling back asleep. This reality resulted in a deterioration of their sleep quality. Researchers investigating this topic have reported that nocturnal hot flashes lead to chronically altered sleep, thereby causing irritability and anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1049732311422050">Steiner, Dunn, &amp; Born, 2003</xref>). The women also described nocturia as a typical symptom of menopause causing disruption of sleep. Such sleep fragmentation results in the loss of a segment of total sleep time.</p>
<p>There is also a loss of deep, restoring sleep, known as slow wave sleep, as it might take up to half an hour to resume this sleep stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1049732311422050">Coren, 1996</xref>). Consequently, sleep fragmentation might lead to daytime somnolence as a form of completing the total sleep time that was not achieved during the previous night. In the literature, there is no clear distinction between daytime somnolence and daytime fatigue, and it uses these expressions with similar meanings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1049732311422050">Dolan &amp; Rosenthal, 2007</xref>). Yet another disruption in the evolutionary biology of sleep is the loss of napping, which is a form of sleep that impacts the chronobiologic system of the sleep/wake cycle. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049732311422050">Carskadon and Dement (2011)</xref> suggested that napping was a vital function that acts as a synchronizer of the circadian rhythm. During napping there is an alteration in body temperature, which indicates that it plays a role in regulating the biological clock of humans. The participants in the current investigation were not able to delineate any link between napping and daytime somnolence. Napping, when regular, was not detrimental to night sleep, except for those with insomnia. Those participants did not enjoy regular sleep throughout the week, and resorted to irregular naps on the weekends, which were of little help to their overall sleep.</p>
<p>Notably, despite the theoretical understanding that menopause is a period when organic and functional alterations occur, we should not attribute all unexplained symptoms in middle-aged women to it. In our study, we found women to be ignorant about the biology of sleep processes, including the alternating states of alertness leading to sleep and vice versa, as well as the ontological evolution of sleep in human life. We identified women who held the belief that the removal of the womb was the root of their insomnia. They were not aware that the cessation of menstrual bleeding is not necessarily linked to menopause, and that menopause only occurs when there is altered ovarian function as part of the aging process, or if both ovaries are surgically removed.</p>
<p>The interviews within this study revealed that there were unquestionably positive things about modern life that benefit women; however, it is often difficult to cope with the complexities of present day life. Consequently, there has been an increase in the prevalence of social and cultural disorders, which have arisen from a lifestyle that has not been tested by time, and might not necessarily be beneficial to the well-being of the individual. The women described these so-called “civilization diseases” in a variety of themes: violence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1049732311422050">Oliveira et al., 2005</xref>), stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1049732311422050">Landis &amp; Moe, 2004</xref>), the growing abuse of drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1049732311422050">Coren, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1049732311422050">Herculano-Houzel, 2003</xref>), depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1049732311422050">Dennerstein &amp; Soares, 2008</xref>), iatrogenic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1049732311422050">Ohayon, Caulet, Priest, &amp; Guilleminault, 1997</xref>), and other conditions that were the cause or related to the development of the patients’ insomnia.</p>
<p>Historically, when one considers the objectives of human maturation, the social attributes of advanced age were expected to be desirable, as in the case of adolescent girls wishing to be mature women. However, the inverse took place in aging women, as the attributes of the young became preferable to those of maturity. In Western culture, postmenopausal women are depicted as being in a phase in which youth, vitality, sexuality, and appeal might be maintained by means of physical exercise, healthy eating habits, weight control, the avoidance of smoking and drinking, and good sleep. Recent studies in women of different ethnicities, including those from Japan and Korea, reported significant rates of middle-aged women with sleep disorders. However, the factors that might have triggered those alterations were not fully explored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1049732311422050">Shin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1049732311422050">Smith-Dijulio, Windsor, &amp; Anderson, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Sleep is a biological manifestation, and as such possesses its own evolutionary history. Unfortunately, behavior and other psychosocial functional processes do not leave fossilized traces that allow for their recovery and objective examination. This lack of material evidence poses great difficulties in the investigation of sleep, and limits the phylogenetic investigation of sleep by only allowing comparisons to other animal species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1049732311422050">Campbell &amp; Tobler, 1984</xref>). Various researchers making use of sleep-deprived animal subjects for the purpose of examining sleep stages have demonstrated that lack of sleep might be detrimental to health and might ultimately lead to death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1049732311422050">Palma, Gabriel, Calugnati, &amp; Tufik, 2006</xref>). Hence, evolution has created mechanisms that protect sleep. However, we now know that insomnia is linked to cognitive damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1049732311422050">Moraes et al., 2006</xref>) and to a heightened risk of several physical and mental disorders—particularly depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1049732311422050">Hachul et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1049732311422050">Vigeta, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Sleep is necessary for maintaining mental contact with society. The experience of sleep deprivation and being in menopause results in alterations in communication skills, which are expressed as mood shifts and increased irritability. As we observed from these interviews, many of the postmenopausal symptoms were identical to those that prevented women from achieving restorative sleep. These individuals suffered from symptoms that include mood alterations and irritability; simultaneously, they had to deal with the reality that to admit to tiredness or somnolence is viewed by our society as a sign of weakness, laziness, or lack of drive. Thus, this is the image a mature woman has when she approaches advanced age. Insomnia and somnolence are complaints health professionals and postmenopausal women themselves most often neglected, because they believed that their difficulties with sleep were normal or temporary. We should investigate and treat such symptoms.</p>
<p>There is great need for education concerning sleep hygiene among health organizations throughout the community. Such education, in addition to advocating healthy habits, should instill a greater understanding of matters related to sleep, including the preparation of an appropriate setting that enables one to achieve restorative sleep. Hence, we emphasize the importance of addressing appropriate attention to the sleep of postmenopausal women, as to any alteration in their sleep at this period of their lives, even if it is subjective perception. We should view it as a potential health problem that we should not consider “the norm” for this age group.</p>
