<p>Children’s clothes are an appropriate topic for examining maternal consumption, as they are among the first items provided for infants and must be frequently replaced to accommodate growth, requiring repeated consumption decisions.

<p>As Dan Cook has noted, the disjuncture between theories of consumption and the historiography of childhood is a major problem, with the origins of contemporary practices largely unexamined. Thus there is scope for examining maternal consumption in the past in order to illuminate parallels and disjunctures with contemporary practices and issues around maternal consumption. This article examines the role of mothers in providing children’s clothing in Britain from 1890–1914, in a society that was both fixated on consumption as a sign of social status and increasingly concerned about correct methods of mothering. It is framed by a review of some of the main themes and anxieties raised by contemporary studies of maternal consumption. It then examines 19th-century texts addressed to mothers to establish how maternal provision of clothing was conceptualized. These reveal a divergence between the promotion of the pleasures of consumption in dressmaking magazines such as <italic>Letts’s Illustrated Household Magazine, Madame Schild’s Shilling Dress Patterns</italic> and <italic>Myra’s Mid-Monthly Journal and Children’s Fashions</italic> and the counsels of restraint in childrearing manuals and wardrobe management guides. Texts addressing the needs of working-class families, such as school textbooks, linked clothing consumption with improving child health and rationalizing scarce resources of time and money. The extent to which consumption practices reflected these competing sources of advice is evaluated through an analysis of school group photographs. A case study of the pinafores commonly worn by young schoolgirls draws out the ways in which this garment embodied social meanings. This leads to reflections on the relevance of these findings for contemporary investigations of maternal consumption.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1469540513480164"><title>Rationale</title>
<p>Children’s clothes are an appropriate topic for examining maternal consumption, as they are among the first items provided for infants and must be frequently replaced to accommodate growth, requiring repeated consumption decisions. Moreover clothing has communicative functions, with specific styles and colours used to signal the gender of preverbal infants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1469540513480164">Paoletti, 2012)</xref>, and to define older children’s gendered identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1469540513480164">Ruble et al., 2008</xref>). For contemporary mothers, decisions about clothing may act as a way of defining their parenting practice both to their children and to adult peers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1469540513480164">Clarke, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1469540513480164">Brusdal 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1469540513480164">Pugh, 2009</xref>). These decisions may be challenged by the child wearers, as examined in recent studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1469540513480164">Clarke, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1469540513480164">Chin, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1469540513480164">Clarke, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1469540513480164">Boden et al., 2004</xref>). The role of mothers as arbiters of consumption practices has been heightened by the characterization of retailers and advertisers as corrupters of childhood innocence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1469540513480164">Taylor, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1469540513480164">Cook, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1469540513480164">Paul, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1469540513480164">Cook (2008)</xref> has noted, the disjuncture between theories of consumption and the historiography of childhood is a major problem. This is exacerbated by the under-theorized nature of histories of the material culture of childhood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1469540513480164">Cook, 2011</xref>). Some historical surveys of children’s clothes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1469540513480164">Ewing, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1469540513480164">Rose, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1469540513480164">Buck, 1996</xref>) have touched on parental attitudes to consumption, but over a broad period. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1469540513480164">Calvert (1992)</xref> established changes in the conceptualization of parental consumption in the late 18th century, but did not look at clothing in detail. A study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1469540513480164">Honeyman (2011)</xref> of the development of mass-produced boys’ clothing in Britain discussed retailing practices, but not consumption. The current author has identified changes in British consumption practices between 1870 and 1900 as mass-production made boys’ clothing cheaper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1469540513480164">Rose, 2010</xref>). Dan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1469540513480164">Cook’s important study (2004)</xref> examined changes in the marketing of children’s clothing in early and mid-20th-century America, uncovering retailers’ initiatives to develop consumer consciousness. The key shift from adults as arbiters of clothing even for wage-earning adolescents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1469540513480164">Ross, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1469540513480164">Ugolini, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1469540513480164">Rose, 2010</xref>) to children claiming the right to select clothes paid for by adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1469540513480164">Boden et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1469540513480164">Brusdal, 2007</xref>) seems to have started in the USA in the 1950s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1469540513480164">Margerum, 1999</xref>), but its precise chronology remains unclear.</p>
<p>Thus there is scope for examining maternal consumption in the past in order to illuminate parallels and disjunctures with the contemporary practices and issues identified by Pugh, Clarke and Taylor. This article will examine the role of mothers in providing children’s clothing in Britain from 1890 to 1914, in a society that was both fixated on consumption as a sign of social status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1469540513480164">Veblen, 1912</xref>) and increasingly concerned about correct methods of mothering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1469540513480164">Davin 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1469540513480164">Cunningham 1991</xref>). It will be framed by a review of some of the main themes and anxieties raised by contemporary studies of maternal consumption. It will then examine 19th-century texts addressed to middle-class mothers to establish how maternal provision of clothing was conceptualized. These reveal a divergence between the promotion of the pleasures of consumption in dressmaking magazines such as <italic>Letts’s Illustrated Household Magazine</italic>,<italic> Madame Schild’s Shilling Dress Patterns</italic> and <italic>Myra’s Mid-Monthly Journal and Children’s Fashions</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1469540513480164">Beetham, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1469540513480164">Breward, 1999</xref>) and the counsels of restraint in childrearing manuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1469540513480164">Cassell, 1869</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1469540513480164">Beeton, 1884</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1469540513480164">Panton, 1888</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1469540513480164">1896</xref>) and wardrobe management guides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1469540513480164">Cook, 1873</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1469540513480164">de Barras, 1896</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1469540513480164">Taylor, 1899</xref>).</p>
<p>As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1469540513480164">Bates (1997)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1469540513480164">Helvenston (1981)</xref> have warned, advice literature should not be accepted unquestioningly as evidence of practice. This is particularly true when dealing with school needlework textbooks and educational policy documents, which made extravagant claims for the importance of home sewing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1469540513480164">Jones, 1884</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1469540513480164">Turnbull, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1469540513480164">Richmond, 2011</xref>). They drew on an ethos of self-sacrificing motherhood that can also be found in some autobiographies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1469540513480164">Haw, 1909</xref>). Home sewing was also promoted by the Rational Dress Society (founded 1882), as a way of bypassing over-consumption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1469540513480164">Cunningham, 2003</xref>). After 1910 there were attempts to pass on ‘reform’ principles through the needlework teaching in state schools, for the benefit of working-class families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1469540513480164">Swanson and Macbeth, 1913</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1469540513480164">Synge, 1913</xref>). The over-determination of maternal consumption is reflected in autobiographies covering this time, which reveal children’s understanding of the ways that clothing created social meanings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1469540513480164">Willis, 1960</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1469540513480164">Shears, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1469540513480164">Pritchett, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1469540513480164">Raverat, 1980[1952]</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1469540513480164">Rolph, 1980</xref>). A case study of the pinafores commonly worn by young schoolgirls will compare the different views presented in books and in autobiographies with the evidence contained in a sample of school photographs. This will allow an evaluation of which of the findings from contemporary investigations of maternal consumption are contingent on particular social settings, and which may have general validity.</p>

<sec id="sec2-1469540513480164"><title>Theorizing maternal consumption</title>
<p>In a recent paper Dan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1469540513480164">Cook (2008)</xref> addressed the presence – or rather absence – of children in consumption theory. He rightly identified the role of the mother in determining both the practices and the meanings of consumption, a role that is sometimes ignored by studies that focus on the agency of children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1469540513480164">Cook, 2008</xref>: 231). He sees this problem as deriving from the tendency of sociologists to model their theoretical consumer on <italic>homo economicus</italic>, a single male who is able to act autonomously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1469540513480164">Cook, 2008</xref>: 228). This model can also be seen in the work of some historians, notwithstanding the work of Ellen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1469540513480164">Ross (1993)</xref> on familial consumption practices. The meanings of consumption in contemporary families have been a major theme in the anthropology of Daniel Miller and Alison Clarke (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1469540513480164">Miller, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1469540513480164">2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1469540513480164">Clarke, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1469540513480164">2004</xref>). Clarke’s work is particularly relevant to this study, as she examines clothes shopping by mothers on behalf of children. Her studies demonstrate the ways in which clothing consumption is seen as defining the mother’s efficacy, both in the act itself and as the garments are worn. They build on the work of Colin Campbell, who has identified a gap between the intended meanings of acts of consumption and the actuality, when consumers are limited by a lack of resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1469540513480164">Campbell, 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>One of the prevailing problems that Cook identifies in studies of consumption is the assumption that consumption is an activity directed by commercial forces and thus dangerous to children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1469540513480164">Cook, 2008</xref>: 231). This view has been related by Janelle Taylor to a characterization of consumption as intrinsically unproductive and even wasteful (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1469540513480164">Taylor, 2004</xref>: 11). Instead, the studies collected by Taylor in <italic>Consuming Motherhood</italic> argue cogently for the centrality of consumption to the creation and maintenance of social identities and affective relationships. Taylor follows Campbell in noting the meaningfulness of consumption to those who are excluded from it through lack of means and ‘seek through consumption not merely to secure the minimum necessary to maintain life but also to act meaningfully in the world and to create valued identities and social relations, for themselves and their children’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1469540513480164">Taylor, 2004: 7</xref>). Taylor also notes the tendency of policymakers to critique the consumption practices of the poor as both an irrational use of resources, and a way of perpetuating poverty. This critique can be found in historic sources going back a century or more, as will be discussed below.</p>
<p>Another key theme in contemporary ethnographies of consumption is the way in which consumption practices both shape and are shaped by familial and peer group relationships. Elizabeth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1469540513480164">Chin (2001)</xref>, in a study of impoverished African-American households, identified a complex balancing of the desire of children for peer group recognition, and the limited resources of parents. A detailed study of both high- and low-income families by Allison Pugh identified a range of different consumption strategies that were used to articulate families’ social positions. She found that low-income families often practised ‘symbolic indulgence’, purchasing key items to give their child status in the ‘economy of dignity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1469540513480164">Pugh, 2009: 217</xref>–222). Conversely, high-income families practised ‘symbolic deprivation’, restricting consumption in order to differentiate themselves from less-enlightened consumers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1469540513480164">Pugh, 2009: 85</xref>). Thus consumption practices could be used as strategies both of inclusion and exclusion; in either case parents’ interpretation of the ‘correct’ forms of consumption was open to challenge by their children, who had a heightened understanding of the value of goods in the local ‘economy of dignity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1469540513480164">Pugh, 2009</xref>: 222). These practices are not new, and are evident in some of the historic case studies discussed below.</p>
<p>Other contemporary studies have examined parental provision of clothing as a way of defining adults’ group identity and values, leading to complex negotiations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1469540513480164">Brusdal, 2007</xref>). These may be played out within a nuclear family, or across a wider group, as in the study of Dublin kin by Peter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1469540513480164">Corrigan (1989)</xref>. Alison Clarke has looked in detail at clothing consumption by a sample of London mothers who were cash-poor but highly educated and self-defined as middle-class (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1469540513480164">Clarke, 2000: 86</xref>). She focused on the ways that consumption was used to articulate relationships between peers (mothers) rather than between generations. This sometimes led to conflicts between the child’s desires and the mother’s self-identified principles and aesthetic judgements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1469540513480164">Clarke, 2000: 88</xref>).</p>
<p>What are the common findings in between these research projects, and how might they be explored in past societies? One point of agreement between Chin and Clarke was the extent to which mothers saw themselves as the arbiters of children’s clothing consumption, even when (as in some of Chin’s families) they were not actually able to provide garments. Consumption decisions acted as demonstrations of the mother’s knowledge of what was both suited to and affordable for their child; not all that was suitable was affordable, and not all that was affordable was suitable. Both studies acknowledged the importance of gifts of clothing and other goods in consolidating relationships. The power relations implicit in gift giving have been highlighted by Corrigan, whose adolescent subjects marked their maturity by rejecting gifts of clothing from older relatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1469540513480164">Corrigan, 1989: 529–530</xref>). These are all themes that I have identified in historic texts.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-1469540513480164"><title>The meanings of maternal consumption in late 19th-century Britain</title>
<p>In late 19th-century Britain, the provision of children’s clothing was characterized as one of the key duties of mothers, with minimal input from children themselves. This was particularly noticeable in working-class families, where mothers controlled the clothing purchases of all children, even wage-earning adolescents living at home (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1469540513480164">Ross, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1469540513480164">Ugolini, 2007</xref>). This level of control was partly prompted by the economic constraints of families living near the poverty level. But it also reflected a wish for the child to be dressed in ways that would enhance the reputation of the family. Nineteenth-century authority figures such as teachers and charity workers tended to conflate the state of a child’s clothing and the state of his morals; this link was embodied in the name of the ‘Ragged Schools’ that taught children too unruly for other institutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1469540513480164">Rose, 2010</xref>: 40–4). Neat and clean clothes were seen as not only good in themselves, but as indicative of a readiness for self-improvement: ‘the self-respect begotten of tidy clothes will find soap, a fireside, and an account at a penny bank’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1469540513480164">Jones, 1884: 96</xref>). During a 1904 inquiry into Physical Deterioration, state-funded Board Schools were characterized both as a means of observing the practices of poor families, and as a vehicle for improving them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1469540513480164">Cunningham, 1991</xref>: 193). The benefits of state educational provision were gauged by the fact that:<disp-quote>
<p>Collars and ties are now almost as common as rags were a few years ago; the bare-footed ragamuffin of popular imagination figures still as the frontispiece to well-meaning philanthropic appeals, but is no longer a common object of the streets … the civilising influence of the Board School has made him the exception instead of the rule. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1469540513480164">Urwick, 1904: xi</xref>)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Thus for poor families, failure to dress their children appropriately might mark them as ‘uncivilized’ and in need of guidance from philanthropists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1469540513480164">Rose, 2010</xref>: 52–4).</p>
<p>For comfortably-off families, children’s clothing was no less important an indicator of domestic values. As <italic>Cassell’s Book of the Household</italic> warned in 1889, ‘Teachers, as well as schoolfellows, form their impression of a child’s home and belongings from his appearance, dress and manners’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1469540513480164">Cassell, 1889</xref>: 112). There was also recognition of the pleasure of dressing children: ‘as every mother is desirous that her little ones should be seen at their best, it will be her pride and pleasure to exercise her taste and judgement in this direction’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1469540513480164">Ollif, 1884</xref>: 150). In advice manuals it was the mother, rather than the retailer or garment designer, who was responsible for the garments appropriate to the gender, age, social status, and physique of her child. This stance was maintained even in documents produced by retailers, where the role of the consumer was limited to choosing between ready-made items. The booklet <italic>The Boy and How to Suit Him</italic>, produced by the commercial printer Richard Taylor for distribution by clothing retailers, characterized the mother as motivated by a wish ‘to see her boy look as well as, or if possible better than, his companions’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1469540513480164">Taylor, 1899</xref>: 3). At the same time, female consumers needed guidance as to which of the styles available were most suitable for different stages of children’s development, as ‘however good-looking a boy may be, if he be improperly or carelessly dressed he suffers in appearance’(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1469540513480164">Taylor, 1899</xref>: 4).</p>
<p>From the 1880s onwards, there was a further consideration when dressing children, that of health promotion. Earlier, this had been constituted through a variety of practices, from ‘hardening’ the child’s body by exposure to protecting it with layers of wool underwear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1469540513480164">Ewing, 1977: 42, 103</xref>). However, the foundation of the British Rational Dress Society (RDS) in 1882 codified ideas of healthy or ‘reformed’ clothing for children as loose-fitting and avoiding the extremes of fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1469540513480164">Cunningham, 2003</xref>). Discussions of ‘reformed’ dress were first aired in publications by and for members of the RDS, but also appeared in mass-market women’s magazines. In 1884 the dressmaking columnist for <italic>Letts’s Illustrated Household Magazine</italic> stated that ‘one of the most vital and serious subjects at present occupying not only the matronly but the public mind, is the proper and healthy way of dressing children’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1469540513480164">Ollif, 1884</xref>: 206).</p>
<p>In the 1890s, Glasgow School of Art pioneered a radical new approach to needlework that fused concerns for healthy dress practices with Froebel’s ideas about education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1469540513480164">Turnbull, 1987: 89</xref>). This department had an important role in training needlework teachers for Scottish state schools, and its ideas were spread further by a teaching manual which included ideas for older girls’ garments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1469540513480164">Swanson and Macbeth, 1913</xref>). This was followed by handbooks for mothers who wished to make children’s and infants’ clothing on ‘reformed’ principles by Margaret Synge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1469540513480164">Synge, 1913</xref>; 1917). The links between these new styles of clothing and new child-centred educational practices were made clear in introductions by the educationalists Margaret Macmillan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1469540513480164">Swanson and Macbeth, 1913</xref>) and Maria Montessori (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1469540513480164">Synge, 1913</xref>). These texts were based on the twin assumptions that the correct kind of clothing would make children ‘more free and healthy’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1469540513480164">Synge, 1913: xii</xref>) and that middle-class educationalists were uniquely qualified to advise working-class mothers: ‘The more enlightened parents are already beginning to adopt a more sanitary style of clothing for their children. But the poorer parents depend on philanthropy, and here philanthropy fails them’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1469540513480164">Synge, 1913: xii</xref>).</p>

<sec id="sec4-1469540513480164"><title>Motherhood and the handmade</title>
<p>The assumption that healthy ‘reformed’ clothes for children would be made by their mothers reflected the paucity of commercial suppliers for these styles. But it also drew on the prevailing view of the ideal mother as one who made her family’s clothing, usually by hand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1469540513480164">Burman, 1999</xref>). The sewing mother was at the core of 19th-century educational theories; the Revised Code of 1862 tied school funding to girls’ performance in needlework tests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1469540513480164">Richmond, 2011</xref>: 1–3). Between 1870 and 1904 girls in state elementary schools spent between three and seven hours a week in mandatory needlework classes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1469540513480164">Turnbull, 1987</xref>: 90; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1469540513480164">Davin, 1996</xref>: 144–5). This emphasis on needlework was justified because, in the words of an 1857 school inspector:<disp-quote>
<p>If we can teach them to darn and to mend, and patch with readiness and skill – if we can enable them to master cutting out to such an extent is required for the ordinary work of a poor man’s home, we shall have rendered to them, and at the same time we shall have rendered to society a lasting and incalculable service. (cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1469540513480164">Turnbull, 1987: 87</xref>)</p></disp-quote>Even for middle-class women, educated in private schools, there was an assumption of a high level of sewing skills, enabling mothers with no professional training to make clothing for themselves and their children. For example, an 1873 text suggested that mothers would save money by making their own dresses ‘with an <italic>arrière pensée</italic> [forethought] as to what will cut up best for the children’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1469540513480164">Cook, 1873</xref>: 97). The domestic encyclopaedia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1469540513480164"><italic>Cassell’s Household Guide</italic> (1869)</xref> gave detailed instructions and diagrams to enable mothers to make all the garments needed by middle-class children from infancy to age 12, including boys’ tweed suits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1469540513480164">Cassell, 1869</xref>: Vol. 1, 177, 332, 369; Vol. 2, 361; Vol. 4, 60–1, 68).</p>
<p>This view of home sewing as essential to household economy was still prevalent in 1901, as can be seen from a set of articles on the cost of living published in <italic>The Cornhill Magazine</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1469540513480164">Layard, 1901</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1469540513480164">Morrison, 1901</xref>). For working-class families with a total income of £1 10 shillings a week (£78 a year) ‘some children’s clothes are bought at the slop-shop, but more are made at home from father’s and mother’s cast-offs’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1469540513480164">Morrison, 1901: 454</xref>). Even for a lower middle-class family with an income of £150 a year, ‘the wife must of course be her own and her children’s dressmaker … This applies more particularly to the children’s clothing … The father’s discarded waistcoats and trousers will be metamorphosed by her deft fingers into second-best suits for the boys’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1469540513480164">Layard, 1901: 661</xref>). The importance of home sewing for poor families was echoed by some autobiographers; Will Crooks, a working-class boy who rose to be a Member of Parliament, stated that ‘the children could not remember the time when she [the mother] did not make all their clothes’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1469540513480164">Haw, 1909</xref>: 6).</p>
<p>On closer examination these assertions reveal some unanswered questions. The first is how women filled the gap between the limited processes taught in the state school needlework syllabus and the skills needed to make – or remake – outer garments. Up to 1894, school needlework classes focused on hand-stitching techniques taught through working ‘samples’, small swatches of fabric demonstrating set stitches to a set size and standard (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1469540513480164">Jones, 1884</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1469540513480164">Turnbull, 1987: 91</xref>). Girls were also expected to hand-sew a specific garment each year; the revised syllabus of 1882 specified ‘a child’s pinafore or plain shirt’ in Standard I, progressing up to ‘a night dress with frill, or baby’s robe, or child’s fancy pinafore’ in Standard VII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1469540513480164">Richmond, 2011</xref>: 53–4). Pupils were discouraged from bringing in sewing projects from home, and many of the skills needed in a working-class household were not covered by the school syllabus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1469540513480164">Turnbull, 1987</xref>: 92). These included the seaming and finishing techniques needed to mend outer garments in heavy cotton or wool, such as working men’s corduroy or serge trousers and coats. The use of sewing machines was also not covered by the school syllabus, partly because of the expense of the machines themselves.</p>
<p>The growing availability of commercial dressmaking patterns after the Butterick publishing company opened a London office in 1873 increased opportunities for home sewers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1469540513480164">Emery, 1999</xref>). A number of dressmaking magazines were founded, offering fashion advice and practical guidance to mothers in the middle and upper working classes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1469540513480164">Rose, 2011a</xref>: lvii–lviii; 141–3). Yet the characterization of the readers in these publications was inconsistent. On the one hand, there was an assumption that they should dress young children in miniature versions of the latest fashions, including fitted bodices, draped skirts and bustled petticoats, since ‘Children, as a rule, lead the way in popular fashions’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1469540513480164">Schild, 1886</xref>). At other times, there was a recognition that the patterns featured might be beyond the skills of mothers sewing for their families:<disp-quote>
<p>It is a saving of money to make a young boy’s clothes at home; but from the time that the lad is old enough to put off sailor and other baby suits, his coats and knickers must be properly made, or life becomes a burden to him. At school boys are as bad as girls in spying out deficiencies in cut and style. Cloth suits must be made in tailor fashion or they must be left alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1469540513480164">‘Myra’, 1897</xref>).</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Clothing that was evidently home made seems to have caused embarrassment on two grounds: first, that the clothes were less well made than purchased ones and, second, that they implied the family was too poor to buy new (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1469540513480164">Ugolini, 2007</xref>: 50, 208–11, 217). The writer H.G. Wells identified the home dressmaking of his mother (who had trained as a dressmaker) as an act of ‘courage rather than skill’. When she made clothes for him and his brother, ‘under the pressure of our schoolfellows’ derision … [we] rebelled against something rather naive in the cut’ (Wells in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1469540513480164">Ugolini, 2007</xref>: 208–9). V.S. Pritchett, from an economically struggling middle-class family, recorded several instances of embarrassment caused by his mother’s home sewing. On one occasion she sent her son to school in his father’s suit trousers, hastily cut down (1980: 90–1); on another her sons went to visit relatives wearing trousers made from a chair cover (1980: 29). Mrs Pritchett’s home sewing seems to have been conducted not as self-effacing thrift but as a public campaign to shame her husband into providing adequate housekeeping expenses. It drew on both the official view of home sewing as a sign of a conscientious mother, and the understanding that home-made clothes were a source of social embarrassment and shame, to be avoided at all costs.</p>

<sec id="sec5-1469540513480164"><title>Fashion magazines and the pleasures of consumption</title>
<p>Dressmaking magazines and wardrobe guides were keen to foster an appreciation of the aesthetic possibilities of children’s clothing: ‘All women love to plan out the prettiest costumes for their little ones’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1469540513480164">de Barras, 1896: 58</xref>). Both girls and boys were described as accessories for the fashionable mother:<disp-quote>
<p>For boys of two or three there are nice little indoor dresses of zephyr … and lovely frocks of muslin and embroidery, with all the adornments of finely gauged plastrons and wide sashes of folded surah [silk] and exquisite coats of broché [brocaded silk] with deep embroidery on the cape, for wearing when sitting or driving with Mama (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1469540513480164">‘Myra’, 1882a: 201</xref>).</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>This passage recommended garments sold by a department store, which had already done the work of identifying appropriate styles. Other passages presented the mother as actively seeking out garments to highlight her child’s unique beauty:<disp-quote>
<p>The following dress has been made for such a child, a beautiful boy of three, and consists of crimson satin and cream lace; the skirt is lightly gathered over an embroidered satin band worked in black silk, the casaque [tunic] being crenelated over it, each tab embroidered with a flower in black silk, and a black satin scarf is tided loosely round the hips in a large knot behind; beneath the tabs is sewn a full flounce of cream lace, and a very large handsome collar and cuffs of lace complete a costume which though showy is the very thing for the handsome little man, thus coloured both by art and nature as richly as a tropical butterfly (‘Myra’, 1882: 256).</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>This view of the dressed child as a work of art tended to focus on the very young, whose clothing made them not only visual but psychic extensions of the mother. For slightly older children, convention prescribed a more restrained aesthetic: ‘little girls, even when very tiny, can be made to look so very picturesque. Beautiful materials may be used for these that would be in very bad taste for maidens over seven years’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1469540513480164">de Barras, 1896: 58</xref>). But even when exercising restraint in the style of garments, middle-class mothers could indulge in the pleasure of consumption through their choice of retailer. A household guide by Jane Emily <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1469540513480164">Panton (1888: 200)</xref> advised mothers to buy standard items such as sailor suits not from low-priced high-street stores, but from Redfern, a couturier who supplied the Royal family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1469540513480164">North, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1469540513480164">Rose, 2011b</xref>: 196).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1469540513480164"><title>The temptations of consumption and ‘symbolic deprivation’</title>
<p>The frank appreciation of the aesthetic and sensual beauty of children’s clothing in needlework magazines seems to have brought its own reaction: ‘it is difficult to resist temptation, I know; one likes the flattery that adoration of the child really means for oneself, and it is no doubt very difficult to do one’s duty, just as it is much easier to let a child have its own way’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1469540513480164">Panton, 1896</xref>: 97). Some of the warnings against excessive consumption were based on awareness that adult styles might not suit children’s bodies:<disp-quote>
<p>In these days of elaboration and extravagance in dress, children are too frequently seen dressed out in imitation of grown-up persons, like miniatures reproducing on a small scale each detail of puff, frill, furbelow and manufactured protuberance that is seen on the costumes of their mothers and aunts. This is a mistake, not only as regards the fostering of self-consciousness in the small wearer, but from an artistic point of view. Children’s clothes should be of simple material, simply made. Brilliant colouring is more than allowable, and the mother may indulge in this direction the love of colour which she must curb and confine as regards her own garments. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1469540513480164">Beeton, 1884</xref>: 806)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>This passage situates the young child in opposition to the adult woman, distinguished by a wider range of colour choices but a limited range of shapes. The progression from child to adult was seen as needing careful management: ‘A difference must, however, be made with children of different ages. For a child of two, three, four or five years of age, the dress may be made quite plain. After six, if the girl be tall, a little trimming is necessary’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1469540513480164">Beeton, 1884</xref>: 807; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1469540513480164">Hunter, 2002</xref>: 140–5).</p>
<p>Restraint was characterized as the hallmark of good taste in children’s clothing: ‘most of our richest and most cultivated people nowadays dress their children in plain cottons, ginghams and muslins in summer …. those sensible people aim to bring their children up to have refined and quiet tastes’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1469540513480164">de Barras, 1896</xref>: 59). Panton reminded her readers that lavish expenditure on children’s clothing would detract from the resources available for ‘the most necessary parts of education’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1469540513480164">Panton, 1896</xref>: 96). Even when resources allowed, the temptation to dress children up should be resisted, as it was associated with the distasteful practices of the ‘<italic>nouveaux riches</italic> whose principal pleasure in the possession of their new wealth is to flaunt it in the eyes of all men’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1469540513480164">Beeton, 1884</xref>: 806).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-1469540513480164"><title>The dangers of consumption: Misreadings</title>
<p>Parental consumption decisions were open to scrutiny not only by peers, but by children themselves. Gwen Raverat (b. 1880) recalled: ‘Clothes were a major cause of rows, naughtiness, misery and unpleasantness, right through my whole youth … our clothes were imposed on us from above, without even the power of veto’ (Raverat, 1952: 253). Her objection was based on her lack of personal autonomy in clothing choice, but there were also problems with parental misreading of the social codes governing clothing. Children might be ‘made wretched by what they have to wear, by reason of its ugliness, or its difference to the raiment worn by their small playfellows’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1469540513480164">Panton, 1896</xref>: 92). The gap between the parent’s and the child’s perception of what was suitable was stressed:<disp-quote>
<p>In choosing children’s dress it would be well if mothers could realise how sensitive children are, and would be careful not to clothe them in dress that was strikingly <italic>peculiar</italic>. Nervous children sometimes suffer agony through being stared at or jeered at by their schoolmates. There are, indeed, parents who think that the discipline thus brought about is beneficial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1469540513480164">Cassell, 1889</xref>: 112).</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>The acceptable range of clothing could be very tightly limited, as a London schoolboy found in 1910:<disp-quote>
<p>At this period the boys’ outfitters’ shops, Isaac Walton, John Baker, Man and Boy, etc., sold little suits which, among those whose parents could afford them, amounted to a uniform … A tweed or serge Norfolk jacket buttoning right up to the throat, surmounted by a huge white Eton collar (celluloid for week-days, starched linen for Sundays) … The boys who didn’t have Norfolk jackets usually had coloured blouses, plus jerseys in the winter. Such boys, generally speaking, wore shorts, as distinct from the button-up knee breeches that went with the Norfolk jacket. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1469540513480164">Rolph, 1980</xref>: 62–3)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>The ‘uniformity’ described here was self-regulating, not imposed by the school authorities, and included variants for different days of the week and seasons of the year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1469540513480164">Rose, 2011b</xref>). Rolph associated specific outfits with different levels of household income: tailored Norfolk suits were worn by better-off boys, with blouses and shorts a cheaper option. Clothing was also an important indicator of the wearer’s progress through developmental stages, from infancy to adolescence. Children were quick to identify and mock a peer dressed in a way ‘suitable for a boy two or three years his junior’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1469540513480164">Willis, 1960</xref>: 54). Clothes that were outside the normal range could create social stigma, even when the garments themselves were of high quality. Edward Brown (b.1880) was given a second-hand golden brown velvet suit which caused ‘a good deal of mortification … it stood out against the drab cloth suits of my associates in quite a startling way’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1469540513480164">Burnett, 1994</xref>: 152). In this case the gift relationship embodied in the clothing may have been seen as positive by the mother, but reinforced the child’s sense of social inadequacy.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-1469540513480164"><title>Symbolic consumption and the economy of dignity: The white pinafore</title>
<p>The potential for adult misunderstanding of the meanings of children’s clothing is revealed by middle-class attempts to advise poor parents on healthy and economical clothing. An example can be seen in the white frilled pinafores worn by schoolgirls over their dresses. Pinafores, washable sleeveless overalls, derived from the aprons and bibs worn by toddlers since at least the 16th century (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1469540513480164">Buck, 1996</xref>: 71–2). In the mid-19th century they were worn by girls and by young boys to protect non-washable dresses, and patterns for utilitarian versions were given in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1469540513480164">Cassell’s guide (1869: Vol. II, 22)</xref>. Pinafores were also associated with domestic service, worn by poor girls educated in charitable institutions and destined to work as maidservants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1469540513480164">Cunnington and Lucas, 1978: 103–5, 115–16</xref>). In the needlework syllabus established by the Revised Code of 1862, pinafores were specified as set garments, since they could be made from cheap cotton and required little skill in cutting out or shaping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1469540513480164">Richmond, 2011</xref>: 53).</p>
<p>However in the 1880s this humble garment became a fashionable accessory, trimmed with machine embroidery and machine-made lace that was decorative but strong enough to withstand repeated laundering. By 1886 the catalogue of the Army &amp; Navy Stores in London offered ten different ranges of children’s aprons and pinafores, in sizes from infant to ten years old, with the prices for a two-year-old ranging from 1s 7d to 6s 9d (Army &amp; Navy Co-Operative Society Ltd., 1886: 1250–1). As the highest priced pinafores cost as much as some of the children’s dresses in the same store, they were less protective garments than a form of conspicuous consumption. Even stores with a more cost-conscious clientele, such as Dallas’s of Glasgow, offered pinafores in a range of styles and prices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1469540513480164">Figure 1</xref>). Writing in 1896, Panton acknowledged the changed status of the pinafore as suitable for formal occasions as well as schooldays:<disp-quote>
<p>No child should be allowed to wear anything but … a good big pinafore which completely envelops it and covers its frock all over. These pinafores should be made of diaper, and should be gathered into a yoke; they should be edged at the neck and round the arms with a strong Swiss embroidery, and they should be gathered in round the waist by a Liberty [silk] sash: and no little girl should be seen without her pinafore, even on Sundays or in the drawing-room, when the diaper can be changed for clear muslin, and lace can replace the embroidery. But the pinafore should be there, and should give the childish appearance which it seems to me as many parents as children resent in these very unchildlike days of ours.

<p>This passage is interesting in foregrounding the exemplary restraint of the middle-class mother who rejects both inappropriately adult clothes and the indiscriminate use of finery. It also identifies both parents and children as seduced by ‘unchildlike’ fashions, recognizing that their views on dress were not always in agreement. This is a rare acknowledgement of generational differences in tastes.</p>
<p>The symbolic importance of the white pinafore as an indicator of ‘best’ dress was also recognized by poorer families, as autobiographies confirm. One girl born in 1902 recalled that her family were poor and she did not own a white pinafore, but on special occasions she had one lent to her by a family friend ‘so I would look as good as anyone else you know’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1469540513480164">Davin, 1996</xref>: 135). A carefully washed and starched white pinafore was a visible indicator of cleanliness in everyday life as well, as children themselves noticed. A middle-class girl forced by family misfortunes to attend a village school in 1914 noticed: ‘Only six girls … including [sister] Evelyn and myself wore white pinafores; the rest had coloured pinafores, and some were dirty and torn’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1469540513480164">Shears, 1971</xref>: 14). Wealthier families might feel that this overt display of cleanliness was not needed; a girl starting at a private school found that in this securely middle-class environment pinafores were interpreted as an admission that the dress beneath was shamefully old (Harrison in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1469540513480164">Burnett, 1994</xref>: 33 note 109).</p>
<p>These nuanced meanings were ignored by the dress reformer Margaret Synge, who saw only the practical difficulties posed by the frilled white pinafore:<disp-quote>
<p>The ordinary white pinafore for London schoolchildren, nice as it looks when clean, creates an immense amount of work for the London mother. Hence it is not to be greatly encouraged in the schools. Coloured pinafores are very picturesque, and should keep clean a week instead of a day … the cheap lace that adorns so many pinafores may be discarded and pretty coloured stitches substituted in their place (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1469540513480164">Synge, 1913: xiv</xref>).

<p>Synge’s advocacy of the hand-made and colourful over the machine-made and mass-produced reflected the Arts and Crafts ideology that had informed Swanson and Macbeth’s work. Her advice to working-class mothers ignored the possibility that both expenditure on purchased (rather than home-making) goods and finding time for additional laundry might be marks of status.</p>
<p>The competing interpretations of pinafores were evaluated by the quantitative analysis of a sample of forty-four group photographs dated 1885-1923 from state elementary schools throughout England (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1469540513480164">Table 1</xref>). The archives used covered schools in both urban and rural communities in the south (London and Hampshire) and the north (Manchester and Beamish). These photographs were formally posed, usually in the school yard, and often all the classes in one school were photographed on the same day, allowing for a comparison of children of different ages from the same location and social background. Of the 653 girls in these photographs, 236 were identifiably wearing pinafores. Moreover, only eight of the 236 pinafores were the dark cotton ones recommended by Synge; the rest were white cotton, with or without frilled trim.
<table-wrap id="table1-1469540513480164" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><p>Pinafores in school photographs, 1885–1923.</p></caption>

</table-wrap></p>
<p>While the incidence of pinafores varies between groups, the variations are not correlated to locations, with equal numbers seen in Holden Street, London and in rural Alresford in 1897. There is also surprisingly little change over time, with up to 45 percent of girls in Tadley wearing them as late as 1921. There is a distinction in age, suggesting that the association of pinafores with infancy noted by Panton was generally recognized. This can be seen in the photographs taken at Mortimer School, Hampshire in 1921, with a decline in pinafore wearing over the age range from ‘Infants’ to ‘Standard VII’. The persistence of the pinafore into the 1920s is unexpected, as by this date girls’ main garments had shifted from the one-piece dresses of 1890 to separate skirts and sweaters or blouses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1469540513480164">Figure 3</xref>). There was also a new fashion for pinafore dresses in dark wool worn over lighter blouses or sweaters. All of these combinations can be seen in the photograph of the Standard VII group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1469540513480164">Figure 3</xref>), where three girls in the front and second rows wear white pinafores, one girl in the second row wears what is probably a print pinafore, and seven girls wear pinafore dresses. The white pinafores present a striking visual contrast to dark dresses and sweaters worn underneath. However this contrast also highlights tears in the fabric of two of the pinafores, which show up as dark lines.

<p>The variety of different clothing combinations in this small group may reflect the kind of status differentials noted in autobiographies, with some girls wearing shabby pinafores to cover even shabbier dresses, while others proudly display dresses with no signs of wear. It may also reflect differences in family composition, if younger sisters wore hand-me-downs from older siblings, or older mothers chose garments that reflect tastes formed in 1910 rather than 1920. Or the choice of white pinafores, rather than the other garments available, may be interpreted as an assertion of the mother’s understanding of the ‘proper’ dress for her daughter even when the garment itself is torn and shabby. This may reflect a mentality similar to that identified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1469540513480164">Campbell (1996)</xref>, where the intention of an act of consumption needs to be separated from its execution.</p>

<sec id="sec9-1469540513480164" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>How can these glimpses of past consumption practices inform our understanding of maternal clothing consumption today? Firstly, they act as reminders that while the past may be a foreign country, it is one that is ruled by many of the same social forces we see around us now. The use of children as vehicles of conspicuous consumption, castigated by contemporary journalists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1469540513480164">Paul, 2008</xref>) can be clearly seen in the 1880s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1469540513480164">‘Myra’, 1882a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1469540513480164">1882b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1469540513480164">Schild, 1886</xref>). The framing of consumption as a ‘temptation’ to be resisted by conscientious mothers either on aesthetic or on moral grounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1469540513480164">de Barras, 1896</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1469540513480164">Panton, 1896</xref>) mirrors Pugh’s finding that ‘affluent parents used symbolic deprivation to express and codify their ambivalence about spending’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1469540513480164">Pugh, 2009: 85</xref>). The view of dress as a means to improve the health not only of individual children but of a whole society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1469540513480164">Swanson and Macbeth, 1913</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1469540513480164">Synge, 1913</xref>) could be paralleled with the contemporary tendency for middle-class parents to justify their consumption decisions by reference to ‘ecological’ values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1469540513480164">Miller, 2001</xref>).The tension between consumption based on mothers’ social values, and the values attached to goods by children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1469540513480164">Pugh, 2009</xref>: 107) can be seen in past children’s rejection of home-made garments intended as signs of maternal devotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1469540513480164">Pritchett, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1469540513480164">Ugolini, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The importance of the frilled white pinafore in 1900 relates to Pugh’s concept of ‘symbolic indulgence’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1469540513480164">Pugh, 2009: 217</xref>) as this garment acted as a key indicator of social inclusion for the families least able to afford it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1469540513480164">Davin, 1996</xref>: 135). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1469540513480164">Panton’s recommendation (1888: 200)</xref> that parents purchase a standard item from an elite retailer is reminiscent of some of the practices identified by Pugh in the wealthy families she studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1469540513480164">Pugh, 2009: 208</xref>). The role of gifted and second-hand garments in representing relationships, as discussed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1469540513480164">Corrigan (1989)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1469540513480164">Clarke (2000)</xref> appears in 1900 to have had negative overtones, with children suffering hand-me-downs only because they knew that rejecting them would destabilize the family economy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1469540513480164">Panton, 1896: 98</xref>). A trope that is easy to identify in historic texts is that of the middle-class commentator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1469540513480164">Synge, 1913</xref>) trying to correct working-class practices. This should make us wary of modern journalists’ criticism of parents’ consumption practices on the grounds of ‘good taste’. Thus this historic material may help to evaluate and historicize contemporary parenting practices.</p>
