<abstract>
<p>There is some controversy regarding liposuction for late-stage lymphedemas. Although it is clear that conservative therapies such as complex decongestive therapy and controlled compression therapy should be tried in the first instance, options for the treatment of late-stage lymphedema that is not responding to treatment is not so clear. Liposuction has been used for many years to treat lipodystrophy. Some results have been far from optimal; however, improvements in technique, patient preparation, and patient follow-up have led to a greater and a wider acceptance of liposuction as a treatment for lymphedema. This article outlines the benefits of using liposuction and presents the evidence to support its use.</p>

<body>
<p>There is an increasing body of evidence, based on well-controlled clinical trials and long-term follow-up, that liposuction can result in significant objective and subjective benefit to patients who have long-term chronic lymphedema.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1534734612438550">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1534734612438550">2</xref></sup> There are, however, different views on the immediate, short-term, and long-term benefits of liposuction for treating lymphedema, with a strong dichotomy between those who support surgical and conservative treatments.</p>
<sec id="section1-1534734612438550">
<title>Excess Subcutaneous Adiposity and Chronic Lymphedema</title>
<p>The incidence of postmastectomy arm lymphedema varies between 8% and 80%, depending, in part, on whether axillary lymph nodes have been removed and postoperative irradiation has been given.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1534734612438550">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1534734612438550">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>The outcome of the surgical procedure as well as of the irradiation of the tissue often results in the destruction of lymphatic vessels. When this is combined with the removal of lymph nodes and tissue scarring, the lymphatic vessels that remain are likely to be unable to remove the load of lymph. The remaining lymph collectors become dilated and overloaded and their valves become incompetent, preventing the lymphatics from performing their function. This failure spreads distally until even the most peripheral lymph vessels, draining into the affected system, also become dilated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1534734612438550">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>In a parallel process, the cells of the mononuclear phagocytic system of the mesenchymal tissues begin to lose their capability to remove the protein that accumulates. The accumulated interstitial proteins, as osmotically active molecules, attract fluid to the area. This accumulation of protein and fluid is usually a transitory phase, lasting between 1 and 3 weeks.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1534734612438550">5</xref></sup></p>
<p>In the latent phase, there may still be no clinical signs initially of any discernable lymphedema. The latent phase normally varies from about 4 months to 10 years. At the end of the latent phase, pitting of the edematous arm on pressure can be observed. This can be objectively measured by plethysmography and by decreased tissue compressibility using a tissue tonometer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1534734612438550">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1534734612438550">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>The enlargement of the arm leads to discomfort and complaints in the form of heaviness, weakness<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1534734612438550">7</xref></sup>, pain, tension, and a sensory deficit of the limb, as well as anxiety, psychological morbidity, maladjustment and social isolation,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1534734612438550">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1534734612438550">9</xref></sup> and increasing hardness of the limb.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1534734612438550">10</xref></sup> In time, there is also an increase in the adipose tissue content of the swollen arm. The author has observed this clinically since 1987, when the first lymphedema patient in his department was operated on.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1534734612438550">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1534734612438550">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>There are various possible explanations for the adipose tissue hypertrophy. There is a physiological imbalance of blood flow and lymphatic drainage, resulting in the impaired clearance of lipids and their uptake by macrophages.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1534734612438550">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1534734612438550">14</xref></sup> There is increasing support, however, for the view that the fat cell is not simply a container of fat but is an endocrine organ and a cytokine-activated cell,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1534734612438550">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1534734612438550">16</xref></sup> and chronic inflammation plays a role here.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1534734612438550">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1534734612438550">18</xref></sup> The same pathophysiology goes for primary and secondary leg lymphedema.</p>
<p>For more information about investigational advances and the relationship between slow lymph flow and adiposity, as well as that between structural changes in the lymphatic system and adiposity, see Harvey et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1534734612438550">19</xref></sup> and Schneider et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1534734612438550">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>Other indications for adipose tissue hypertrophy include the following:</p>

<list-item><p>Preoperative investigation with volume-rendered computer tomography images in 8 patients showed a significant preoperative increase of adipose tissue in the swollen arm, the excess volume consisting of 81% (range 68-96) fat.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1534734612438550">23</xref></sup></p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Tonometry can distinguish if a lymphedematous arm is harder or softer than the normal one. If the edematous arm is softer than the healthy one, it indicates that there is accumulated lymph fluid in the tissue, and these patients are candidates for conservative treatment methods. In contrast, patients with a harder arm compared with the healthy one have adipose tissue excess that can successfully be removed by liposuction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1534734612438550">6</xref></sup></p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The findings of increased adipose tissue in intestinal segments in patients with Crohn’s disease, known as “fat wrapping,” have clearly shown that inflammation plays an important role.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1534734612438550">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1534734612438550">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1534734612438550">25</xref></sup></p></list-item>
<list-item><p>A major problem in Graves’s ophthalmopathy is an increase in the intraorbital adipose tissue volume leading to exopthalmus. Overexpression of adipocyte-related immediate early genes in active ophthalmopathy and cysteine-rich, angiogenic inducer 61 (CYR61) may have a role in both orbital inflammation and adipogenesis and serve as a marker of disease activity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1534734612438550">26</xref></sup></p></list-item></list>
<p>The common understanding among clinicians is that the swelling of a lymphedematous extremity is purely because of the accumulation of lymph fluid, which can be removed by use of noninvasive conservative regimens such as complex decongestive therapy (CDT) and controlled compression therapy (CCT). These therapies work well when the excess swelling consists of accumulated lymph but do not work when the excess volume is dominated by adipose tissue.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1534734612438550">12</xref></sup> The same may go for microsurgical procedures using lymphovenous shunts and lymph vessel transplantation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1534734612438550">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1534734612438550"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1534734612438550">29</xref></sup></p>

<title>Liposuction</title>
<p>Liposuction is the most common procedure in plastic surgery and is mainly performed for cosmetic purposes. To a lesser extent, it has been used for reconstructive surgery, for example, in the treatment of lymphedema,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1534734612438550">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1534734612438550">30</xref></sup> problems of leakage around colostomies and urostomies caused by bulging fatty skin folds,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1534734612438550">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1534734612438550">35</xref></sup> “insulin tumors” caused by the injection of insulin into the subcutaneous fat,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1534734612438550">36</xref></sup> multiple familial angiolipomatosis,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1534734612438550">37</xref></sup> gynecomastia,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1534734612438550">38</xref></sup> and benign symmetrical lipomatosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1534734612438550">39</xref></sup></p>
<p>Initially, liposuction was done as a “dry” technique, no dilute adrenaline or anesthetics being injected into the adipose tissue beforehand.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1534734612438550">40</xref></sup> A disadvantage of the “dry” technique was the large amount of blood loss.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1534734612438550">41</xref></sup> Most surgeons recommended that no more than 1500 mL of blood should be lost or removed to avoid the need for blood transfusions.</p>
<p>Illouz was the first to infiltrate the subcutaneous fatty tissue when doing liposuction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1534734612438550">42</xref></sup> In the early 1980s, most surgeons used the “wet” technique,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1534734612438550">43</xref></sup> which involves infiltration of 200 to 300 mL of normal saline with or without lignocaine, adrenaline, or a combination, into the surgical area before liposuction.</p>
<p>In 1986, the “superwet” technique was introduced, which involves infiltration of a solution of normal saline containing adrenaline and lignocaine in an amount equal to that of the fat that is to be removed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1534734612438550">44</xref></sup></p>
<p>The following year, Klein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1534734612438550">45</xref></sup> described the “tumescent” technique, which involves somewhat larger amounts of saline containing both low-dose adrenaline and lignocaine in the ratio of 2:1 or 3:1 mL (infiltrate:aspirate) being injected. These techniques enabled surgeons to remove large quantities of adipose tissue. By infiltrating dilute adrenaline and lignocaine into subcutaneous fat, both the excessive loss of blood and the need for general anesthesia with its associated risks are reduced.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1534734612438550">46</xref></sup></p>
<p>According to other authors, more than 3000 mL of fat can be removed during liposuction under local anesthesia without sedation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1534734612438550">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1534734612438550">47</xref></sup> Samdal et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1534734612438550">48</xref></sup> reported that the amount of whole blood contained in the aspirate is roughly 2% (volume/volume) when superwet or tumescent techniques are used, whereas in the “dry” technique, it is 25%,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1534734612438550">43</xref></sup> and in the wet technique 15%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1534734612438550">40</xref></sup></p>
<p>When our team started to treat arm lymphedema following breast cancer treatment, we used the “dry technique.” Later, to minimize blood loss, a tourniquet was used in combination with tumescence. Liposuction was performed up to the distal edge of the tourniquet. A sterile compression garment was put on and the tourniquet was released. The area covered by the tourniquet was infiltrated with dilute adrenaline before the liposuction was completed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1534734612438550">46</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1534734612438550">Figure 4</xref>).</p>

<title>How to Perform Liposuction for Lymphedema</title>
<sec id="section5-1534734612438550">
<title>Surgical Technique</title>
<p>Liposuction technique for leg lymphedema is similar to that for the arm. By the use of liposuction, the excess hypertrophied adipose tissue is removed under bloodless conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1534734612438550">Figure 4</xref>). General anesthesia is used in most cases but some patients with arm lymphedema prefer nerve blockade in the combination of a plexus and scalenus block. Neither local anesthetic nor epinephrine is injected distal to the tourniquet; hence the “dry technique” is used. Through around 15 to 20, 3-mm long incisions, the shoulder and arm—and even the hand when indicated—are treated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1534734612438550">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1534734612438550">5</xref>).</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1534734612438550-fig5.tif"/></fig>
<p>Cannulas are connected to a vacuum pump giving a negative atmospheric pressure of 0.9. The cannulas are 15 cm long with outer diameters of 3 and 4 mm, and they have 3 openings at the tip. The finer cannula is used mainly for the hand and the distal part of the forearm and also when irregularities are remedied. The openings differ from normal liposuction cannulas in that they take up almost half of the circumference to facilitate the liposuction, especially in lymphedemas with excess fibrosis.</p>
<p>Made-to-measure compression garments (2 sleeves and 2 gloves) are ordered 2 weeks before surgery. The size of the garments is measured according to the size of the healthy arm and hand. In stock we always have standard interim gloves and gauntlets (= a glove without fingers, but with a thumb), used as described below. Liposuction is executed circumferentially, step-by-step from hand to shoulder, and the hypertrophied fat is removed as completely as possible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1534734612438550">Figures 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1534734612438550">5</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1534734612438550">6</xref>).</p>

<p>When the arm distal to the tourniquet has been treated, a sterilized made-to-measure compression sleeve is applied (Jobst Elvarex compression class 2, BSN Medical, Hamburg, Germany) on the arm to stem bleeding and postoperative edema. A sterilized, standard interim glove (Cicatrex interim, Thuasne, France), where the tips of the fingers have been cut to facilitate gripping, is put on the hand. The tourniquet is removed and the most proximal part of the upper arm is treated using tumescent technique. Finally, the proximal part of the compression sleeve is pulled up to compress the proximal part of the upper arm. The incisions are left open to drain through the sleeve. The arm is lightly wrapped with a large absorbent compress covering the whole arm (60 cm × 60 cm, Cover Dri, Attends, UK). The arm is kept at heart level on a large pillow. The compress is changed when needed.</p>
<p>The following day, a standard gauntlet (ie, a glove without fingers, but with a thumb; Jobst Elvarex compression class 2) is put over the interim glove after the thumb of the gauntlet has been cut off to ease the pressure on the thumb. If the gauntlet is put on straight after surgery, it can exert too much pressure on the hand when the patient is still not able to move the fingers after the anesthesia. Operating time is, on average, 2 hours. An isoxazolylpenicillin or a cephalosporin is given intravenously for the first 24 hours and then in tablet form until incisions are healed, about 10 to 14 days after surgery.</p>

<sec id="section6-1534734612438550">
<title>Postoperative Care</title>
<p>The arm is held in a raised position by the patient herself during the hospital stay. Garments are removed 2 days postoperatively so that the patient can take a shower. Then, another set of garments is put on and the used set is washed and dried. The patient herself repeats this after another 2 days before she is discharged. The standard glove and gauntlet is usually changed to the made-to-measure glove at the end of the stay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1534734612438550">Figure 7</xref>).</p>

<p>The patient alternates between the 2 sets of garments (2 sleeves and 2 gloves) during the first 2 postoperative weeks, changing them daily or every other day so that a clean set is always put on after showering and lubricating the arm. After the 2-week control, the garments are changed every day after being washed. Washing “activates” the garment by increasing the compression due to shrinkage. It also removes perspirated salt that can cause dry and irritated skin.</p>
<p>During the subsequent course, this rigorous compression regime, referred to as CCT, is maintained exactly as described below.</p>

<sec id="section7-1534734612438550">
<title>Controlled Compression Therapy</title>
<p>A prerequisite to maintaining the effect of liposuction and, for that matter, conservative treatment, is the continuous use of a compression garment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1534734612438550">12</xref></sup> Compression therapy is crucial, and its application is therefore thoroughly described and discussed at the first clinical evaluation. If the patient has any doubts about continued CCT, she is not accepted for treatment. After initiating compression therapy, the custom-made garment is taken in at each visit using a sewing machine, to compensate for reduced elasticity and reduced arm volume. This is most important during the first 3 months when the most notable changes in volume occur. At the 1- and 3-month visits, the arm is measured for new custom-made garments. This procedure is repeated at 6, (9), and 12 months. If complete reduction has been achieved at 6 months, the 9-month control may be omitted. If this is the case, remember to prescribe garments for 6 months, which normally means double the amount than would be needed for 3 months. It is important, however, to take in the garment repeatedly to compensate for wear and tear. This may require additional visits in some instances, although the patient can often make such adjustments herself. When the excess volume has decreased as much as possible and a steady state is achieved, new garments can be prescribed using the latest measurements. In this way, the garments are renewed 3 or 4 times during the first year. Two sets of sleeve-and-glove garments are always at the patient’s disposal; one being worn while the other is washed. Thus, a garment is worn permanently, and treatment is interrupted only briefly when showering and, possibly, for formal social occasions. The patient is informed about the importance of hygiene and skin care, as all patients with lymphedema are susceptible to infections, and keeping the skin clean and soft is a prophylactic measure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1534734612438550">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1534734612438550">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>The life span of 2 garments worn alternately is usually 4 to 6 months. After complete reduction has been achieved, the patient is seen once a year when new garments are prescribed for the next year, usually 4 garments and 4 gloves (or 4 gauntlets). In active patients, 6 to 8 garments and the same amount of gauntlets/gloves a year are needed.</p>
<p>For legs, the authors’ team often uses up to 2 to 3 compression garments on top of each other, depending on what is needed to keep pitting away. A typical example is Jobst Bellavar compression class 2, Jobst Elvarex compression class 3, Forte and Jobst Elvarex compression class 2 (BSN Medical, Hamburg, Germany). The latter can be a leg-length or a below-the-knee garment. Thus, such a patient needs 2 sets of 2 to 3 garments. One set is worn while the other is washed. Depending on the age and activity of the patient, 2 such sets can last for 2 to 4 months. This means that they must be prescribed 3 to 6 times during the first year. After complete reduction has been achieved, the patient is seen once a year when all new garments are prescribed for the next year.</p>
<p>CCT can also be used primarily to effectively treat a pitting edema as an alternative to CDT, which, in contrast to CCT, comprises daily interventions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1534734612438550">12</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1534734612438550">
<title>Arm Volume Measurements</title>
<p>Arm volumes are recorded for each patient using the water displacement technique. The displaced water is weighed on a balance to the nearest 5 g, corresponding to 5 mL. Both arms are always measured at each visit, and the difference in arm volumes is designated as the edema volume. The decrease in the edema volume is calculated in a percentage of the preoperative value.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1534734612438550">11</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="section9-1534734612438550">
<title>The Lymphedema Team</title>
<p>To investigate and treat patients with lymphedema, a team comprising a plastic surgeon, an occupational therapist, a physiotherapist, and a social welfare officer is needed. An hour is reserved for each scheduled visit to the team when arm volumes are measured, garments are adjusted or renewed, the social circumstances are assessed, and other matters of concern are discussed. The patient is also encouraged to contact the team whenever any unexpected problems arise, so that these can be tackled without delay. In retrospect, a working group such as this one seems to be a prerequisite both for thorough preoperative consideration and informing patients and for successful maintenance of immediate postoperative improvements. The team also monitors the long-term outcome, and the authors’ experience so far indicates that a visit once a year is necessary, in most cases, to maintain a good functional and cosmetic result after complete reduction.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1534734612438550">
<title>Other Liposuction Techniques</title>
<p>Newer techniques involve ultrasonic assisted liposuction (UAL), laser-assisted liposuction (LAL), and power-assisted liposuction (PAL). UAL and LAL generate energy that is transformed into heat that can damage the skin. The authors do not use these techniques for lymphedema. On the other hand, PAL is of great benefit as the vibrating cannula facilitates the liposuction, especially in the leg.</p>

<title>How Liposuction Helps</title>
<p>For many people conservative treatment does not work well or come up to their expectations, and no matter what therapy they receive, neither conservative treatment nor microsurgical procedures can remove excess adipose tissue.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1534734612438550">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1534734612438550"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1534734612438550">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1534734612438550">49</xref></sup> Subcutaneous tissue debulking seems the only option to reduce the limb volume and lead to an improvement in the patient’s quality of life.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1534734612438550">10</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="section12-1534734612438550">
<title>Lymph Transport System and Liposuction</title>
<p>All surgery can lead to postoperative swelling due to tissue trauma and damage to the lymph and vascular systems. This swelling, depending on the type of surgery performed (ankle fractures take 3 to 6 months before the swelling disappears, free flaps tend to regenerate quickly, after a rhinoplasty, swelling can persist for more than 1 year, and, naturally, minor surgery, eg, after excising a mole, leads to no swelling at all), usually disappears within a few weeks when the lymphatics regenerate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1534734612438550">50</xref></sup> The same goes for liposuction performed for cosmetic reasons. In patients with lymphedema, the lymph transport is greatly reduced. To investigate the effect of liposuction on lymph transport, the author conducted an investigation using indirect lymphoscintigraphy in 20 patients with postmastectomy arm lymphedema. Scintigraphies were performed before liposuction, with and without wearing a garment. This was repeated after 3 and 12 months. In conclusion, it was found that the already decreased lymph transport was not further reduced after liposuction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1534734612438550">30</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="section13-1534734612438550">
<title>When to Use Liposuction to Treat Lymphedema</title>
<p>A surgical approach, with the intention of removing the hypertrophied adipose tissue, seems logic when conservative treatment has not achieved satisfactory edema reduction and the patient has subjective discomfort of a heavy arm. This condition is especially seen in chronic, large arm lymphedemas around 1 L in volume, or when the volume ratio (edematous arm/healthy arm) = 1.3.</p>
<p>Liposuction should never be performed in a patient with a pitting edema, as it is dominated by accumulated lymph, which can be removed by conservative treatment. Only a lymphedematous limb where no or minimal pitting is shown should be operated on. By removing the excess adipose tissue, the risk of developing lymphangiosarcoma may decrease.</p>
<p>At the Department of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, Skåne University Hospital, Malmö, Sweden, the first liposuction of an arm lymphedema was undertaken in 1987, but it was not until 1993 that a more detailed treatment protocol was established and a lymphedema unit with a team was founded. The aim was arm lymphedema after breast cancer treatment, as this is a large and common problem. There is no upper age limit to be accepted for surgery, but active tumor disease and ulcerations are contraindications.</p>
<p>Initially, lymphedema starts as a swelling that shows pits on pressure. If treated immediately by conservative regimens, the swelling can disappear. If not, or improperly treated, the swelling increases in time and can end up in an even larger pitting edema with concomitant adipose tissue formation.</p>
<p>The first and most important goal is to transform a pitting edema into a nonpitting one by conservative regimens such as CDT or CCT. “Pitting” means that a depression is formed after pressure on the edematous tissue by the fingertip, resulting in lymph being squeezed into the surroundings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1534734612438550">Figure 8A</xref>). To standardize the pitting test, one presses as hard as possible with the thumb on the region to be investigated for 1 minute, the amount of depression being estimated in millimeters. A swelling that is dominated by hypertrophied adipose tissue shows little or no pitting<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1534734612438550">31</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1534734612438550">Figure 8B</xref>).</p>

<p>(A) Marked lymphedema of the arm after breast cancer treatment, showing pitting several centimeters in depth (grade I edema). The arm swelling is dominated by the presence of fluid, that is, the accumulation of lymph. (B) Pronounced arm lymphodema after breast cancer treatment (grade II edema). There is no pitting in spite of hard pressure by the thumb for 1 minute. A slight reddening is seen at the 2 spots where pressure has been exerted. The “edema” is completely dominated by adipose tissue. The term <italic>edema</italic> is improper at this stage since the swelling is dominated by hypertrophied adipose tissue and not by lymph. At this stage, the aspirate contains either no or a minimal amount of lymph</p>

<p>Stemmer’s sign implies that you can pinch the skin at the base of the toes or fingers with difficulty or not at all. This is due to increased fibrosis and is characteristic for chronic lymphedema. On the other hand, a negative sign does not exclude lymphedema. The author has not seen any relationship between either a positive or negative sign and the occurrence of adipose tissue.</p>
<p>When a patient has been treated conservatively and shows no pitting, liposuction can be performed. If quality of life is low, this can be especially effective. The cancer itself is a worry, but the swollen and heavy arm introduces an additional handicap for the patient from a physical, psychosocial, and psychological point of view. Physical problems include pain, limited limb movement, and physical mobility and problems with clothing, thus interfering with everyday activities. Also, the heavy and swollen arm is impractical and cosmetically unappealing, all of which contribute to emotional distress.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1534734612438550">10</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1534734612438550">
<title>When Liposuction Should Never Be Used</title>
<p>Liposuction should never be performed in a patient who shows pits on pressure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-1534734612438550">Figure 8A</xref>; see above). In a patient with an arm lymphedema, the authors accept around 4 to 5 mm of pitting, and in a leg lymphedema, 6 to 7 mm. Patients with more pitting should be treated conservatively until the pitting has been reduced. The reason for not doing liposuction in a pitting edema is that liposuction is a method to remove fat, not fluid, even if theoretically it could remove all the accumulated fluid in a pitting lymphedema without excess adipose tissue formation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-1534734612438550">
<title>Benefits to the Patient</title>
<p>Liposuction improves patients’ quality of life, particularly qualities associated with everyday activities, hence those that can be directly related to the complete arm edema reduction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1534734612438550">10</xref></sup> CCT is also beneficial, but the effect is less obvious than when combined with surgery, conceivably because the reduction of excess volume is less.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1534734612438550">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>Skin blood flow and cellulitis after liposuction reduces the incidence of erysipelas; the annual incidence of cellulitis was 0.4 before liposuction and 0.1 after.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1534734612438550">49</xref></sup> Improved local skin blood flow may be an important contributing factor to the reduced episodes of arm infection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1534734612438550">51</xref></sup> The point of bacterial entry may be a minor injury to the edematous skin, and impaired skin blood flow may respond inadequately to counteract impending infection. Reducing the excess volume by liposuction increases skin blood flow in the arm, and decreases the reservoir of adipose tissue, which may enhance bacterial overgrowth.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-1534734612438550">
<title>Potential Negative Effects to the Patient</title>
<p>Liposuction typically leads to numbness in the skin, which disappears within 3 to 6 months. Continuous, that is, lifelong wearing of compression garments is a prerequisite of maintaining the effect of any lymphedema treatment and should not be considered as a negative effect.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-1534734612438550">
<title>When to Perform Liposuction</title>
<p>In all patients with arm lymphedema treated so far at our department (n = 94), the mean age of the patient at the time of surgery was 64 years (range 41-89 years), with a mean duration of arm swelling of 9 years (range = 1-38 years). Mean age at breast cancer operation and mean interval between breast cancer operation and onset of lymphedema were 52 years (34-80) and 3 years (0-32), respectively. The preoperative mean excess arm volume was 1729 mL (570-3195).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1534734612438550">32</xref></sup> In short, there is no age limit for performing surgery. Any patient with a nonpitting swelling that causes a considerable decreased quality of life can be a candidate for surgery. Surgery should not be performed if the patient has active cancer or wounds.</p>

<sec id="section18-1534734612438550">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>There need be no tension between those who favor conservative treatment and the proponents of liposuction. Accumulated lymph should be removed using the well-documented conservative regimens until minimal or no pitting is seen. If there is still a significant excess volume, this can be removed by the use of liposuction. In some patients, increased fibrous tissue can be present, especially in male patients and in women with a male distribution of body fat. When seen, fibrous tissue is more common in leg than in arm lymphedema. Continuous wearing of a compression garment prevents recurrence.</p>
