<abstract>
<p>In the 1970s, a rolling contact fatigue defect that was christened a squat was identified on the British railway network, primarily at first on the West Coast Main Line. Two productive decades of international research on squats followed, which later contributed to a rapid understanding of gauge corner cracking, which differs in detail but is similar in many important respects to a classic squat. In the last 10–15 years, a rail defect that is superficially similar to the classic squat has appeared on several railways. This has been investigated in some detail, initially in Australia and more recently also in Europe as part of the Innotrack project. These investigations have both assumed that the investigated defect is a classic squat. This paper reviews research on the squat and on its younger cousin. It forms the basis for a companion paper that presents original observations from track and detailed metallurgical examinations of specimens of the more recent squat-type defect. The review in this paper is used in the companion paper to identify features of the two types of defects that are similar and those that are significantly different.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0954409711422189"><title>1 INTRODUCTION</title>
<p>After British Rail (BR) upgraded their heavily used west coast main line (WCML) in the 1960s and 1970s, there was a significant increase in rail damage. Corrugation increased in both extent and severity, and a type of defect was noted that had hitherto been of such little consequence that a name did not even exist for it. Corrugation proved to be an irritation that increased the requirement for rail grinding, but the as-yet unnamed defect was significantly more pernicious. In particular it was found that if these remained in track, there was a high chance of the rail breaking e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954409711422189">Fig. 1</xref>. These defects were christened squats in one of the more prosaic contributions of railway engineers to etymology. Charles Frederick, who led much of the early research on squats at British Rail Research (BRR) has explained the origin of this term as follows (C. O. Frederick, 2007, personal communication)<disp-quote>
<p>The term squat originated on the western region of BR and it came up as a subject at the Permanent Way Subcommittee. We accepted it as a term which was distinct from head checks or gauge corner fatigue.

<p>The name derives from the apparent crack formation shape on the running table of the rail; it looks as though a very heavy gnome has sat or squatted on the rail producing an indentation shape with two lobes of similar size.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>History does not record if BRR calculated the weight of this ubiquitous gnome whose predilection for sitting on rails has caused so much trouble to the world's railways. Nevertheless, the two very distinct lobes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954409711422189">Fig. 2</xref>) are one of the most prominent superficial characteristics of both squats and what are termed, for the time being, squat-type defects. Almost two decades of extremely productive research was undertaken from the mid-1970s to the mid-1990s, which included a full gamut of activities: mathematical modelling, small-scale modelling in laboratory roller rigs, and field investigations. It was also realized that the European gnome had an oriental cousin who was causing the “black spots” that plagued the high-speed Shinkansen lines in Japan at the same time. This led to a convergence in research although slightly different approaches were taken to examine and produce solutions to this novel problem.
<fig id="fig2-0954409711422189" position="float"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Appearance of a squat (courtesy of CO Frederick, formerly of BRR)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954409711422189-fig2.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>It was concluded that a squat is a rolling contact fatigue (RCF) defect that originates in the heavily sheared surface layer of the rail. If squats are periodic with a spacing equal to the circumference of the wheel, as is sometimes observed, these have probably arisen from indentations caused by hard material that has been picked up on the wheel tread [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954409711422189">1</xref></bold>]. Surface shearing arises from high surface tractions and traction ratios associated with locomotives and power cars. Cracks initiate in the layer of relatively soft inter-granular ferrite. Squats subsequently develop under the influence of a fluid (usually water) until the crack moves beyond the near-surface layer of compressive residual stress (which typically exists to a depth of about 5 mm). Cracks can then branch, forming transverse defects if they are allowed to develop in an uncontrolled manner down into the rail or spalls on the rare occasions that they branch towards the surface. These stages in the mechanism of crack development, which are essentially identical to those in development of head checks from the gauge corner of the rail, are summarized in a review of RCF [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954409711422189">2</xref></bold>].</p>
<p>This paper first reviews historical work on squats (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec2-0954409711422189">section 2</xref>) to provide some perspective for recent work on squat-type defects (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec3-0954409711422189">section 3</xref>), which has mainly been undertaken by Marich and his colleagues in Australia e.g. [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954409711422189">3</xref></bold>–<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954409711422189">5</xref></bold>] and by Li and his colleagues in Europe e.g. [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954409711422189">6</xref></bold>–<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0954409711422189">8</xref></bold>]. It appears with the benefit of hindsight that the defects noted in the late 1990s by Varejas Fassarella <italic>et al</italic>. [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0954409711422189">9</xref></bold>] on the Carajas railway in Brazil may be the same squat-type defects. There are certainly some similarities (including presence on a heavy haul line with which squats were not associated at all in the 1970s to 1990s), but it is no longer possible to be confident given the limited description of these defects. Kondo <italic>et al</italic>. [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0954409711422189">10</xref></bold>] have also stated that two types of black spots were present on the Tokaido Shinkansen: one with horizontal cracks ‘which develops at a depth of 3–6 mm in the direction of traffic’ and a transverse crack, which in the worst case terminates with a rail break. The possible significance of this difference appears to have been overlooked at the time, although it is now clear that there are significant similarities between the black spot with horizontal cracks and defects on which there has been research more recently.</p>
<p>Railway systems, suppliers, and others have published rail defect manuals, many of which discuss squats. Two such manuals of particular interest here are those produced by Railtrack plc in the UK [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954409711422189">1</xref></bold>] and by ARTC in Australia [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0954409711422189">11</xref></bold>]. In the first guide, squats are given what might be termed the classic treatment of being an RCF defect, with unsurprising reference to the work of BRR, whereas in the ARTC guide the more recent squat-type defects are treated in particular depth, with several photographs and discussion of possible causes. The Railtrack guide was completed with remarkable speed following the Hatfield derailment on 17 October 2000. A first version was drafted (largely by Roger Allen of Railtrack) in November 2000 and revised by the three co-authors in December. The guide was published in February 2001. Seldom does anything happen in the British railway industry with such speed.</p>
<p>The rail defect handbooks that are issued by railway systems are not discussed here since their intention is primarily to provide those who inspect track with a routine method of classifying defects based on visual inspection. These handbooks might change as a result of ongoing work, and by future research in this area (including that reported in the accompanying paper [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0954409711422189">12</xref></bold>]). However, any such change at present would be premature.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-0954409711422189"><title>2 SQUATS: INITIATION, PROPAGATION, AND INFLUENCES, THE HISTORICAL UNDERSTANDING</title>
<p>Research on squats in the UK was essentially a collaborative venture between BRR and Cambridge University. Clayton, Allery and their colleagues were responsible for the majority of work at BRR, including excellent metallurgical analysis and painstaking field measurements e.g. [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0954409711422189">13</xref></bold>–<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0954409711422189">15</xref></bold>]. In many cases the sites for field measurements were used also to examine corrugation development. At one set of sites near Rugby on the WCML grinding was undertaken to different depths on existing rail and new rail was ground to examine the effect on development of both squats and corrugation [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0954409711422189">13</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0954409711422189">16</xref></bold>]. Cross-sectioning showed that squats initiated at the rail surface and grew at an acute angle to the surface (about 20°) along the lines of heavily sheared ferrite in the pearlitic rail steel, e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954409711422189">Fig. 3</xref>. This is also shown in some detail in [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954409711422189">1</xref></bold>].
<fig id="fig3-0954409711422189" position="float"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Cross-sections of a squat (courtesy of CO Frederick, formerly of BRR): (a) global view; (b) detail showing development at about 20° to the rail surface; and (c) etched cross-section showing deformed pearlite and crack development along layer of heavily sheared ferrite</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954409711422189-fig3.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>Contact stresses were sufficient to shear the surface layer and initiate the crack, but another mechanism was required to explain how cracks grew further into the rail. This was the hydraulic entrapment model of Bower and Johnson [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0954409711422189">17</xref></bold>], which was subsequently used also to study head checking and gauge corner cracking (GCC). The need for a fluid to cause small cracks to propagate provided a reason for the heretofore unexplained peculiarity that had been observed particularly in Japan, that squats vanished as soon as the railway entered a tunnel. The work of Bower and Johnson highlighted also the need for a combination of high contact stress and high traction ratios to initiate damage at the rail surface, as illustrated on the so-called shakedown diagram. Although Clayton and Allery were amongst the earliest to propose that routine rail grinding should be used to control RCF defects [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0954409711422189">13</xref></bold>], their recommendation was not followed in the UK until more than two decades afterwards, when the Hatfield derailment forced a rapid reconsideration of rail maintenance.</p>
<p>Work in Japan included considerable disc machine work to reproduce the phenomenon e.g. [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0954409711422189">18</xref></bold>] and confirmation of the desirability of grinding rails to control development of RCF defects in general, and squats in particular [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0954409711422189">10</xref></bold>]. Monitoring undertaken on Shinkansen lines gave a rough idea of the rates at which squats developed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954409711422189">Fig. 4</xref>) and showed that a few tens of MGT of traffic were required to initiate the seeds of a squat. Grinding is best undertaken at that time to arrest squat development. About 100 MGT of traffic was required for a crack to develop to the edge of the layer of compressive residual stress that exists below the running surface of the rail. This life is broadly consistent with experience on railways elsewhere:

<p>It has been commonly noted that squats are initiated at the gauge corner edge of the running band and at a slight angle to the rolling direction [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954409711422189">1</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0954409711422189">13</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0954409711422189">19</xref></bold>]. Bogdanski and Brown [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0954409711422189">20</xref></bold>] have demonstrated why this is the preferred morphology of a squat.</p>
<p>The significance of squats as a topic of research can be gauged from the proceedings of the conferences on Contact Mechanics and Wear of Rail/Wheel Systems, which started in 1982. Squats were a significant topic of papers at conferences in 1982, 1986, and 1990, but there were relatively few papers on the subject in 1994, 2000, and 2003. Squats continued to be a problem for railway systems (particularly for those that undertook none of the remedial measures whose effectiveness had been thoroughly demonstrated), but they ceased to be a problem of significant research interest because they were thought to be well understood.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-0954409711422189"><title>3 SQUAT-TYPE DEFECTS: RECENT WORK</title>
<p>The work by Marich and his colleagues [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954409711422189">3</xref></bold>–<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954409711422189">5</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0954409711422189">11</xref></bold>] is certainly the earliest and probably the most comprehensive treatment to date of the type of defect that is referred to for the time being as a squat-type defect. Marich and his colleagues were well aware of previous work on squats including the historic association of this defect with relatively lightly loaded, high-speed passenger lines and their apparently negligible presence on heavy haul lines. Their specific concern was with the heavy haul coal lines of the Hunter Valley in Australia, on which squat-type defects were first noted in the early 1990s. Grinding was first undertaken to control these defects as early as 1994/1995 [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954409711422189">4</xref></bold>]. These defects are associated with loaded coal traffic only: none are observed on the lines carrying empty coal cars. The defects are associated with shallow curves and tangent track. They had reached epidemic proportions by the early 2000s e.g. in January 2001 68 defects were noted in barely 500 m between the 165.23 km and 166.05 km locations [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954409711422189">3</xref></bold>]. Despite the large number of defects, there was no record of a defect having ever broken a rail. Marich and his colleagues observe that this is distinctly different from experience with squats on high-speed lines.</p>
<p>It is suggested that there exist two types of defect with similar characteristics: defects on the rail crown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954409711422189">Fig. 5</xref>) and those initiated close to or at the gauge corner [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954409711422189">3</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0954409711422189">11</xref></bold>]. From the evidence presented in [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954409711422189">3</xref></bold>] and [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0954409711422189">11</xref></bold>] it appears that the second is more a form of GCC or head checking. The defects on the rail crown, such as those shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954409711422189">Fig. 5</xref>, clearly display lobes that are characteristic of squats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954409711422189">Fig. 2</xref>). Surface-breaking cracks are plainly visible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954409711422189">Fig. 5</xref>), but the most significant cracking in the rail is at a depth of 3–6 mm, as is apparent from a cross-section through a defect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0954409711422189">Fig. 6</xref>).
<fig id="fig5-0954409711422189" position="float"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><p>Defect on rail crown (courtesy of S Marich and S Mackie); material such as that shown ringed appears to be WEL</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954409711422189-fig5.tif"/></fig>

<p>The Australian experience is also that a hard white-etching layer (WEL) is associated with some of the smaller defects. It is proposed that this becomes detached from larger defects, since it is no longer apparent. Two mechanisms have been proposed in the literature to explain WEL: wheel slip, giving rise to high surface temperatures followed by rapid quenching due to the high thermal inertia of the rail, or high rates of adiabatic shear [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0954409711422189">21</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0954409711422189">22</xref></bold>]. There is certainly evidence from field measurements in the UK of sufficient slip to cause WEL by thermal transformation [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0954409711422189">16</xref></bold>]. Marich and Mackie [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954409711422189">3</xref></bold>] consider high rates of adiabatic shear to be the more likely cause of WEL around the defects they observed. They also propose that detachment of WEL is the most likely mechanism for initiation of defects. They accordingly conclude that<disp-quote>
<p>the squat defects examined are not really of a rolling contact fatigue nature, as has been indicated in the literature, at least in their early stages of development.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Li and his colleagues are the second group that has published widely in the area of squat-type defects e.g. [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954409711422189">6</xref></bold>–<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0954409711422189">8</xref></bold>]. Their principal interest lies in the defects that have arisen and become widespread on the Dutch railway network in the last decade. An example of the defects noted by Li and his colleagues is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954409711422189">Fig. 7</xref>, in which short wave corrugation has developed from the more substantial defect. They note some of the same superficial features as those noted by Marich and his colleagues e.g. an association of defects with sites where there exists high traction or braking effort [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0954409711422189">8</xref></bold>] and the presence of multiple defects in some locations. They examine the hardness variation along a rail and demonstrate that hardness is lower at welds, which are preferred locations for these defects. They do not comment on the association or otherwise of WEL with squat-type defects.
<fig id="fig7-0954409711422189" position="float"><label>Fig. 7</label><caption><p>Corrugation initiated from defect on rail crown; traffic from left to right (from [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0954409711422189">8</xref></bold>])</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954409711422189-fig7.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>Li and his colleagues have undertaken detailed examination of the development of individual defects on the rail surface over a period of time e.g. [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0954409711422189">8</xref></bold>]. They consider the case of a small irregularity existing on the railhead, calculate the resulting dynamic contact force, and find that for the predominant speeds of trains at these sites, there are peaks in contact force along the rail whose spacing corresponds quite closely to the spacing of the depressions in the rail that are characteristic of a squat: ‘the wavelength is determined by the eigen-characteristics of the system’ [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0954409711422189">8</xref></bold>]. It is then postulated that a second peak occurs as a result of ratchetting associated with the high contact forces caused by the first irregularity.</p>
<p>There are significant open questions raised by the work of Li and his colleagues. It is fundamental to their hypothesis that there must first exist an isolated irregularity that gives rise to the fluctuations in contact force. What causes these isolated irregularities? It is asserted that there may exist ‘squats initiated and growing from defects without cracks’ [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0954409711422189">8</xref></bold>]. Such defects may exist (although metallurgical cross-sectioning was not undertaken by Li and his colleagues to demonstrate the absence of cracks), but they are manifestly not the classic squat treated in the work that was undertaken from the mid-1970s to the late-1990s [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0954409711422189">10</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0954409711422189">13</xref></bold>–<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0954409711422189">20</xref></bold>] and which is treated, for example, in the manual issued by Railtrack [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954409711422189">1</xref></bold>]. In all of these cases, the squat was regarded as an RCF defect, cross-sectioning showed there to be two sub-surface cracks (the trailing crack being rather longer than the leading crack). Broadening of the contact path around the squat (giving the characteristic black spot) arose from greater plastic flow of the poorly supported layers above the cracks. The model of Li and his colleagues provides a very good explanation for the development of corrugation from isolated railhead irregularities, as illustrated (for example) in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954409711422189">Fig. 7</xref>. However, it is unclear why the first two cycles of dynamic load are associated with substantial flow and broadening of the running band, whereas subsequent cycles are associated with corrugation development from what is apparently differential wear. It is also unclear why sub-surface cracking exists for the defect that was regarded as a squat in the classic literature on the subject e.g. [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954409711422189">1</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0954409711422189">10</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0954409711422189">13</xref></bold>–<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0954409711422189">20</xref></bold>], even if it does not exist in at least some of those defects found more recently on the Dutch railway network.</p>

<sec id="sec4-0954409711422189"><title>4 CONCLUSIONS</title>
<p>A great deal of research was done from the mid-970s to the mid-1990s on a rail defect that is commonly known as a squat. In the last 10–15 years a rail defect has appeared on several different types of railway system that is similar in many respects to the classic squat, and which has indeed been considered to date to be the same defect.</p>
<p>The following conclusions were reached from the research on squats that was undertaken primarily in Europe and Japan.
<list id="list2-0954409711422189" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Squats are a surface-initiated RCF defect. These are initiated at the gauge-corner edge of the contact band and at an angle to the running direction. The crack is initiated in the heavily sheared and plastically deformed surface layer of the rail.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>When squats appear periodically at a spacing that is equal to the circumference of the wheel, they have probably initiated from indentations caused by hard material that has been picked up by a wheel.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The defects are associated with driving traction i.e. locomotives and power cars, rather than curving traction.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>They are associated with straight track and gentle curves, but not with severe curves.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Water (or possibly a liquid lubricant) is critical to crack propagation. Squats are not present in tunnels because water is absent.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The initial crack propagates as a result primarily of fluid entrapment at an angle of about 20° to the rail surface, roughly normal to the crack mouth on the surface, and in the direction of traffic. If neither the crack nor the loading is removed, this crack propagates further into the rail and in most cases develops into a transverse defect.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>A shorter crack often develops in the opposite direction e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954409711422189">Fig. 3</xref>(a). Development of this crack is limited because fluid cannot become entrapped within it. Nevertheless, the two sub-surface cracks are responsible for the two lobes that are characteristic of squats when viewed from above.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Squats are initiated after a few tens of MGT of traffic. A total of 100 MGT of traffic or more is required for squats to develop into a crack that would be detectable by conventional ultrasonic testing.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Squats can be well controlled by preventative maintenance of rails. Routine, shallow metal removal at the typical period required for initiation of squats i.e. about 40 MGT is an excellent practical method for controlling these defects.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>Considerably less work has been undertaken on the squat-type defects that have become the subject of research in the last 10–15 years. The following observations can be made on published work to date.
<list id="list3-0954409711422189" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>The defects have a clear superficial similarity with squats, particularly insofar as there are two characteristic lobes on the rail surface.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The defects are associated with sites where there is high driving traction. In such locations there may be dozens of defects within a few hundred metres.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The defects have been found on heavy haul lines, whereas the squats on which research was undertaken in the mid-1970s to mid-1990s were a problem almost exclusively of relatively high-speed passenger or mixed-traffic lines with light axle loads.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The principal crack that registers as an ultrasonic defect is at a depth of about 3–5 mm below the rail surface.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Some association is reported between the defects and WEL. Detachment of the WEL is proposed by one of the two groups that have worked on this problem to date as the most likely mechanism for crack initiation. A high rate of adiabatic shear is considered to be the most likely mechanism giving rise to WEL.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>The second group that has worked in this area to date proposes that sub-surface cracking is not necessarily a characteristic of squats. They propose that squats initiate as a result of plastic flow associated with high dynamic loads resulting from isolated irregularities on the rail.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>There is a tendency for defects to be more prevalent at welds.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Corrugation is associated in some cases with the defects, although it is not clear whether the corrugation has initiated defects or <italic>vice versa</italic>.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>There has been some success with the use of rail grinding to treat defects, but the success of this treatment is limited by the rate at which the defects recur.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>There is no record to date of a rail break having arisen from one of these defects.</p></list-item>

<title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title>
<p>An earlier version of this summary of historical understanding on squats was written for TubeLines Ltd in 2007 after they engaged the author to advise on squat-type defects. Dr Grassie is grateful to Tubelines Ltd for supporting that work. He is also indebted to Mr C.O. Frederick, formerly of BRR, for his comments on the history of the phenomenon and for the use of photographs and to Stephen Marich and Stephen Mackie for discussion of squat-type defects and access to their unpublished work. The original research that was undertaken for TubeLines Ltd forms the substance of a companion paper. Parts of both the review and the original research were presented at the Eighth International Conference on Contact Mechanics and Wear of Rail/Wheel Systems in Florence in September 2009.</p></ack>
