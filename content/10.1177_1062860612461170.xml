<p>China is now the world’s second largest economy. With coffers flush from economic expansion, the Chinese government is providing more financial support for basic research. Much of the money has been disbursed through the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Science and Technology, and other such outlets. Financial support for medical research comes from government agencies as well as nongovernmental organizations, universities, and hospitals. However, the majority is from government, especially the national government. The Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC), the government agency at the national level, is responsible for funding major scientific research projects in the country. It awarded 18 billion RMB yuan (US$3 billion) in research project grants alone in 2011<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1062860612461170">1</xref></sup> and funds the majority of biomedical research in China. In 2011, funding allocated to medical research was about 3 billion RMB yuan (US$0.5 billion),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1062860612461170">2</xref></sup> accounting for approximately 17% of the total NSFC funding that year. Such funding provides significant motivation to medical institutes and researchers. Such expenditure on scientific research has never been seen before in China. At the same time, close attention has been paid to research evaluation. One of the most important measurements is publication, especially articles published in science citation index (SCI) journals. The publication of SCI articles is commonly considered in decisions involving the assessment of the quality and impact of funded research, the recruitment and advancement of university faculty, and the awarding of grants. Because of this, scientific publication has been booming. The total number of SCI articles authored by Chinese researchers ranked second in the world in 2011, and the total number of scientific publications citations moved up to rank 7 in the world. As a result, publication has been greatly encouraged and has even become mandatory in some universities and research units.</p>
<p>China has the largest scientific workforce in the world. The publication of Chinese articles in internationally indexed journals represents a positive trend, as evidenced by bibliometrics data on articles published in the SCI database. With the impressive increase in Chinese articles being published in the English language, the scientific findings and advancements in the Chinese medical field have become more accessible to the rest of the world. However, the development of Chinese medical research has not mirrored the enormous economic progress in China. According to the Essential Science Indicators database, an international comparison of the output of scientific articles in medicine reveals that China is not among the top 5 in the number of documents and citations received during the period 2001 to 2011.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that the number of scientific articles from China published in international journals each year is almost the same as for the United States, Chinese researchers are underrepresented at the upper levels of scientific publication. The current volume of medical research output in China is immense, but this does not appear to have had much impact on China’s scientific reputation. The production of scientific publications in the field of medicine in China is far below the economic level of the country and is clearly lower than the production in some other fields (eg, chemistry, mathematics, physics). Furthermore, the increase in citations per article lags significantly when compared with the increase in the number of articles. In addition, there has been a lower level of academic achievement in clinical research in China when compared with the West. To date, articles from Chinese researchers in this area are scarcely published in leading journals and rarely are these Chinese reports influential.</p>
<p>Why is this so? Certainly lack of money is not the reason.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most important deficiency is a favorable environment for research. Hardware (eg, equipment, devices) is vital, but the culture of scientific research is equally important, if not more so. Unfortunately, the academic atmosphere in China is not conducive. Academic bureaucracy and an official-oriented system exert a negative influence, hindering researchers from concentrating on scientific investigation, which is supposedly their primary task. Many leading scientists who are appointed to administrative positions must face seemingly endless, time-consuming administrative work and therefore cannot commit themselves fully to research. The result is that the capacity of researchers and precious research time are being wasted.</p>
<p>Medical education reform in China lags behind economic reform in both depth and scope. The education system is centrally administered. The Ministry of Education is responsible for general educational policy making for all aspects of education, including medical education, whereas the Ministry of Health is responsible for professional administration. At present, problem-based learning in China is still in its infancy, especially in traditional Chinese medicine. This is partly because of certain characteristics of educational philosophy inherited from China’s lengthy past, which has its roots in traditional Chinese culture. Failing to equip postgraduates with research skills translates into a failure to address medical research in practice. In postgraduate education, many students are self-directed to seek research topics by reading the literature rather than by attending established programs. This is primarily because of a lack of programs. Additionally, the research support provided to students is poor, and in many cases, supervision is unsatisfactory. The expansion of enrollment in colleges and universities in China has put students in furious competition for employment after graduation. Because scientific publication may enhance the chances of obtaining higher-level and more satisfying positions in the future, many students engage in research but target solely journal publication, leading to a number of low-quality publications.</p>
<p>China’s medical education system produces good physicians, but very few of them are trained to be clinical investigators. Most clinicians are not familiar with statistics, and postgraduate training in clinical research is rarely offered in medical schools. Although fast patient recruitment provides a large amount and a wide variety of clinical materials, the complex national infrastructures needed for clinical research are still insufficient, such as the platforms necessary for ethics approval and the administration of multicenter trials.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1062860612461170">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Furthermore, there is a serious flaw in China’s funding system for projects, in that it favors 1-shot projects: that is, revolution, not evolution. Short deadlines are often set for projects, but unreasonably short deadlines can be counterproductive. This system is likely to encourage short-term and insufficiently or even poorly developed research<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1062860612461170">4</xref></sup> and makes funds an end in themselves. Driven by the deadlines, researchers are in haste to publish articles that mark the completion of projects. Otherwise, they may not receive successive funding. However, only well-developed research can produce high-quality articles. The consequence is that most Chinese research articles fail to be published in the world’s leading scientific journals.</p>
<p>Another problem is that the allocation of funding is unbalanced. The granting of funds often may be influenced by the social connections, administrative status, and political influence of the applicants.</p>
<p>Professional promotion of a researcher is often decided based on academic performance; the number of articles published is a very important, if not the most important, decisive factor. However, different levels of articles are published. The quality and influence of an article depends on the impact factor of the journal in which it has published and how many times it has been cited. In some Chinese institutions in which academic performance or research output is measured based on the number of publications, the quality of the articles is ignored.</p>
<p>The number of basic science researchers in China is far from satisfactory. Many talented people choose to be practicing physicians or administrators who may be better paid or respected, rather than researchers, and sustainable development of researchers has been ignored.</p>
<p>International publication requires English language skills. For Chinese researchers, for whom English is a second language, writing research articles in English is a daunting task. Most research findings of Chinese medical researchers have been traditionally published in Chinese in scientific journals in China. Obviously, the scientific information in China probably has reached only a very limited range of researchers worldwide.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1062860612461170">5</xref></sup> To make China’s scientific research known to the world, researchers must publish in English—the universal scientific language—in internationally distributed journals.</p>
<p>We are soberly aware of the gap between China and some developed countries in the field of medical research. There is much to do to close this gap. To cope with increasing international competition, innovation in medical research in China is urgently needed. The existing deficiencies should be addressed, which will require the joint efforts of policy makers, administrators, and researchers.</p>
