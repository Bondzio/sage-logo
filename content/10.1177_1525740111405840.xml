<abstract>
<p>This study considered the efficacy of a differentiated approach to vocabulary instruction for learners with word-finding difficulties (WFD) in the speech and language pathologist’s room. Using a pretest–posttest design to study treatment outcomes, 10 second graders with WFD received first semantic-based vocabulary instruction (S) and then semantic- and phonological-based vocabulary instruction (S &amp; P). The S instruction focused on teaching only the semantic properties of words, whereas the S &amp; P vocabulary instruction focused on teaching both semantic and phonological properties of words. Lexical factors of words taught were studied in reference to their influence on vocabulary instruction. Greater expressive language normalized gains were revealed for learners with WFD following the S &amp; P approach to instruction as compared to the S approach. Phonotactic probability influenced success; learners found words consisting of common phoneme sequences easier to learn. Thus, for learners with WFD, expressive language learning was enhanced when form-based strategies were added to the semantic-based teaching paradigm.</p>

<p>Michael said, “I feel stupid. I raise my hand to answer and then I forget it. . . . I feel really embarrassed. Everybody’s listening. I don’t know. . . . I had it in my head and I raise my hand and when she calls on me I forget it.”</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Michael’s voice informs us that even though he studied his vocabulary and knows the word that would answer the teacher’s question, he is unable to retrieve it. His self-reflection describes the classic definition of word finding, a discrepancy between knowing a word and being able to access that same word for spontaneous usage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1525740111405840">German, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1525740111405840">Messer &amp; Dockrell, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1525740111405840">Sheng &amp; McGregor, 2010</xref>). Michael is not alone in his frustration with his word-finding difficulties (WFD). Child word finding prevalence rates are high: As many as 25% of learners with specific language impairment have been predicted to have WFD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1525740111405840">Messer &amp; Dockrell, 2006</xref>), and 49% of students with learning disabilities have been reported to have underlying WFD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1525740111405840">German, 1998</xref>). Furthermore, researchers have documented WFD among learners with difficulties in reading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1525740111405840">Faust, Dimitrovsky,&amp; Shacht, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1525740111405840">Messer, Dockrell, &amp; Murphy, 2004</xref>) and written language (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1525740111405840">Scott, 2002</xref>.).</p>
<p>Difficulties in Word Finding (WF) can result in significant expressive language problems that interfere with communication and can impede learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1525740111405840">German, 2005</xref>). In particular, vocabulary learning for students with WFD, like Michael, can be challenging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1525740111405840">Montgomery, 2007b</xref>). Vocabulary acquisition demands are high; learners are expected to acquire 3,000 to 4,000 words per year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1525740111405840">Nagy &amp; Anderson, 1984</xref>), curriculum state standards expect learners to demonstrate ability to use learned words, and vocabulary learning affects other academic learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1525740111405840">Blachowicz &amp; Fisher, 2004</xref>). Consequently, difficulties with vocabulary can affect learning across the curriculum. Therefore, learners with WFD could have difficulty meeting standards for vocabulary in response to intervention–Tier 1 (RTI-Tier 1) classrooms and core curriculum instruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1525740111405840">Wallach, 2008</xref>) as well as be at risk for school failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1525740111405840">Nippold &amp; Schwarz, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Contemporary models of vocabulary instruction do include enlightened pedagogy, such as repeated readings and word explanations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1525740111405840">Biemiller &amp; Boote, 2006</xref>), story retellings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1525740111405840">Lueng, 2008</xref>), use of context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1525740111405840">Nash &amp; Snowling, 2006</xref>), and extended exposure to vocabulary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1525740111405840">Coyne, McCoach, &amp; Kapp, 2007</xref>). Although these current models of vocabulary instruction result in most learners being able to access known words, their focus on learning semantic representations of words may not be enough for learners with WFD. Often, students with WFD are not successful in bridging their newly learned vocabulary and their lexical access skills. They thus have difficulty retrieving learned words in school assessments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1525740111405840">German, 2005</xref>). Like Michael, they cannot demonstrate their vocabulary knowledge. It may be that learners with WFD need a more differentiated approach to vocabulary instruction. Thus, in the study reported in here, we chose to explore whether students who already had an individualized education program (IEP) for word finding would be more successful in their vocabulary learning if they received vocabulary instruction that linked the semantic and phonological aspects of vocabulary. If so, it may be that this linked approach to vocabulary instruction would also be beneficial for learners with vocabulary difficulties in the classroom (RTI-Tier 2 interventions) and/or in the language group of the speech and language pathologist (SLP; RTI-Tier 3 interventions).</p>
<p>Child language research has suggested that the etiology of WFD may be semantic based (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1525740111405840">German, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1525740111405840">Messer &amp; Dockrell, 2006</xref>) and/or form based (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1525740111405840">Constable, Stackhouse, &amp; Wells, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1525740111405840">German, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1525740111405840">2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1525740111405840">German &amp; Newman, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1525740111405840">McGregor, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1525740111405840">Messer &amp; Dockrell, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1525740111405840">Sheng &amp; McGregor, 2010</xref>), depending on the nature of the learner’s WFD and the lexical factors of the vocabulary being learned (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1525740111405840">German &amp; Newman, 2004</xref>). Therefore, for purposes of this investigation, it seemed reasonable to create a differentiated approach to vocabulary instruction that would incorporate both semantic and phonological treatments to anchor school vocabulary for meaningful and automatic usage. To measure the efficacy of this linked method of vocabulary instruction in school contexts, students’ vocabulary learning was compared when provided a semantic-based (S) approach only to vocabulary instruction versus a semantic-and phonological-based (S &amp; P) approach.</p>
<sec id="section1-1525740111405840">
<title>Semantic-Based Approach to Vocabulary Instruction</title>
<p>The vocabulary instruction focuses on developing a pupil’s semantic representation of the word. Current functional models of vocabulary instruction emphasize explicit instruction of words and concepts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1525740111405840">Montgomery, 2007a</xref>), reinforcement of metalinguistic knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1525740111405840">Nagy, 2007</xref>), mindful selection of word types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1525740111405840">Beck, McKeown, &amp; Kucan, 2002</xref>), and the establishment of instructional routines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1525740111405840">Archer, 2008</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1525740111405840">Nagy (2007)</xref> suggested that vocabulary instruction include metalinguistic awareness activities; that is, knowing what a word is, understanding its definition, interpreting its context, and recognizing its syntax and morphology. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1525740111405840">Beck et al. (2002)</xref> encouraged professionals to be mindful of the inherent hierarchy embedded in students’ vocabulary groups, basic words (Tier 1), high-frequency words (Tier 2), and low-frequency domain-specific words (Tier 3). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1525740111405840">Montgomery (2007a</xref>) recommended that professionals select from all three word groups when planning vocabulary instruction. In addition, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1525740111405840">Archer (2008)</xref> emphasized establishing instructional routines when teaching vocabulary like introducing “student-friendly definitions” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1525740111405840">Beck et al., 2002</xref>, p. 35), illustrating word examples, and checking learners’ word understanding.</p>
<p>The aforementioned research was considered in developing the S vocabulary lessons for each word taught in this investigation. Because our study was school centered, we focused on Tier 3 domain-specific science and math vocabulary. In addition, each S (and phonological-based) vocabulary lesson highlighted metalinguistic features of the word learning process. An instructional routine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1525740111405840">Archer, 2008</xref>) was followed for each word taught. The word was introduced, “student-friendly explanations” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1525740111405840">Beck et al., 2002</xref>, p. 35) were created to explain word meaning, and multiple examples and nonexamples of the word were shared across various contexts.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1525740111405840">
<title>Semantic- and Phonological- Based Approach to Vocabulary Instruction</title>
<p>The S &amp; P approach to vocabulary instruction focused on both establishing and accessing the semantic and phonological representations of words. The semantic portion of the lesson incorporated the activities discussed above. The phonological portion of the vocabulary lesson focused on the phonological properties of the vocabulary taught. Earlier studies in child language and learning disabilities, and lexical access models in cognitive science, guided development of the phonological portion of the lesson.</p>
<p>In the area of child language, a body of research has indicated that learners with WFD can improve their WF skills using various phonological strategies, such as thinking of or producing word rhymes and initial sounds and counting syllables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1525740111405840">Best, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1525740111405840">German, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1525740111405840">McGregor, 1994</xref>). Concurrently, research in memory strategies in the field of learning disabilities has demonstrated the usefulness of applying mnemonic strategies (keywords, pegwords, and letter strategies) to improve students’ recall of vocabulary on assessments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1525740111405840">Fontana, Scruggs, &amp; Mastropieri, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1525740111405840">Uberti, Scruggs, &amp; Mastropieri, 2003</xref>). Given the reported success of phonological-based strategies to improve WF and the advantages noted in using mnemonic strategies to enhance learners’ memory for words, our investigation included metalinguistic reinforcement of the word’s syllabic structure and application of phonemic mnemonics to anchor the word’s form.</p>
<p>Our development of form-based vocabulary instruction was also guided by architectural models of lexical access (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1525740111405840">Levelt, 1989</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1525740111405840">1999</xref>) and the spreading-activation accounts of the processes that may occur among lexical components. Each is discussed below.</p>
<sec id="section3-1525740111405840">
<title>Lexical Architectural Model</title>
<p>Use of metalinguistic reinforcement activities and application of phonemic mnemonics in our vocabulary instruction was advised by an adapted architectural model of the lexicon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1525740111405840">Levelt, 1989</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1525740111405840">1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1525740111405840">2001</xref>) that focuses on those mechanisms thought to underlie single-word retrieval (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1525740111405840">German, 2000</xref>). Theoretically, this model proposes the involvement of three levels when accessing a word: (a) the word’s conceptual structure, (b) the word’s abstract lexical representation (semantic, syntactic, and form features), and (c) the word’s corresponding speech-motor program plan. Embedded in these three levels are four corresponding stages of single-word retrieval. At Stage 1, a triggering stimulus (desire to retrieve the word) links to the conceptual repository for the word. At Stage 2, the conceptual structural accesses the entry’s semantic and syntactic features (the lemma) from among neighboring entries. At Stage 3, the lemma accesses the entry’s corresponding phonological features (the syllabic frame and sound units) to create the phonological schema. Finally, at Stage 4, a motor plan is created and forwarded to lower level articulation processes to produce the word.</p>
<p>The phonological portion of the S &amp; P approach to vocabulary instruction focuses on reinforcing algorithms for lexical access of the word’s form. Theoretically it strengthens those lexical processes involved at the juncture between Stage 2 and Stage 3 above and at Stage 3 itself. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1525740111405840">Levelt (1989</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1525740111405840">2001</xref>), eliciting a word’s form includes accessing the word’s morphemic and syllabic structure and corresponding sound units. Therefore, form-based strategies for the phonological portion of the S &amp; P approach to vocabulary instruction included metalinguistic strategies to reinforce the phonological structure of words, the syllabic frame, and segmental sound units.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1525740111405840">
<title>Lexical Spreading-Activation Accounts</title>
<p>Development of the phonological mnemonic strategies used in the S &amp; P instructional approach was guided by lexical spreading-activation accounts of the processes that may occur among the lexical components discussed in the adapted model above (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1525740111405840">Dell, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1525740111405840">MacKay, 1987</xref>). Connectionist approaches to lexical access suggest that when a word is accessed, it is primed and activated. Priming prepares the word (node) for possible activation and, in turn, the activated word (node) primes all words (nodes) associated with it (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1525740111405840">Burke, MacKay, Worthley, &amp; Wade, 1991</xref>, for a more detailed report of these processes). Priming and activation processing models provided the impetus for selecting phonological word neighbors as mnemonic cues to aid in lexical access. In priming studies of children and adults, researchers have reported that primes similar in form to words facilitate activation and retrieval of those words during WF disruptions, “tip of the tongue” blocks on picture-naming tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1525740111405840">Brown, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1525740111405840">Burke et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1525740111405840">James &amp; Burke, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1525740111405840">McGregor &amp; Windsor, 1996</xref>). Informed by the findings of these priming investigations, we used words similar in sound form to word and word parts (phonological neighbors; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1525740111405840">Luce &amp; Pisoni, 1998</xref>) as mnemonic cues. It was thought that these cues would make an implicit linguistic process (priming) explicit by requiring the student to consciously think of a word’s phonological form. Pairing syllables of multisyllabic words to similar sounding words was also hypothesized to cue those word parts.</p>
<p>Therefore, the form-based mnemonic strategies were used to teach learners to associate evasive words or word syllables with cue words similar in sound (same-sounds cue; e.g., <italic>X is gone</italic> to cue <italic>hexagon</italic> in a math unit). Use of these form-based mnemonics differs from the semantic portion of the vocabulary lesson as S instruction cues the semantic attributes of the word (e.g., meaning cues such as <italic>six sided</italic> to remember the word <italic>hexagon</italic>) whereas form-based mnemonic strategies cue the phonological representations of the word. Last, to stabilize the word’s metalinguistic structure and students’ application of mnemonic cues, rehearsal strategies were employed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1525740111405840">German, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1525740111405840">2005</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1525740111405840">
<title>Nature of the Target Word</title>
<p>In addition to studying approaches to vocabulary instruction, we also considered the lexical factors of the words taught to see if these word properties might influence the ease with which the words were learned in either the S or S &amp; P vocabulary lessons. Our choice of lexical factors to examine was motivated by work on adult perception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1525740111405840">Luce &amp; Pisoni, 1998</xref>), sound learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1525740111405840">Storkel &amp; Morrisette, 2002</xref>), and earlier studies of word production in children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1525740111405840">German &amp; Newman, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1525740111405840">Newman &amp; German, 2002</xref>). We considered word frequency, phonotactic probability, and word length. These factors are highlighted below.</p>
<sec id="section6-1525740111405840">
<title>Word frequency</title>
<p>The frequency with which a word occurs in the language can influence the ease with which it is recognized and accessed. Studies have reported that low-frequency words tend to be recognized and produced more slowly and with less accuracy than more common words (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1525740111405840">Luce &amp; Pisoni, 1998</xref>). This effect of word frequency has been found not only in young adults but also in children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1525740111405840">German &amp; Newman, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1525740111405840">Newman &amp; German, 2002</xref>). Therefore, it seemed meaningful to consider if our students’ response to instruction would vary based on whether the words being taught were low or high frequency in occurrence.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1525740111405840">
<title>Phonotactic probability</title>
<p>This refers to the frequency with which a sound or sequence of sounds occurs in the language. Some sounds of words are infrequent (such as the /Δ/ in <italic>azure</italic>), whereas others are quite frequent in the language (such as /s/). Similarly, some phoneme sequences are rare (such as /mt/ in <italic>dreamt</italic>), whereas others are common (such as /nt/ in hunt). Phonotactic probability has an impact on repetition, recall, and production abilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1525740111405840">Gathercole, Frankish, Pickering, &amp; Peaker, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1525740111405840">Storkel &amp; Morrisette, 2002</xref>). In this investigation we examined whether the phonotactic probability affected word learning in the S and S &amp; P vocabulary lessons.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1525740111405840">
<title>Target word phoneme length</title>
<p>Previous studies have shown that children typically find it easier to recall and repeat shorter words than longer words (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1525740111405840">Gathercole et al., 1999</xref>) and that word length influences the type of WF error students manifest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1525740111405840">German &amp; Newman, 2004</xref>). These reported differences suggest that it would also be meaningful to study the influence of word length on learners’ responsiveness to vocabulary instruction.</p>

<title>Study Goals and Research Questions</title>
<p>Vocabulary instruction in school is most often focused on developing learners’ semantic representations of words. For many learners with WFD this may not be enough, as they are often not successful in meeting school standards for vocabulary. Thus, our goal was to explore the efficacy of an approach to vocabulary instruction that emphasized both semantic and phonological properties of words. To that end, we studied specific phonological strategies as part of an S &amp; P approach to vocabulary instruction to help learners gain word automaticity. The S &amp; P approach to vocabulary instruction was taught as part of a pullout program—small language groups in the SLP room. Our interest was to see if it would improve students’ retrieval of studied vocabulary such that it might be considered as a beneficial approach to WFD in an RTI setting. Furthermore, we investigated whether three lexical factors (frequency of occurrence, phonotactic probability, and word length) would affect the learning of these words in either of the two instructional approaches. We asked the following questions:</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>Two groups of students with WFD (designated as Group A and Group B) participated in this investigation: three boys and three girls in Group A and two boys and two girls in Group B. Students were enrolled in second grade and ranged in age from 7 years 11 months to 8 years 9 months. Participants had normal auditory and visual acuity and had not been referred or evaluated for primary emotional disturbance. All had an IEP with goals and benchmarks for WF intervention and were receiving ongoing language therapy from the school SLP in a language group for 30 minutes biweekly.</p>

<title>Materials</title>
<p>This study was a school-based rather than a laboratory-based intervention investigation. In such intervention studies, use of vocabulary from the school curriculum is recommended (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1525740111405840">German, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1525740111405840">Montgomery, 2007a</xref>). Thus, students were provided S and S &amp; P vocabulary instruction for academic words they would be expected to know and use spontaneously in the classroom to meet state standards. A total of 20 second-grade vocabulary words were taught: 10 science words and 10 math words (see the <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1525740111405840">appendix</xref>). These curriculum words were considered challenging to access because of their phonological complexity. The list consisted primarily of bisyllabic and multisyllabic words. The science and math words were matched for syllabic structure; 60% of the words contained three or more syllables, 20% contained two syllables; 10% were two-word targets, and 10% were monosyllabic words. However, as a result of adhering to the curricular vocabulary, we were not able to control certain vocabulary variables (e.g., frequency of prefixes and suffixes and conceptual complexity of words). Students’ difficulty with these words was verified by their low receptive and expressive pretest scores (as reported in the following Results section).</p>
<p>Three target word lexical factors—frequency, phonotactic probability, and phoneme length—were studied. The frequency of occurrence of each word was determined from word counts created by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1525740111405840">Kucera and Francis (1967)</xref>. (This is an older but still relevant database since frequency of usage of common words is reasonably stable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1525740111405840">Nagy, 2009]</xref>.) Frequencies were then transformed into log-frequency values. Length was determined by the number of phonemes in each word. Measures of phonotactic probability across the language were obtained from the online Phonotactic Probability Calculator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1525740111405840">Vitevitch &amp; Luce, 2004</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-1525740111405840">
<title>Design</title>
<p>We used a single-group pretest–posttest design in which students served as their own control. This quasi-experimental design used equivalent materials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1525740111405840">Campbell &amp; Stanley, 1963</xref>, p. 46) to compare students’ vocabulary learning (receptive and expressive) after being taught via the two instructional approaches. For 2 weeks, the school SLP used S vocabulary instruction to teach 10 words to the students. The following 2 weeks, the school SLP used the S &amp; P approach to vocabulary instruction to teach the other 10 words. The S teaching approach was used first to ensure that students would not inadvertently use form-based strategies learned in the S &amp; P approach when being taught using the S approach to vocabulary instruction.</p>
<p>The vocabulary program featured a pretest phase, a vocabulary instruction phase, a posttest phase, and a 3-week posttest maintenance phase. During the pretest phase, learners’ receptive and expressive baseline skills for studied vocabulary (20 words) were determined through receptive (multiple choice) and expressive (naming and fill-in-the-blank) pretesting. To not confound the receptive and expressive assessments, the receptive assessment required no oral production and the expressive assessment involved only naming. Four pretest scores were generated for each student: a receptive pretest score and an expressive pretest score on the words that were taught during Weeks 1 and 2 and a receptive pretest score and an expressive pretest score on the words that were taught during Weeks 3 and 4. During the posttest phase, four additional sets of posttest receptive and expressive scores were created for each student. Specifically, students were tested at the end of each week of instruction, and their scores from Weeks 1 and 2 (S approach) were combined, as were their scores from Weeks 3 and 4 (S &amp; P approach). Finally, in a maintenance phase 3 weeks poststudy, students’ receptive and expressive skills were again tested to generate postintervention maintenance scores.</p>

<title>Vocabulary instruction</title>
<p>During the vocabulary instruction phase, the 10 participants were seen for 30 minutes, twice a week by their school SLP. To maintain a low SLP–student ratio and to accommodate students’ individual schedules, students were seen in two language groups. Each week, five words were taught to each group.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section17-1525740111405840">
<title>Semantic-based vocabulary instruction</title>
<p>During the first 2 weeks, both language groups were provided the S approach to vocabulary instruction. Students received explicit instruction as to word meanings and applications. An instructional routine for each word was taught (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1525740111405840">Archer, 2008</xref>). First, the word was introduced and its academic context was indicated (“<italic>Experiment</italic>, this is a science word that you are all studying”). Second, student-friendly explanations were presented to explain the meaning of each word (“<italic>Experiment</italic> means a test or trial, a test you do to find out something you did not know before”). Third, visual and verbal examples of the target word referent or meaning (“A test to see if people would choose to eat green pizza is an <italic>experiment”</italic>), and nonexamples of the target word referent or meaning (“A test to see if the Cubs will win is not an <italic>experiment”</italic>) were shared in various contexts. Fourth, to check understanding, students were asked to find in the room, demonstrate, or verbalize examples of the word’s meaning (Students were asked to think of a test that would be an <italic>experiment</italic>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section18-1525740111405840">
<title>Semantic- and phonological-based vocabulary instruction</title>
<p>In Weeks 3 and 4, the S &amp; P approach to vocabulary instruction was implemented. As indicated earlier, this involved the teaching of both word meanings (lessons like that taught in the S approach, but shortened) and form-based strategies. The three form-based strategies used were (a) metalinguistic reinforcement of the word’s segmental word form (syllable dividing), (b) association of the word or evasive syllable with a phonological neighbor or similar sounding word cue (same sounds mnemonic cue), and (c) rehearsal of individual words in isolation and in a sentence. These form-based strategies are further described below.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section19-1525740111405840">
<title>Strategy 1: Metalinguistic reinforcement</title>
<p>The metalinguistic strategies focused on reinforcing the phonological structure of multisyllabic words, the syllabic frame, and segmental sound units. This strategy explicated the word’s segmental structure to the students in the language group. They were presented with a worksheet with the word written as a whole and then written in syllables in a grid. Students first counted the number of syllables as they said the words and then repeated each syllable after the SLP while tapping their head, shoulders, knees, and toes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1525740111405840">Montgomery, 2007b</xref>). Special emphasis was put on those syllables a learner may have difficulty accessing. For example, if the second or third syllable of a word were evasive for a learner, syllable dividing for word finding would put more emphasis on those evasive syllables (<italic>experiment</italic> would be segmented focusing on the second and third syllables, <italic>ex PER I ment</italic>, if they were the evasive syllables; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1525740111405840">German, 2005</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section20-1525740111405840">
<title>Strategy 2: Same-sounds mnemonic cue</title>
<p>In this strategy, students learned to associate a mnemonic cue with the word or its evasive syllable(s). The mnemonic cues selected were cue words similar in sound to the evasive word or syllables (same-sounds cues: <italic>X spear mint</italic> for <italic>experiment</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1525740111405840">German, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1525740111405840">2005</xref>). The underlying assumption was that a phonemic neighbor of a word or syllable could be used to facilitate its retrieval because of its proximity to the target word or syllable in the phonological lexicon. To avoid reinforcing pathways to the cue instead of the target, students were instructed to <italic>think</italic> of the cue word, but not say it, prior to verbalizing the word. Students’ cue words were entered into a “think-call-out” or “think bubble” on the S &amp; P work sheet to emphasize that they were to think of the cue prior to saying the word or syllable</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section21-1525740111405840">
<title>Strategy 3: Word rehearsal</title>
<p>To strengthen and stabilize word pathways, learners were asked to think of their same-sounds mnemonic cues (<italic>X spear mint</italic>) before they verbalized the word three times in isolation (<italic>experiment</italic>, <italic>experiment</italic>, <italic>experiment</italic>) and then in sentences and discourse (We did an <italic>experiment</italic> in science) to increase automaticity of word retrieval in oral and written language.</p>
</sec>

<sec id="section22-1525740111405840">
<title>Fidelity of Research</title>
<p>Four areas of treatment fidelity were considered: study design, training, treatment delivery, and treatment enactment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1525740111405840">Smith, Daunic, &amp; Taylor, 2007</xref>). We designed an authentic intervention schedule; intervention lessons were 30 minutes twice a week. We trained, observed, and critiqued our SLP instructor in both vocabulary approaches prior to the study. We avoided treatment contamination; the S teaching approach was taught prior to the S &amp; P approach so that students would not inadvertently use phonological strategies when being taught the S approach to vocabulary instruction. Classroom teachers’ and participants’ feedback verified treatment enactment; teachers indicated that students were using the studied vocabulary, and students were reported to call out the target words when passing the SLP in the hall.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section23-1525740111405840">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>Students served as their own controls, and student gain scores served as the unit of analysis. We analyzed the data two ways: using normalized gain scores and the Wilcoxon signed rank test. The <italic>normalized gain</italic>, introduced by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1525740111405840">Hake (1998)</xref>, is defined as the absolute gain score divided by the maximum possible gain. Normalized gain is expressed in standardized units that allow researchers to compare gains across different settings. Normalized gain is preferable over simple gain because it accounts for the fact that when the pretest score is low, there is a greater potential for growth than in cases where the pretest score is high and therefore the potential gain is low.</p>
<p>The receptive and expressive pretest and posttest scores of the students were recorded and compared to compute their normalized gain scores. This comparison was repeated twice: first for the 10 words taught using the S approach and second for the 10 words taught using the S &amp; P approach. Four normalized gain scores were calculated: receptive and expressive normalized gain scores for words taught using the S approach and receptive and expressive normalized gain scores for words taught using the S &amp; P approach. In addition, to assess stabilization of the vocabulary over time, a 3-week delayed follow-up posttest was administered to the students following the end of treatment. The second test we used to analyze the data was the Wilcoxon signed rank test, which is a nonparametric statistic (<italic>z</italic>) that is used to test mean differences between matched pairs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1525740111405840">Moore, McCabe, &amp; Craig, 2009</xref>, p. 749). This test is similar to the <italic>t</italic> test for paired samples that is often used with larger sample sizes. The Wilcoxon signed rank test evaluates the rank of paired comparisons and gives more weight based on the magnitude of the differences. In our study, the samples were matched “by using each subject as its own control” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1525740111405840">Siegel &amp; Castellan, 1988</xref>, p. 74).</p>
<p>To assess whether the lexical factors of words taught in the two vocabulary approaches influenced our learners’ WF skills with these words, a Pearson product–moment correlation was generated for the postexpressive accuracy scores for 18 of the words taught (2 words had missing data and were not included in the analysis), as was their corresponding lexical factor index (log frequency of occurrence index, the number of phonemes index [length], and the phonotactic probability index).</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section24-1525740111405840" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>First, mean pretest and posttest scores were generated for the 10 participants for the two different instructional approaches studied. Students’ pretest receptive scores for words taught in the S &amp; P and S instructional approaches were similarly low: The S &amp; P mean pretest receptive score was 4.90 (<italic>SD</italic> = 1.37), and the S pretest-receptive mean score was 5.10 (<italic>SD</italic> = 2.38). Students’ posttest receptive scores following S &amp; P and S vocabulary instruction were similar also, suggesting that there were minimal differences in the influence of the two approaches on learner’s receptive language learning of words (S &amp; P posttest receptive score <italic>M</italic> = 9.00, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.15; S posttest receptive score <italic>M</italic> = 8.20, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.48).</p>
<p>Students’ pretest expressive scores for words taught in the S &amp; P and S instructional approaches were similarly low: the S &amp; P mean pretest expressive score was 0.50 (<italic>SD</italic> = 0.70); the S pretest expressive mean score was 0.40 (<italic>SD</italic> = 0.52). In contrast, learners’ posttest expressive mean scores following the S &amp; P approach to vocabulary instruction were notably higher (S &amp; P posttest expressive score <italic>M</italic> = 6.20, <italic>SD</italic> = 2.44) than their posttest expressive scores following the S approach to vocabulary instruction (S posttest expressive score <italic>M</italic> = 3.60, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.71). Furthermore, learners’ receptive and expressive language improvement following the S &amp; P approach to vocabulary instruction was long-lasting, as their posttest receptive and expressive mean maintenance scores declined only slightly in a follow-up assessment 3 weeks later (S &amp; P 3-week posttest receptive maintenance score <italic>M</italic> = 8.70, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.42; S &amp; P 3-week posttest expressive maintenance score <italic>M</italic> = 5.70, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.42).</p>
<p>Real differences in the influence of the two approaches on student learning become clearer when we look at students’ normalized mean gain scores. When students were taught using the S &amp; P approach, their normalized gain was higher on both receptive (normalized gain = .8038) and expressive (normalized gain = .6000) scores compared to their normalized gain scores on receptive (normalized gain = .6327) and expressive (normalized gain = .3333) scores when they were taught using the S approach. Furthermore, the gap between the receptive and expressive normalized gain scores was greater following the S approach as compared to the S &amp; P instructional approach.</p>
<p>Wilcoxon signed rank test was used to compare the gains in receptive and expressive scores made by the students when they were taught using the S and S &amp; P approaches. The results indicate that there was a statistically significant gain in the expressive scores when the S &amp; P approach was used compared with the S approach (<italic>z</italic> = 2.530, <italic>p</italic> = .011, <italic>n</italic> = 10). Eight students made higher gains in their expressive scores when receiving the S &amp; P approach as compared to the S approach; 2 students had the same gain in both approaches. In comparison, there was no statistically significant gain in the receptive scores when the two teaching approaches were compared (<italic>z</italic> = 0.984, <italic>p</italic> = .325, <italic>n</italic> = 10). The receptive scores of 5 students were higher when taught using the S &amp; P approach; 3 students scored higher using the S approach, and 2 students had the same gain for both approaches.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section25-1525740111405840">
<title>Lexical Factors</title>
<p>Pearson product–moment correlation coefficients indicated nonsignificant low correlations between naming accuracy and word frequency and word length for both instructional approaches: word frequency: S approach, <italic>r</italic> = –.382, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .05; S &amp; P approach, <italic>r</italic> = –.001, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .05; word length: S approach, <italic>r</italic> = –.020, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .05; S &amp; P approach, <italic>r</italic> = –.094, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .05. However, a significant moderate correlation was found between naming accuracy and the phonotactic probability lexical factor for words taught in the S &amp; P instructional approach, phonotactic probability: S &amp; P approach, <italic>r</italic> = .471, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .05, and a positive but not statistically significant correlation emerged for this lexical factor for words taught using the S approach, phonotactic probability: S approach, <italic>r</italic> = .279, <italic>p</italic> &gt; .05.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This investigation studied differentiated vocabulary instruction for learners with WFD. Our goal was to evaluate the efficacy of an S &amp; P approach to vocabulary instruction that linked form-based strategies with the teaching of S strategies to enhance learners’ vocabulary usage. In doing so, this investigation posed two questions. The questions are considered in turn.</p>
<sec id="section27-1525740111405840">
<title>Question 1</title>
<p>Our first question was, “Will an S &amp; P approach to vocabulary instruction be beneficial for learners with WFD as an intervention in an RTI-Tier 2 classroom or RTI-Tier 3 pullout program?” Our investigation revealed that vocabulary instruction in the SLP language room was enhanced for learners with WFD when phonological strategies were embedded in the teaching paradigm; learners’ ability to access studied vocabulary was much improved following the instructional approach that focused on both the semantic and phonological properties of words. Furthermore, the gap between their receptive and expressive skills for studied vocabulary was less after receiving the S &amp; P approach to vocabulary instruction. In addition, 3 weeks postintervention, these learners with WFD were still able to access studied vocabulary, suggesting that the S &amp; P approach had a sustained effect. These findings are in harmony with those of earlier studies that have demonstrated the value of phonological-based intervention procedures for learners with WFD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1525740111405840">Easton, Sheach, &amp; Easton, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1525740111405840">German, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1525740111405840">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1525740111405840">McGregor, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1525740111405840">Wright, 1993</xref>) and that mnemonic strategies can be helpful in anchoring the sound form of a word or word parts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1525740111405840">German, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1525740111405840">2005</xref>).</p>

<title>Question 2</title>
<p>Our second question was, “Will the lexical factors of vocabulary taught influence learners’ success with either the S or S &amp; P approaches to vocabulary instruction?” Lexical factors of words have been identified as word features that affect learners’ processing and production of words as well as their word learning. We studied whether these same lexical factors would affect our students’ learning of vocabulary. Counterintuitive findings emerged; neither word frequency nor word length significantly affected our students’ naming of the words they learned via either of the two vocabulary approaches. Nonetheless, the findings indicate that a word’s phonology (phonotactic probability—the frequency of which sounds occur in the language) did influence our participants’ success in retrieving studied words. That is, learners found it easier to establish naming automaticity on those academic words consisting of common phoneme sequences, whereas words containing rarer sound sequences were more difficult to name. This was particularly the case for vocabulary taught via the S &amp; P approach to vocabulary instruction. Our students demonstrated a learning advantage for real words with common sound sequences similar to that reported for typical students processing of novel words (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1525740111405840">Storkel, 2001</xref>). In summary, our findings, although preliminary in nature, suggest that students with WFD may also find it easier to apply form-based strategies to words that contain more common phonological sequences.</p>

<title>Implications for Vocabulary Intervention</title>
<p>The findings from this investigation have practical implications for both developing differentiated vocabulary instruction and providing service to learners with WFD.</p>
<sec id="section30-1525740111405840">
<title>Semantic- and phonological-based vocabulary instruction</title>
<p>The form-based treatment of the S &amp; P instructional approach in this investigation focused on Stages 2 and 3 in the lexical process, lemma access of a word’s phonological features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1525740111405840">German, 2000</xref>). There was a facilitation effect of the phonological approach used, which suggests that it would be helpful to consider both semantic and phonological properties of target words to improve oral word finding of studied vocabulary.</p>
<p>Furthermore, since the vocabulary list that students are expected to know and use is large (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1525740111405840">Nelson &amp; Van Meter, 2006</xref>), it might be meaningful for SLPs and teachers to consider the learning advantage demonstrated for words with common phonological sequences. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1525740111405840">Montgomery (2007a</xref>) recommended considering form-based lexical factors such as phonotactic probability when selecting vocabulary. Based on the findings from this investigation, it appears that low phonotactic probability words need the extra attention of the S &amp; P approach if learners are to become automatic in their use. Alternatively, SLPs could first teach those words in the unit that contain the most common phonological sequences (high phonotactic probability). Then once learners experience success with these words, follow with S &amp; P vocabulary instruction on the words with rarer sound sequences. In that way, previous paradigm learning can boost new learning on words thought to be more difficult.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section31-1525740111405840">
<title>Delivering vocabulary instruction</title>
<p>SLPs are being asked to serve as collaborators and consultants with classroom teachers, and they need to help all students achieve state and district goals. They must be knowledgeable about evidence-based practices for supporting classroom learning as well as the learning of their identified special education students. Researchers have articulated what qualifies as good vocabulary instruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1525740111405840">Montgomery, 2007a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1525740111405840">2007b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1525740111405840">Nelson &amp; Van Meter, 2006</xref>). We view the S &amp; P protocol for vocabulary instruction as an important “add on” to these time-honored approaches to vocabulary instruction that have, for the most part, focused on students’ learning of the semantic properties of words. The S &amp; P approach could be added to SLPs’ RTI-Tier 2 and/or RTI-Tier 3 vocabulary instructional protocols. By combining S instruction with form-based instruction, SLPs could differentiate vocabulary instruction in the SLP room as well as help teachers differentiate vocabulary instruction in the classroom. For example, following word definitions, semantic mapping, and word usage activities for science vocabulary, an SLP could teach segmentation to make the syllabic structure of the vocabulary word more explicit (e.g., <italic>PRE-CIP–I-ta-tion</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1525740111405840">Montgomery, 2007a</xref>), link mnemonic phonological cues to make the word’s form more salient (e.g., <italic>purr sip it</italic> for <italic>precipitation</italic>), and follow up with rehearsal activities in single words to reinforce retrieval algorithms for the words studied (e.g., <italic>precipitation</italic>, <italic>precipitation</italic>, <italic>precipitation</italic>) and sentences (e.g., “<italic>Precipitation</italic> is rain, sleet, or snow”). By combining instruction on words’ semantic properties with form-based strategies, the SLP could help students with WFD not only learn academic vocabulary but also become automatic in their vocabulary usage in the classroom. Furthermore, when applied in the context of an RTI service delivery model, such intervention may help some learners with WFD be successful in vocabulary learning so as to avoid referral for special education services.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The research presented in this article looks at differentiated vocabulary instruction for learners with WFD within an RTI service delivery model. Based on our preliminary findings, it appears that an S &amp; P approach to vocabulary instruction could be an appropriate protocol to help students meet vocabulary state standards. The findings demonstrate a positive effect of combining S with phonological-based vocabulary instruction for students with WFD. Although additional research with larger samples and different vocabulary is needed to verify the S &amp; P approach to vocabulary instruction, SLPs could begin progress monitoring with students with WFD to measure their success with this approach in the classroom and SLP room.</p>
