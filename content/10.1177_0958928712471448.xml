<p>Upward trends in women’s labour force participation as well as a growing interest in a ‘social investment’ strategy for policy-making have brought early childhood education and care (ECEC) and other children’s services to the forefront of policy debates in many advanced welfare states. This edited volume by Lloyd and Penn explores the market-based approach to ECEC, outlining the theoretical tensions inherent in a market for children’s care and documenting empirical variation in childcare markets across countries. The volume takes a multidisciplinary perspective, with contributions from economists, sociologists and early childhood specialists.</p>
<p>Although privately purchased education and care for young children has a long history, and in fact predates state systems of delivery, the editors focus on developments within the last 30 years, during which time, they argue, welfare states entered a ‘transitional phase’ of increased privatisation of social welfare services (p. 7). They situate recent developments in childcare markets as a part of this larger trend, with the market-based approach to childcare delivery a ‘distinctive and rapidly growing phenomenon’ across countries (p. 4).</p>
<p>The volume is structured into three main sections. The first provides an overview of childcare markets and how they relate to the broader policy context. Penn’s chapter provides a theoretical critique of the childcare market model and whether it ‘works’, by presenting the challenges to delivery of ECEC by the market, specifically the issue of reconciling profitability with equal access and high quality. Penn acknowledges that the chapter would benefit from an assessment of the strengths and weaknesses not only of market-based delivery, but also of state-based or non-profit-based delivery (p. 34), but does not do so, perhaps for reasons of space or scope.</p>
<p>The bulk of the volume lies in the second section, which empirically documents policy developments in market-based ECEC across countries and explores their consequences in terms of outcomes for children, families and the childcare workforce. The contributions include recent policy research from a diverse array of case studies – the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Hong Kong, New Zealand, Norway, the United States, Canada and Australia – as well as some discussion of ‘raw and emerging markets’ in Namibia and post-socialist countries in Eastern Europe. Each country chapter provides an in-depth look at the nature of the market for childcare in that particular policy context, as well as analysis of specific policy instruments, such as the introduction of a voucher scheme in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>The concluding chapters take a broader perspective, considering policy initiatives to shape the market for ECEC as well as alternatives to the market-based approach. Paull’s final chapter is an essential exploration of the rationale for market-based delivery as well as the various policy options governments might implement in order to support or otherwise influence the childcare market.</p>
<p>The editors emphasise that the book is about analysing childcare markets in terms of their outcomes for equity, as the title of the book makes clear. While many of the contributions imply that the answer to the question of whether childcare markets can deliver an equitable service is ‘no’, this question, ostensibly at the heart of the volume, is never fully developed. What qualifies as an ‘equitable service’ and how will we know when it has been achieved? The volume provides no explicit answers to these questions. Furthermore, while the introductory chapters convey the idea that markets cannot deliver equitable services, Paull’s concluding chapter presents a more ambivalent assessment, suggesting that whatever failures the market may bring, there is reason to suspect that similar problems could potentially arise (or may be worse) under a state-based delivery system. The absence of a summarising concluding chapter was deliberate, but would nevertheless have clarified some of the contradictions within the text as well as providing a space to explore the central question in light of the particular case studies presented.</p>
<p>In spite of these limitations, the volume achieves its stated aim – to generate greater knowledge about mixed economies of childcare in order to develop an evidence base for future policy-making and academic discourse. The book is a comprehensive resource for those with an interest in comparative family policy and children’s services as well as a general interest in the mixed economy of welfare. It can be read cover to cover for a broad understanding of childcare markets from a policy perspective, or as stand-alone chapters for those interested in a particular country or context. Lloyd and Penn’s edited volume is thus an important contribution given the persistent gap in our understanding of the role of markets in early childhood education and care, and indeed in many other human services. It is recommended reading for academics, policy-makers, and anyone else interested in understanding cross-national variations in market-based care and related policy initiatives.</p>
