<abstract>
<p>The purpose of this study was to clarify potential fall-related behaviors as fall risk factors that may predict the potential for falls among the elderly patients with dementia at a geriatric facility in Japan. This study was conducted from April 2008 to May 2009. A baseline study was conducted in April 2008 to evaluate Mini-Mental State Examination, Physical Self-Maintenance Scale, fall-related behaviors, and other factors. For statistical analysis, paired <italic>t</italic> test and logistic analysis were used to compare each item between fallers and nonfallers. A total of 135 participants were followed up for 1 year; 50 participants (37.04%) fell during that period. Results of multiple logistic regression analysis showed that the total score for fall-related behaviors was significantly related to falls. It was suggested that 11 fall-related behaviors may be effective indicators to predict falls among the elderly patients with dementia.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>As the number of elderly population increases in Japan, so does the number of elderly patients with dementia. It is estimated that there were 2 410 000 elderly patients with dementia in 2011, and this number will reach its peak at 3 550 000 in 2036.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1533317512454706">1</xref>
</sup> Dementia and cognitive impairment are well-known major risk factors for falls and fall-related injuries in the elderly patients.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1533317512454706">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1533317512454706">3</xref>
</sup> Because the elderly patients with dementia are likely to have atypical symptoms such as spatial agnosia and apraxia, which may include neurological symptoms, gait disturbances, and balance concerns, the elderly patients with dementia are likely to experience repeated falls and injuries and may eventually become bedridden.</p>
<p>The use of physical restraints, which was part of the primary strategy to help prevent elderly patients with dementia from falling, has been prohibited at facilities since the year 2000 due to the implementation of Long-Term Care Insurance in Japan. However, it is reported that 40% of facilities are still using physical restraints for their patients to prevent problems such as complaints, lawsuits, and compensation damages for injuries related to a fall.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1533317512454706">4</xref>
</sup> Currently, these intentionally neglected facility obligations are being reviewed pending a lawsuit and are being discussed among medical care professionals with regard to elderly patients with dementia. It is no exaggeration to say that the prevention of falls and injuries within the elderly population with dementia is an urgent matter as well as a steadfast challenge to overcome in the field of nursing.</p>
<p>In terms of fall prevention research reports in Western countries, several authors<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1533317512454706">5</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1533317512454706"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1533317512454706">7</xref>
</sup> have conducted intervention studies using large-scale populations from multiple facilities and randomized control trials (RCTs); systematic reviews and meta-analyses have also been published.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1533317512454706">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1533317512454706">9</xref>
</sup> Chang et al,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1533317512454706">5</xref>
</sup> who synthesized 40 RCTs regarding fall prevention interventions, reported that multifaceted fall risk assessments and a management program are effective for both reducing and preventing falls. Gillespie<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1533317512454706">8</xref>
</sup> conducted a meta-analysis based on 62 previously published research articles to determine the most efficient intervention to prevent falls. Results showed that a multilateral intervention within a wide range of specialties, including risk factor screening and an intervention program for the elderly patients staying at homes and facilities, is effective. Similarly, Cameron et al<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1533317512454706">9</xref>
</sup> pointed out that the following factors were efficient methods for fall prevention intervention at a care facility or a hospital: addressing the various risks associated with falling; developing an individualized intervention program for each patient; and implementing intensive long-term support.</p>
<p>Based on results of their 6-month study, in which they observed elderly patients with dementia staying at an elderly care facility, Eriksson et al<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1533317512454706">10</xref>
</sup> reported that 62% of participants fell during the study period. However, in terms of RCTs regarding fall prevention, there is no enough evidence for multifactorial interventions to be proven effective in meta-analyses, because of problems such as a lack of full description of the quality of care and the intervention methods used in different facilities.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1533317512454706">11</xref>
</sup> It was reported that Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia (BPSD),<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1533317512454706">12</xref>
</sup> which include variables such as irritation or wandering, can cause a fall—especially among the elderly patients with dementia. In addition, various elements such as gait or balance problems due to cranial neuropathy are related to dementia in its progressive state<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1533317512454706">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1533317512454706">13</xref>
</sup> and may trigger falls.</p>
<p>It is difficult to analyze the actual cause of a fall because elderly patients with dementia often cannot remember how the incident occurred. However, many elderly patients with dementia who are institutionalized at geriatric facilities are at serious risk of falling due to unpredicted behaviors that contribute to a fall.</p>
<p>Because the elderly patients with dementia have several serious risks for falling, nurses are not able to predict falls among these patients even if they use a fall risk assessment tool.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1533317512454706">14</xref>
</sup> However, nurses who assess fall-related behaviors such as agitation, resisting care, and wandering indicate that these behaviors can easily lead to a fall.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1533317512454706">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1533317512454706">16</xref>
</sup> Previous studies have not determined what kinds of fall-related behaviors lead to falls. The purpose of this study is to clarify fall-related behaviors as fall risk factors that may predict potential falls among the elderly patients with dementia at geriatric facilities in Japan.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>Participants included 135 elderly patients (24 men and 111 women) residing at a geriatric facility from April 2008 to March 2009. The mean age of participants was 86.94 years (±7.40); there was a significant difference in ages between men and women (83.88 ± 9.84 vs 87.52 ± 6.66 years, respectively; <italic>P</italic> = .028 [chi-square test]). Diagnoses of study participants included Alzheimer’s disease (89), cerebral vascular dementia (36), dementia with Lewy bodies (5), frontotemporal dementia, and Pick’s disease (5).</p>
<p>This study was approved by the Screening Committee of Research Ethics at Hamamatsu University School of Medicine. Due to their cognitive impairment, many participants were unable to comprehend various issues associated with conducting a research study, such as the purpose of the study. Therefore, our researchers explained to them through their family (or via a deputy) the following points of concern: the aim of the study, privacy protection issues, and the method used for reporting results of the study. Written consent was received from family members of the elderly patients with dementia.</p>
<p>The following data were included as baseline data at the beginning of April 2008: Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1533317512454706">17</xref>
</sup> the Physical Self-Maintenance Scale (PSMS) score,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1533317512454706">18</xref>
</sup> Behavioral Symptoms in Alzheimer’s disease (Behave-AD) score,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1533317512454706">19</xref>
</sup> the number of medications taken, and fall-related behaviors. The definition of a “fall” was floor contact with a part of the body other than the soles of the feet.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1533317512454706">20</xref>
</sup> From April 2008 to March 2009, nurses and caregivers were instructed to submit a patient accident report when they discovered a fall, regardless of whether an injury occurred.</p>

<p>The MMSE<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1533317512454706">14</xref>
</sup> is an interview-based screening test consisting of 30 items on the following 6 subscales: orientation, registration, attention and calculation, recall, language, and visual constriction. Each item is scored from 0 to 5, with a total score ranging from 0 to 30. Higher MMSE scores represent better functioning. The MMSE was conducted at baseline (April 2008) before a 1-week observational period that took place between the fall of April 2008 to March 2009.</p>

<sec id="section8-1533317512454706">
<title>Fall-related behaviors</title>
<p>First, based on previous studies regarding falls among elderly patient with dementia, we determined more than 40 items associated with BPSD and extracted behaviors related to falling. Next, we conducted focus group interviews with 6 nurse experts who had nursing experience with elderly patients with dementia to identify fall-related behaviors. We then extracted behaviors related to falling from the original 40 items based on whether the nurse experts considered the items to be related to falls or not (items were evaluated on a 5-point scale, where 5 = <italic>strongly agree</italic> and 1 = <italic>strongly disagree</italic>). Twenty items with a mean score of 3.5 or higher were extracted in this step. Finally, 6 nurse experts discussed these 20 items to evaluate whether they could be assessed by nurses during clinical practice (items were evaluated on a 5-point scale, where 5 = <italic>strongly agree</italic> and 1 = <italic>strongly disagree</italic>). The final list of fall-related behaviors included 17 items with a score of 3.5 or higher. The 17 fall-related behaviors included (1) engaging in unexpected sudden behavior; (2) being agitated and wandering; (3) experiencing delirium or changing consciousness; (4) experiencing unconsciousness or syncope; (5) resisting care from nurses and caregivers; (6) inability to maintain seated balance in a wheelchair; (7) experiencing Parkinson’s disease or similar symptoms, such as a forward-bent posture, brachybasia, and pulsion; (8) paying no attention to danger; (9) trying to transfer by oneself when using the toilet or walking in spite of an order not to; (10) dangerous behavior other than transferring as usual or when conditions are not favorable; (11) trying to leave bed during bedtime; (12) standing up abruptly from a wheelchair and attempting to walk; (13) wandering in a unit by oneself; (14) walking in an unbalanced or unsteady manner; (15) attempting to move, walk, stand, or transfer by oneself, although it is impossible to do so; (16) having a sudden desire to urinate or defecate; and (17) becoming agitated due to a desire to urinate or defecate.</p>
<p>The charge nurse who took care of the participants evaluated PSMS, Behave-AD, number of medications taken, and fall-related behaviors at baseline (April 2008) before a 1-week observational period that took place between the fall of April 2008 to March 2009.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Fall-related behaviors represent dangerous actions taken by the elderly patients with dementia and can be caused by core symptoms of dementia or BPSD. Thus, nursing interventions, including analyzing and reducing dangerous behaviors, are necessary. It is important to develop a strategy for predicting falls not only by evaluating physical and cognitive abilities but also by assessing behaviors. According to the relationship between PSMS scores and falls in males, male participants who fell had significantly lesser abilities to feed themselves than those who did not fall, which means that male participants who fell had higher abilities in terms of eating. However, males who fell had impaired ability for other items related to ADL, with no significant differences between fallers and nonfallers. Similarly, there were no significant differences in females between PSMS scores and falls.</p>
<p>The elderly patients with serious impairments, including those who are bedridden, generally cannot move on their own and thus have a lower likelihood of experiencing a fall. Buchner and Larson<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1533317512454706">21</xref>
</sup> pointed out the significant relationship between falling and wandering among the elderly patients with dementia. In this study, it was suggested that the elderly patients with dementia sometimes needed assistance with ADL, especially minor and moderate working and moving assistance.</p>
<p>Studies<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1533317512454706">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1533317512454706">22</xref>
</sup> have already reported that BPSD such as agitation and wandering among the elderly patients with dementia can increase the risk of falling. In this study, although significant relationships between falling and Behave-AD items were not seen in male participants, they were identified among females and overall participants. In the overall participants, scores for paranoid and delusional ideation, activity disturbances, affective disturbances, anxieties and phobias, and total score were significantly higher among participants who fell than among participants who did not fall. It is possible that significant differences were not seen in the male population due to the small sample size (n = 24).</p>
<p>Wandering behavior, which is included as “C. Activity Disturbances” in the Behave-AD, may increase the risk of falls. Buchner and Larson<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1533317512454706">21</xref>
</sup> reported that the elderly patients with Alzheimer’s disease have 3 times greater risk of bone fracture compared with an age-matched sample without Alzheimer’s disease and 5 times greater risk if they demonstrate wandering behavior. These patients often lose their balance and fall while they are wandering. Therefore, it may be possible to reduce the prevalence of falls by preventing wandering behavior.</p>
<p>In addition, patients who fell in this study had higher scores on the Behave-AD in terms of aggressiveness, affective disturbances, and anxieties and phobias. Studies<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1533317512454706">23</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1533317512454706"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1533317512454706">25</xref>
</sup> have reported that among the elderly patients with dementia, a symptom such as agitation can develop due to treatments such as use of physical restraints or certain medications. Hence, it is important to consider reducing agitation by administering alternative treatment options or providing proper nursing care. The so-called BPSD symptoms, such as agitation and wandering, tend to cause falls and also create obstacles to efforts to provide safe nursing care. However, labeling all fall-related behaviors among the elderly patients with dementia as “agitation” or “wandering” may not be appropriate as it can inhibit predicting other risk factors for falls among this population. Therefore, this study aimed to identify fall-related behaviors among the elderly patients with dementia and predict falls based on these behaviors. When comparing fall-related behaviors with the actual prevalence of falls, significantly more participants who fell had fall-related behaviors associated with 11 of 17 items. Behaviors such as delirium, consciousness disturbances, symptoms of Parkinson disease, leaving bed during bedtime, and wandering were not related to falls.</p>
<p>The elderly patients with delirium or consciousness disturbances have increased risk for falls because their attention can many times become scattered due to their altered level of consciousness.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1533317512454706">2</xref>
</sup> However, in our study, no significant relationships between these elements were identified. It is possible that the nurses who evaluated patients in this study did not possess enough knowledge about delirium among the elderly patients with dementia; therefore, further consideration regarding the methodology of this study is required. Also, a higher prevalence of falls existed among the elderly patients with dementia who were exhibiting elimination disturbances, such as urinary incontinence or disturbances in excretion behaviors. Excretion behaviors are related to privacy issues. The elderly patients with dementia who have impairments in ability and who clearly require assistance still feel a need to go to the restroom and perform this function independently, even if doing so is impossible. Hence, although some may have difficulty walking for various reasons, many still to go to a restroom by themselves, which tends to increase the risk of falls. In addition, some often lose balance or suffer from a change in their cardiovascular system when they transfer to a toilet seat, which can also cause falls. Additionally, it is also reported that some patients experience delirium or BPSD due to their frustration, both of which are related to their inability to express a concern with conditions of constipation or diarrhea.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1533317512454706">24</xref>
</sup> Hence, providing nursing care to assist with elimination behaviors among the elderly patients with dementia has the potential to aid in preventing falls.</p>
<p>In terms of gender, the mean age of females in this study was significantly higher than that of males. In addition, there were fewer males (n = 24) than females (n = 111). Although more females fell than males, the difference was not statistically significant. Impairments in physical ambulation are reported to be related to falls,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1533317512454706">26</xref>
</sup> and there were significant gender differences between males and females on the functions of physical ambulation in this study. Gambassi<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1533317512454706">27</xref>
</sup> reported that females are older than men and are more likely to fall than men among patients with Alzheimer’s disease. In this study, females who had impairments in physical ambulation were more likely to fall. Moreover, there were no significant differences in any fall-related item between males who fell and males who did not fall. In contrast, females who fell showed significant differences from females who did not fall in terms of all 11 fall-related items. We suggest that females in this study might have been more affected by fall-related behaviors because they were older and had greater impairment of physical ambulation compared with males. Further studies with a larger number of participants are needed to clarify our findings.</p>
<p>Where risks caused by fall-related behaviors are concerned, our study showed a significant association between the prevalence of falls and performance of careless behaviors (ie, actions taken without exercising proper judgment). Additionally, the ability to identify various dangers within one’s surroundings tends to decrease among the elderly patients with dementia due to the negative influence of BPSD, spatial agnosia, and delirium,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1533317512454706">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1533317512454706">21</xref>
</sup> which can also cause falls.</p>
<p>As a result of this study, we could predict that falls are caused not only by gait disturbances but also by the state of behavior and where patients cannot identify environmental hazards due to abnormally increased activity, which in turn is caused by excessive emotional responses. Of the 17 fall-related items we included, we identified 11 items that showed a significant relationship with the prevalence of falls and then ran a multiple logistic regression model to determine which variables were associated with accidental falls. As a result, we found that the total score for these fall-related behaviors maintained a significant relationship with the prevalence of falls, even after controlling for variables such as age, gender, cognitive function, and number of medications. Hence, these 11 items were found to be effective in predicting falls among the elderly patients with dementia. We believe that it is possible to contrive a concrete structured fall prevention care plan for elderly patients with dementia using these 11 items together. Although Jensen<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1533317512454706">28</xref>
</sup> evaluated the effectiveness of a multifactorial fall and injury prevention program such as residence-specific risk factors in elderly patients with cognitive impairment, the lower cognitive group did not respond well because Jensen<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1533317512454706">28</xref>
</sup> did not target fall-related behaviors among the elderly patients with dementia. The fall-related behaviors identified in this study are more specific fall risk factors among patients with severe dementia, and the results of this study may be used to identify fall risk factors among the elderly patients with dementia and develop efficient methods to prevent falls. Further study is required to evaluate the validity and reliability of these 11 fall-related behaviors to determine whether they maybe used as an effective indicator with which to predict falls among the elderly patients with dementia.</p>
<p>Although dementia is an important risk factor for falling,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1533317512454706">26</xref>
</sup> nurses have not known how to assess behavior of the elderly patients with dementia. Based on the fall-related behaviors identified in this study, nurses may be able to assess specific fall-related behaviors to predict—and thus prevent—accidental falls among the elderly patients dementia in geriatric facilities.</p>
<p>One limitation of this study is that we evaluated fall-related behaviors only one time, at baseline. It is necessary to evaluate fall-related behaviors regularly to predict falling among the elderly patients with dementia living in a geriatric facility. In addition, this study included only 135 elderly residents. It is necessary to conduct larger studies to determine the effective predictors of fall-related behaviors.</p>
