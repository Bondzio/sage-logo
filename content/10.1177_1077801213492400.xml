<p>Readers are likely familiar with the argument that the battered women’s movement has lost its radical feminist edge and has been co-opted by the need to win the financial support of politicians and other potential, but relatively conservative funders. In the article that opens this issue of <italic>Violence Against Women</italic>, Gretchen Arnold and Jami Ake challenge this “narrative of decline” and present a convincing counter-narrative of the movement as continuously changing in response to a variety of external and internal challenges. Instead of depicting the battered women’s movement as depoliticized, Arnold and Ake offer strong evidence that first-generation movement activists have recognized mistakes and pitfalls over the years, and have consistently worked to address these difficulties while simultaneously fighting for better services for and improved treatment of battered women. In addition, they show how a second generation of activists, led by minority women, have incorporated an intersectional framework into movement activities and practices. Arnold and Ake’s article is both reassuring and inspirational.</p>
<p>Rodney Kingsnorth, Lynne Wolcott, and Kaitlyn Lonnquist also ask us to reexamine previously published research that has influenced popular views of how plaintiff gender affects judicial decisions to grant civil restraining orders. More specifically, Kingsnorth and his colleagues replicate one of two commonly cited studies that claim that judges discriminate against male domestic violence victims. Kingsnorth et al. are critical of these previous studies for their use of small sample sizes, failure to use adequate controls, and limited or inappropriate statistical tests. In their replication, Kingsnorth et al. analyze a sample of 310 cases randomly drawn from court records and stratified by plaintiff sex. Their findings show a small effect for plaintiff gender, although Kingsnorth et al. show that it can be accounted for by legally relevant gender differences. But the findings show no gender effects with regard to the setting of hearing dates and the granting of permanent orders. The authors discuss the important implications of their findings for future research and for policy and advocacy.</p>
<p>The next two articles in this issue also focus on intimate partner violence (IPV). Katherine Vittes, Daniel Webster, Shannon Frattaroli, Barbara Claire, and Garen Wintemute studied the impact on IPV victims of a California statute that requires persons under a domestic violence restraining order to surrender their firearms within 24 hr of being served with the order. In evaluating a program to improve enforcement of the statute, Vittes et al. interviewed IPV victims to assess their reactions to the statute. Many of the women they interviewed reported having been repeatedly threatened with gun violence by their abusive partners. Not surprisingly, then, Vittes and her colleagues found that the women in the study expressed strong support for the statute and stated that it made them feel safer.</p>
<p>Petra Ornstein and Johanna Rickne surveyed a nationally representative sample of separated women in Sweden to identify risk factors for post-separation stalking and assault. Their results indicate that partner control during the relationship is a better predictor of post-separation assault and, more so, post-separation stalking than any of the other risk factors they examined.</p>
<p>The final two articles in this issue discuss aspects of sexual victimization. Amy Hequembourg, Jennifer Livingston, and Kathleen Parks investigated the relationship between childhood sexual abuse (CSA), risky alcohol use, and adult sexual victimization among bisexual and lesbian women. An alarmingly high percentage of participants in their study reported sexual victimization experiences as both children and adults, and for the majority, their most recent sexual victimization occurred after coming out. Most striking among their findings, though, is the significantly greater risk for severe sexual victimization and revictimization among bisexual women compared with lesbians. This may be a result of their riskier alcohol consumption patterns as well as their sexual relationships with men, since most perpetrators were male.</p>
<p>And Kathryn Branch and Tara Richards discuss the effects of receiving a rape disclosure on a small sample of male and female college students. As Branch and Richards note, college students, particularly those living away from home, may turn to friends on campus if they experience sexual victimization. But there has been little attention to the effects that such a disclosure may have on those who are chosen by victims to receive it. Interviewees reported a range of reactions, from feelings of anger, shock, and concern to changes in their worldview (e.g., a lost sense of security, changed perceptions of “typical” victims and offenders). Branch and Richards encourage campus counselors and student life personnel to reach out campus-wide to let those who receive sexual assault disclosures know that services are available to them as well—useful advice, indeed.</p>
