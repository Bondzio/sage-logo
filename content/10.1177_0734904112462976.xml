<abstract>
<p>The demand for improved damage control materials to address high strain rate impact has led to exploration of polyureas in this role. Polyureas show potential for retrofitting pre-existing platforms because they can be applied as a spray and have extremely fast cure times and low volatile organic compounds. However, they have been limited in use in enclosed spaces because of their flammability. In this article, synthetic and additive routes to improve polyurea flame retardancy are systematically explored. The US Department of Defense test method standard Military Standard 2031 has been used as a target to meet or exceed for flammability properties. This article will outline the changes in polymer chemistry, the addition of fire-retardant additives, and the use of ignition barrier coatings that led to a composition that exceeded the military standard.</p>

<p>Some advantages of polyurea for explosion-resistant coating (ERC) applications are its extremely fast cure times and low volatile organic compounds (VOC) content. The rapid cure time means that the polyurea properties are less dependent on ambient temperature and humidity. However, as with most organic materials, polyureas are combustible, and thus their use in enclosed spaces such as onboard maritime vessels is limited.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0734904112462976">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0734904112462976">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0734904112462976">14</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>In this study, a number of methods were explored in efforts to improve the fire properties of polyurea. The approaches included the chemical incorporation of flame-retardant moieties into the molecular structure of the polyurea, the mechanical incorporation of flame-retardant fillers, and using barrier coatings on the surface of the polyureas. The properties evaluated were time to ignition, smoke generation, heat release rate (HRR) (peak and average), and mass loss rate, all as determined by cone calorimetry.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0734904112462976">15</xref></sup>

<title>Flame-retardant additives</title>
<p>Flame-retardant additives can fall under the broad chemical categories of halogenated, phosphorus containing, borate, hydrated mineral (i.e. inorganic hydroxides), and intumescent. In recent years, some nontraditional additives have been explored for their potential synergistic effects on conventional flame retardants. Exfoliated clays (e.g. nanoclays) have emerged as candidate additives.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0734904112462976">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0734904112462976">17</xref></sup> It has been reported that there is a synergistic effect between nanoclays and flame retardants.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0734904112462976">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0734904112462976">19</xref></sup> Small amounts of zeolites have also been shown to enhance the performance of intumescent additives.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0734904112462976">20</xref></sup> Yet another nontraditional additive that has shown to help intumescent additives is polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxanes (POSS).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0734904112462976">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0734904112462976">22</xref></sup> Talc can be used as an unreactive, inorganic filler.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0734904112462976">23</xref></sup>

<title>Polyurea backbone substitution</title>
<p>The traditional technique of preparing flame-retardant polymers is to blend the flame-retardant additive into the polymer, creating a composite. Physical compounding may result in separation between the additive and polymer, as well as detrimental effects on the resulting composite’s thermal and mechanical properties. To mitigate these issues, it may be possible to incorporate the flame retardant into the main chain of the polymer itself. Howell examined using phosphonate polymerization initiators for polystyrene.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0734904112462976">24</xref></sup> Unfortunately, the incorporation of phosphonate did not affect the thermal stability of the polystyrene. This may be due to the low-molecular-weight ratio of initiator to the main styrene chain. Silicon can also be incorporated into the polymer using siloxanes to replace the polyether portion of the backbone. By substituting the flammable carbon with silicone, it is believed that the onset decomposition temperature may be increased.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0734904112462976">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0734904112462976">26</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>Another strategy is to synthesize a polymer that is more thermally stable by strengthening the main chain bonds. This can be achieved using the resonance stabilization in aromatic structures. It is known that higher aromatic content polymers produce better char, forming flame-resistant polymers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0734904112462976">27</xref></sup> Polyimide-based polymers are a class of polyaromatic heterocycles that naturally condense into chars upon combustion without the need for additives. These materials are typically very rigid thermoplastics and not elastomeric; however, it is this mechanism of flame retardancy that is to be explored in this study by increasing the aromatic content of the polyurea backbone. Increasing the aromatic nature of the polyurea backbone can be achieved by utilizing aromatic prepolymers to replace the aliphatic polyol portion of the isocyanate and aromatic amines to replace the aliphatic amine portion of the polyurea.</p>

<sec id="section4-0734904112462976">
<title>Coatings</title>
<p>Rather than incorporating additives into the polymer, which may adversely affect physical properties, another approach is to use surface coatings (i.e. ignition barrier coatings (IBCs)). The role of a coating is to reduce the rate of heat transfer from the fire to the polymer substrate. Intumescent coatings have been used in a number of applications, including the thermal protection of steel structures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0734904112462976">28</xref></sup> Intumescent coatings have also been evaluated for use on polymer substrates such as glass-reinforced plastics (GRP)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0734904112462976">13</xref></sup> and polyureas.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0734904112462976">29</xref></sup> They consist of a resin matrix and an intumescent filler (e.g. ammonium phosphate), are applied in a thin layer (like a paint), and are stable at ambient temperature. Like intumescent additives, the intumescent coatings expand when exposed to the high temperature of a fire, creating a foam-like, insulative layer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0734904112462976">30</xref></sup>

<title>Laboratory scale fire testing</title>
<p>All fires are different and a single fire test cannot represent the whole range of fire types.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0734904112462976">31</xref></sup> Sorathia et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0734904112462976">32</xref></sup> have noted that the HRR of a material as measured in laboratory scale testing (e.g. oxygen consumption cone calorimetry) is the most important parameter when characterizing the flammability of an organic matrix composite. Cone calorimetry determines the fire properties of a developing fire. The cone calorimetry test method ASTM E 1354<sup>15</sup> has been accepted by the US Navy to test against Military Standard 2031 (MIL-STD-2031).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0734904112462976">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0734904112462976">33</xref></sup> Although MIL-STD-2031 was developed to qualify organic matrix composites for use on submarines, it is the only Navy standard to employ cone calorimetry data,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0734904112462976">13</xref></sup> and as such it is used in the research reported here as a target to be met for materials’ development. Within this standard, minimum/maximum requirements are set for a number of major criteria: the time to ignition, peak HRR, and smoke generation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0734904112462976">14</xref></sup> The MIL-STD-2031 targets are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0734904112462976">Table 6</xref>.</p>

<title>Base polyurea synthesis</title>
<p>All polyureas were synthesized using a two-part system. Part A was a diisocyanate prepolymer, and Part B was a diamine-terminated polyether. When the stoichiometric ratio of diisocyanate to diamine is increased from 1:1 to 1.05:1 and above, the formation of the biuret crosslink may occur (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0734904112462976">Figure 1</xref>). The base polyurea formulation for this study used 100% w/w Rubinate 9009 (Huntsman) for Part A, and Part B was composed of a mixture of 30% w/w Ethacure 300 (Albemarle) or Ethacure 100 (Albemarle) with 70% w/w Jeffamine D-2000/T-5000 blend (Huntsman) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0734904112462976">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

<title>Phosphorus- and siloxane-substituted polyurea backbone</title>
<p>The chemical modification of the polyurea with phosphorus or silicon can be accomplished through a reaction with either the diisocyanate (Part A) or the diamine (Part B). For the former, the reaction of the diisocyanate with a suitable phosphorus-containing diol will yield a modified diisocyanate prepolymer. The diol must be a liquid and must have low viscosity (≤500 cP) in order to avoid overloading the mixer if fillers are to be added. Phosphorus-containing polyol Exolit OP 560 (10–13% w/w phosphorus; Clariant Pigments and Additives) was reacted with diisocyanate Mondur M (4,4′-diphenylmethane diisocyanate (4,4′-MDI), Bayer) to produce a suitable Part A diisocyanate prepolymer. Conversely, the polyether diamine (Part B) could be replaced with an amine-terminated polydimethylsiloxane of similar molecular weight to the polyether in the base formula (i.e. D-2000). DMS-A15 (Gelest, Inc.), an amine-terminated polydimethylsiloxane, was selected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0734904112462976">Figure 3</xref>). Three samples were prepared as described in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0734904112462976">Table 1</xref>. Sample Ph had the phosphorus-substituted Part A, sample Si had the siloxane-substituted Part B, and sample PSi contained both substitutions.</p>

<p>For samples Ph and PSi, Part A was prepared by adding 4,4′-MDI (Mondur M) into a mixing vessel at 40°C and then Exolit OP 560 was added slowly to the vessel. The reactants were mixed at 60 r/min with a paddle blade mixer for 5 min. The temperature rose to 80°C and was held at this temperature for 2 h by placing the reaction mixture in an oven. The resin was then allowed to cool.</p>
<p>Part B was prepared by adding 60 g of the Ethacure to 140 g of the D2000/T5000 or DMS-A15 depending which sample was being made. The components were mixed for 1 min using a low-speed paddle mixing blade (500 r/min) at room temperature and pressure.</p>
<p>To prepare the modified polyureas, equal weights of Parts A and B (200 g) were loaded into 200-mL side-by-side cartridges and dispensed through an 18-element, ¼″ static mixing tube into 2- and 3-mm-thick sheet sample molds at room temperature using a handheld dispensing gun.

<sec id="section9-0734904112462976">
<title>Aromatic polyurea backbone</title>
<p>Another backbone substitution involved increasing the aromatic content of the polyurea. The approach for Part A was to add more aromatic character into the prepolymer backbone than in the standard prepolymer. The standard prepolymer was a difunctional isocyanate based on 4,4′-MDI and a polyoxypropylene glycol. An isocyanate with higher functionality was selected to increase the aromatic content of the prepolymer. This material also needed to be spray applied; therefore, its viscosity, the requirement that the compound be a liquid at room temperature, and freeze–thaw stability were all factors in material selection. A polyol with an aromatic functional backbone that would react with an isocyanate was also required. The diamine (Part B) could also add more aromatic character to the polymer. Again, it had to be a liquid at room temperature and should have a molecular weight range of 250–1000 g/mol and have the reactivity to cure quickly.</p>
<p>Two aromatic isocyanates (Part A) and two aromatic amines (Part B) were examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0734904112462976">Figure 4</xref>). Aromatic isocyanate 1 was prepared by reacting 25% w/w aromatic polyester polyol (Terate 258) with 75% w/w of a higher functional aromatic isocyanate (Mondur MR 200). Aromatic isocyanate 2 was prepared by reacting 15% w/w aromatic phosphonate (poly-(<italic>m</italic>-phenylene methylphosphonate), Fyrol PMP; Israel Chemical Ltd.–Industrial Products America) with 85% w/w of Mondur MR 200. Aromatic diamine 1 was prepared by reacting 30% w/w Ethacure 100/300 with 70% w/w Versalink P250, a very short-chain aromatic amine oligomer. Aromatic diamine 2 was prepared by reacting 30% w/w Ethacure 100/300 with 70% w/w Versalink P1000 blended with 4,4′-methylene dianiline (MDA). MDA was used to balance the volume of Part B.</p>

<title>Flame-retardant additives</title>
<p>The effect of flame-retardant additives on the flammability properties of the base polyurea and an aromatic-substituted polyurea was explored. The flame retardants were not placed in Part A of the polyurea formulations because they contained small amounts of moisture, which would react with the isocyanate. Part B had a lower viscosity and acted to disperse the fillers better. Samples were prepared by mixing the fillers into Part B using a high-speed shear mixer at 2100 r/min for 10 min, after which time a Hegman scale drawdown device was used. Mixing was continued until a Hegman scale of 6 was achieved.</p>
<p>Parts A and B were loaded into 200-mL side-by-side cartridges and dispensed through an 18-element, ¼″ static mixing tube into 2- and 3-mm-thick sheet sample molds. This was done at room temperature using a handheld dispensing gun. All the sample sheets were postcured for 16 h at 65°C.</p>
<p>The fillers examined included Cloisite 30B (Southern Clay), trisilanol-phenyl-POSS (Hybrid Plastics), ammonium polyphosphate (APP; Intumax AC-2), zinc borate (2ZnO·3B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>·3.5H<sub>2</sub>O; Firebrake ZB Fine from Borax), alumina trihydrate (ATH; Akrochem Corp.), calcium phosphate (Ca<sub>3</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>; Canada Colors and Chemicals Ltd), zeolite 3A (Zeochem), ammonium sulfate ((NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>; Canada Colors and Chemicals Ltd), sodium phosphate (Na<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>; Recochem Inc.), talc (Canada Colors and Chemicals Ltd), and APP/triisocyanurate (3:1 blend; Canada Colors and Chemicals Ltd).

<p>The effect of expandable graphite (Anthracite Industries) in the base polyurea was also examined. Two sizes were chosen, #1721 the largest particle size of treated graphite available (US Sieve 20 × 50) and #3538 the smallest particle size available (US Sieve 100 × 0 (&lt;0.15 mm)). These particle sizes were selected in order to compare the effect of surface area and particle size on flammability properties. They will be referred to as large particle graphite (LPG) and small particle graphite (SPG). Four samples were prepared, one with each graphite particle size at 12% w/w and one with each graphite particle size at the maximum loading level, which was defined as being when the viscosity of Part B reached 5000 cP. The two graphites (LPG and SPG) were added to Part B in 2% increments, and the viscosity was measured. Graphite was added until the viscosity reached 5000 cP. The maximum loading occurred at 22% w/w for LPG and at 18% w/w for SPG. Parts A and B (100 g each) were then loaded into 200-mL side-by-side cartridges and dispensed through an 18-element, ¼″ static mixing tubes into 2- and 3-mm-thick sheet sample molds. This was done at room temperature using a handheld dispensing gun. All the sample sheets were postcured, in an oven, for 16 h at 65°C at normal atmospheric conditions.</p>

<p>The first IBC examined was a polyphenylene water-based polymer (Solvay’s PrimoSpire<sup>®</sup> PR-250). This material was noncombustible and highly thermally stable. The second IBC examined was a polymer-modified, gypsum-based paint; gypsum is inherently noncombustible. The gypsum was mixed with an acrylic water-based binder to give the gypsum better impact properties as well as improved water resistance. The third ignition barrier was Nomex<sup>®</sup> fabric glued onto the polyurea with an intumescent paint (Paint to Protect DC333). Nomex has an aromatic backbone that promotes excellent char formation. For comparison purposes, the intumescent paint (Paint to Protect DC333) was also examined without the Nomex fabric. Finally, the first three ignition barriers were also mixed with LPG to determine whether the graphite could enhance their properties.</p>
<p>A summary of the samples prepared is given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0734904112462976">Table 5</xref>. The polyurea (base or aromatic-substituted sample Ar3), the type of IBC, and whether the coating contained graphite are shown. Each polyurea sheet was prepared as described in previous sections, with postcuring process. For coatings 1, 2, and 4, the ignition barrier was painted on with a brush. For each sample, two coats of the IBC were used. The coating was allowed to air dry at room temperature for 24 h before a second coat was applied. For ignition barrier 3, the Nomex fabric was applied in between the first and second coats of intumescent paint. For the IBCs containing graphite, 22% w/w of LPG was added to the coating and then dispersed with a high-speed mixer, before application.</p>

From the results in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0734904112462976">Table 6</xref>, it can be seen that sample PSi (containing both phosphorus and polydimethylsiloxane) gave the best overall results. It had the longest time to ignition and the least smoke released. Although it had a slightly higher peak HRR than the phosphorus-only sample Ph, its average HRR was half that of the other samples. These results show a shared effect between phosphorus and siloxane when they are incorporated into the polymer backbone. This may be due to them interacting to form a more stable char than each could produce individually.</p>

<title>Aromatic backbone</title>
<p>The results of the cone calorimetry testing of the aromatic-substituted polyureas are given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-0734904112462976">Table 7</xref>. It was expected that samples Ar5 through Ar8 should have produced the greatest improvements in flammability properties, as these samples had the highest degree of aromatic content. It was observed that as the aromatic content increased, the time to ignition increased. However, the samples that contained the aromatic amines (Ar1, Ar2, Ar5 to Ar8) did not perform as well as the samples with the aliphatic amine (Ar3 and Ar4). In selecting the aromatic amines, it was required that they should be a liquid to facilitate mixing and the end application technique of high-pressure impingement spraying. The aromatic amines that met this criterion typically had pendant groups on the aromatic ring, such as methyl, ethyl, methoxy, or ester groups. It is possible that these pendant groups were liberated during combustion thereby increasing the peak HRR.</p>

<p>Samples Ar3 and Ar4 produced the lowest peak HRR with only Part A (the diisocyanate) being replaced. Overall, the best results were seen in sample Ar3. It exhibited an intermediate time to ignition, while having the lowest smoke factor and peak HRR. This sample was chosen for further study.</p>

<title>Conventional fillers with base polyurea</title>
<p>Levchik<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0734904112462976">35</xref></sup> indicated that a synergistic approach to fire retardancy is required to optimize all the desired properties. This requires a combination of materials that work together to bring about the desired result. ATH and zinc borate have synergistic relationships as flame retardants. The use of melamine in polyureas has also been shown to reduce peak HRR.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0734904112462976">14</xref></sup>
</p>
<p>In this study, the filler combination that improved the fire-retardant properties the most was FRA-BASE-3 (i.e. 5% melamine + 5% calcium phosphate blend + 35% ammonium sulfate + 2.5% sodium phosphate + 2.5% talc). This sample contained talc, which was empirically shown to promote a stable char during the acid depolymerization of the polyurea surface. This, coupled with the low activation temperature at which the ammonium sulfate began to intumesce, may explain why this sample performed the best (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table8-0734904112462976">Table 8</xref>).</p>

<p>All the samples were made using the polyurea formulation PSi. This had both phosphorus-substituted Part A and siloxane-substituted Part B. As can be seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table9-0734904112462976">Table 9</xref>, all the samples performed better than the base polyurea with no fillers.

<p>The expansion ratio of the graphite increases with the particle size. Even though the smaller particle size has approximately four times the surface area of the large particle, the large particle has an expansion ratio of 290:1 versus 50:1 for the small particle. The interlayer spacing of the graphite sheets is the same regardless of the particle size, and since the LPG are larger, there are more graphite sheets to expand. The LPG clearly protected the surface of the polyurea better than the SPG at maximum loading levels. The peak HRR was 101 kW/m<sup>2</sup> for FRA-Graphite-1 (LPG at 22% w/w). This represents a 92% reduction in peak HRR from the base polyurea.</p>
<p>Sample FRA-Graphite-5 combined the increased aromatic content polyurea (Ar3) with the LPG fillers. It was determined that the addition of 22% w/w LPG was very effective in lowering the peak HRR, independent of the polyurea formulation. This is likely due to the mechanism by which the graphite decreases flammability. The graphite expands, chars, and protects the polymer, regardless of the chemical makeup of the polyurea. Both FRA-Graphite-1 and FRA-Graphite-5 had similar cone calorimetry results despite having different polyurea formulations.</p>

<p>The first IBC, polyphenylene (IBC1), showed a 45% improvement in peak HRR and a 21% improvement to the total smoke when applied to the base polyurea. The improvements rose to 84% and 48%, respectively, when LPG was added to the barrier coating (IBC2). When this barrier coating was applied to the aromatic base formulation (IBC7), improvements were also seen. There was a 22% improvement in peak HRR but no improvement to the total smoke. When the LPG was added to the barrier coating on Ar3 (IBC8), the improvements were 78% and 75%, respectively. With all samples that used this barrier coating, the time to ignition only improved 15%–30%. The addition of graphite had very little effect on the time to ignition of the coating.</p>
<p>The second IBC, gypsum-based paint, showed a 55% improvement in peak HRR and a 16% decrease in the total smoke, when applied to the base polyurea (IBC3). The improvements rose to 96% and 96%, respectively, when LPG was added to the barrier coating (IBC4). When this barrier coating was applied to the aromatic base formulation, improvements were also seen (IBC9). When the LPG was added to the barrier coating on Ar3 (IBC10), the improvements were 95% and 98%, respectively. With this barrier coating, dramatic improvements were seen in the time to ignition. When applied to the base polyurea (IBC3), the time to ignition rose from 21 to 81 s, with the graphite (IBC4), it increased further to 701 s. When applied to the aromatic polyurea Ar3, time to ignition was 211 s without graphite (IBC9) and 560 s with graphite (IBC10).</p>
<p>The third IBC, Nomex fabric with intumescent paint, showed improvement in both peak HRR and the total smoke when applied to the base polyurea (IBC5). The improvements were not quite as large when LPG was added (IBC6). Improvements were seen when this barrier coating was applied to the aromatic base Ar3 (IBC11) and when the LPG was added (IBC12). With this barrier coating, improvements were seen in the time to ignition in all the variants tested. When applied to the base polyurea, the time to ignition rose from 21 to 343 s, with the graphite it rose to 323 s. When applied to the aromatic polyurea, similar results were seen: 441 s without graphite and 592 s with graphite. The intumescent coating was evaluated alone, under the same conditions (IBC13 for the base polyurea and IBC14 for the aromatic polyurea). The result in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table11-0734904112462976">Table 11</xref> shows that the addition of the Nomex fabric improved each of the properties of interest above the intumescent coating alone.

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The following approaches were explored to achieve the time to ignition, smoke generation, HRR (peak and average), and mass loss rate as listed in MIL-STD-2031: chemical modification of the polyurea, mechanical compounding of fire-retardant additives, and finally the use of surface coatings. MIL-STD-2031 requirements for time to ignition, peak HRR, and smoke factor were achieved using a gypsum-based IBC. When 22% w/w large particle expandable graphite (Anthracite Industries #1721) was added to the gypsum-based paint, it improved the fire-resistant properties of both the base polyurea formulation and the aromatic polyurea formulation (Ar3), such that they exceeded the requirements of the chosen standard.</p>
