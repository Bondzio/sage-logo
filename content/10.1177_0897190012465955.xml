<p>Dabigatran etexilate is a competitive, direct thrombin inhibitor that works in the coagulation cascade to ultimately prevent thrombus formation. It is recommended by the 2012 American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines as first-line therapy over vitamin k antagonists for long-term antithrombotic therapy in patients with paroxysmal or persistent nonrheumatic atrial fibrillation who are at intermediate to high risk of stroke and systemic embolism (grade 2B). However, serious postmarketing events involving life-threatening bleeding are emerging with no antidote for reversal of the anticoagulant effect being available for use. Potential reversal agents are being used in clinical practice with questionable efficacy and safety profiles. We report a case involving an 84-year-old male with acute kidney injury who developed life-threatening gastrointestinal and surgical site bleeding secondary to dabigatran accumulation. Use of the Naranjo probability scale indicated a probable cause between the bleeding event and dabigatran use. After discontinuation of drug therapy, fresh frozen plasma, recombinant coagulation factor VIIa, and cryoprecipitate were administered as potential reversal agents with negligible benefit. However, this patient appeared to slowly benefit with administration of continuous venovenous hemodialysis. Based upon our experience with this patient and literature review, the most effective treatment algorithm for dabigatran-associated bleeding may be to utilize hemodialysis initially.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The American College of Chest Physicians have recently recommended the use of long-term antithrombotic therapy for patients with paroxysmal or persistent nonrheumatic atrial fibrillation (AF) who are at intermediate (CHADS<sub>2</sub> score of 1) to high risk (CHADS<sub>2</sub> score ≥ 2) of stroke and systemic embolism.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0897190012465955">1</xref>
</sup> However, in contrast to prior guidelines, dabigatran etexilate 150 mg administered orally twice daily has been recommended over traditional adjusted-dose vitamin K antagonist (VKA) therapy (grade 2B).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0897190012465955">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0897190012465955">2</xref>
</sup> This recommendation was based upon a single randomized controlled trial which showed that dabigatran 150 mg administered twice daily leads to reductions in nonfatal stroke and systemic embolism with no apparent increase in the risk of major bleeding compared with VKA therapy.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0897190012465955">3</xref>
</sup> This recommendation was given with the caveat that rare but serious postmarketing events can occur and that there is no antidote for reversal of the anticoagulant effect.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0897190012465955">1</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>In late 2011, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a drug safety communication regarding an investigation into whether bleeding adverse events were occurring at a higher rate when compared to the findings of the RELY trial.<sup>

</sup> Additionally, published reports are emerging describing cases of dabigatran-induced coagulopathy and bleeding.<sup>

</sup> Despite these reports, the issue of how to appropriately manage a patient that experiences a major bleeding event while taking dabigatran is left unanswered. Below, we report a case of dabigatran-induced major bleeding in a critically ill patient who needed emergent surgery and our experience with possible reversal and removal methods. To investigate the efficacy of supportive care treatments on other cases of dabigatran-associated bleeding, we performed an ovid_MEDLINE database search (2008 to 2012 April week 2) using various combinations of the following terms: dabigatran, hemorrhage, bleed, treatment, management, induced, and associated. In addition, a targeted hand search was performed in relevant journals. We will review the treatments used in prior cases along with current data surrounding this issue.</p>

<title>Case Report</title>
<p>An 84-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, AF, chronic kidney disease (baseline serum creatinine [sCr] 1.07 mg/dL, calculated creatinine clearance [CrCl] of 53 mL/min), and laryngeal cancer presented to the emergency department with a 2-day history of rectal bleeding and worsening abdominal distention. He was started on dabigatran 150 mg twice daily 4 days prior to admission for a suspected ischemic stroke secondary to AF and received his last dose approximately 16 hours prior to hospitalization. Upon admission, physical examination revealed a distended abdomen with guaiac-positive stool. A nasogastric (NG) tube was placed to suction with approximately 800 mL of dark brown output with intermittent bright red blood, prompting the initiation of a pantoprazole infusion. A portable abdominal x-ray and computed tomographic scan of the abdomen and pelvis indicated the presence of free air in the abdomen. Laboratory results at that time were activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) 48.1 seconds, international normalized ratio (INR) 1.7, platelet count (PLC) 237 × 10<sup>3</sup>/μL, hemoglobin 13.5 g/dL, thrombin time (TT) &gt;120 seconds, and sCr 3.96 mg/dL, with a calculated CrCl of 25 mL/min. The patient was given 4 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP), 1 dose of recombinant coagulation factor VIIa (rFVIIa) 3000 mcg (30 mcg/kg), and was emergently taken to the operating room (OR). The patient underwent an exploratory laparotomy and was found to have a cecal perforation with fecal contamination. A right hemicolectomy was performed, abdominal packing was placed, and the patient’s abdominal fascia was closed. Intraoperatively, vasopressin and norepinephrine infusions were administered along with 1.5 L of 5% albumin, 4 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs), 1 unit of FFP, and 4.5 L of crystalloid fluids. After his initial operation, the patient was transferred to the surgical intensive care unit intubated and was resuscitated with an additional 500 mL of crystalloid fluids, 1 L of 6% hetastarch in lactated electrolyte solution, and 50 g of 25% albumin.</p>
<p>Despite the administered blood products, the patient’s hemoglobin trended down from 9.5 to 5.7 mg/dL over the first 24 hours after the operation, necessitating 6 additional units of pRBCs, 10 units of cryoprecipitate (CP), 2 units of FFP, followed by the initiation of a 24-hour FFP infusion at 50 mL/h. Laboratory results at that time showed a hemoglobin of 8.7 g/dL with continued bleeding from the NG tube and a persistent coagulopathy (TT &gt;120 seconds, aPTT 131.8 seconds, INR 4.3) presumed to be secondary to dabigatran accumulation. Thus, the patient was started on continuous venovenous hemodialysis (CVVHD) for dabigatran removal on postoperative day (POD) 0.</p>
<p>On POD 2, the patient’s aPTT was 75 seconds, INR 2, and TT again remained &gt;120 seconds. His continued bleeding and hemoglobin drop to 6.9 g/dL prompted a change from CVVHD to continuous venovenous hemadiafiltration (CVVHDF). A bedside abdominal washout and packing was performed, which required 2 units of pRBCs and 2 units of FFP. Approximately 51 hours after initiation of continuous renal replacement therapy, the TT had dropped to 109.7 seconds. On POD 3, the patient remained on CVVHDF and was given 2 units pRBCs, 1 unit of platelets, and 10 units of CP due to continued signs of bleeding in the context of abnormal labs (aPTT 62.4 seconds, INR 1.5, PLC 40 × 10<sup>3</sup>/μL). Four days after the patient’s initial operation, the patient was hemodynamically stable and laboratory values continued a favorable trend (PTT 42.9 seconds, INR 1.1, TT 73 seconds, PLC 55 × 10<sup>3</sup>/μL, hemoglobin 9.3 g/dL).</p>
<p>He was then taken back to the OR on POD 4 for an exploratory laparotomy, bowel reconnect, and abdominal closure with 100 mL of blood loss requiring 1.6 L of crystalloid, and 1 unit of platelets. One day after his second operation, the patient’s TT was 52 seconds and PLC was 77 × 10<sup>3</sup>/μL. The patient began to develop pulmonary edema, and the rate of CVVHD was increased. Two days after his second operation (POD 6 from the first operation), the patient’s pulmonary edema was resolving and lab results revealed a TT of 32.5 seconds, aPTT 30.5 seconds, and INR 1. The patient failed an extubation trial which required reintubation later that day. Three days after his second operation, the patient remained intubated, CVVHD rates were reduced, and the patient was noted to be without clinical or laboratory signs of bleeding.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Dabigatran etexilate has demonstrated efficacy for reduction of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with nonvalvular AF.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0897190012465955">3</xref>
</sup> Dabigatran etexilate is a prodrug that is metabolized by esterase-catalyzed hydrolysis to the active moiety.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0897190012465955">12</xref>
</sup> It is a competitive, direct thrombin inhibitor that works in the coagulation cascade to ultimately prevent thrombus formation by inhibition of free- and clot-bound thrombin and thrombin-induced platelet aggregation. Additionally, dabigatran has many attributes that make it a desirable anticoagulant over VKAs such as predictable pharmacokinetics and anticoagulation response making routine monitoring unnecessary. However, this therapy is not without risks such as serious bleeding, which has been illustrated in the above case and several other published case reports.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0897190012465955">5</xref>

</sup> While dabigatran has predictable pharmacokinetics, renal dysfunction can impair its elimination, increasing the half-life from 13 hours (normal renal function) to 27 hours in patients with severe renal impairment (CrCl 15-30 mL/min), thereby leading to potentially supratherapeutic drug levels.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0897190012465955">12</xref>
</sup> Other factors that have been hypothesized to affect drug accumulation include advanced age, low body weight, and drug interactions through p-glycoprotein transporter.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0897190012465955">5</xref>
</sup> Advanced age and the presence of renal dysfunction as risk factors for dabigatran-induced bleeding are supported by all reported bleeds occurring in patients aged greater than 60 years<sup>

</sup> having moderate to severe renal dysfunction.</p>
<p>Although regular coagulation monitoring is not recommended for patients on dabigatran, it may be necessary for situations such as severe bleeding episodes or emergent surgery.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0897190012465955">15</xref>
</sup> In our patient case, both indications were met necessitating monitoring. While ecarin clotting time (ECT) is the preferred assay for measurement of thrombin generation and direct thrombin inhibitor activity, it has not yet been approved by the FDA for clinical use.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0897190012465955">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0897190012465955">16</xref>
</sup> Therefore, we chose to use thrombin clotting time which shows a linear dose response at normal dabigatran concentrations. However, at dabigatran concentrations above 600 ng/mL, the maximum measurement of the test is exceeded, correlating to a TT of greater than 120 seconds. We also obtained aPTT measurements that have been shown to have a curvilinear concentration–response curve that plateaus at dabigatran concentrations greater than 200 ng/mL. With this relationship, the aPTT may be relatively insensitive at normal concentrations making interpretation of the test difficult. PT/INR was also obtained but has been shown to be an insensitive marker as opposed to PT/INR monitoring for VKAs. Our patient on admission had an elevated TT of &gt;120 seconds and severe renal dysfunction, indicating accumulation of dabigatran with levels &gt;600 ng/mL and a prolonged elimination half-life. The majority of prior cases used a combination of TT and/or aPTT for coagulation monitoring. A single case report measured dabigatran plasma levels and found strong correlation between the TT measurements and drug levels.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0897190012465955">8</xref>
</sup> Other cases had difficulty interpreting coagulation measurements due to differences in the interpretation of aPTT and TT values drawn at the same time.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0897190012465955">7</xref>
</sup> In addition, efficacy of administered treatments has been difficult to assess based on TT alone.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0897190012465955">11</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Although reversal agents for dabigatran overdose are unavailable, the manufacturer suggests discontinuing dabigatran therapy, initiating supportive care, the potential use of hemodialysis, and investigating the source of the bleed.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0897190012465955">15</xref>
</sup> In VKA overdose, therapies such as phytonadione, FFP, CP, rFVIIa, and prothrombin complex concentrates (PCCs) can play a role in reversal.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0897190012465955">17</xref>

</sup> However, what constitutes supportive care for dabigatran overdose is currently in debate. A systematic evaluation of the available published literature regarding dabigatran reversal showed that few studies, including animal and human data, exist to support current proposed therapies.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0897190012465955">22</xref>

<p>Phytonadione is used for VKA reversal because it is needed for production of the inhibited coagulation factors.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0897190012465955">17</xref>
</sup> This therapy has no expected benefit for reversing direct thrombin inhibitors due to the mechanism of action which is supported by no observed effect in the 5 patients who received phytonadione.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0897190012465955">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0897190012465955">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0897190012465955">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0897190012465955">14</xref>
</sup> Fresh frozen plasma does not seem to have a role in dabigatran reversal since the underlying coagulation defect is due to inhibition of thrombin and not depletion of coagulation factors.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0897190012465955">22</xref>
</sup> Our patient received large amounts of FFP upon initial presentation to the emergency department and throughout his hospital stay, without seeing an effect on TT or transfusion requirements. Additionally, 7 other patients received FFP in the reported cases with no documented benefit.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0897190012465955">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0897190012465955">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0897190012465955">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0897190012465955">14</xref>
</sup> Cryoprecipitate, a fibrinogen-rich blood product, was used in only 2 cases including ours with no appreciable effect.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0897190012465955">6</xref>
</sup> The benefit of CP has not been evaluated in this situation and the case reports did not properly assess a change in coagulation parameters after administration. Therefore, a conclusion regarding CP’s benefit cannot thoroughly be assessed at this time.</p>
<p>Recombinant coagulation factor VIIa and PCC are most widely recommended for reversal of dabigatran-induced bleeding with little supportive data. Our patient received a single dose of 30 mcg/kg of rFVIIa. Although the TT was not checked after administration of rFVIIa, it is unlikely an effect would have been seen based upon TT monitoring due to the maximum measurement being &gt;120 seconds. Two other cases reported the use of rFVIIa with positive effects seen only in 1 of these patients after 2 large doses of 90 mcg/kg.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0897190012465955">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0897190012465955">10</xref>
</sup> Changes in coagulation monitoring were not assessed but bleeding decreased from 1500 mL/h to approximately 800 mL/h.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0897190012465955">8</xref>
</sup> However, with the limited efficacy data available and lack of safety data, a firm recommendation for its use cannot be given.</p>
<p>Prothrombin complex concentrates are another postulated reversal agent, but this was not administered to our patient. Currently, only 3-coagulation factor products with negligible amounts of factor VII and activated PCC are available in the United States. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 12 healthy volunteers who received dabigatran 150 mg orally twice daily for 2.5 days showed that administration of a 4-coagulation factor PCC, Cofact 50 IU/kg, did not affect any of the elevated coagulation parameters: aPTT, TT, or ECT.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0897190012465955">23</xref>
</sup> A case report available in abstract form discussed the use of factor eight inhibitor bypassing activity (FEIBA), for a patient receiving dabigatran with subsequent development of life-threatening bleeding after transeptal perforation during cardiac ablation.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0897190012465955">11</xref>
</sup> While the TT did not change as expected, visual inspection showed decreased bleeding at 1 minute and a notable change at 5 minutes. Authors concluded that measuring TT may not be predictive of actual effect on bleeding. Additionally, 2 other published cases reported the use of the 3-coagulation factor PCC, Profilnine, and found little effect on coagulation parameters.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0897190012465955">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0897190012465955">7</xref>
</sup> With these data, it is still unclear where PCC should fit into the algorithm of dabigatran reversal, if at all. It seems unlikely that the addition of rFVIIa to the 3-factor coagulation PCC would increase the efficacy due to the data from Eerenberg et al.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0897190012465955">23</xref>
</sup> However, with all of the above treatments, the place in therapy, optimal timing, dose, and monitoring are still not fully elucidated.</p>
<p>Two treatment modalities have been shown to have a role in dabigatran overdose including activated charcoal and hemodialysis. In vitro simulations have shown approximately 99.9% of dabigatran to be adsorbed by activated charcoal, but this has not been tested in vivo.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0897190012465955">24</xref>
</sup> Expert opinion recommends administration of activated charcoal approximately 1 to 2 hours after overdose; however, this was not feasible in our patient due to the timing of his last dabigatran ingestion and was not used in any published case reports.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0897190012465955">16</xref>
</sup> Dabigatran is approximately 35% protein-bound making hemodialysis an option for clearance of the drug.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0897190012465955">15</xref>
</sup> In a study of patients with end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis, 62% and 68% of the drug was removed during a 2-hour and 4-hour hemodialysis session, respectively.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0897190012465955">25</xref>
</sup> Dialysis poses its own risks due to the need for a dialysis catheter in a coagulopathic patient. Depending on the patient’s illness acuity, benefit may outweigh risk and dialysis may be desirable. Intermittent hemodialysis sessions were used in 2 cases with favorable results.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0897190012465955">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0897190012465955">8</xref>
</sup> In one case, dabigatran levels were shown to decrease from 76 to 27 ng/mL after a 6-hour hemodialysis session.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0897190012465955">8</xref>
</sup> Additionally, a recently published case report showed hemodialysis to be effective in removing dabigatran prior to cardiac transplantation with no abnormal bleeding during or after the surgery.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0897190012465955">26</xref>
</sup> We chose to initiate dialysis in our patient, but CVVHD/CVVHDF was chosen due to the patient’s hemodynamic instability. Based on the TT measurements, this mode of dialysis removed negligible amounts of dabigatran but may have had a small impact on the patient’s recovery time. This was also observed in another case where a patient received CVVHD.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0897190012465955">6</xref>
</sup> For future patients with hemorrhage in the context of dabigatran use, we recommend hemodialysis to remove the drug more rapidly and to support hemodynamics with vasopressors as needed.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Clinicians must remain aware of the benefits and risks of new anticoagulants, including dabigatran, specifically in elderly patients with altered renal function. Overall, it remains unclear how to best monitor and treat a patient with a dabigatran-associated bleeding, specifically with regard to drug reversal or drug elimination. The pretreatment evaluation of the patient as an appropriate dabigatran candidate is most important. If a life-threatening bleed does occur, initiation of activated charcoal and hemodialysis first may be most appropriate based upon the available data. There is insufficient data to determine whether efficacy outweighs safety risk associated with other treatments such as rFVIIa and PCC. Future studies should investigate the optimal treatment regimen for patients experiencing a major bleed while taking dabigatran. Such investigations should also attempt to determine the occurrence of mortality among these patients.</p>
