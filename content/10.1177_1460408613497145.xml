<abstract>
<p>We present a case of a 23-year-old man who suffered a facial assault. An intracranial foreign body, a socket from a socket wrench, was introduced into the cranial cavity via a medial conjunctival entry wound which presented with minimal physical signs. The entry wound and the foreign body were missed during the patient’s first presentation to an emergency department leading to a delay in diagnosis. Subsequent periorbital swelling and visual blurring prompted delayed investigation leading to detection of the foreign body. This case report highlights the need for a high index of suspicion of intracranial complications when assessing ocular injuries. The mechanism of the penetrating injury, the ophthalmological findings and the surgical and antibiotic management are discussed.</p>

<p>Penetrating brain injury caused by non-missile, low-velocity objects represents a rare pathology among civilians. Although normally presenting with neurological signs and symptoms suggestive of intracranial penetration occasionally such injuries may be hidden. This case shows that in such occult presentations it is important that a thorough examination is performed to exclude intra cranial penetration even in the face of seemingly innocent injury.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1460408613497145" sec-type="cases"><title>Case report</title>
<p>A 23-year-old male was assaulted whilst under the influence of alcohol. His only recall of the injury was of a punch in the facial region. There were minimal initial sequelae and he remained alert. On the following day, he noticed a small laceration to the right upper eyelid and attended his local emergency department (ED). An eyelid laceration was identified and sutured. Over the next 7 days, he noticed increasing swelling of the right eyelid, blurred vision and pain in the right eye. There was no double vision or rhinorrhea but he did report anosmia.</p>
<p>He re-attended the ED and was assessed by an ophthalmologist. The right pupil was dilated and unreactive to light. Visual acuity was 6/15 on the right and 6/6 on the left. There was a short horizontal laceration to the medial conjunctiva of the right eye, visible on full abduction of the globe. The cornea, fundi and intraocular pressure were normal.</p>
<p>Assessment of eye movements indicated that extra-occular muscle function was unimpaired. There were no symptoms or signs of meningism. A diagnosis of a traumatic mydriasis and a penetrating orbital injury was made (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1460408613497145">Figure 1</xref>).

</fig></p>
<p>Computed tomographic (CT) scan of the brain with bone windows revealed a cylindrical metallic foreign body lying at the floor of the anterior fossa with an associated fracture of the orbital roof and the cribriform plate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1460408613497145">Figure 2</xref>).

</fig></p>
<p>The patient was admitted under the care of the neurosurgical department for surgery. A minicraniotomy via a transglabellar incision (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1460408613497145">Figure 3</xref>) was performed. The anterior wall of the frontal sinus was raised as a free flap, the floor of the anterior fossa was exposed and a chrome plated socket was located and removed from the inferior frontal cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1460408613497145">Figure 4</xref>). A repair of the anterior fossa floor was done with a pericranial flap and Tisseel™ repair. The frontal sinus was repaired and cranialised by exposure of the entire sinus, meticulous removal of all sinus mucosa and removal of the posterior table bone. A lumbar drain was placed for 48 h to protect the repair. A perioperative course of an intravenous second generation cephalosporin was administered.

</fig></p>
<p>Post-operative recovery was uneventful and at 2 month follow-up demonstrated visual acuity of 6/15 on the right and 6/6 on the left with a persistent right mydriasis and mild right ptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1460408613497145">Figure 5</xref>). His sense of smell had not returned.

<p>Penetrating wounds of the orbit are relatively rare. In 2010–11, 155 such injuries required inpatient admission in England (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1460408613497145">HES data</xref>). Previous case reports have described penetration of the orbital roof by spears, needles, metal nails, scissors and twigs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1460408613497145">Dunn et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1460408613497145">Kahler et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1460408613497145">Kasamo et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1460408613497145">Matsumoto et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1460408613497145">Merritt et al., 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1460408613497145">Mutlukan et al., 1991</xref>). This is the first case report of an intracranial socket introduced via an orbital route. In this case, the foreign body passed through the orbit lacerating the conjunctiva before penetrating the medial orbital wall, the ethmoid sinus and the cribriform plate. There was a dural laceration overlying the region of the cribriform plate. The unusual feature of this case was that the small concealed nature of the conjunctival wound led to a delay in diagnosis.</p>
<p>Previous reports indicate that the commonest signs of orbital injury include loss of external ocular movements, chemosis, peri-orbital swelling and conjunctival tears or eyelid laceration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1460408613497145">Chibbaro and Tacconi, 2006</xref>). A minor eyelid laceration, a small conjunctival laceration and traumatic mydriasis were present in this case. A small inconspicuous entry wound in orbital trauma has previously been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1460408613497145">Wesley et al., 1987</xref>). This author reports that initial physical findings may be minimal, as noted in this case.</p>
<p>It has been documented that intracranial high velocity foreign bodies and bone fragments may be safely left in place posing little infection risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1460408613497145">Aarabi et al., 1998</xref>). Low velocity foreign bodies may require different treatment. In Chabbaro and Tacconi’s series of 18 orbitocranial injuries, the most common delayed complications were cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak, meningitis and cerebral abscess (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1460408613497145">Chibbaro and Tacconi, 2006</xref>). We removed this foreign body to debride the entry wound and to repair and prevent potential CSF fistula.</p>
<p>The infectious complications of foreign bodies penetrating the cranial vault through the orbit may include orbital cellulitis, meningitis, subdural empyema and brain abscess.</p>
<p>The incidence of intracranial infection following low velocity foreign body penetration after debridement and surgical treatment is low. Some authors have described increased infection rates with penetrating missile injuries which cause a CSF fistula. This suggests that perioperative antibiotic cover may be of use in such injuries.</p>
<p>Although <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1460408613497145">Annegers et al. (1998)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1460408613497145">Salazar et al. (1985)</xref> have reported increased risk of early post-traumatic seizures in severe brain injury and high velocity penetrating brain injuries leading to the Brain Trauma Foundation recommendation for early anticonvulsant therapy for no longer than 1 week (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1460408613497145">Bratton et al., 2007</xref>), there is insufficient evidence to implicate low velocity penetrating trauma in post-traumatic epilepsy. Prophylactic anti-seizure medication was, therefore, not administered and the patient remains seizure free.</p>
<p>The anosmia suffered by the patient is probably the result of direct injury to the cribriform plate or olfactory nerves as opposed to contusional injury to the olfactory tracts and more posterior olfactory system. This is unlikely to recover.</p>
<p>This case emphasises the need for a close and thorough examination of the patient and selection of CT head scanning if the mechanism of injury and history of continuing symptoms despite minimal signs suggest ongoing pathology. Thus some of the words of Hippocrates’ ancient maxim ring true: ‘No head injury is too severe to despair of, nor too trivial to ignore’</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1460408613497145" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>We conclude that the conjunctival–orbital–cranial route may provide an entry point for an intracranial foreign body with minimal associated physical signs. Prompt identification and treatment of such injuries are required to minimise the risk of secondary infection and CSF leakage which were averted in this case. Detection of orbito-cranial penetrating injuries requires a high index of suspicion in any case of orbital trauma, even when physical signs are minimal.</p>
