<p>Guy Boy’s <italic>Handbook of Human–Machine Interaction</italic> integrates established theories and models with current research, new theories, and new models and simulations. The necessity of involving human factors/ergonomics researchers at the design stage is evident throughout. In addition to the editor’s introduction and conclusion, three sections (analysis, design, and evaluation) of the handbook include 20 chapters by an international mix of top researchers in the field.</p>
<p>It was refreshing to see Raj, Doyle, and Cameron make a distinction between situation awareness and situation understanding. Raj et al.’s contribution of Bayesian probabilities and Markov models for psychophysiological analyses provides the reader an initial understanding, becoming more prevalent in how many HF/E researchers are analyzing data.</p>
<p>Burian and Martin discuss the importance of various document formats, from standalone documents (e.g., stationary checklists) to dynamic documents (e.g., low-altitude warning for aircraft). We are reminded of how “poor design can actually increase operator workload and give rise to confusion and error.” Implementing HF/E principles can ameliorate these issues with user performance through the design of a system that provides adaptable automation, as discussed in Boy and Grote’s chapter, and by considering the sophistication of the user based on experience and age, as pointed out by Simoes, Pereira, and Panou.</p>
<p>The handbook addresses broad applications in HMI, such as cognitive architecture, perception, human reliability assessment, decision support tools, fatigue, and sociotechnical systems. These broad applications are applied to simple systems, such as the Bixi Rental Bicycle System discussed by Robert and Lesage, and to complex systems such as cockpits of advanced aircraft, discussed by Harris and Li. However, the chapters are transportation heavy, with few examples of gaming applications, power plant operations, and the medical field at either the individual or group level. Other than a few references, the book could have benefited from more inclusion concerning participatory design.</p>
<p><italic>The Handbook of Human–Machine Interaction</italic> is very informative, and some parts are both educational and humorous. For example, in Bradshaw, Feltovich, and Johnson’s chapter on human-agent interaction, I found myself learning as well as laughing from the illustrations and pictures about the capabilities and limitations of humans and machines.</p>
<p>With any work of this size, there can be problems. Many of the chapters seemed out of place. For example, some chapters in the analysis section may have fit better in the design section. The book’s fair share of typos made some of the important points ambiguous. Although attempts by the authors may have been noble, better integration with other chapters would have made the reading flow more smoothly.</p>
<p>Despite some common flaws, the handbook is a useful resource for the human factors/ergonomics community. New models are introduced, current research is discussed, and projections of future trends are illustrated.</p>
