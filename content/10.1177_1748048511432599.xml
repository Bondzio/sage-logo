<abstract>
<p>This article argues that small states have a significant contribution to make to international communications research, which is dominated by a large state event-oriented outlook. A study of newspaper reporting on developing countries in Ireland shows significant coverage in genres neglected by research to date, beyond the ‘international news’ pages, which presents a less negative and more nuanced picture of the developing world than usually described in the literature. The discussion is situated within international news flow and world-systems theory and demonstrates the potential for small states to depolarize the event vs context debate on determinants, showing why semi-peripheral perspectives are vital for the future development and application of world-systems theory in international communications research.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>During the first half of 2008, some of the world’s poorest countries made international headlines. Predictably newsworthy events were occurring such as war in Afghanistan, violent pre- and post-election crises in Kenya and Zimbabwe, ongoing conflict and humanitarian crises between Chad and Sudan, the assassination of Benazir Bhutto in Pakistan and so on. Nepal provided brief respite from negative news with its peaceful shift from monarchy to democracy, but when cyclone Nargis hit Burma/Myanmar, reports from the developing world resumed the default position, reflecting the ‘coups and earthquakes’ syndrome of media coverage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1748048511432599">Rosenblum, 1979</xref>). Yet, beyond the headlines in Irish newspaper coverage during this period, a different picture of the developing world emerged. Afghanistan appeared frequently in arts and culture coverage, Chad was implicated in Irish domestic politics while reporting on Nepal was almost exclusively concerned with the age of consent of young boys. The press in this small state presented a different picture of the developing world to that which international news flow theory would have predicted.</p>
<p>This article discusses international communications theory against the background of a study of Irish newspaper coverage of the developing world. It argues that small state media studies provide much needed balance to international communications (IC) research, not least by showing how analysis of all news output, and not just international news sections, presents a more neutral and nuanced representation of the developing world. Beginning with a review of the literature on IC research, the article continues by exploring the potential for application and development of world-systems theory, particularly with regard to the perspective of semi-peripheral countries, which are often but not always also small states. A case study from Ireland on newspaper coverage of the developing world is presented as a semi-peripheral view on how some aspects of news flow research are challenged. Then, in light of the findings, the discussion teases out the four key predictors of international news coverage – Deviance, Relevance, Affinity and Prominence (after <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1748048511432599">Golan, 2008</xref>) – and examines the challenges and opportunities for future IC research.</p>

<sec id="section2-1748048511432599">
<title>Literature review</title>
<p>Debate has continued in the literature for over four decades on what, if anything, determines international news flows and why some stories or countries appear to get more coverage than others. Studies tend to fall into event-oriented (‘gatekeeper’) or contextual perspectives. The former focus on the characteristics of an event to determine its newsworthiness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1748048511432599">Galtung and Ruge, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1748048511432599">Rosenblum, 1979</xref>), while the latter highlight factors such as the geopolitical position of countries within world-systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1748048511432599">Chang, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1748048511432599">Golan, 2008</xref>), trade links between countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1748048511432599">Golan and Wanta, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1748048511432599">Pietilainen, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1748048511432599">Wu, 2007</xref>), how media structures influence news flows (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1748048511432599">Kim, 2003</xref>) and so on. Trends in newer communication technologies present some challenges to early hypotheses on news flows (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1748048511432599">Wall, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1748048511432599">Wu, 2007</xref>) and some researchers question whether macro predictors of news flow exist at all (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1748048511432599">Archetti, 2008</xref>). However, one consistent feature of international news flow research is that it is dominated by studies from large elite nations such as the US and UK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1748048511432599">Lazarsfeld, 1952</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1748048511432599">Tsang et al., 1988</xref>).</p>
<p>A second consistent feature of IC research is the narrow basis upon which studies are designed. The standard methodology for international news flow press research is content analysis of newspaper output where the coverage labelled ‘foreign’ or ‘international news’ is usually selected for analysis. However, relying on such categories carries risks. Definitions may differ between countries and need constant re-examination because of the shifting ground under what the media define as ‘local’, ‘national’, ‘foreign’ or ‘international’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1748048511432599">Berger, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1748048511432599">Tsang et al., 1988</xref>). This restricted approach to harvesting data also introduces subjective editorial definitions to the research design. Moreover, it excludes much potentially relevant newspaper content. The limitations of this part-view, single issue, selected titles/networks approach so prevalent in large state research, while acknowledged by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1748048511432599">Golan (2008</xref>), leave a serious lacuna in the literature.</p>
<p>This feature is most starkly illustrated in the few studies that focus specifically on developing world coverage, which <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1748048511432599">Scott (2009a</xref>) identifies as chronically lacking in IC research. Several studies – again from large states – show that developing nations are consistently found not to be as newsworthy as the developed nations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1748048511432599">Chang, 1998</xref>). And, if the developing world does receive coverage, the tone is overwhelmingly negative and dominated by conflict and disaster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1748048511432599">Franks, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1748048511432599">Stevenson, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1748048511432599">Tai, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1748048511432599">VSO, 2001</xref>). This is directly related to the assumption that developing world news happens only on ‘news’ pages, and not on ‘business’ or ‘culture’ pages, which is a result of the narrow methodological approaches applied in examining only news genres. Furthermore, it implicates the IC research community in maintaining the perception of developing countries as locations of negative events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1748048511432599">Ayish, 1991</xref>), rather than countries where other things like business and culture happen, ‘a normal place like anywhere else’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1748048511432599">Franks, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Third, national context is seen as an important factor in how the media cover world affairs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1748048511432599">Kim, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1748048511432599">Tai, 2000</xref>), either through domestication of international news (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1748048511432599">Berger, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1748048511432599">Lee and Yang, 1995</xref>) or through a ‘cultural bias’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1748048511432599">Novais, 2007</xref>). Many studies on determinants of news flow discuss ‘relevance’ as a key driver of coverage. These largely US-based studies usually express relevance as US involvement or a threat to the United States and its interests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1748048511432599">Chang and Lee, 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1748048511432599">Chang et al., 1987</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1748048511432599">Hicks and Gordon, 1974</xref>, cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1748048511432599">Golan, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1748048511432599">Shoemaker et al., 1991</xref>). Given the dominant position of the US geopolitically (as well as in IC research), relevance applies to a vast number of issues and events occurring all over the world. Sheer volume makes deeper analysis of any contextual determinants a challenge and may to some extent explain why the ‘gatekeeper’ perspective dominates the literature. There is consensus that the US media show limited interest in international news in general compared to other countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1748048511432599">Tai, 2000</xref>) so it is unlikely that the literature can adequately reflect coverage in other countries, especially smaller states.</p>
<p>One or two ‘elite’ media are not enough to represent the whole press of a country (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1748048511432599">Kim, 2003</xref>), and so research from one or two elite nations cannot adequately represent all IC research. The literature to date really only describes what flows onto international news pages in large elite states whose interest in international news is already shown to be limited and which by design may exclude more balanced coverage in particular of the developing world.</p>
<p>State size matters (after <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1748048511432599">Hallin, 2009</xref>), not just in relation to the character of media systems but equally to the character of IC research. Small state research is a growing field in political science and international relations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1748048511432599">Joenniemi, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1748048511432599">Simpson, 2006</xref>) and is necessary if a social science is to take the majority of its universe seriously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1748048511432599">Neumann and Gstöhl, 2004</xref>). Small state studies offer the potential to rebalance IC research not least by showing how analysis of the total output of newspapers and not just the international news pages, changes the picture of international news coverage and in particular that of the developing world.</p>
<sec id="section3-1748048511432599">
<title>World-systems theory: The semi-peripheral perspective</title>
<p>World-systems theory (WST) is a promising direction for international news flow research. Several analyses have established how information appears to move from peripheral to core countries, resulting in inequalities in representation, depending on a country’s position in the world-system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1748048511432599">Chang, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1748048511432599">Golan, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1748048511432599">Kim and Barnett, 1996</xref>). Position or ‘prominence’ – whether core, peripheral or semi-peripheral – is a key predictor of coverage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1748048511432599">Golan, 2008</xref>: 55). But with research dominated by large elite nation perspectives, the emphasis inevitably focuses on periphery/core flows. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1748048511432599">Terlouw (2003</xref>) warns against such polarized application of world-systems analysis, which creates theory based on small and biased samples.</p>
<p>Objective statistical categories such as GNP per capita and population size have been suggested as the defining characteristics of world-system positions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1748048511432599">Arrighi, 1985</xref>). These criteria are traditionally used in international news research studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1748048511432599">Golan, 2008</xref>). However, the semi-periphery is frequently defined by other factors such as high levels of economic dependency, lack of indigenous entrepreneurialism, potential for political instability or openness to globalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1748048511432599">Wallerstein, 1984</xref>). For some, the semi-periphery represents the middle ground on a spectrum from periphery to core (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1748048511432599">Terlouw, 2003</xref>) while others view it as an evolutionary stage in sociopolitical development, found in many states throughout history (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1748048511432599">Chase-Dunn, 2005</xref>). Terlouw considers the semi-periphery not as a descriptive category, but as an analytical instrument to study change, which improves the understanding of the dynamics of the world-system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1748048511432599">Terlouw, 2003</xref>: 72). This correlates with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1748048511432599">O’Hearn’s (2001)</xref> view of the semi-periphery as a <italic>strategic</italic> position between both core and periphery and undergoing constant shift. This conceptual approach seems most suited for the application of WST to international news research as it is less concerned with the qualifications of individual countries as to position, than with interaction between them. It considers all system positions as fluid and explicitly acknowledges the contribution the semi-periphery can make in analysing processes within the system.</p>

<sec id="section4-1748048511432599">
<title>Ireland’s small and semi-peripheral outlook</title>
<p>Ireland is consistently defined both as a small state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1748048511432599">Katzenstein, 1985</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1748048511432599">2003</xref>) and as semi-peripheral under statistical, descriptive and strategic criteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1748048511432599">Grant and Lyons, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1748048511432599">O’Hearn, 2001</xref>). O’Hearn’s concept of the semi-periphery describes Ireland as a ‘key intermediate zone’ in the Atlantic economy, with an important strategic role between the EU and the core states of the US and UK. It is among the most highly globalized countries in the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1748048511432599">Carswell, 2010</xref>) and is heavily dependent on foreign trade, a noted predictor of foreign news in small countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1748048511432599">Pietlainen, 2006</xref>). It is a recipient of significant inward investment from the US with over half of all transnational corporations in Ireland being US companies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1748048511432599">IMF, 2007</xref>). What makes Ireland a ‘critical intermediating periphery’, according to O’Hearn, is that it holds one-fifth of all US investment in the entire EU (2001: 202).</p>
<p>Ireland’s relationships with the US and UK and membership of the EU and UN are strong influences not just on its economy, but also on its culture and international identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1748048511432599">Tonra, 2007</xref>). However, the picture is not one of a dependent subject but rather of mutual flows, which challenge typical ‘post-colonial’ perspectives on small semi-peripheral state relations with core nations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1748048511432599">Peillon, 2003</xref>). Indeed, one of the ‘key master frames’ in Irish foreign policy political discourse is that of ‘<italic>special relations</italic>’ with the UK and US, originating in historic, social and personal ties with these states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1748048511432599">O’Regan, 2010</xref>: 5). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1748048511432599">Archetti (2008</xref>) describes how a country’s national interest contributes to the newsworthiness of foreign actors in the eyes of media professionals. She specifies the national interest as a country’s ‘priorities in relation to the rest of the world as defined by the country’s political leaders’ (2008: 482). Thus, the relationship between a semi-peripheral country and influential core states must be considered a factor in media representations of the periphery, if position within the world system is deemed pertinent in IC research. In this way, third party flows introduce potential for indirect determinants of news, i.e. determinants for large states may also be incorporated by smaller states by proxy.</p>
<p>O’Regan identified three other ‘long-established and historically-embedded’ master frames in Irish foreign policy discourse: the ‘<italic>anti-colonialism/imperialism</italic>’ frame, ‘<italic>Ireland’s neutrality as sacrosanct</italic>’ and the ‘<italic>commitment to primacy of the UN</italic>’ frame. These frames reflect an international relations role similar to that of other small states, emphasizing ‘principles’ over ‘interests’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1748048511432599">O’Regan, 2010</xref>: 4). The ‘non-colonial’ nature of Ireland’s relationship to developing countries and pride in levels of aid in comparison to other ‘colonial’ countries has been observed, both in media and political discourses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1748048511432599">Griesshaber, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1748048511432599">Horgan, 1987a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1748048511432599">O’Neill, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1748048511432599">O’Regan, 2010</xref>). Relations with the developing world are ‘integral’ to Ireland’s foreign policy reflected in the central role that development aid plays in foreign policy and the long tradition of missionary and humanitarian work, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa (Irish <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1748048511432599">Aid, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1748048511432599">O’Neill, 2002</xref>). These principles and policies could be considered part of a strategic position adopted by semi-peripheral countries negotiating the space between core and periphery.</p>
<p>Ireland holds a relatively unique place within media systems, as the only small state member of the Liberal model in the EU/EFTA with a giant neighbour sharing the same language (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1748048511432599">Puppis et al., 2009</xref>, after <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1748048511432599">Hallin and Mancini, 2004</xref>) and has a particular contribution to make to IC research.</p>

<title>Case study</title>
<p>A study was carried out on six months’ worth of print media coverage (from 1 January to 30 June 2008), of 68 developing countries<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1748048511432599">1</xref>
</sup> across eight national and 24 regional newspapers in Ireland. A descriptive content analysis sought to assess for the first time what kind of coverage developing countries receive in Ireland. This case study presents selected descriptive findings, followed by discussion on the implications for news flow theory and IC research in general.</p>
<sec id="section6-1748048511432599">
<title>Methodology</title>
<p>A keyword search of 68 different countries (on the OECD/ODA list of least developed countries) generated over 6000 units for analysis. A constructed random sample of four newspaper weeks was selected (following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1748048511432599">Riffe et al., 2005</xref>), which represented one-sixth of all the relevant articles (977 valid for analysis). Data were harvested from the entire newspaper output and the unit of analysis was the individual article. This method ensured that material for analysis was included on the basis of the content of the text (any mention of a relevant country), rather than the output of a particular newspaper section (‘international news’, ‘foreign news’, ‘world news’, etc.), thus avoiding the skewed field of analysis common in large state IC research to date. Each article was coded for quantitative variables such as <italic>Country</italic>, <italic>Genre</italic> (News, Editorial, Opinion, Business, Entertainment, Sport, etc.), <italic>Topic</italic>,<italic> Author</italic>, <italic>Irish angle</italic>, <italic>Relevance </italic>(Major, Minor or Incidental) and <italic>Sources</italic>, while the qualitative variable relevant to this discussion is <italic>Tone </italic>(articles were coded as overtly positive, overtly negative or neutral/indiscernible).</p>
<p>The data were subjected to intercoder reliability testing where a second researcher coded a proportion of the sample separately to ensure consistency of coding method, clarity of expression and reliability of results. Using <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1748048511432599">Holsti’s (1969)</xref> method, the testing indicated over 85% agreement on the quantitative data and over 75% agreement on the qualitative data, which, following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1748048511432599">Wimmer and Dominick (1991</xref>), is within an acceptable range for a descriptive content analysis, the basis for the discussion contained herein.</p>

<p>As to why these genres are not usually within the research design, it may be assumed that ‘Sport’ for example would not present coverage worthy of analysis and that developing world references may be stereotypical. Of course many articles in the ‘Sport’ genre when referencing Ethiopia did indeed relate to long distance running, just as articles on Bangladesh concerned cricket, and those referencing Togo were mostly about footballer Emmanuel Adebayor (then a striker for Arsenal football club). But Sports coverage is not always just sports results and some unexpected topics arose in the genre, such as ‘Conflict’. The murder of Olympic gold medallist Lucas Sang in the post-election violence in Kenya in January 2008 triggered several articles about the challenges facing international sports stars living in conflict zones.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1748048511432599">3</xref>
</sup> Ghana’s hosting of the Africa Cup of Nations generated much discussion about the attitudes of ‘western’ football organizations to their African counterparts. The ‘Business’ genre accounted for almost one-tenth of daily newspaper coverage, with many stories charting the progress of Irish mineral exploration companies in Uganda, Mozambique and elsewhere. These examples suggest that both sports and business journalism, genres neglected in the research to date, provide alternative avenues for coverage of the developing world which may also be distinctive given the expectation from readers for detailed specialist information, often generated outside standard international news channels.</p>
<p>However, developing countries got little or no attention from editorials (less than 1%), indicating a low editorial value attached to the developing world. Some coverage was found in ‘Letters to the Editor’, which although not reflective of readership as a whole, indicates some reader interest and supports previous research findings that editorial perceptions of readers’ lack of interest in foreign news is at odds with the expressed interests of readers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1748048511432599">Berger, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1748048511432599">Kim, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Differences in genre trends between newspaper types can be explained somewhat by format. Irish Sunday newspapers are mostly broadsheet with multiple supplements, so have space to focus on longer analytical news articles, hence the higher number in the ‘News features’ and ‘Opinion’ genres. More frequent publication and shorter lead time means ‘News’ items dominate coverage in daily newspapers. Irish regional newspapers are weekly and often tabloid in format, and do not have the readership requirements for national or international news or business news so therefore focus limited resources on more local news articles.</p>

<title>Providing neutral territory: How genre selection impacts on tone</title>
<p>It is a widely held perception that most media coverage of the developing world is negative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1748048511432599">Franks, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1748048511432599">Golan, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1748048511432599">Haenens, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1748048511432599">Scott, 2009a</xref>). However, as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1748048511432599">Table 2</xref>, the majority of articles in this study were found to be neutral in tone, despite the presence of conflict as a significant topic (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-1748048511432599">Table 7</xref> further). Just one-third of all articles were found to be ‘negative’, while overtly positive descriptions were thin on the ground, with small variations between newspaper types.</p>

<p>However, when topics are considered along with other variables such as the ‘Irish angle’, the reference to country as location rather than nationality and relevance of the country to the story overall, a more complex picture of coverage emerges. The topic most associated with Afghanistan was Arts/Culture rather than Conflict. This is due to the number of articles on film and literature in which Afghanistan was mentioned. And the frequency of articles where Afghanistan was of major relevance was low (39%) as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1748048511432599">Table 5</xref>, reflecting the Arts/Culture focus where location was of low relevance but also coverage of Conflict where the main focus was on US military activity in Iraq (not part of this study), with Afghanistan mentioned in passing.</p>

<p>Chad and Sudan received significant attention, with the high percentage of stories on Chad with an Irish angle (87%) reflecting coverage of the deployment of Irish troops under the EU-FOR peacekeeping mission in February 2008. However, while Conflict was an element in coverage, the focus was more on Irish domestic political issues, such as stories about insufficient army equipment and the debates surrounding Irish neutrality and peacekeeping activities and their relevance to the upcoming EU Lisbon Treaty referendum<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1748048511432599">4</xref>
</sup> in Ireland. As topic, the actual Conflict in Darfur took third place. Thus attention trends do not necessarily correspond to detailed coverage of key news events in that country.</p>
<p>To judge from its coverage, Vietnam is not so much a country in its own right as an event in US history. The most common topics associated with Vietnam were US Politics and Arts/Culture (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1748048511432599">Table 4</xref>), while <xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-1748048511432599">Table 5</xref> shows it received the lowest relevance score of any of the top 10 countries (2%). Articles on Vietnam mainly concerned the US Senator and 2008 Republican Presidential candidate John McCain (referred to consistently as the ‘Vietnam vet’), or the many references made to Vietnam in film culture. The sample produced no coverage of any current events in that country. In a similar vein, while the main topic of coverage of Kenya in the first half of the sample period was Conflict and political fallout there, the second half moved on to coverage of Democratic US Presidential nominee Barack Obama and his family connections. This illustrates how US interests play a part in shaping both why and how countries get attention in smaller states.</p>
<p>In Nepal’s coverage, Arts/Culture and Human Interest were the most common topics. These topics, along with the relatively high frequency of an Irish angle (at 73%), indicate attention for reasons other than the historic political events occurring there. Most articles in fact concerned revelations in a controversial documentary<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1748048511432599">5</xref>
</sup> about an Irish poet and his relationships with young Nepalese boys. Few referred to the abolition of monarchy and historic establishment of Nepal’s first elected parliament. Thus, local, celebrity and human-interest stories appear more newsworthy in this small state than significant political revolutions.</p>
<p>Overall, however, celebrity visits were not found to be a distinct feature of the coverage of developing countries (except Malawi, see further), despite the findings in studies on UK media coverage of Africa that found celebrity to be a significant factor in attention trends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1748048511432599">Franks, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1748048511432599">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1748048511432599">Scott, 2009a</xref>). Equally, the expectation that local celebrities with developing world interests like Bono and Bob Geldof might be a factor in Irish coverage was not borne out in the findings.</p>
<p>Indeed an Irish ‘angle’ or relevance does not necessarily trigger significant coverage of a developing country. Some of the countries on Ireland’s overseas aid programme (Irish Aid), considered a key aspect of Irish foreign policy, received the least attention of all, in particular Lesotho, Malawi and Sierra Leone (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-1748048511432599">Table 6</xref>). Madonna’s adoption of a Malawian child prompted a short burst of attention while Sierra Leone received incidental mention as the birthplace of a prominent Irish district court judge in stories on legal topics. Only Tanzania received coverage relating to Irish Aid activities, but as an offshoot in articles surrounding the visit of Taoiseach Bertie Ahern in January 2008. A state visit should be expected to generate a boost in coverage, yet here the most common topic was again domestic Irish politics. This was due to Ahern’s involvement in a tribunal of inquiry into payments to politicians,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1748048511432599">6</xref>
</sup> a scandal that caused Ireland’s top political correspondents to be dispatched to East Africa in search of a domestic news scoop.</p>

<p>The presence of Private Sector Business as the most frequent topic in the coverage of many Irish Aid countries is significant, particularly as it is a far more common topic than ‘Irish Aid’ policy itself. It suggests that private business activities are greater generators of coverage than development aid policy. Overall, Private Sector Business accounted for one-tenth of the entire coverage of the developing world (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-1748048511432599">Table 7</xref> below), reflecting the genre findings noted earlier, and which indicates that private business interests may be a significant determinant of news flows from the developing world for smaller countries.</p>

<title>National and regional news variations</title>
<p>In terms of relevance, 96% of regional paper articles on developing countries were found to have an Irish angle compared to just 46% of the coverage in national papers. Stories from the developing world tend to be localized for regional newspapers, a trend that can be seen both in the topics covered and the sources quoted. As a topic, NGO Activities dominates the regional newspaper coverage (at 45%) while Conflict hardly features (at only 5%). This is markedly different to the national papers where over 20% of coverage concerns Conflict (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table7-1748048511432599">Table 7</xref>). These findings suggest that NGOs may be an important source of news for regional newspapers.</p>
<p>Those most often quoted in all articles were Government Officials, Private Citizens, NGO Representatives and Military Sources of all nationalities (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table8-1748048511432599">Table 8</xref>). But major differences are again noted between different newspaper types. Private Citizens and NGO Representatives account for two-thirds of all regional newspaper quotes. And when NGOs are combined with Religious (missionaries and other religious personnel hold a similar position to NGOs in Ireland in relation to overseas humanitarian activities<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1748048511432599">7</xref>
</sup>), they represent over half of all quotes in the regional papers. This reflects the strong focus on NGO Activities as topic in regional newspaper coverage and underlines a potential link between NGOs and news flows.</p>

<p>A further breakdown by nationality, shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table9-1748048511432599">Table 9</xref>, shows Private Citizens and Government Officials from developing countries were quoted more often than Other Citizens. This finding contrasts with the results of a UK research report on broadcast coverage of developing countries, which showed TV reports were twice as likely to quote someone from outside the relevant country as a citizen from that country (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1748048511432599">Scott, 2009b</xref>: 17). This may illustrate differences between how print and broadcast representations of the developing world are constructed. However, it is notable because private citizens are often presented as an alternative to the elite sources traditionally used in international news coverage and possibly again reflect NGO news management.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This small state study challenges IC research, by going beyond the international news pages to assess attention trends and coverage in totality in a semi-peripheral context. First, it reveals the nuances found in coverage of other countries when all genres are considered and not just news. Assumptions cannot be made at research design stage on where coverage might be found, a particularly inimical approach if addressing coverage of the developing world.</p>
<p>Second, the coverage of countries receiving most attention does not necessarily reflect the commonly found news flow determinants of deviance and relevance. Deviance or conflict is a key driver of coverage overall, but is not the topic most associated with countries receiving most attention, even where serious conflicts were known to be occurring. In terms of relevance, topics associated with developing country coverage in large states such as foreign policy (whether military or aid), national interests and celebrity activities get little or no attention in this small state. Instead NGO activities, sport and private business interests play a substantial role. This is partly due to taking all genres into consideration, but it also reflects possible differences in operation of determinants of news flows into small states, especially considering the ‘principles over interests’ international relations identity of small states. National interests of significance to large states, such as military activities, foreign policy and trade only become a factor in small state coverage when they are localized through association with an individual or a domestic political story. Private business interests appear to have a higher news value than national interests or trade links in Ireland. NGO activities are particularly prominent and resonate with the ‘principles’ aspect of this small state’s international outlook and coverage is again localized through NGO personalities.</p>
<p>Finally, coverage in Ireland differs between newspaper types. This finding challenges the notion of a media ‘gatekeeper’ who filters information by selecting from a menu of international news made available by systemic factors or determinants (after <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1748048511432599">Wu, 2003</xref>). The concept does not follow through either because determinants of news flow do not really exist – as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1748048511432599">Archetti (2008</xref>) argues in relation to differing newspaper coverage in the same country – or because the operation of determinants is more complex in small states than currently understood within the dominant paradigm of large state research. If we assume for now they do exist, the determinants most commonly found in international news – Deviance, Relevance, Affinity and Prominence (after <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1748048511432599">Golan, 2008</xref>) – appear to show a spectrum of operation in small states, possibly influenced by relationships with large elite states, as illustrated in this semi-peripheral state study.</p>
<sec id="section13-1748048511432599">
<title>Deviance – why bad news is associated with the developing world</title>
<p>As coverage of developing countries in Ireland is dominated overall by conflict, ‘deviance’ appears to be as likely a determinant of news flows into small states as well as large states. The findings show significant attention paid to a country when conflict occurs within the time frame of study such as was found with Kenya, Zimbabwe, etc. But detailed coverage of that event does not necessarily follow, such as with Afghanistan’s more frequent appearance in arts and culture articles. The coverage of Vietnam shows that conflict does not need to be current or even recent to be a factor in coverage. Persistent references to older conflicts through cinema and literature or connections with major news personalities may also generate attention, meaning that <italic>historic deviance</italic> is a challenge for developing countries to overcome when referenced in any kind of coverage.</p>
<p>The focus on NGO activities, particularly in regional newspapers, reflects another facet of deviance. Fallout from conflict brings NGOs to the field, the focus of significant coverage in Irish newspapers. NGOs are central to some of the more negatively toned articles found on developing countries in this study. Such articles often have NGO connections (e.g. through topic, source or author) and tend to foreground gruesome descriptions of violence and styles of brutality, statistics on death, injury and displacement with an emphasis on women and children in difficulty. In some instances NGO assistance in producing articles is evident whether overtly stated or surmised from the content.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1748048511432599">8</xref>
</sup> In other cases, a hybrid author type – part-journalist/part-aid worker<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1748048511432599">9</xref>
</sup> – is noted in the coverage. NGOs provide a local and continuing news angle, but also serve to produce a <italic>second order deviance</italic> associated with a country. This reflects UK research, which has blamed charities for perpetuating negative and stereotyped images of victims in the developing world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1748048511432599">VSO, 2001</xref>). It raises questions about objectivity and the relationship between NGOs and the press particularly in small states for whom, as is suggested in this study, they may be a significant source of news. Further careful agenda setting analysis would help bring clarity to the relationship in particular between NGOs and the media and could specifically analyse how NGOs might shape small state coverage in particular through second level deviance.</p>
<p>Generally, broadcast studies appear to find more negative representations of the developing world (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1748048511432599">Franks, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1748048511432599">Golan, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1748048511432599">VSO, 2001</xref>) while press coverage research find less negative and more neutral coverage (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1748048511432599">Scott, 2009a</xref>), a finding supported by this study. Broadcast research is even less likely than press to include material outside news and current affairs genres, due to the logistical constraints of total broadcast output analysis. Golan’s study on US TV networks’ coverage of Africa notes the impact that images may have on presenting more negative depictions and therefore on the ‘deviant’ events deemed newsworthy. Comparative international research which combines both event and contextual approaches and takes all genres into consideration should specifically address the differences between broadcast and press coverage in representing the developing world.</p>
<p>Some researchers have explored opportunities for the media to ‘positively highlight foreign countries by demonstrating democracy in action’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1748048511432599">Golan and Wanta, 2003</xref>: 25). This is achieved for example with the coverage of an election process such as that in Pakistan, described in some Irish papers as relatively non-violent and fair. However, the isolation of an election as a news event by itself (and rigorous analysis of such) is a difficult task. Alleged fraud, contestation, violence and protracted negotiations are an increasingly common feature of complex pre- and post-election events, making <italic>potential for deviance</italic> as likely a factor in their coverage. In any case, the assumption that either journalists or readers make a positive association with a democratic process at work could be viewed as a US perspective, reflecting journalistic frames considered viable with a US audience and a large state research perspective. This small state study included examples of ‘democracy in action’ in Pakistan, Kenya, Zimbabwe and Nepal among others, which received negative, positive and neutral coverage as well as no coverage at all. Comparative research should examine if these positive association perspectives on events are reflected in coverage elsewhere or are even relevant to non-US based research. A research design that considers all genres of coverage is a better place to start in efforts to rebalance the perception of foreign and especially developing countries.</p>

<sec id="section14-1748048511432599">
<title>Relevance and affinity – why size matters</title>
<p>As noted in the literature review, most studies on relevance as a determinant focus on US interests across a wide area. Small states are less likely to have relevance expressed in such broad terms or to have as many countries meeting relevance criteria either on trade volume, foreign policy or other single-issue basis. Relevance to Ireland is evidently a determinant of coverage for regional papers where most articles display an Irish angle, but a broader international outlook operates in daily and Sunday newspapers. Here the main topics and countries covered were not particularly relevant to Ireland and even the topics of specific relevance expected in the Irish coverage (e.g. Irish foreign policy, Irish Aid, Irish celebrities involved in development) were simply not found. Relevance is instead created through localization via NGO personnel and private business interests or individual private and political scandals. Again, for small states where foreign relations are expressed in terms of ‘principles’ rather than ‘interests’, such interests as there are only operate at the local and personal level. Individual connections may be as strong in small states as trade volumes in larger states in providing enough relevance to determine coverage above other contextual factors.</p>
<p>But relevance to Ireland is at times superseded by relevance to the US as in some of the Irish Aid country coverage or in US domestic political coverage. As noted earlier, US trade volume through Ireland is just one of the many complex connections in the special relationship between the two countries. Small states may view some international events through the prism of their relationships with and relevance to larger states, challenging weaker relevance to their own interests.</p>
<p>Ireland has an ‘affinity’ with developing countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, which arises out of its own historic legacy of missionary involvement, often expressed in terms of a shared colonial past (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1748048511432599">Griesshaber, 1997</xref>). Research on the Irish media agenda in coverage of the Ethiopian famine in the 1980s noted how the Irish famine was employed to imply parallels and shared experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1748048511432599">Horgan, 1987b</xref>: 6), in effect creating affinity with Ethiopia. This shows how affinity operates as an affective element in the salience of an object with the required ‘valence’ that helps to frame a country and its representation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1748048511432599">Chyi and McCombs, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1748048511432599">Kiousis and Wu, 2008</xref>). However, affinity, like relevance, does not operate in a vacuum and affinity to developing countries may also work by proxy. Small states like Ireland with a close affinity to an influential neighbour that itself has links to developing countries (US, UK or EU) may have to balance this with their own outlook on the news agenda. Comparative international research, particularly from other small states, would help to clarify how these affinities might be contested and negotiated.</p>

<sec id="section15-1748048511432599">
<title>Prominence – the semi-peripheral outlook</title>
<p>‘Prominence’ looks different from a semi-peripheral perspective. Being semi-peripheral means having a strategic engagement in a world-system and a 360-degree perspective around world-system space. This space is geopolitical but also cultural, political and socioeconomic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1748048511432599">Terlouw, 2003</xref>). The media perform the function of representing this space and the strength of the semi-periphery, as noted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1748048511432599">Boatca (2006</xref>), may be found in this sphere. The complexity of ‘deviance’ and the hierarchies relating to ‘relevance’ and ‘affinity’ that are navigated by media in a semi-peripheral state have been shown in Ireland’s more nuanced coverage of the developing world.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1748048511432599">O’Hearn (2001</xref>) places emphasis on <italic>processes</italic> in the world-system of how regions are incorporated and peripheralized, rather than on <italic>position</italic> in the system. Thus rather than <italic>prominence</italic> as a predictor of international news coverage, perhaps it is the <italic>processes</italic> affecting mobility within the world-system that themselves make news. Following O’Hearn, countries may be ‘incorporated’ and gain temporary access to the news agenda, only to be effectively ‘peripheralized’ when such interests move on. But, if sufficiently networked through semi-peripheral processes (such as NGO activities or private business interests), a developing country can receive significant and continuous coverage in the semi-periphery which may even flow on to core states.</p>
<p>Inevitably, countries move and shift in terms of their developmental level and position within world-systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1748048511432599">Chase-Dunn, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1748048511432599">O’Hearn, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1748048511432599">Terlouw, 2003</xref>). A comparative study undertaken now would show a change in position for many countries – some will have moved out of the lowest income countries’ group and others will have joined. Ireland’s position in the world-system is no doubt also undergoing shift due to recession, intervention by the International Monetary Fund and a reduction in foreign direct investment, which could threaten its critical intermediary status. Further studies could assess whether news coverage of the developing world follows trends that mirror changes in position within world-systems over time, or if, despite changes in position, certain countries remain unchanged both in the quantity and quality of their coverage.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-1748048511432599">
<title>Small and semi-peripheral – a special position</title>
<p>Ireland’s semi-peripheral status, its foreign policy identity of emphasis on principles over interests and its special relations with the US and UK, all reflect a recurring theme in Irish public discourse – the ‘special position’. This theme is noted in international affairs as early as at the founding of the Irish state in 1922,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1748048511432599">10</xref>
</sup> used then in an effort to rally other small states around perceived shared causes. It is regularly invoked<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1748048511432599">11</xref>
</sup> to describe interest or involvement in or reasons for special treatment in relation to a particular international issue. In this sense, it appears to operate as a frame through which Ireland’s identity as a small state is expressed and may be used in representations of the developing world.</p>
<p>The <italic>special position</italic> acknowledges that an issue or country may be of little significance to others, but explains Ireland’s involvement by showing both affinity and relevance connected to position. Once expressed, it is difficult to reject the <italic>special position</italic> as it contains an element of obligation, much like the ‘special relations’ frame in Irish political discourse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1748048511432599">O’Regan, 2010</xref>). In this respect, the <italic>special position</italic> is integral to the semi-peripheral position and how the media report on foreign locations. Comparative research would help identify if a <italic>special position </italic>is employed by other small semi-peripheral states when negotiating international and in particular developing world news. Further comparative research should also address and refine the processes that connect semi-peripheral states to both core and periphery.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Small state studies have much to contribute to IC research. This study has shown that taking total newspaper output into account produces different results to the single genre studies prevalent in large state research and presents a more neutral picture of the developing world. Differences in the topics covered by small states and diverging trends between newspaper types indicate that the context created by both position in and processes of the world-system may impact on the determinants of news flow and hence the nature of coverage.</p>
<p>International news flows face competition from news ‘currents’ in small states, running like rivers in the ocean<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1748048511432599">12</xref>
</sup> of news. These small state currents represent news events of direct, localized and national relevance such as with NGO and private business interests or the ‘special position’ affinities evident in the Irish coverage. Currents can move information quickly, bypass traditional news channels and may even divert international news flows away from small states, even those with the requisite deviant, relevant, affinitive and prominent characteristics. However, relationships with large influential neighbours can have the opposite effect, attracting news flows with a higher determinant value for large states into small states as proxy determinants. But by adopting a <italic>special position</italic>, a small state can negotiate these flows and currents projecting a quasi-autonomous outlook. How all states, both large and small, navigate international news remains a question for IC research, which appears locked into a gatekeeping perspective, still dominant in large state studies. Changes in production and distribution technologies and news consumption habits have forced the news industry to ‘shift from we-know-best, gatekeeper thinking’ in delivering news (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1748048511432599">Curley, 2007</xref>). It may be time for IC research to do the same.</p>
<p>Wallerstein’s original concept of the semi-periphery was as a stabilizing force that acts to depolarize the world-system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1748048511432599">Johnston and Biro, 2003</xref>). This small state semi-peripheral study challenges the polarized state of IC research, between context- and event-oriented perspectives and core to periphery extremes. The theoretical and methodological gap between event- and context-oriented perspectives could be narrowed if news flows were aligned with the former and news currents with the latter. And as an arena where local and global forces meet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1748048511432599">Terlouw, 2003</xref>), the semi-periphery is the logical place to carry out further research on the interaction of events and context, flows and currents in international communications. Inclusion of the semi-peripheral perspective in international news flow studies would help the IC community move towards a more fully developed application of world-systems theory. In this way, the semi-periphery may become the analytical tool it is suited to be.</p>
