<p><italic>Objective</italic>. To explore young people’s understanding of the differences between Chlamydia, HIV, and AIDS. <italic>Methods</italic>. Participants from a hospital-based adolescent clinic completed a self-administered written survey. Three questions assessed participants’ understanding of the differences between Chlamydia, HIV, and AIDS. <italic>Results</italic>. Nearly half of the 119 participants selected “No” or “Don’t know” when asked if there are differences between Chlamydia and HIV and between HIV and AIDS. Increasing age was associated with correct response. <italic>Conclusions</italic>. A large proportion of youth in this sample did not know that there are differences between Chlamydia, HIV, and AIDS. Previous research suggests that some young people are afraid to be screened for Chlamydia because they fear that a Chlamydia diagnosis has the same ramifications as an AIDS diagnosis. Findings from this study indicate that more education about the differences between Chlamydia, HIV, and AIDS is needed.</p>

<title>Background</title>
<p>Young people in the 15- to 24-year-old age-group represent only 25% of the sexually active population, yet acquire nearly one half of all new sexually transmitted infections (STIs).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922813479162">1</xref></sup> <italic>Chlamydia trachomatis</italic> and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are both STIs, yet have many differences. Chlamydia is much more prevalent than HIV, but it is easily cured with antibiotics. Delay in treatment may lead to pelvic inflammatory disease, tubal infertility, and ectopic pregnancy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0009922813479162">2</xref></sup> Chlamydia infection can also facilitate transmission of HIV infection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0009922813479162">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0009922813479162"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0009922813479162"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0009922813479162">6</xref></sup> Although HIV is not curable, many effective treatments are available. However, if left untreated, HIV can progress to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and lead to death.</p>
<p>Focus group interviews have demonstrated that many young people know little about Chlamydia, with some believing that there is no cure and that people can die from Chlamydia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0009922813479162">7</xref></sup> Because they have heard so much about HIV and so little about other STIs, participants thought that if HIV was incurable and deadly, then perhaps the same was true for Chlamydia. Focus groups with other young people revealed that many adolescents are not clear on the differences between HIV and AIDS (unpublished data). Many stated that they frequently read or hear about HIV/AIDS, which makes it seem like the terms are synonymous (unpublished data).</p>
<p>Misconceptions about Chlamydia and HIV, especially when the misunderstanding leads to unnecessary fear, may deter young people from seeking or accepting recommended screening. We sought to explore adolescents’ knowledge and misunderstandings about the differences between Chlamydia, HIV, and AIDs.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section3-0009922813479162">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Participants aged 14 to 22 years were recruited from the UMass Memorial Medical Center Adolescent Clinic. Participants provided verbal consent or assent after an investigator described the study, reviewed a brief fact sheet, and answered questions. Permission from parents or guardians of minor participants was only sought if they accompanied the participant to the medical appointment.</p>
<p>Individuals who were unable to understand the information presented during the verbal consent process were ineligible. The study protocol, fact sheet, and consent procedures were approved by the University of Massachusetts Medical School Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects in Research.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0009922813479162">
<title>Survey Administration</title>
<p>Participants completed a brief, self-administered survey. Understanding about the differences between Chlamydia and HIV and between HIV and AIDS was assessed with 3 questions: (1) “Are there differences between Chlamydia and HIV?,” (2) “Are there differences between HIV and AIDS?,” and (3) “Are HIV and AIDS two words for the same health problem?” Response choices were “Yes,” “No,” and “Don’t know.” Participants who answered “Yes” to either of the first 2 questions were asked to provide examples of the difference (open-ended responses).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0009922813479162">
<title>Analyses</title>
<p>Responses to the 2 open-ended questions were independently scored by 2 of the investigators (JGA and DRB). Answers were scored for accuracy using a scale of 0 (entirely incorrect), 0.5 (partially correct), or 1 (fully correct). Illegible, nonsensical, or vague answers were given an invalid designation. The 2 investigators discussed discordant scores and decided final score by consensus.</p>
<p>Data analyses were performed using PASW statistical software version 18.0 (IBM Corporation, Somers, NY). Univariate descriptive statistics were performed for all variables. Logistic regression models were used to evaluate associations between independent and outcome variables.</p>

<title>Participant Characteristics</title>
<p>In all, 135 patients attended the adolescent clinic during the study period. Seven patients were unable to understand the consent process well enough to give informed consent, and 9 declined because of lack of interest. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0009922813479162">Table 1</xref> provides participant characteristics for the final sample of 119.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Nearly half of the young people in this study did not have an accurate understanding of the differences between Chlamydia, HIV, and AIDS. Lack of understanding about differences may serve as a deterrent to test seeking if young people fear that a Chlamydia diagnosis has the same implications as an HIV diagnosis or that an HIV diagnosis has the same implications as an AIDS diagnosis. Some of the participants’ open responses demonstrated confusion about the different treatment options and prognoses for Chlamydia, HIV, and AIDS. Uncertainty among youth about the implication of a Chlamydia, HIV, or AIDS diagnosis is concerning because uncertainty may negatively affect young people’s decisions about screening for Chlamydia and HIV.</p>
<p>We found a positive association between participant age and knowledge of differences between Chlamydia, HIV, and AIDS. This is reassuring if as young people get older, they become more well-informed about some of the infections that can directly impact their health. Nevertheless, adolescents need to acquire this understanding at a younger age because many engage in sexual behaviors and contract STIs without sufficient awareness about the natural history of these infections and the treatments that are available.</p>
<p>This study has limited generalizability because of sampling from a single clinic population and sampling from teens actively seeking health care. Despite these limitations, findings from this study indicate that there is room for improvement in adolescent and young adult understanding about these infections. Youth who do not know that Chlamydia is curable and that treatment of HIV can prevent progression to AIDS may be less likely to get screened. Increased education about the differences between Chlamydia, HIV, and AIDS is needed to prevent AIDS-related anxiety from serving as a deterrent to routine HIV and Chlamydia screening.</p>
