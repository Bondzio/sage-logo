<p><italic>Colonialism, Modernity, and Literature: A View from India</italic></p>
<p>Satya P. Mohanty (ed.)</p>
<p>New York: Palgrave, 2011</p>
<p>Reviewed by Gurminder K. Bhambra</p>
<p>Recent scholarship on sociological understandings of modernity has begun to counter the dominant view that it originated endogenously in Europe and then was disseminated around the globe. The shift from the dominant view of the 1960s, defined by modernization theory, to that at the end of the 20th century, centred on multiple modernities, is beginning to give way to postcolonial and decolonial understandings of modernity. These argue for the already interconnected nature of the world as the necessary condition for the development of what has come to be known as modernity. In particular, the colonial encounter is perceived as a defining moment in the making of the modern world in that it both <italic>made</italic> a particular world and established cognitive patterns for <italic>knowing</italic> that world. The volume under review here is particularly interested in this aspect of knowing the world and, in knowing the world, it further seeks to reshape our understandings of the world. In simple terms, <italic>Colonialism, Modernity, and Literature: A View from India</italic> is an edited volume organized around discussion of modern Indian literature. Its ambition, however, is profound. In the process of literary analysis the essays seek to discuss, and reframe, the generally accepted understandings of the relationship between colonialism and modernity.</p>
<p>Satya Mohanty, the editor of the volume, very effectively sets out these issues in his introduction. Colonialism, within much literature on modernity, he argues, is seen as a vehicle that brings modern values and institutions to the colonized world. The pre-colonized world is represented as the repository of all that is traditional and the colonized world – either in positive or negative terms – is seen to embody (or have the potential to come to embody) the modern. The basic assumption, Mohanty suggests, is that the world(s) that ‘colonialism replaced or destroyed belongs to the irretrievable past and is irrelevant for our [modern] purposes’ (p. 2). The essays collected in the volume have the express purpose of challenging this reading of the relationship between colonialism and modernity. In addition, Mohanty argues, the volume demonstrates how values that have come to be seen as intimately tied to the emergence of a specific form of capitalist modernity in the West were also articulated in other geographic and historical contexts. With this, he aligns the political project of the volume with the ‘alternative modernities’ literature, exemplified by the work of Dilip Gaonkar, ‘to trace the provenance of such [modern] values and ideas in … non-European contexts and to examine the alternative institutions and cultural forms that supported them’ (p. 3). The shift to the conceptual language of alternative modernities reflects unease with the idea of a singular, uniform trajectory applied to the current diversity of contemporary societies and looks to establish the different sources and roots of a variety of what are understood to be indigenous modernities.</p>
<p>Along with this overarching desire to rethink the relationship between colonialism and modernity, Mohanty outlines two other broad themes. The first is the notion of ‘a literary view from below’, that is, as Mohanty suggests, an examination of the representation of subaltern perspectives within literary modes and forms (p. 4). In this respect, Mohanty argues against the theoretical scepticism characteristic of Gayatri Spivak's classic essay, ‘Can the Subaltern Speak?’, and suggests that it is possible to seek to represent and thereby understand the lives and motivations of subaltern characters, and to extrapolate from literary readings to reflections upon and about real social agents (p. 4). This is complemented by the final theme which focuses on ‘the epistemic dimension of literature’, that is, ‘reading literature … as continuous with social, moral, and epistemological theory’ (p. 5). This widens the frame of analysis from particular readings of Indian literature to more general understandings of ‘how we read and interpret literature and its contexts’ (p. 5). This latter, Mohanty argues, would reinvigorate contemporary study of ‘world literature’ by drawing attention to the general themes identified above and privileging these over the dominant trend to establish national or regional literary histories (pp. 5–6).</p>
<p>The general themes cutting across the volume are all filtered through specific readings of a particular text, a 19th-century Oriya novel, <italic>Six Acres and a Third</italic>, by Fakir Mohan Senapati. The significance of this literary text, according to Mohanty, rests, at least in part, with the inability of critics easily to categorize it. Its complexity of narrative themes sits uncomfortably alongside its use of multiple linguistic registers and the novel itself is situated historically in a moment of immense social and political upheaval (p. 8). For these reasons, among others, Mohanty believes the text to be particularly generative in addressing the concerns highlighted above.</p>
<p>The volume is divided into two parts with the first comparing literary perspectives ‘from below’ in discussion of Senapati’s novel and the second examining the different socio-theoretical and historical contexts of the novel. The first essay, by Jennifer Harford Vargas, examines the similarity of the responses by Senapati and the Latin American novelist Gabriel Garcia Marquez to modes to colonial and neo-colonial governance. She traces the ways in which they both, separately and independently, use the form of the novel to interrogate varieties of hegemonic domination across a range of fields. It is by embedding ‘their narratives in subaltern hermeneutics,’ in particular through their use of testimony, she argues, that they ‘critically interpret the modern colonial world’ (p. 39). The following essay, by Paul Sawyer, also compares Senapati to another novelist, this time to a novelist at the heart of empire – George Eliot. Sawyer, in bringing these two novelists together, looks to address the different ways in which they have presented a ‘view from below’ in their respective works. He suggests that while Eliot was a rare figure within British fiction for representing the lives of the impoverished and the marginalized, the narrative conventions within which she worked, ‘limited her power to imagine life from below’ (p. 57). Senapati, however, according to Sawyer, in refusing an authoritative discourse is able to provide ‘quiet accountings of characters’ lives’ that appear to us almost transparently (p. 77). This transparency, he continues, is a reflection of the novelist’s craft in being able to present the voice of the subaltern ‘against the class-bound discourses that have fallen quiet’ (p. 77). In this way, Sawyer suggests, Senapati is able to deliver a richer account of the lives of those within the lower orders and, while his account may present a more pessimistic picture of their lives, it also points to the political power of the moments of human connection when they arise within this group (p. 84). The third essay continues the theme of comparative literary analysis, this time by comparing <italic>Six Acres and a Third</italic> with a classic from the Indian literary realist tradition, Premchand’s <italic>Godaan</italic>. While both novels are seen as exemplars of social realism in their depiction of rural life in India, Himansu Mohapatra suggests that the methods they use are very different (p. 92). Mohapatra outlines the difference in terms of a distinction between descriptive and analytic realism and seeks to evaluate the two novels in terms of the ‘epistemic access’ they provide to understanding the social worlds being represented (p. 92). In his analysis, Mohapatra identifies the radical social critique that he suggests is one of the ‘forgotten legacies of realism in Indian literature’, and seeks to develop ‘the social and philosophical implications’ of this critique for contemporary understandings of the social and the place of the self within it (p. 103).</p>
<p>The emergence of the modern subject, both in literature and in history, is the focus of Tilottoma Misra’s problematizing of the easy association of modernity with the notion of being progressive and tradition with being retrogressive. She also contests the idea that a modern historical consciousness within India was something that came in the wake of British colonialism and argues instead that elements of modernity were present in pre-colonial Assamese literature – and that these elements remained, providing a crucial alternate locus for thinking and acting during the colonial period (p. 115). Misra elaborates on this thesis by examining literary texts from Orissa and Assam, discussing the different modes of social criticism used within them in their contestation of colonialism (an English translation of the Assamese text under consideration is provided in an appendix at the end of the volume). The ‘literary view from below’ comes out in both novels in their use of trials as the medium by which to represent ‘the folk perception of the colonial legal structure’ (p. 123) and to point to the abuses of power carried out by both traditional elites as well as the newer colonial powers. The fifth chapter continues the theme of elaborating an ‘indigenous’ modernity and here Senapati’s work is contrasted with a Telugu play by Apparao, <italic>Girls for Sale</italic>. According to Velcheru Narayana Rao, both Apparao and Senapati have been seen as founders of modern Indian literature within their respective languages. He goes on to suggest that while most people regard their ‘modernity’ as a form of colonial modernity, his reading of their work would rather place them as presenting ‘an indigenous modernity, distinct from the colonial variety’ (p. 135).</p>
<p>Ulka Anjaria moves the analysis from national and regional comparative perspective to addressing the politics of silence, and in particular the silence of female characters, within three novels that are geographically and historically diverse. Anjaria picks up the conceptualization of silence within feminist criticism and broadens its usual remit to examine how silence might work politically within the novels under consideration. This analysis is complemented by that of Claire Horan, whose chapter on the representation of women and gender relations opens the second section of the volume. Horan provides a detailed analysis of Senapati’s depiction of female characters within the novel and then addresses his critique of the way in which women are often treated in rural villages (p. 180). She argues that Senapati depicts women across the range of social and cultural identities and enables his characters to develop beyond the usual stereotypical constructions. With this, she argues, Senapati is able to give his female characters a ‘more realistic literary and social representation’ (p. 184) than is usual.</p>
<p>The final pair of chapters set the themes of the novel in wider socio-historical context. Gaganendra Dash takes up the issue of the central protagonist’s dual identity as a <italic>zamindar</italic> (landlord) and <italic>mahajan</italic> (moneylender), and looks to understand the production of these identities through the socio-historical processes of the time. He uses the work of social scientists and historians such as Gunnar Myrdal, David Hardiman and Ranajit Guha to provide the socio-historic context which serves as the backdrop for the emergence of the moneylending class, and to validate an argument that Senapati’s critique was primarily anti-colonial rather than anti-feudal. Debendra Dash and Dipti Pattanaik, in the concluding chapter, return explicitly to the modernity–tradition dialectic that is otherwise an implicit theme within many of the chapters in the volume. They address the standard depiction of Senapati as a traditionalist and argue that his hostility to forms of colonial modernity was not a hostility to modernity itself. Instead, they suggest that his goal was the articulation of ‘an alternative modernity that was universal in character without rejecting the values of tradition’ (p. 225).</p>
<p>This is a very fine collection of essays. Each essay stands independently as a piece of literary criticism of the highest quality, and together the essays provide a compelling discussion of the broader themes of colonialism and modernity that the authors convincingly demonstrate to animate the novel. It is unlikely that many readers will know Senapati’s novel, but they will perhaps now be motivated to read it, and to read it as a complex representation of the very constitution of an indigenous modernity. The essays make a convincing case for the novel as a form of social theory and political engagement, where its political relevance is both past and present. However, they also make a powerful contribution to rethinking modernity in the light of experiences other than those of Western subjects. I recommend this book wholeheartedly to those working in the areas of social and political theory as well as in literary and cultural theory.</p>
