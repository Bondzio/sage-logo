<abstract>
<p>This longitudinal study examined the rates of overweight, elevated blood pressure, acanthosis nigricans, and their associated factors in third through fifth grade students over 4 years. Participants consisted of 279 students who participated in health screenings in 2002 and 2006. Hispanic students had significantly higher rates of overweight and acanthosis nigricans compared to White students. There was a sharp increase in elevated blood pressure from 2002 to 2006 among obese children. While 20% of the matched obese students were above the 90th percentile in 2002, 82% of the same students were above the 90th percentile in 2006. After controlling for sex, ethnicity, and grade, preadolescent obesity in 2002 continued to be a significant factor associated with elevated blood pressure and acanthosis nigricans in 2006. These findings demonstrate that prevention and treatment of obesity during preadolescence is critical for the prevention of elevated high blood pressure in early adolescence.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The rate of childhood overweight has been growing rapidly over the past three decades. Using National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data, Ogden, Carroll, Curtin, Lamb, and Flegal (2010) found 31.7% of children and adolescents aged 2 to 19 years were overweight. Childhood overweight and obesity are related to several health problems including elevated blood pressure (BP) and type 2 diabetes.</p>
<p>Overweight status has been identified as one of the strongest indicators of elevated BP among children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1059840511428615">Marty, Wolff, &amp; Morgan, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1059840511428615">Muntner, He, Cutler, Wildman, &amp; Whelton, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1059840511428615">Peterson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1059840511428615">Sorof, Lai, Turner, Poffenbarger, &amp; Portman, 2004</xref>). Elevated BP is a contributing risk factor for cardiovascular disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1059840511428615">Raitakari et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1059840511428615">Stamler, Stamler, &amp; Neaton, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1059840511428615">Vasan, 2001</xref>). The rate of hypertension has recently been found to be increasing in the young American population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1059840511428615">Muntner et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Overweight status has also been identified as one of the strongest predictors of risk for type 2 diabetes. A weight-related condition called acanthosis nigricans (AN) has been associated with insulin resistance and its presence is considered a risk factor for type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1059840511428615">Brickman, Huang, Silverman, &amp; Metzger, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1059840511428615">Hermanns-Le, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1059840511428615">Peterson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1059840511428615">Schwartz, 1994</xref>). This condition is characterized by skin lesions that span from brown to black in color on the neck, groin, and in flexures of the extremities. The lesions are commonly symmetrical and velvety in texture and can appear as a lighter color in light-skinned Whites. The association between overweight and AN among children has been identified in several studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1059840511428615">Mukhtar, Clevereley, Voorhees, &amp; McGrath, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1059840511428615">Schwartz, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1059840511428615">Urrutia-Rojas et al., 2004</xref>). Mukhtar, Clevereley, Voorhees, and McGrath (2001) found that the prevalence of AN was higher in obese middle school students (49.2%) compared to nonobese students (7.7%). Likewise, Urrutia-Rojas and colleagues (2004) found that 87% of overweight Mexican American students were positive for AN. These studies support a positive relationship between AN and overweight among children.</p>
<p>Notable differences in the prevalence of overweight, BP, and AN exist among different ethnic groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1059840511428615">Ogden, Carroll, Curtin, Lamb, &amp; Flegal, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1059840511428615">Sorof et al., 2004</xref>). For example <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1059840511428615">Ogden et al. (2010)</xref> found Hispanic boys have significantly higher odds for an elevated BMI compared with non-Hispanic White boys. Similarly, there is a significant association between elevated BP and ethnic group. As an example, mean systolic BP is higher among Mexican American preadolescent students compared to non-Hispanic White students, although these differences are attenuated after adjustment for BMI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1059840511428615">Muntner et al., 2004</xref>). Similar research has indicated Hmong middle school students have higher incidences of elevated BP than White Students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1059840511428615">Voorhees et al., 2008</xref>). Additionally, Hispanic and Native American middle school students have a higher prevalence of AN compared to non-Hispanic White students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1059840511428615">Mukhtar et al., 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>While study results suggest a critical need for hypertension and type 2 diabetes prevention programs aimed at children and adolescents, little is known about how elevated BP and AN may develop over a period of time since most studies to date have relied on a cross-sectional design (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1059840511428615">Muntner et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1059840511428615">Otto et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1059840511428615">Peterson et al., 2010</xref>). Moreover, there is limited information about trends for overweight, elevated BP, and AN among children by demographic characteristics such as gender and ethnicity. Therefore, the purpose of this longitudinal study was to examine the prevalence of overweight, elevated BP, and AN in third through fifth grade students over a period of 4 years and investigate the relationships among these variables in two low-income schools in rural northern California.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section3-1059840511428615">
<title>Participants and Method of Selection</title>
<p>The study sample consisted of a cohort of all of the 289 third through fifth grade students who attended a low-income, rural school consisting of a total of 563 students in the fall of 2002. Two hundred seventy-nine of all students from this third through fifth grade school have longitudinal data for 3Â½ years later. Health screening data were collected by the school district nurse, university faculty, and trained research students from XXXX. This study was approved by the XXXX Human Subjects Review Committee. All participating students were required to have active parental consent and were orally informed that participation was voluntary.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1059840511428615">
<title>Instrument and Procedures</title>
<p>School health screenings for all third through fifth grade students were held in fall 2002 and again in spring 2006 when those students were sixth through eighth graders. Demographic data included age, sex, and ethnicity. Height was measured to the nearest 0.01 inches and weight was measured to the nearest 0.01 pounds using a SecaÂ® 5700 stadiometer and were used to calculate body mass index (BMI). BMIs were classified into percentiles using procedures defined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC); 5th to less than 85th percentile is normal weight, 85th to less than 95th percentile is overweight, and â¥95th percentile is obese (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1059840511428615">CDC, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>BP was assessed for students â¥95th percentile BMI for age in 2002 and â¥ 85th percentile BMI for age in 2006. BP was classified into percentiles based on standards for age, height, and sex. All students participated in a BP screening by the school nurse using a standard sphygmomanometer, appropriate cuff size, and standard procedures. Prior to screening, students were asked to remain seated for 5 min to normalize heart rate and BP. The measurement was classified into percentiles for age, sex, and height using standard criteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1059840511428615">National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHBLI, 2004)</xref>. Based on a single BP reading, students were classified as normal (&lt;90th percentile) or prehypertensive (90th to &lt;95th percentile), or hypertensive (â¥95th percentile). If a studentâs systolic reading was equal to or higher than 120 mmHg, the student was directed to sit for an additional 5 min and a second reading was collected. The second reading was used for data analysis.</p>
<p>Presence of AN was visually assessed by the same trained school nurse who had received training at a national conference addressing diabetes in children and adolescents. AN was assessed visually and then rated based on size and shape using the severity scale of 0â4 by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1059840511428615">Burke, Hale, Hazuda, and Stern (1999)</xref>. Study participants were classified as either AN negative (0) or AN positive (1â4).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1059840511428615">
<title>Data Analysis</title>
<p>Data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 19. Student data were matched for the 2002 and 2006 health screenings. Descriptive statistics included percentages, means, and standard deviations. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and independent samples <italic>t</italic> tests were used to compare mean BP values. Chi-square was used to assess relationships between categorical variables (including BMI groups, BP groups, AN groups, ethnicity, and sex). The McNemar test was used to assess whether there was a difference in the rates of overweight/obesity, prehypertension/hypertension, and AN between the years of 2002 and 2006. Finally, multiple logistic regression was used to identify variables that predict the risk of developing elevated BP and AN.</p>

<title>Elevated BP</title>
<p>As discussed previously, the assessment of BP was limited to obese students (<italic>N</italic> = 61) in 2002. In 2006, overweight students â¥85th percentile BMI for age (<italic>N</italic> = 159) were included in the BP screening. In addition, 16 normal weight students were randomly selected for inclusion in this BP screening. Mean systolic BP values in 2002 and 2006 were 103 Â± 16.2 and 121 Â± 13.1 mmHg, respectively. Also, mean diastolic BP values in 2002 and 2006 were 59.0 Â± 9.63 and 70.6 Â± 8.61 mmHg, respectively. In 2002, 14.9% of the students were classified as prehypertension or hypertension (â¥90th percentile), whereas 59.3% of them were prehypertensive or hypertensive in 2006.</p>
<p>Our study examined whether sex and ethnicity were significant factors associated with elevated BP. Chi-square tests revealed that there was no significant association between prehypertension/hypertension rates and gender in either 2002 (<italic>p</italic> = .198) or 2006 (<italic>p</italic> = .234). Likewise, no significant association was found between BP and ethnicity in 2002 (<italic>p</italic> = .192) or 2006 (<italic>p</italic> = .107).</p>
<p>Mean value scores of BP were compared among the different BMI groups using the data collected in 2006. At 126 mmHg, the mean systolic BP for students with a BMI â¥95th percentile was significantly higher than the mean 112 mmHg (SD) systolic BP for students in the normal BMI group (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001).</p>
<p>Of the 61 obese students in 2002, 56 completed both 2002 and 2006 BP screenings. A sharp increase in mean systolic BP was observed from 105 Â± 12 mmHg in 2002 to 128 Â± 13 mm Hg in 2006 among the 56 matched students. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1059840511428615">Figure 1</xref>
, only 16% (<italic>n</italic> = 9) of these matched obese students were above the 90th percentile for BP in 2002. In contrast, 73.2 (<italic>n</italic> = 41) of the same students were above the 90th percentile in 2006. This change was statistically significant (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001).</p>

<p>Based on the appearance of AN, all students were placed into negative and positive AN groups. In 2002, 21% (<italic>n</italic> = 59) of students were positive for AN and 79% (<italic>n</italic> = 220) were negative. The prevalence of AN was similar in 2006 at 23% (<italic>n</italic> = 64) AN positive and 77% (<italic>n</italic> = 215) AN negative. Chi-square tests revealed significant differences among ethnic groups. In both 2002 and 2006, Hispanic students had a significantly higher rate of AN compared to White students (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). In 2002, 29.5% (<italic>n</italic> = 46) of Hispanic students were AN positive, while only 7.6% (<italic>n</italic> = 6) of White students were AN positive. In 2006, 34.0% (<italic>n</italic> = 53) of Hispanic students were AN positive, whereas 2.5% (<italic>n</italic> = 2) of White students were AN positive. In addition, there was a marginal association between gender and AN in 2006 (<italic>p</italic> = .096); girls had a higher rate of AN compared to boys.</p>
<p>A significant association between AN and BMI was found in both 2002 (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) and 2006 (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). In 2002 and 2006, 89.8% and 78.1%, respectively, of AN-positive children were obese. A multiple logistic regression analysis was carried out to identify predictors of AN in 2006. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1059840511428615">Table 3</xref> demonstrates that preadolescent BMI was a significant predictive factor after controlling for gender, ethnicity, and grade (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .001); the odds of having AN were 17.2 times higher in the preadolescent obese group, OR: 17.2, 95% CI [7.96, 37.1], compared to the nonobese group.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study longitudinally examined the rates of overweight, elevated BP, and AN in third, fourth, and fifth grade students over a period of 4 years in a low-income school in rural northern California. To our knowledge, this is one of the first longitudinal studies that examined overweight, elevated BP, and AN among ethnically diverse, low-income children.</p>
<p>One of the most intriguing findings is a significant increase in BP from 2002 (third to fifth grades) to 2006 (sixth to eighth grades) among overweight students. Logistic regression analysis revealed that preadolescent (third to fifth grades) obesity is an independently significant factor associated with elevated BP among sixth to eighth graders. Past studies that have shown a significant positive association between BMI and BP relied on cross-sectional or retrospective quantitative study designs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1059840511428615">Muntner et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1059840511428615">Otto et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1059840511428615">Peterson et al., 2010</xref>). Our finding suggests that the prevention and treatment of obesity during preadolescence (third to fifth grades) is critical for the prevention of elevated high BP in early adolescence (sixth to eighth grades).</p>
<p>Contrary to the BP results, there was no significant increase in AN between 2002 and 2006 among our study participants. Similar to the results from previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1059840511428615">Brickman et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1059840511428615">Otto et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1059840511428615">Urrutia-Rojas et al., 2004</xref>), overweight was a significant factor associated with AN among third to fifth graders in 2002. The association remained significant in 2006. It is unknown whether overweight prior to 2002 was a risk factor for developing AN among our AN-positive students. Further longitudinal research that includes younger children is needed to identify risk factors for developing AN.</p>
<p>Ethnicity was a significant factor associated with overweight in our study with Hispanic students significantly more likely to be overweight compared to White students. This finding is congruent with the findings of previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1059840511428615">Ogden et al., 2010</xref>; Sorof et al., 2010). Our study findings confirm the importance of obesity prevention efforts for Hispanic children in particular and the development of school-based obesity prevention programs that are culturally appropriate for those children.</p>
<p>This investigation found that ethnicity was not a significant factor associated with BP after controlling for BMI. This finding is similar to the result reported by Ogden et al. (2010) and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1059840511428615">Sorof et al. (2004)</xref>. A review of the literature points to overweight as the primary contributing factor for elevated BP in children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1059840511428615">Sorof et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1059840511428615">Ostchega et al., 2009</xref>). On the other hand, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1059840511428615">Munger, Gomez-Marin, Prineas, and Sinaiko (1991</xref>) reported that a lower weight may not be as protective against elevated BP for Southeast Asian youth as it appears to be for White youth. Our study participants consisted primarily of Hispanic (56%) and White (29%) and with a few students of other races such as Asians and Native Americans (15%). Additional research is needed to further clarify the association between BMI and elevated BP among different ethnic groups.</p>
<p>Past research suggests that ethnicity and gender are associated with AN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1059840511428615">Burke, Duggirala, Hale, Blangero, &amp; Stern, 2000</xref>). With an AN rate of 34% for Hispanic students versus 2.5% for White students in 2006, the current study confirmed the association between ethnicity and AN which had been previously reported. Mukhtar and colleagues (2001) found that 19.7% of Hispanic students were AN positive compared with 4.7% of non-Hispanic students. In the current study, Hispanic students were significantly more likely to develop AN than White students after adjustment for BMI, gender, and grade. Considering the rapidly increasing rate of type 2 diabetes among ethnic minorities, this finding cannot be overlooked.</p>
<p>Gender has also been identified as a factor associated with hypertension and AN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1059840511428615">Sorof et al., 2004</xref>). The current study did not demonstrate an association between gender and hypertension but showed a strong association between gender and AN. Similar to the results of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1059840511428615">Otto et al. (2010)</xref>, our study demonstrated that female students were more likely to have a positive AN marker than male students. In contrast, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1059840511428615">Mukhtar et al. (2001)</xref> found that gender was not an independent significant predictor of AN. It is argued that gender-specific genes may influence insulin resistance, which is a factor strongly associated with AN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1059840511428615">Brickman et al., 2010</xref>). Future research is needed to understand the biological mechanisms by which gender-specific factors may be associated with the development of AN.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1059840511428615">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>There are several limitations to the present study. Due to limited time and resources, BP was measured once for normotensive students and twice for students with an elevated first reading for each screening. The use of less than three BP readings cannot serve as a diagnosis of either prehypertension or hypertension. Second, BP was measured among only obese children in 2002. Thus, the association between BP and BMI was not examined in 2002. Finally, this longitudinal study does not confirm a causal association between overweight and elevated BP or AN and possible confounding factors should not be overlooked.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1059840511428615">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The current study findings suggest a need for obesity prevention, especially among Hispanic students, in this low-income school. Our results indicate that preadolescence (third to fifth grades) is a critical period for the prevention of the development of risk factors for chronic diseases such as hypertension. A longer longitudinal study beginning with younger age children (e.g., 5â8 years old) is needed to better understand the development of elevated BP and AN and associated risk factors over a period of time.</p>
<p>School nurses and other professionals can play important roles in obesity, hypertension, and diabetes prevention by conducting timely screenings and health and nutrition education. As suggested by previous research, BMI and AN may serve as noninvasive and easily measured markers for children at increased risk for developing chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1059840511428615">Urrutia-Rojas et al., 2004</xref>), while CDC does not currently recommend screening for AN in the schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1059840511428615">CDC, 2011</xref>). Jones and Ficca state that âalthough the screening for AN remains controversial, school nurses who recognize AN should discuss the finding with the student and familyâ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1059840511428615">Jones &amp; Ficca, 2007</xref>). With the current epidemics of obesity and diabetes, more research is needed to further evaluate benefits and challenges (e.g., stigmatization) in different screening methods.</p>
<p>It is recommended that a combined effort among school nurses, parents, teachers, and school administrators be utilized in order to promote healthful eating habits and physical activity. Because of the alarming obesity rate among ethnic minority children, as demonstrated in the current study and others, we suggest that school nurses, teachers, and other professionals continue to develop and implement effective, culturally appropriate school health interventions tailored to ethnic minority children. School health professionals may benefit from research that examines diverse perspectives on nutrition, health, and diseases among ethnically diverse children and their parents.</p>
