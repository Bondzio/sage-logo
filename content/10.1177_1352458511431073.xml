<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Natalizumab (Tysabri®, Biogen Idec, Inc., and Elan Pharmaceuticals, Inc.), a recombinant antibody directed against alpha4-integrin, is frequently used as a treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS). Phase III trial data have shown that natalizumab dramatically reduces the frequency of relapses and lesion formation on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in patients with relapsing MS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1352458511431073">1</xref></sup> In these studies, benefits were realized rapidly and persisted throughout the treatment period. However, the occurrence of natalizumab-associated progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) in natalizumab-treated patients indicates that these prominent beneficial effects need to be balanced against the risk of a potentially life-threatening adverse event.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1352458511431073">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1352458511431073">3</xref></sup> As of February 2011, 95 cases of natalizumab-associated PML have been reported in MS (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.biogen.com">www.biogen.com</ext-link>). Recent studies have suggested another hazard of exposure to natalizumab: cessation of the drug seems to be associated with recurrence of clinical and radiographic disease activity. Some of these exacerbations were clinically severe, with a high number of contrast-enhanced lesions, suggesting a rebound of disease activity. This rebound occurs somewhere between 2 and 6 months after cessation of therapy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1352458511431073">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1352458511431073">5</xref></sup> Although it is unclear what determines the point in time of the rebound after cessation of therapy, obviously this may largely depend on the swiftness of clearance of natalizumab from the body.</p>
<p>Both the moment of rebound disease activity and the outcome of PML are related to natalizumab levels and clearance of the drug. For proper management of PML, it is important to have insight in natalizumab levels after treatment interruption, to determine whether or not plasma exchange should be started and continued. However, clinical data on clearance of natalizumab are scarce. Until now, clearance of natalizumab has been monitored only for relatively short periods of time. For instance, extrapolating natalizumab levels monitored for 28 days, Khatri et al. predict that it would take almost 100 days before median levels drop below 1 mg/l, a level below which partial desaturation of alpha4-integrin was observed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1352458511431073">6</xref></sup> Natalizumab levels after administration of a single dose have been monitored for up to 8 weeks,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1352458511431073">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1352458511431073">8</xref></sup> but this is not representative of patients receiving repeated doses of natalizumab.</p>
<p>Here, we present data of natalizumab levels for up to 260 days after stopping treatment in 10 patients with relapsing MS who, after at least 12 months, decided to discontinue treatment for a variety of reasons.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1352458511431073" sec-type="methods">
<title>Patients and methods</title>
<p>Since 2006 about 115 patients have started treatment with intravenous natalizumab 300 mg every 4 weeks at the MS Centre of the VU University Medical Centre in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Several have now discontinued treatment, for a variety of reasons. Here we further report on the first 10 patients who were monitored according to an an aforementioned algorithm (frequent MRI and clinical assessments) after their discontinuation of treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1352458511431073">4</xref></sup> Their mean age at start of treatment with natalizumab was 39 years. They discontinued natalizumab after a mean treatment duration of 23 months (range 12–40 months). Serum samples were drawn under informed consent. Blood samples were obtained just before the last dose of natalizumab was received and at different time points thereafter. These patients have been described in more detail elsewhere.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1352458511431073">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>We recently developed a sensitive assay to determine serum levels of natalizumab that takes into account several specific features of natalizumab.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1352458511431073">9</xref></sup> Natalizumab is an IgG4 antibody, which can undergo Fab arm exchange (half-antibody exchange), resulting in antibodies containing a single natalizumab-derived antigen-binding site.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1352458511431073">10</xref></sup> A bridging ELISA using natalizumab-specific antibodies is therefore not suited to quantify drug levels (but could be used to detect only bivalent natalizumab).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1352458511431073">11</xref></sup> However, alternative assay formats require careful assay design to avoid high background signals due to non-specific binding of serum IgG4 to coated (anti-idiotypic) antibodies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1352458511431073">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1352458511431073">13</xref></sup> We solved this problem by using F(ab’)2 fragments of anti-idiotypic rabbit antibodies as capture reagent. The resulting assay is able to detect natalizumab down to 10 ng/ml in serum, i.e. substantially more sensitive compared with other published assays.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1352458511431073">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1352458511431073">11</xref></sup> Precision of the assay is 13% for bivalent natalizumab and 17% for ‘monovalent’ natalizumab, respectively, and accuracy is 105% and 112%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1352458511431073">9</xref></sup> To prepare ‘monovalent’ natalizumab, a tenfold excess of an irrelevant IgG4 antibody was incubated with natalizumab at 37°C in the presence of 0.5 mM GSH to induce Fab arm exchange.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Using a recently developed sensitive assay we measured natalizumab levels in 10 patients with relapsing MS who had discontinued natalizumab therapy. Natalizumab was detectable up to 200 days after cessation of therapy. Thus, it can take a substantial amount of time before natalizumab levels drop to values that no longer block alpha4-integrin. Also, considerable variation in natalizumab levels was found between individuals, suggesting the need for monitoring by measurement of actual drug levels in specific situations. Persisting natalizumab levels after cessation of therapy might have clinical implications; for example, indolent PML has been described followed by a very late but severe immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1352458511431073">14</xref></sup> Interestingly, we measured blood levels of natalizumab at different time points during the course of PML and IRIS in this MS patient. The diagnosis was confirmed late, more than 2 months after stopping natalizumab, and therefore the patient was not treated with plasma exchange or immunoabsorption. Also, the patient had shown some initial spontaneous improvement after cessation of therapy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1352458511431073">14</xref></sup> Nevertheless, the patient developed severe IRIS. We measured serum levels of 1.1 mg/l 10 weeks after stopping natalizumab during the phase of clinical improvement, 0.6 mg/l during the phase in which IRIS became clearly visible on MRI 2 weeks later, and 0.1 mg/l 2 weeks thereafter, when the patient’s clinical condition had worsened due to IRIS and IV methylprednisolone was started after unsuccessful treatment with IV immunoglobulins.</p>
<p>Another suggestion of possible clinical relevance of measuring drug levels in our study was found in the fact that rebound disease activity occurred later in patients who showed the highest natalizumab levels. Unfortunately, the small group size and limited temporal resolution did not allow a more rigorous analysis. Accurate drug level measurement may provide guidance in when to start timely alternative treatment in patients switching from natalizumab. Identification of the best moment to start alternative treatment after cessation of therapy will be one of the main objectives of recently developed studies (e.g. the RESTORE study, clinicaltrials.gov NCT01071083).</p>
<p>We conclude that accurate measurement of natalizumab levels may contribute to a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms and the management of natalizumab-associated PML and the occurrence of rebound disease activity after cessation of the drug. Further research is needed, including functional assays, e.g. lymphocyte migration correlated to natalizumab serum levels as measured by a sensitive assay, and longitudinal serum level monitoring in both PML/IRIS cases, and larger cohorts of patients need to be sampled after cessation of natalizumab.</p>
