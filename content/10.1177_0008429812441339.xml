<p>This article examines three passages from the Rule of the Congregation and the Damascus Document that pertain to the topic of children’s education. The education of children was considered important within the Qumran movement, which is evident in the curriculum in 1QSa and the fact that such a high-level official as the Examiner had a supervisory role over the teaching. In contrast to the level of education of children in Jewish society in general at the turn of the era, which appears to have been quite rudimentary and consisting mainly of memorization, it appears that children within the movement received a thorough education in both reading and writing. The content of the teaching focused on the laws of the Torah and the Book of Hagu, which is an unknown composition. It is likely that both boys and girls received some education.</p>
<p>Cet article examine trois passages de la Règle de la Congrégation et le Document de Damas qui se rapportent au thème de l’éducation des enfants. L’éducation des enfants était considérée comme importante au sein du mouvement de Qumrân, importance qui est évidente dans le programme de 1QSa et le fait qu’un tel fonctionnaire de haut niveau que l’examinateur a eu un rôle de supervision sur l’enseignement. Contrairement au niveau de l’éducation des enfants dans la société juive en général au début de l’époque, qui semble avoir été assez rudimentaire et composé principalement de mémorisation, il semble que les enfants au sein du mouvement ont reçu une éducation complète en lecture et en écrit. Le contenu de l’enseignement a été axé sur les lois de la Torah et le Livre d’Hagu, qui est une composition inconnue. Il est probable que les garçons et les filles ont reçu une certaine éducation.</p>

<p>The extant sectarian literature of the Dead Sea Scrolls does not frequently refer to the children within the Qumran movement. Nevertheless, there is some information regarding the education of children in two of the documents, the Rule of the Congregation (1QSa) and the Damascus Document (CD). Given the scarcity of evidence concerning the specifics of the education of Jewish children in the late Second Temple Period, this information is quite valuable. I will examine these passages by asking basic questions, such as, what do the children learn? Where does the learning take place? How do they learn? And, was the education for boys only? In addition to the passages that directly mention children’s education I will also discuss a passage on the initiation rites in CD that throws additional light on the topic. I will begin my analysis with 1QSa 1:4–8, which describes the education of children in some detail.</p>
<p>A sectarian origin of 1QSa is undisputed, and the document likely stems from the beginning of the first century BCE.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0008429812441339">1</xref>
</sup> The text entails rules for an end-time community, which is explicitly stated at the outset of the document: “And this is the rule for all the Congregation of Israel in the end of days” (וזה הסרך לכול עדת ישראל באחרית הימים). The address to all of Israel is qualified, however, in the next few lines, as being addressed to those who correctly have been following the teaching of the priestly leaders rather than “the way of the people” (1:2–3). Perhaps one should assume that the narrative framework is that of a post-judgement era when only the righteous of Israel would remain.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0008429812441339">2</xref>
</sup> This period is marked by the presence of angels in the congregation (2:8–9) and two messiahs presiding at the banquet (2:11–22). At the same time, the end time depicted is quite ‘earthly’ in that there are still physically blemished and mentally impaired people in the community (1:19–22). The two messiahs who host the meal also appear quite human and a future war is still a possibility (1:26).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0008429812441339">3</xref>
</sup> Regardless of the exact time frame, the sectarian addressees are assumed to live according to the correct rules, which are also those for the end time. In other words, the rules are meant to be implemented in an actual community.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0008429812441339">4</xref>
</sup> Lawrence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0008429812441339">Schiffman (1989</xref>: 9) clarifies that the text constitutes “a kind of messianic mirror image of the society described in the Manual of Discipline [i.e. the Community Rule],” and he concludes that “legal materials contained in the Rule of the Congregation were actualized in the everyday life of the sect.” The instruction concerning teaching the children would certainly fall under the rubric of “legal materials.”</p>
<p>Col 1, lines 4–5 introduces the section that is of special interest:<disp-quote>
<p>
4 בבואום יקהילו את כול הבאים מטפ עד נשים וקראו בא[וזניהם ]את
</p>
<p>
5 [כ]ול חוקי הברית ולהבינם בכול משפ[טיה]מה פן ישגו במ[שוגותיהמ]ה
</p>
<p>4 When they come they shall assemble all those who enter, from children to women, and they shall read in [their] h[earing]</p>
<p>5 [al]l the statutes of the covenant, and instruct them in all [th]eir regul[ations] lest they stray in their errors.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0008429812441339">5</xref>
</sup>
</p>
</disp-quote>
Scholars usually take this passage in 1QSa as referring to the Renewal of the Covenant Ceremony that took place on an annual basis.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0008429812441339">6</xref>
</sup> This was an important ceremony in the Qumran movement when the whole community gathered and renewed its allegiance to the covenant. The inclusiveness of the whole congregation in the covenant ceremony is reminiscent of biblical precedents that commonly presume a large gathering of people, sometimes referring specifically to women and children, and sometimes not.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0008429812441339">7</xref>
</sup> In particular, this passage recalls the covenantal ceremony in Deuteronomy 31:10–13, where Moses demands that the Torah be read every seventh year for the whole congregation of “men, women, and children, as well as the aliens residing in your towns.” The biblical discourse emphasizes the presence of children, mentioning them twice (31:12, 13).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0008429812441339">8</xref>
</sup> Whereas the stated purpose of the reading in Deuteronomy is a positive one, “that they may hear and so learn to revere the Lord your God and to observe faithfully every word of his teaching” (Deut 31:12), in 1QSa the reason is “lest they stray in their errors.” The change in wording is likely aimed at bringing the importance of the instruction to the readers’ attention.</p>
<p>The learning that took place at the Renewal of the Covenant Ceremony described in 1QSa appears simply to have been that of listening to the commandments, “the statutes of the covenant” (חוקי הברית) and the regulations (המשפטים). The key section for our purpose begins in the next line, line 6, which introduces a list of the various stages in the life of a sectarian, beginning with the children; primary education naturally belongs to the early stage of life. Twenty is the age of marriage according to lines 9–10. In the list that follows, a man gets further responsibilities in the congregation at twenty-five years of age, and at thirty he may serve as a judge and is eligible for full service. Hence, just like marriage, education of the young is considered a life-stage, a natural part of life.</p>
<p>1QSa 1:6–8 reads:<disp-quote>
<p>
6 וזה <sup>ה</sup>סרך לכול צבאות העדה לכול האזרח בישראל ומן נעו[ריו]
</p>
<p>
7 [יל]מדהו בספר ההגי וכפי יומיו ישכיליהו בחוק[י] הברית ול[פי שכלו]
</p>
<p>
8 [יי]סרו במשפטיהמה
</p>
<p>6 And this is the rule for all the hosts of the congregation, for all born in Israel. From his youth</p>
<p>7 they<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0008429812441339">9</xref>
</sup> shall [ins]truct him in the Book of Hagu, and according to his age, they shall enlighten him in the statute[s of] the covenant, and acc[ording to his understanding]</p>
<p>8 [they shall] teach (him) their regulations.</p>
</disp-quote>
The listing of various levels of education according to age and maturity resembles a similar list in <italic>Pirke Avot</italic>, which also emphasizes the teaching of the laws.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0008429812441339">10</xref>
</sup> It specifies that children at five are ready to learn the Torah, at ten the Mishnah, and at fifteen the Talmud (<italic>m</italic>. <italic>Avot</italic> 5:21). This detailed progression, in turn, resembles that of the strict division between primary and secondary education in the Greco-Roman model, which like the Mishnah-model may be more of an ideal than historical reality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0008429812441339">Hezser, 2001</xref>: 81). At any rate, 1QSa reveals the same general idea about progression according to maturity. There is also an awareness of the differences in learning-ability among the children and that they learn at a different pace (if the reconstruction is correct), which sounds quite realistic.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0008429812441339">11</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>The terms חוקי הברית “statutes of the covenant” and משפטים “regulations” from lines 4–5 are repeated in lines 6–8. This indicates that the core curriculum is generally the same as what is read at the annual ceremony, i.e. laws. Hence public reading of the laws at the Renewal of the Covenant Ceremony served to remind the congregation of the knowledge they already were supposed to have. In the case of the children, their knowledge of these laws would depend on their age and the stage of their education. The Renewal of the Covenant Ceremony would serve to remind all, regardless of the level of their education, of the importance of these laws.</p>
<p>We should note that these terms (חוקי הברית “statutes of the covenant” and משפטים “regulations”) are used by Moses when he instructs the Israelites.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0008429812441339">12</xref>
</sup> It is noticeable that Deuteronomy, more than any other book in the Hebrew Bible, stresses the importance of the instruction of children. A prominent example is the <italic>Shema</italic> in Deuteronomy 6:4–9: “Keep these words that I am commanding you today in your heart. Recite them to your children and talk about them when you are home and when you are away, when you lie down and when you rise.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0008429812441339">13</xref>
</sup> Consequently, the regulations concerning children’s education in lines 6–8 are presented as a fulfilment of the laws in Deuteronomy, i.e. <italic>this</italic> community is fulfilling Moses’ command concerning teaching the children the laws. In this context we should remember that Deuteronomy was a very popular book at Qumran, judging from the 30 copies preserved.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0008429812441339">14</xref>
</sup> In comparison, only the Psalms have been discovered in more copies (36 copies).</p>
<p>In 1QSa “the statutes of the covenant” evidently refers to the biblical laws, and משפטים (their regulations) likely refers to their correct interpretation.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0008429812441339">15</xref>
</sup> So parallel to Deuteronomy, the focus in 1QSa is clearly on learning the laws. In addition the children should study the Book of Hagu (or Hagi), an enigmatic term that also appears in CD 10:6; 13:2; 14:7–8. The word likely derives from הגה, “to meditate”/“mutter while meditating.” One suggestion is that the title refers to the Torah, upon which students should meditate. But the reference to חוקי הברית already refers to the laws in the Torah. Others suggest that the Book of Hagu may refer to a halakhic collection, or perhaps a sapiential composition.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0008429812441339">16</xref>
</sup> Hence we have to conclude that the exact content of the Book of Hagu is simply not known. Yet it is clear that the primary focus of the education is on Scripture with an emphasis on religious law, which corresponds to the information on children’s education in other Jewish sources, such as Josephus, Philo, 4 Maccabees and the Mishnah.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0008429812441339">17</xref>
</sup> Some of these sources also stress general ethical teaching. The synagogue service evidently shared this focus on the Scripture and laws by the public readings of the Torah and expounding of the texts.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0008429812441339">18</xref>
</sup> An illuminating example is the so-called Theodotos incription (<italic>CIJ</italic> 1404) from early first-century CE Jerusalem, which states that Theodotos “constructed the assembly house for the reading of the law and for the teaching of the commandments.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0008429812441339">19</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Did the education envisioned in 1QSa include reading and writing? In lines 4–5 learning takes place through listening to the reading of the laws, “they shall read in their ears….” This is very much in line with the pedagogy revealed in Deuteronomy, where the people are told to recite God’s words constantly to the children so that they are inscribed on their hearts (Deut 6:6; 11:18–19), that is, memorized. 1QSa 1:6–8 does not specify whether reading and writing was taught. This is very similar to the information about the instruction of children that we find in other Jewish sources from this time, which rarely spell out whether the teaching actually involved reading and writing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0008429812441339">Yarbrough, 1993</xref>: 39–59). For example, 4 Maccabees 18:10–16 recalls the words of the mother of the seven unfortunate sons about to be killed, which describe the teaching they have received from their father. The content of their instruction includes the law and the prophets, biblical stories, and psalms, but nothing is said about reading and writing. Memorizing the Torah was the focus of the instruction at home, according to evidence in Josephus and the Mishnah.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0008429812441339">20</xref>
</sup> Josephus’ statement in <italic>Ag. Ap</italic>. 2.178 indicates that everyone would know the Torah by heart:<disp-quote>
<p>Were anyone of us to be asked about the laws, he would recount them all more easily than his own name. So, learning them thoroughly from the very first moment of consciousness, we have them, as it were, engraved on our souls; it is rare to find a transgressor, and impossible to gain exemption from punishment.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>Nevertheless, a few ancient, Jewish writers encouraged their readers to teach the children explicitly to read: the Testament of Levi expresses the value of teaching one’s children reading skills so that they “may have understanding throughout their lives as they ceaselessly read the Law of God” (13:2); and Josephus, similarly, encourages the teaching of “letters,” i.e. reading. The Book of Jubilees stands out as exceptional in that it presents fathers who are teaching their children writing skills as models (e.g. 8:2; 11:16).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0008429812441339">21</xref>
</sup> Teaching literature through dictation and memorization was also the basic model in the Greco-Roman schools. Nevertheless, while the latter included education in practical writing skills, the Jewish schools that developed later, did not. Instead, in Jewish society writing skill was considered a trade and was taught mainly to scribes in training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0008429812441339">Hezser, 2001</xref>: 73).</p>
<p>Since teaching mainly took place in the home, the level of education would naturally correspond to that of the parents. According to both Catherine Hezser and Meir Bar-Ilan the literacy rate of the Jewish population in Palestine was lower than 10–15%.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0008429812441339">22</xref>
</sup> According to them, the education at home was mainly of oral nature. We should also remember that writing required more skills than reading. So for example, if Jesus did possess some basic reading skills, as Luke claims (Luke 4:16–20), he may not have been able to write. In sum, while it is clear from the historical records that teaching children to memorize Torah was widespread, it is less clear that actual reading and writing skills were included in the common educational experience.</p>
<p>The reference to a specific book in 1QSa, the Book of Hagu, does not necessarily imply that the children should learn to read it since learning could mean memorizing the content. But, given the general character of the community, we may safely assume that the instruction at least included reading. The movement was a highly educated one that likely originated in priestly circles; it valued study throughout one’s life (e.g. 1QS 6:6–7 and CD 4:8; 20:31); its members copied biblical books and wrote commentaries on Scripture, i.e. <italic>Pesharim</italic>; the whole library at Qumran testifies to the high literacy rate of the movement. Indeed, the self-designation “the house of the Torah” (CD 20:10, 13; cf. 1QHab 8:1) depicts the community as the place where Torah symbolically dwells, i.e. where Torah is studied and interpreted and where the members (“the men of perfect holiness”) live according to its laws.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0008429812441339">23</xref>
</sup> It is also noteworthy that the founder was remembered as the teacher <italic>par excellence</italic>, the Teacher of Righteousness. It is therefore safe to assume that the children were not only taught to recite texts, but to read as well. Furthermore, writing skills must have been part of the curriculum, since the movement must have included many scribes, who produced the vast amount of sectarian literature and copied biblical and non-biblical manuscripts.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0008429812441339">24</xref>
</sup> It is noteworthy as well that Jubilees, a book that was very important for the Qumran community, presents fathers who are teaching their sons writing as ideal models.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0008429812441339">25</xref>
</sup> If we assume a link between the Essenes and the Qumran movement, it is revealing that Josephus highlights the thorough education they provided for the children: “[the Essenes] were versed from their early years in holy books, various forms of purification, and sayings of the prophets” (<italic>J.W.</italic> 2.159). Actually the focus on the education of the children in 1QSa appears quite similar to the life-long learning in which adult members were engaged, according to 1QS 6:7–8:<disp-quote>
<p>And where there are ten (members) there must not be lacking there a man who studies the Torah day and night continually, each man relieving another. The Many shall spend a third part of every night of the year in unity, reading the book, studying judgment (לקרוא בספר ולדרוש משפט),<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0008429812441339">26</xref>
</sup> and saying benedictions in unity.</p>
</disp-quote>
</p>
<p>The education for the children laid the foundation for them to become full-fledged members who would take part in the ordinary activities of the community, which included reading (or reciting) and studying the regulations, in short, reading skills combined with exegetical skills. The phrase “reading the book” (1QS 6:7) may well refer to the book of Hagu (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0008429812441339">Fraade, 1993</xref>: 56–57), which was part of the children’s curriculum as discussed above. This was an important book in the movement as priests and judges alike were required to be knowledgeable in this particular book (CD 10:6; 13:2; 14:7–8). Accordingly, the children were also trained to potentially serve as priests (depending on family) and high officials.</p>
<p>In 1QSa teaching is a <italic>communal</italic> responsibility. The text sets a common curriculum and the generic “they,” which refers to the men of the community mentioned in 1QSa 1:3, are to teach the children. The Damascus Document confirms this picture in that it is the Examiner, the <italic>mebaqqer</italic>, who is said to instruct the children, as we will see below. The communal nature of the instruction is noteworthy since the home was the traditional place for the earliest education of children, with the father having special responsibilities. Instruction by the parents is the model in Proverbs 4:1–4, for example: “Hear, O sons, a father’s instruction and be attentive, that you may gain insight; for I give you good precepts; do not forsake my teaching….” The home is still the primary location for instruction of Jewish children in the late Second Temple Period.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0008429812441339">27</xref>
</sup> In comparison, in the Greco-Roman world, also perhaps in some cities in Palestine, there were private Greek schools available for the primary education, or tutors at home for those who could afford it. According to Hezser, elementary Jewish schools started to become fairly common first in the third century CE.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0008429812441339">28</xref>
</sup> The passages in the Dead Sea Scrolls are the earliest references to what appears to be mandatory, communal elementary education for Jewish children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0008429812441339">Fraade, 1993</xref>: 55–56).</p>
<p>A final question to ask is whether both boys and girls were subject to instruction. Eileen Schuller highlights that women appear immediately before and after the segment on education in 1QSa 1:6–8 and proposes we should assume the same subject, that is, both sexes, in the entire section on the education of children.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0008429812441339">29</xref>
</sup> We may add that instruction of girls would have been important in the married branch of the Qumran movement; they would have had to know purity regulations and communal legislation as well as the men. This becomes evident in the lines that follow: “And at that time she shall be received to bear witness of him (concerning) the regulations of the Law and to take her place at the hearing of the judgments” (line 10). Apparently women testified, probably about their husband’s observation of the laws, and at least attended the communal meetings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0008429812441339">Ilan, 1995</xref>: 32–33; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0008429812441339">Wassen, 2005</xref>: 140–143, 203–204). This assumes that a woman had some level of education in these matters. Finally we may note that the education of girls was not uncommon in the Roman world.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0008429812441339">30</xref>
</sup> In short, there is no reason why girls would not be included among the children receiving an education according to 1QSa. Perhaps girls did not receive the same kind of education as did boys, but we do not know.</p>
<p>There is a very fragmented passage in the Damascus Document that also concerns education, which is part of “the rule for the Examiner of the camp,” סרך המבקר למחנה (CD 13:7–19). In this case girls also seem to be included. This text, 4Q266 9 iii 6–9/CD 13:17–20 (parallel letters in CD 13:17–20 are underlined), reads:<disp-quote>
<p>
6 <underline>וה[וא</underline>ה] <underline>ייס</underline>ר את בניהם [ובנותם]

<p>8 Let him (the Examiner) not keep a grudge against th[em] with wrathful an[ger]</p>
<p>9 [be]cause of their failings, and against one who is not<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0008429812441339">31</xref>
</sup>
</p>
</disp-quote>
We should note that the important word for “their daughters” is missing. Still, the wording “their little children” indicates the inclusion of girls since טף is a collective term for all young children.<sup>

</sup> The expression shows that education should start at a fairly young age, which we can compare to a similar notion in Isaiah 28:9: “To whom shall he give instruction? To whom shall he explain a message? To those newly weaned from milk, just taken away from their mothers’ breasts.” The verb יסר “to instruct” has other connotations as well, i.e. “to discipline” and “rebuke.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0008429812441339">33</xref>
</sup> But in light of the usage of the verb יסר in CD 4:8 and 20:31, with its reference to the instruction of the members in the correct interpretation of the Torah, the verb most likely carries the connotation of instructing in this case as well.<sup>

<p>The Examiner appears as a teacher in several passages in CD, which is also his role in the first part of the rule for the Examiner (13:7–8; cf. 15:14–15). The reference to his instruction of the children is very brief; nothing is said about the content or context of this instruction. Nevertheless, the previous lines (13:7–8) may be informative; the Examiner is exhorted to instruct the whole congregation, “the many,” in no less than “the works of God,” “the wonder of his (God’s) mighty deeds” (גבורות פלאו), and “the events of eternity (נהיות עולם) with their interpretations.” This surely involves advanced interpretations of Scripture. These subject matters would likely be part of the instruction to the children as well, but on a lower level. The fatherly, loving character of the Examiner is emphasized in connection to his teaching of both “the many” and the children.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0008429812441339">35</xref>
</sup> CD 13:9 reads, concerning “the many”, “let him pity (וירחם) them as a father does his children.” This can be compared to the section on instruction of the children, where he is admonished to teach the children “[in a spi]rit of hu[mi]lity and lov[ing-kindness]” and “not keep a grudge against th[em] with wrathful an[ger].” This attitude to teaching stands in sharp contrast to the high value commonly placed on physical punishment as a pedagogical tool; the admonition in Proverbs 13:24 is well known: “He who spares the rod hates his son, but he who loves him disciplines him early.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0008429812441339">36</xref>
</sup> This sentiment is shared by Ben Sira<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0008429812441339">37</xref>
</sup> and Philo (<italic>Spec</italic>. 2.232); Roman teachers were well known for using a rod, and the Mishnah narrates the ruling of Abba Saul, who absolved a teacher who had beaten a student to death (<italic>m. Mak</italic> 2:2).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0008429812441339">38</xref>
</sup> Although we of course do not know what actually happened during the instruction by the Examiner, it is noteworthy that he is admonished to be gentle to his young students. Moreover, the loving character of the Examiner in his role of a teacher modifies the general impression of the sect as a harsh environment somewhat, and serves as a corrective to a too one-sided portrayal of the community. We can conclude that since the Examiner himself had some responsibility for the instruction of the children their education was considered highly important. This confirms that the correct instruction of the children was held to be the key to maintaining perfection in the covenantal relationship in the community.</p>
<p>In the same document the Examiner is responsible also for instructing newly admitted members who fail to live according to the laws. CD 15:5–15 describes the initiation process both of the children of members (lines 5–6) and for new aspiring members who come from outside of the sect, “anyone who repents from his corrupt way” (lines 6b–7).<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0008429812441339">39</xref>
</sup> These are all initiated by taking an oath. CD 15:5–7 reads:<disp-quote>
<p>
5 והבא בברית לכל ישראל לחוק עולם את בניהם אשר יגיעו
</p>
<p>
6 לעבור על הפקודים בשבועת הברית יקימו עליהם וכן
</p>
<p>
7 המשפט בכל קץ הרשע לכל השב מדרכו הנשחתה
</p>
<p>5 And all who have entered the covenant for all of Israel as an eternal statute shall let their children,<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0008429812441339">40</xref>
</sup> who have reached (the age)</p>
<p>6 to cross over into those that are enrolled, take the oath of the covenant. Similar</p>
<p>7 is the precept during the entire time of evil for everyone who repents from his corrupt way.</p>
</disp-quote>
The “oath of the covenant” is specified in the next lines (8–9), where it concerns a vow “to return to the Torah of Moses with all his heart and with all his soul, to that which is found to observe during the time of …” (the text is fragmentary). It is evident that the oath includes the promise to live according to the correct interpretations of the laws (i.e. “that which is found”), in line with what the children presumably have been taught up to this point.</p>
<p>Lines 10–11 reveal that there is a test administered by the Examiner: “Let no one make the regulations (המשפטים) known to him before he stands before the Examiner lest he prove to be a fool when he questions him.”<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-0008429812441339">41</xref>
</sup> The context suggests that this test applies to outsiders rather than to the children of members; otherwise the prohibition against revealing “the precepts” to them prematurely does not make sense.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-0008429812441339">42</xref>
</sup> It appears that this rule was aimed at protecting the secret interpretations from being spread to outsiders in case the candidate fails the test. One may also infer that children of members would likely automatically be initiated into the muster of adults, since they otherwise would be in a liminal position in the community.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-0008429812441339">43</xref>
</sup> In addition, such a test of outsiders is also mentioned in CD 13:11–13.<sup>
<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-0008429812441339">44</xref>
</sup> Yet the subsequent lines apply to both categories of new members since the text specifies the consequences of taking the oath: “But when he takes upon himself to return to the Torah of Moses with all (his) heart and all (his) soul, they are free of his blame if he should transgress.” Through initiation the children now take on full responsibility to live according to their received knowledge in the laws. From this point they are initiated as full members. Still, as new members they run the risk of making mistakes, as lines 13–14 explain: “Should he err in any matter of the Torah revealed to the multitude of the camp, the Examiner shall ma[ke it known] to him and enjoin it upon him, and te[ac]h (him) for one complete year.” It is only logical to presume that newcomers would run a higher risk than the youths from within the movement, of making mistakes in the observance of the laws. Possibly, the one-year training would apply mostly to them. It is revealing that the instruction by the Examiner in this case focuses on legal observances. This confirms the general impression that for the Qumran movement, teaching the laws according to their correct interpretation is a central component of the instruction to the children.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the literature from Qumran is valuable in that is provides a glimpse into the education of children in Second Temple Judaism. The sect valued the education of the young very highly. In line with a general emphasis in Jewish society on the importance that children learn the Torah, 1QSa places great emphasis on teaching children the laws, which is seen as a fulfilment of the laws in Deuteronomy. In contrast to the surrounding society, where learning primarily took place in the home, the instruction in the Qumran movement was a communal responsibility. The teaching likely emphasized both reading and memorization of texts. It is not surprising that a sect that sprang from educated priestly circles would place great value on the education of the children, with a focus on sacred texts. Furthermore, the Qumran movement claimed to be alone in knowing not only the correct interpretation of the laws, but also the mysteries of God’s plan with his creation and Israel. For the survival of the sect it was obviously of utmost importance that the next generation should gain a thorough education and learn these interpretive skills. The literary production of the sect testifies to the need for the sectarians not only to memorize and read sacred texts, but also to be able to write and compose new works, skills that were passed on to the children. The education of the young was hence a key part in the socialization of the children into becoming full-fledged members of the sect who could carry on the tradition.</p>

<p>The Shechem ceremony in Deuteronomy 27–28 uses traditional androcentric language. At the same time, since all the people are addressed (Deut 27:1), one suspects that women and children were included as well (the inclusion of women is confirmed in subsequent curses and blessings that pertain to women [28:11, 18, 56-57]). The description of the covenant ceremony in Joshua 24:1–28 includes women and children by inference, in the statement “as for me and my household, we will serve the Lord” (24:15). The reform by Josiah is presented as a renewal of the covenant ceremony in 2 Kings 23:2–3; children are specifically mentioned (למקטן “from the smallest”). The Sinai tradition in Exodus 19, in contrast, stands out as unusual in its apparent exclusion of women and children from the covenant people. Their exclusion from “the people” is explicit in the commandment not to go near a woman for three days (Exod 19:15), which is addressed to adult males.</p>

<p>According to Josephus, the Renewal Ceremony was celebrated in the same manner in the temple as prescribed in Deuteronomy 31:10: “When the multitude has come together to the holy city for the sacrifices every seven years when the festival of Tabernacles is at hand, let the high priest, standing on a lofty platform from which he is audible, read the laws to everyone, and let neither a woman nor children nor even the slaves be prevented from hearing” (<italic>Ant</italic>. 4.209; translation by Louis H. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0008429812441339">Feldman [2000</xref>]; all citations from Josephus are from this series).</p>

<p>משפט is used for ‘law,’ e.g. in CD 16:13, and often carries the connotation of being the correct interpretation of a particular law (clearly the meaning in CD 12:21; 10:14). It can also mean ‘judgement’ in particular cases (e.g. CD 9:15; 13:7). CD 14:8–9 is particularly illuminating: “the priest who is appointed over the Many shall be from thirty to sixty years old, versed in the Book of Hagi, and in all the precepts of the Torah (משפטי התורה) according to their judgment (כמשפטם).” In the first instance, משפטים refers to laws in the Torah, while in the second it refers to their (correct) interpretation.</p>

<p>Hezser argues that the Jewish literacy rate was “lower than the 10–15% of the estimated Roman literacy rate of the entire population including women, if by literacy we mean the ability to read documents and write more than a signature” (2001: 496). There is little evidence for Hebrew primary schools until the third century CE; even then the emphasis was on reading the Torah and not on writing (2001: 40–52, 496–504). Meir Bar-Ilan estimates the literacy rate as only 3% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0008429812441339">1992</xref>: 46–61). The main reasons for the low numbers are: the emphasis on Torah reading (because scrolls were expensive material compared with papyrus); that literacy was an urban phenomenon and common Jewish farmers and fishermen did not need writing skills; and that Jewish schools were a late rabbinic phenomenon – scribes did not teach practical writing skills, but focused on reading the Torah.</p>

Deuteronomy 1:39 equates טפכם with “your children (בנכם) who do not yet know right from wrong,” thus young children in general. In Ezekiel 9:6, טף is distinguished from young men and women and connotes all young children (not only infants).

Nevertheless, the verb can also mean “instruct” and “teach” (see, e.g., Isa 28:26; Hos 7:15; Prov 31:1).</p>

<p>According to CD 7:5, to live by “his teaching” (i.e. God’s) (יסורו) is part of the covenantal relationship with God.</p>

<p>“He shall instruct their sons [and daughters] and their children [in a spir]it of hu[mi]lity and lov[ing kindness]” in lines 4Q266 9 iii 6–7 echoes Micah 6:8: “He has told you, O mortal, what is good; and what does the Lord require of you but to do justice, and to love kindness (אהבת חסד), and to walk humbly with your God.”</p>

<p>Ben Zion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0008429812441339">Wacholder (2007</xref>: 308–309), in contrast, argues that the rule concerns apostates who return to the community. But since outsiders in general are assumed to be under Belial’s sway (see, e.g., CD 4:12–5:15), the terminology of repentance would apply equally to outsiders in general. Importantly, the phraseology is reminiscent of CD 19:16, which refers to entrance “into the covenant of repentance” (בברית השובה).</p>

<p>Although the text does not explicitly state what the questioning concerns, it most likely has to do with the candidate’s general knowledge and intelligence (“lest he proves to be a fool”). The general insight of a person is also important in the initial examination by the Examiner detailed in CD 13:11–13: “let him [the Examiner] examine him [the candidate] with regard to his works and his intelligence (ושוכלו), his strength and might, and his wealth.” The insight of a person is likely one aspect of the evaluation alluded to in 4Q266 5 i 13, which reads: “according to his spirit.”</p>
