<abstract>
<p>The article discusses the organization of sexuality in the late modern societies, with emphasis on the significance of humorous style in the doing of sexual norms. The empirical data employed in the study consists of the agony column of the Finnish magazine <italic>City</italic> and the readers’ online responses to it. The column explores sexual differences and makes a variety of desires public, but also participates in the mass-mediated regulation of sexualities. Furthermore, it parodies the agony column convention, apparently operating as a way to resist formal sex education discourses and normative understandings of sexuality, yet ultimately it contributes to shaping sexual norms in nuanced ways. My research query has three parts. In the first, I focus on the ambivalent construction of normative heterosexuality through emotional mediation and questions of taste. In the second, I examine the connections between non-normative sexualities and other forms of cultural ‘otherness’. In the third, I trace the online responses from readers in order to understand how sexual norms are negotiated. In the data, sexual norms appear situated, as a particular sexual practice can either be approved or disapproved. Despite the general ambiguousness, sexual norms are (re)structured around intersecting social categories, such as gender, class, ‘race’ and ethnicity.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1363460712436822" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>The proliferation of columns in different kinds of publications in which readers’ questions are published and then answered by an agony aunt or uncle is characteristic of contemporary culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1363460712436822">Gill, 2007a</xref>: 180). This illustrates the rise of expert culture often connected to the cultural tendency of individualization, which gives prominence to lifestyle gurus and personal advisers acting as the new cultural intermediaries of the self (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1363460712436822">McRobbie, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1363460712436822">Wood and Skeggs, 2004</xref>: 206). Several agony columns discuss sexuality, to the point that a multiplicity of columns offering ‘sex counselling’ flourishes today. These columns celebrate ‘confessions’ about sex. Yet while they are making different sexualities and sex practices public, they are simultaneously playing a significant role in the regulatory system that opens up the subject of sex to discursive scrutiny (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1363460712436822">Attwood, 2006</xref>). The columns thus participate in regulating and normalizing sexual practices but meanwhile take part in the processes of subjectification (also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1363460712436822">Jackson, 2005</xref>). Agony columns have a central role in ‘educating desire’ because they function as sites of sexual information for their numerous readers and participate in shaping sexual norms (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1363460712436822">Jackson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1363460712436822">Kolehmainen, 2010</xref>). Besides articulating lived experiences and offering information of everyday sexual concerns, the columns are a valuable source of study for understanding the discourses of popularized sexology, and it is reasonable to assume that these articulations materialize to a certain extent as embodied practices. The columns also socialize their readers into certain discourses concerning sexuality and gender, for example. Hence, they have social significance beyond their immediate contexts.</p>
<p>In this article, the agony column of the Finnish magazine <italic>City</italic> and its readers’ online responses are examined in order to understand the processes by which sexual norms are constructed and negotiated. The column can be seen as part of a cultural shift towards more permissive sexual attitudes (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1363460712436822">Attwood, 2006</xref>) in its exploration of sexual differences and a variety of desires, even if in the Finnish society lively discussion of sexuality in the media has been going on for decades, while mediated discussions of sexual issues are supported by the country’s basic institutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1363460712436822">Haavio-Mannila and Kontula, 2003</xref>). However, the column participates in the mass-mediated regulation of sexualities and ultimately contributes to the shaping of sexual norms in nuanced ways. The column parodies somewhat the convention of the ceremonial advice column, manifesting discursive self-reflexivity: parody can be seen as one of the major forms of contemporary self-reflexivity with its metadiscursive features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1363460712436822">Hutcheon, 1985</xref>). The fact that problem pages are increasingly becoming objects of ridicule illustrates their firm position in contemporary culture, as parody ambivalently also functions as a way of honouring its target (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1363460712436822">Dentith, 2000</xref>). Most telling is the pseudonym of the agony uncle – Walter de Camp – that refers to the concept of camp. In contrast to other columns employing sex therapists or psychologists as experts, de Camp is not an institutionally legitimized professional. Rather, he is depicted as acquainted with a wide range of different sexual cultures and rich in social and cultural capital (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1363460712436822">Bourdieu, 1984</xref>). Hence, de Camp manifests a modern cosmopolitan subjectivity, which involves a liberal attitude towards sexuality (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1363460712436822">Wilson, 2004</xref>: 151). De Camp regularly refers to his personal experiences and learnedness, making observations that almost have an academic ring. The discourse employed in the column is thus one of ‘authenticity’ rather than of medical or psychological knowledge, and this gives the agony uncle a position of authority.</p>
<p>In addition to authenticity, the overlapping discourse used in the column is one of knowing and playful irony – widely used today in discussing sexuality in popular culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1363460712436822">Attwood, 2006</xref>: 84) – which apparently operates as a way to resist normative understandings of sexuality. As the readers’ letters often take the form of confessions, the columns also illustrate the current remaking of confession as entertainment (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1363460712436822">Attwood, 2006</xref>). This is especially evident in the case of the humorous columns published in <italic>City</italic> magazine. These confessions are indicative of social norms, as they hint, for example, at what is ‘worth’ confessing and what kinds of stories or questions are considered pure jokes. Whereas adolescents are considered the main target of sex education in Finland, where sex education has been part of the school syllabus for decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1363460712436822">Helén and Yesilova, 2006</xref>), the humorous style of the column produces distance towards formal sex education and its association with the inexperienced young (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1363460712436822">Hutcheon, 1994</xref>). Hence, the humorous discourse manifests discursive impossibility to ask ‘serious’ questions concerning sexuality in a cultural context where adults are supposed to engage and experiment in sex: one cannot parody something one does not ‘know’. This is in line with the cultural norms, as institutional sex discourses in Finland advocate active sexuality over sexual abstinence (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1363460712436822">Paasonen, 2009</xref>: 598; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1363460712436822">Helén and Yesilova, 2006</xref>). The column’s humorous discourse thus enables addressing sexual issues while maintaining the address of the readers as sexually experienced and at least as accepting ‘alternative’ sexualities.</p>
<p>The theoretical aspirations of this study are, on the one hand, to examine the mass-mediated shaping of sexual norms, and on the other, to analyse the role of humour in the construction of sexual norms. Methodologically, the study aims at opening up discussion on the significance of intersectionality in examining sexual norms as well participating in discussion on how to examine humorous circulation of the kind of discourses that maintain social hierarchies despite parodic ambiguity. Intersectionality as a term was first introduced by Kimberle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1363460712436822">Crenshaw (1989)</xref>, who examined how both feminist and anti-racist discourse failed to take into account experiences of women of colour as positioned simultaneously as women and as black. However, such social categories as gender, sexuality or ethnicity do not only count for the ‘Others’ but they shape the lived experiences of the privileged and the powerful alike (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1363460712436822">Staunaes, 2003</xref>: 105). In this study, the concept is used as a methodological tool in order to make visible how the operations of sexual norms cannot be reduced to the discussion of certain contents, as the norms can be organized according to situated dynamics that enable the differentiation of norms according to social categories. Social categories are seen as ongoing cultural processes, which become ‘materialized’ as embodied performatives (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1363460712436822">Butler, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1363460712436822">Byrne, 2006</xref>). Hence, rather than seeing intersectionality merely as describing pre-existing social categories, intersectionality is understood as a dynamic process, which is constantly operating and results in different subject positions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1363460712436822">Staunaes, 2003</xref>). From this perspective also, <italic>City</italic> is part of the everyday processes of making social categories and their intersections.</p>
<p>Intersectionality is also used as a tool in grasping at the ambiguity of humour. The humorous style of the column enables the play with ‘political correctness’. On the one hand, politically incorrect humour has been thought to be based on the idea of offending all social categories equally and to operate on the idea of ‘inclusion via mockery’, with no one safe from ridicule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1363460712436822">Weinstock, 2008</xref>: 13). On the other, the circulation of social inequality is increasingly mediated by masquerading sexist, racist, homophobic or otherwise hostile expressions as irony (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1363460712436822">Gill, 2007b</xref>: 159–160; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1363460712436822">Tyler, 2008</xref>). It is also questionable whether politically incorrect humour really can be seen as offending all the social categories ‘equally’, as these kinds of claims seem to sideline the cultural and social contexts, in which social hierarchies are rooted. However, while a humorous tone destabilizes certainty, the humorous construction of sexual norms in the data appears unequivocally ambivalent only as long as the intersectional differences and hierarchies of social categories are sidelined. Neither analysis of the reception data suggests that all the readers would consider the column as ambivalent. Even if irony and parody make the construction of sexual norms ambiguous, the ambiguity on the semantic level does not mean that readers wholly reject the superficial meaning and replace it with another, more sublime meaning (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1363460712436822">Booth, 1974</xref>: 72–74), thereby interpreting the column in an ‘ironic way’.</p>
<p>The overall data for this study consist of the columns published between the years 2003 and 2008 and all the online responses from the readers to these columns, hence covering both the column and its reception. The total number of columns involved is 144 (24 a year). Each column consists of a few letters followed by de Camp’s answers and is illustrated with a caricature related to one of the themes. On the basis of a tentative analysis of sexual norms in this material, the research questions were formulated and then three different subcategories of data were established in order to answer these questions. Firstly, I included all the questions concerning heterosexual coupling, as well as the answers by the agony uncle in order to discuss the ambivalent construction of normative heterosexuality through emotional mediation and questions of taste. Secondly, as I was interested in the connections between non-normative sexualities and other forms of cultural ‘otherness’ I therefore selected any mentions concerning fetishes and prostitution together with the audience’s online responses to these themes. I also wanted to trace the interactive dynamics of an online column by observing how the constructed norms were negotiated, and therefore decided to analyse all online responses to the columns in the year 2008. In my overall data, sexual norms were not discussed by definition, but practices were; however, by tracing the discursive ways in which these practices were articulated, I was able to adhere to the construction and negotiation of sexual norms.</p>

<sec id="sec2-1363460712436822"><title>The carnival of the ‘Inner Circle’</title>
<p>The agony column examined here is probably one of the best known of its kind in Finland, as the free bimonthly magazine <italic>City</italic> has approximately 367,000 readers. According to a reader survey (see for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1363460712436822">City.fi, 2010</xref>) that combines information elicited from several gallup polls and reader surveys, the majority of the readers are 15–34 years old (63%) and most of the readers (66%) have at least a matriculation. Men and women read the magazine equivalently as the readership consists of 51% women and 49% men. Articles on topics from fashion to politicians are continuously published in what could be described as a lifestyle magazine centred on the urban and trendy ways of living. Sex is a permanent theme in the magazine, which for example conducts sex surveys among the readership and announces the results with a flourish. The magazine is delivered at over 50 localities, the delivery concentrating in the biggest cities and in their surroundings. Despite its name, the magazine is published in Finnish. The publication also has a popular web portal that includes, among other things, a discussion forum, the opportunity to share videos and pictures with other users, an online dating service, a chat room function, and access to the online edition of the magazine. All the columns are published both in print and online. The latter facilitates commentary online while the submission of questions is done solely online. Not surprisingly, one of the main themes of the agony column, which is called the ‘Inner Circle’, is sexuality. Other regular themes include topics from night life to celebrities. In contrast to women’s and girls’ magazines, whose lynchpin agony columns are (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1363460712436822">Smith, 2007</xref>), <italic>City</italic> seems to have as its target audience men as well as women, and ‘straight’ as well as ‘queer’ readers.</p>
<p>In contrast to most agony aunts or uncles, Walter de Camp regularly positions himself in the field of non-normative sexualities, although his self-positioning is shifting to some degree. De Camp plays a significant role in the concept of the magazine as a whole. Sometimes he writes ordinary articles to the magazine, serving in the role of a (often gonzo) journalist; in 2009 a blog was established under the pseudonym. In the context of the blog, de Camp is humorously introduced as ‘Doctor honoris causa of all urban sciences. Extensive written works. Has published the kingdom’s most popular agony column in the <italic>City</italic> magazine since 1998.’ The columns became a regular part of the magazine from the beginning of the 21st century. Decadence is a significant part of de Camp’s image. Originally, de Camp was a pseudonym used by the journalist Kari Lempinen, who has participated in the public discussion on sex in Finland for decades – especially in the probing of pornography and fetish cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1363460712436822">Paasonen, 2009</xref>: 595). The figure was established in the 1980s, combining the names of sociologist Walter Benjamin and actress Rosaria de Camp. In addition to running the column, Lempinen, writing as himself or as de Camp, has published books on e.g. pornography (1988), fetishism (1997) and the sexual ‘underworld’ of Berlin (2011) – and also on the basis of the column (2002). The existence of such a phenomenon as de Camp suggests the commercialization of sexuality: de Camp, which is also a trademark, is an example of successful self-branding (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1363460712436822">ts.fi, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>The majority of the letters published in <italic>City</italic>’s agony column can be viewed as a form of sexual storytelling, in which personal experience is turned into a narrative of the intimate (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1363460712436822">Plummer, 1996</xref>). However, the question of the authenticity of readers’ letters has often been discussed in studies of agony columns, although the format guides readers to read the letters as ‘real’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1363460712436822">Currie, 2001</xref>: 266). This may not be the case with the Inner Circle, as the overall parodic style of the column does not necessarily give an impression of ‘real’ letters. Parody seems to operate in a way that mobilizes questions of ‘seriousness’ and ‘real’, which is of course telling of cultural associations between real and serious. For various reasons, it seems likely that not only all of the answers, but also some of the questions are revised. The repetition of certain themes gives the impression that previously published questions have sometimes been modified. And the elaborate language of some letters is reminiscent of the style of de Camp’s vivid answers. However, this is not to say that all the letters are written by the editorial team, and the opportunity to submit questions is continuously offered as an option to readers. The audience responses also suggest that many of those who participate in online discussions consider the questions ‘realistic’, as they occasionally correct de Camp or share related experiences. On the basis of data analysis, it seems that even though the readers might view the stories as unconvincing, they may suspect the authenticity of the stories, not the questioners – they do not necessarily assume that the letters would be written by the editors. In any case, the relationships among what are often referred to as ‘production’, ‘media/text’ and ‘reception’ are in many ways blurred in the data. For example, the very act of submitting a question can be seen as an audience response, but it certainly becomes part of the production process if the question is published. Thus, the column itself could be viewed both in terms of reception and in terms of production.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-1363460712436822"><title>The ambivalent construction of normative heterosexuality</title>
<p>The column is not heteronormative overall, as it airs a variety of sexual desires. Nevertheless, a great many questions discuss heterosexuality in one way or another. And, the hegemonic position of heterosexuality is confirmed in various other ways. For example, heterosexuality is rarely named in contrast to other forms of sexuality, which are clearly defined. However, not all forms of heterosexuality are treated equally (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1363460712436822">Richardson, 1996</xref>: 17), although the norms within the heterosexual framework in the data are not necessarily constituted by explicit articulation, but rather though emotional mediation and questions of taste. For example, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1363460712436822">Table 1</xref> shows how generational difference is not disapproved of directly, but crossing the age difference requires different investments from men and women.

<td><bold>Answer:</bold> I hear furious yells ricocheting off the lips of twenty-year-old hippie girls when they read your question and think of you, you ‘old’, ‘slimy’, ‘geezer’, ‘polluted by globalization’, who ‘exploits Chinese small farmers’. Nope, a hippie girl in her twenties is neither open to people in finance nor to their thoughts. To start with, take a few months off from work and travel to Goa to lie in a five-euro bungalow. There are other brokers in those corners as well, and it is a kind of thing there to take some distance from the business. There in the moonlight you can experience a passionate fling with an American girl student.</td>
<td><bold>Answer:</bold> … If you eat your waistline away and turn from curvy to round and/or cut your hair short or very manly – as so many middle-aged women do these days – you start sliding into an intermediate form between a woman and a man with the result that neither homosexual nor heterosexual men will be interested in you. I just spent a month in Havana and there were quite a few 40+ western women on a sex trip seeking Cuban men of 25. So if at that age you still mate with only under 25-year-old human males, yes, well, the Third World will be calling. Take your credit card with you.</td></tr>

<p>As norms and hierarchies are often articulated in the name of affective judgment (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1363460712436822">Skeggs, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1363460712436822">Tyler, 2008</xref>), different depictions from disgust to attraction indicate approval and disapproval. In the first example, an older man is associated with sliminess when interested in young women. Nevertheless, the potential disgust is portrayed as being rooted mainly in the collision between values and does not undermine the sexual attractiveness of older men. By contrast, when the person interested in a younger partner is a woman, investment in youngish looks and perceivable gender difference is highlighted – not directly, but alluded to in the anti-fat discourse. Thus, investment in gender embodiment is made a necessity for attracting men even though hair length is framed as a question of taste rather than gender conformism. The answer also suggests that when the age difference turns into a generational difference, a middle-aged woman can attract young men only with the help of money.</p>
<p>Simple celebration of the sexualization of culture simplifies the ways in which developments in sexual taste, representation and practice may be related to the positions of power, particularly in terms of class and gender relations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1363460712436822">Attwood, 2006</xref>: 82–83). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1363460712436822">Table 2</xref> illustrates how questions of taste and class are embedded in the discursive formulation of sexual desirability.

<p>Both examples in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1363460712436822">Table 2</xref> suggest that a desirable partner is one with a relatively high social status. In the first example, the questioner associates value with himself, while in the second, the questioner refers to high-earning celebrity athletes. Also both pseudonyms refer to accruing value and thus help to make the exchange explicit. In these examples bodily excess is associated with the working class, while discreet looks are associated with upper (middle) class. In extract 3, male bouncers are associated with embodied excess, which has been viewed as a typical way of characterizing working-class women (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1363460712436822">Skeggs, 2005</xref>). In the column, the bouncers are connected with excessive muscles, high testosterone levels and overt masculinity.</p>
<p>The Inner Circle can be thus seen as an example of the extension of making distinctions (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1363460712436822">Bourdieu, 1984</xref>) in the field of sexuality and sex practices. In addition to questions of how to find a partner for casual sex or a relationship, there are running themes connected with heterosexual coupling, including such topics as how to become intimate with a certain celebrity or how to meet someone in a certain profession. The column thus participates in the eroticization of difference that takes place through race, age, ethnicity, class and any number of other imaginable eroticized cultural constructions (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1363460712436822">Hart, 1998</xref>). Occasionally, questions about addressing meeting people of a certain nationality, ethnicity or ‘race’ are published, and these questions nurture sexualized and gendered notions of ethnic/racial differences by focusing on how to find black, south European or Central American men or Russian or Swedish women. A more common topic is how to catch someone in a certain profession. The questions under the theme ‘heterosexual coupling’ also employ other distinctions, from hair length or colour to the significance of the human voice or accessories in dating. The column is suggestive of how sexual distinctions can operate as a form of cultural capital that can take the form of symbolic capital if socially recognized and legitimated and then furthermore converted to power (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1363460712436822">Skeggs, 1997</xref>: 8).</p>

<sec id="sec4-1363460712436822"><title>Non-normative sexualities and other forms of cultural ‘otherness’</title>
<p>The pseudonym Walter de Camp suggests a campish attitude towards formal sex education, distinguishing the column from the ‘old-fashioned’ sex discourses. Even if the formal Finnish sex education discourses emphasize the possibilities of the individual to ‘express’ his or her sexuality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1363460712436822">Helén and Yesilova, 2006</xref>), a model of ‘good sex’ as non-commercial, vanilla, committed, couple sex and straight has been central to public sex education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1363460712436822">Paasonen, 2009</xref>: 589). In the spirit of this ‘liberated’ discourse, no line is drawn in the column in general between ‘good’ and ‘bad’ sexualities (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1363460712436822">Rubin, 1993 [1984]</xref>). Obscenity or stigmatization are not employed as discursive ways to constitute sexual norms. The column also covers a variety of the so-called non-normative sexualities, such as different fetishes, BDSM or multiple sexual partners, and hence transgresses the boundaries of legitimate or imaginable sexualities. Indeed, these topics do appear, occasionally compared to regular discussion about heterosexual coupling and related themes. Interestingly, the attitude to different sexual practices is shifting. Fetishism, for example, is discussed in neutral, positive and even shared terms by de Camp and thus normalized. Nor is fetishism disapproved of in the audience responses, but fetishes or fetishisms are rarely discussed online. Silence more or less surrounds them, which locates them on the margins of discussion and distances this topic from ‘normality’.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the tone in which prostitution is discussed in the data is dependent upon the intersectional categories involved. The attitude to prostitution is usually permissive. Sometimes the agony uncle even suggests buying sex as a solution for a reader’s problem. However, by bringing the perspective of intersectionality into the analysis, it is possible to see that prostitution seems to be accepted only as long as it takes place outside Finland or the prostitute is ‘ethnic other’, even if prostitution is not illegal in Finland. The concept of ‘intersectionality’ (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1363460712436822">Davis, 2008</xref>) is thus useful in examining the situatedness of the sexual norms, as well their embeddedness in social hierarchies. Although the column promotes ‘access’ to sex for Finnish audiences, the position of buying sex is only explicitly given to a Finn without any social sanction. In this connection, abuse is associated with prostitution when the prostitution takes place in Finland and the prostitutes in question can be read as Finnish (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1363460712436822">Table 3</xref>).

<p>Excerpt 5 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1363460712436822">Table 3</xref> well illustrates how the agony uncle portrays himself as a real cosmopolite who is well acquainted with different societies, cultures and history. This self-positioning dovetails with a form of masculinized ‘adventure’ when the agony uncle appears to be a sexual discoverer who knows sex in all its forms (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1363460712436822">Frank, 2003: 69</xref>). He also portrays himself as capable of mediating between different genders, sexualities, ‘races’, nations and so on. Popular culture is full of examples of women and men who are portrayed as being so different that they need translators to communicate with each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1363460712436822">Gill, 2007a</xref>). Yet it seems that in the column, gays and heterosexuals, as well as different ‘races’, are also represented as being so different that they need a translator be able to communicate. The idea of needing such translators naturalizes differences as it easily makes the differences appear to be ‘natural’ and unchangeable.</p>
<p>The Inner Circle can be seen as an illustration of how the convenience and erotics of commodified and racialized sexual services are celebrated (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1363460712436822">Wilson, 2004</xref>: 97). In example 5, de Camp is portrayed as a desirable sexual partner in contrast to African or African-American men, who are said to be unwelcome in Asian sex bars, even if US military bases have promoted the sex trade, at least in Thailand, while a number of go-go bars in Thailand are oriented to European, North-American and Australian men (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1363460712436822">Wilson, 2004</xref>: 21, 69). Sexual desirability is also racialized/ethnified, in other discussions about prostitution. In more or less subtle ways the column suggests that white westerners – or at least Finnish – are desirable sexual partners all over the world. In the example in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1363460712436822">Table 4</xref>, Third-World black men who sleep with western women for money appear more privileged than prostitutes.

<p>The column thus helps to generate the kind of discourse that is not only based on, but also promotes the idea of racial difference (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1363460712436822">Byrne, 2006</xref>). In extract 7, the hierarchy between white western women and black men from developing countries is also bolstered by introducing a class difference between them. In de Camp’s response, the western countries are associated with whiteness and developing countries with blackness, as if there is no one other than ‘whites’ in western countries and ‘blacks’ in developing countries. The example also illustrates how racism is cloaked with humour in the column, as are the various sexist expressions.</p>
<p>In my data, prostitution is continuously ‘distanced’ from the Finnish society by locating it in other societies, past cultures or subcultures (such as the lesbian subculture). This is not merely as a way of marginalizing prostitution, but also operates as a means of naturalizing prostitution: selling and buying sex appear to be an inevitable part of several societies and cultures. On its own, this distancing can also function as a way to locate sexual libertarianism outside Finland. Prostitution is normalized by illustrating how common it is in different cultures and how women and men, ‘straight’ as well as ‘queer’, buy sexual services. This way, the column transgresses the limits of acceptable sexual practices for those groups who have not been considered the main clientele of the sex trade, such as women. However, the ‘freedom’ to purchase erotic services is only imagined as belonging to some – wealthy Finnish – women. Neither Finnish men nor women appear as professional prostitutes in the data.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec5-1363460712436822"><title>Readers’ online responses</title>
<p>In order to obtain a picture of how readers responded to the column in public, the online responses to the 2008 volume were analysed. These 24 columns were commented on altogether 159 times – relatively seldom compared to the general liveliness of the <italic>City</italic> web portal, which has 130,000 different visitors each week. Thus, the comments do not represent the overall readership and offer a very partial insight to the reception of the column. These writings consisted mainly of comments on the column as a whole, the answers given, the questions posed in the column or earlier online comments – hence, the emphasis was not on the negotiations of sexual norms themselves. The commentators seemed to enjoy the vivid language used in the column as well as the inter-textual references, both to popular culture and to the so-called fine arts. Some research suggest, that the questions are especially significant to the readers of agony columns, since reading about other people’s problems offers readers a chance for self-comparison (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1363460712436822">Hermes, 1995</xref>; also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1363460712436822">McKay, 2008</xref>), but on the basis of my data, the commentators found the answers by de Camp essential.</p>
<p>Instead of discussing sexual norms, a vital recurrent theme throughout the reception data was the question of the authenticity of the agony uncle. These discussions illustrate how capable the readers are to perceive any changes in style. Many suspected that a ghost-writer had replaced the ‘original’ de Camp. In general, the tone of the suspicious readers was critical, and almost without exception, those who claimed that a change had taken place associated the change with a negative development. Humorous style is characteristic of agony columns of ‘the lad mags’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1363460712436822">Gill, 2007a</xref>: 214), as it is assumed that male readers are best addressed in an ironic tone. The discourse of humour as ‘manly’ was also carried out online, as the assumed change was sometimes connected to gender. Several times readers mentioned that the column was not as entertaining as it used to be because a woman now was writing it:<disp-quote>
<p><bold>disillusionment</bold> – 28.3.2008 03:28 Somehow the answers on this page, which used to be such entertaining “inner circle” items have started to seem as if they were published in Demi (and this is not to say I would ever admit to reading Demi).</p>
<p>Somehow they are perhaps missing something ... a certain genuine insolence ... as if the answers no longer have any “balls” and they’ve been replaced by something that tries to emulate the ballsy-ness as best they can but don’t quite get there.</p>
<p>The questions are still good, but the answers are sometimes somehow too emphatetic, or in a sense just girliefied.</p>
<p><bold>JohnJR</bold> 11.4.2008 14:12 Walter is really lame these days. The comments are no longer such sharp retorts. I strongly supsect that the author has changed from a man into a woman.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>The reference to <italic>Demi</italic> – a Finnish magazine for teenage girls – functions as a clear sign that indicates the involvement of social hierarchies in the giving of advice. The humorous style may indicate the class position of the target audience, as giving advice can be viewed as a classed practice, given that those who are positioned as advice givers are traditionally middle class and those positioned in need of advice working class. Consequently, agony columns seem to be missing from women’s magazines aimed at upper-middle-class readers. When the humorous style is used, the readers are not straightforwardly positioned as being in need of advice, not to mention that ironic distance itself can be seen as a middle-class practice. Also, as the target of sex education in Finland is rather ‘she’ than ‘he’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1363460712436822">Helén and Yesilova, 2006</xref>), the humorous style can blot out gendered associations of that kind.</p>
<p>Although the column regularly discusses relationships, sexuality and sex practices, only a minority of the online responses touched on these topics. The norms constructed in the column are thus questioned only rarely, and the variety of desires, which had been a feature of the column, is hardly recognizable in the responses. Rather, the responses seem to focus on the differences between men and women, especially gender embodiment, heterosexual relationships and ‘straight’ sex. ‘Normative’ heterosexuality is questioned in places in the column, but the online responses in general contribute to heteronormativity rather than to the proliferation of different sexualities. The following examples – generated by a question in which a man seeks advice on how to praise his fleshy girlfriend – illustrate the production of distinguishing, heterosexualized gendered roles. Women’s appearances are discussed – not men’s – and men appear as those whose relation to praising their girlfriends is at stake:<disp-quote>
<p><bold>BBW</bold> 19.6.2008 04:36 Having “Rubensian curves” myself, I wouldn’t like to hear even a positive comment about my curves. Even if my partner did admire them, I don’t, and therefore I don’t want to be reminded of them ... If he wants to sing his praises about my looks otherwise, he could concentrate his praise on the features I find attractive, too, for example my eyes or lips.</p>
<p><bold>my dole</bold>19.6.2008 11:09 Well, the fact is that you should never compare any female curves to the curves of another woman ... As I am a normal weight myself (or even thin) I often hear my boyfriend telling how chicks like Nicole Richie are too thin, and I am more of his type. The only logical chain of thought that follows from this is: I’m not like Nicole Richie → I’m not thin → therefore I’m fat. Do believe me, men; you don’t stand a chance of winning this battle.</p>
<p><bold>younger honkkomäki</bold> 25.6.2008 03:47 For a woman, it is more important to have a man thinking that she matches the hegemonic beauty ideal than that she matches the man’s personal beauty ideal. It is better for the man to stay quiet and just tinker with his Toyota.</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Despite the humorous tone of the Inner Circle, the column is only occasionally discussed in an ironic way online. It seems that the majority of readers who make online comments have somehow ‘sidelined’ the humorous tone of the column so that it is not seen as ‘just as a joke’. As an exception, a few readers apparently imitate an ironic style similar to the one employed by de Camp. These documented attempts to share in the playful discourse illustrate the potential of parody to function as a way of honouring its target (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1363460712436822">Dentith, 2000)</xref>, and can also be read as tributes to the column. However, in places the ironic style is used to criticize (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1363460712436822">Hutcheon, 1994</xref>) the answer written by the agony uncle, producing critical distance from the column and ridiculing de Camp’s advice. The comments also show that when the context is taken into account, the uses of humorous discourses are not full of ambiguous slipperiness.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1363460712436822" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Agony columns in general promote self-reflexivity, which has been seen as a key feature of the late modern societies. This refers to an increasing reflection on the rules, expectations and norms that organize social life, including those relating to sexuality (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1363460712436822">Adkins, 2002</xref>). Reflexivity is often seen as contributing to the de-traditionalization of the social and thus enabling a detachment from traditional forms of social categories, such as gender, sexuality, ethnicity or class. However, feminist critique has highlighted how reflexivity is not necessarily transformative, but may constitute new forms of hierarchies and classification, by for example re-gendering masculinity and femininity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1363460712436822">Adkins, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1363460712436822">2002</xref>), and thus providing grounds for new forms of inequality. Also, being mobile in regard to performances of sexuality and gender is an exclusionary practice, allowing and rewarding only particular groups to be mobile, whilst similar mobility is denied others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1363460712436822">Adkins, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1363460712436822">2002</xref>). Hence, self-reflexivity cannot be interpreted straightforwardly as ‘progressive’. The analysis of the Inner Circle and its reception illustrates how the agony column with its circulation of self-reflexive discourses does not necessarily contribute to detachment from traditional forms of social categories. Rather, these categories are in continuous doing, which in many places results in strengthening prevailing social classifications and hierarchies.</p>
<p>The empirical analysis of the agony columns of the <italic>City</italic> magazine and readers’ online responses has been introduced in three parts. Firstly, the ambivalent construction of heterosexuality through emotional mediation and questions of taste was discussed. The naming of sexual norms is sidestepped in the column by redirecting questions of norms to discussions concerning such things as taste or embodiment. Different distinctions, from trades to ethnicities and from clothing to voice, are discussed in the column; hence, the column thus illustrates how distinctions are made in the field of sexuality and sex practices. In fact, just as the ruling class displayed the most nuanced distinctions in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1363460712436822">Bourdieu’s classic study (1984)</xref>, so the <italic>City’</italic>s agony column can be seen as producing a setting in which sexual authority is drawn from and constituted through nuanced distinctions. ‘Knowing’ sex through its various, continuously produced distinctions operates as a form of cultural capital in the data.</p>
<p>By analysing the connections between non-normative sexualities and other forms of cultural ‘otherness’, it is possible to see how these discursive formulations confirm global inequality and even racism. In discussions of prostitution, white western subjects are positioned as desirable sexual partners and access to sex and erotic services for the Finns is advocated – while prostitution is portrayed as legitimate only when it takes place outside contemporary Finland or when the prostitute is not Finnish. On the basis of my study, the usefulness of an analysis that employs intersectionality as a point of departure becomes evident. Intersectionality as a methodological tool offers a means to understand the (re) construction of sexual norms around intersecting social categories. However, this is not to say that the relations between practices and identity politics is straightforward (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1363460712436822">Hart, 1998</xref>). In the data, sexual norms appear situated. A particular sexual practice can be either approved or disapproved of – ‘rewarded’ or ‘punished’ (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1363460712436822">Rubin, 1993 [1984]</xref>). In other words, sexual norms seem to be (re)structured around intersectional categories, such as gender, class, ‘race’ and ethnicity, despite the general ambiguity.</p>
<p>Even though a great deal of ambiguity can be read into the Inner Circle’s humorous columns, my analysis of the online responses suggests that not all readers interpret the style as being pure irony nor do they themselves use a humorous tone in their comments. Nevertheless, merely to state that the column uses ambiguous meanings would be to ignore its cultural context (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1363460712436822">Lloyd, 1999</xref>) and the significance of social hierarchies. In other words, discovering ambiguity should not be treated as the result of scholarly study, but rather seen as the starting point or as an important object of research in itself. As my analysis points out, humour plays a central role in mediating sexual norms and in the handling of intersectionality. In the late modern societies, ambivalence is at the heart of many forms of gender and sexuality reproduction (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1363460712436822">Skeggs, 2004</xref>: 29), and it could be argued that it is precisely humorous ambivalence and ambiguity that participate in maintaining gender dichotomy in my data, and that also produces gendered, raced and classed sexual practices and norms.</p>
