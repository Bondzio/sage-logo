<abstract>
<p>The aim of this study was to describe and gain an understanding of clients’ experiences of psychotherapy contracts and processes in cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and psychodynamic psychotherapy (PDT). Fourteen participants were interviewed after ending their psychotherapy. To get information richness they were selected with as great a variation as possible in relation to their life context. Qualitative content analysis was used to analyse the descriptions and the significance of the descriptions. Similarities between the two therapy orientations emerged throughout the informants’ experiences. These similarities were expressed in the two themes: The creation of a new context and The working method and the cooperation with the psychotherapist made up a whole. The psychotherapy process was described as ‘hard work’ in a new context, markedly different from the ordinary social context. From the informants’ perspective, the creation of a new context offered a possibility to give full attention, together with the psychotherapist, to oneself and to the problems one was grappling with. A salient feature was the informant’s responsibility for agreements in the psychotherapy contract, especially in relation to the number of sessions and the creation of cooperation with the psychotherapist. Irrespective of therapy orientation the therapeutic techniques were described as inextricably linked to the cooperation with the psychotherapist. An implication for practice and research from these findings is to give more weight to the influence of cooperation in psychotherapy techniques, irrespective of therapy orientation. Another implication is an awareness that the client’s knowledge of her/his difficulties, needs and desire for change, capacity to make an effort and to assume responsibility always have to be highlighted and have an impact on the psychotherapy contract and process.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1473325011431649"><title>Background</title>
<p>An important task for social workers within publicly financed psychiatry is to provide psychotherapy to persons suffering from mental illness. Within public mental health care in Sweden, just like in many other Western countries, there are two main therapeutic orientations available; Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and Psychodynamic psychotherapy (PDT). Within CBT the client and the therapist work at identifying and directly transforming thoughts, affects and behaviours which tend to maintain the symptoms. Within PDT the aim is to identify and understand the psychological roots of the symptoms and to develop strategies for change.</p>
<p>When psychotherapy is being considered as a means of treatment for persons in these contexts, a decision is made as to which one of these therapeutic orientations to offer. Irrespective of therapeutic orientation, psychotherapy is a relatively resource demanding intervention and it is important that it provides the greatest possible benefit for the individual. How to find suitable ways to assemble and deliver therapeutic activities has been pointed out as a vital issue for psychotherapy research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1473325011431649">McLeod, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Psychotherapy research has raised the issue as to whether psychotherapy has an effect and has also addressed what is the effective constituent in therapy and ‘what works for whom’. The first question is now considered to be answered since the positive effects of psychotherapy have been presented in meta-analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1473325011431649">Lambert and Ogles, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1473325011431649">Smith et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1473325011431649">Wampold, 2001</xref>).</p>
<p>A great number of studies have focused upon different, specific psychotherapy methods and their use in relation to different types of problems. An implicit condition has been that it is the techniques specific for the given method – the specific factors – which explain the outcome. Within psychotherapy research, however, there is support for the notion that the ingredients shared by different therapies – the common factors – are significant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1473325011431649">Wampold, 2010</xref>). Examples of common factors are the alliance, or the relationship between the therapist and the client, the credibility of the therapist, the therapist’s and the client’s expectations of a positive change and trust in the method, a new corrective emotional experience helping the client to understand her/his problems in a new way, qualities in the therapist such as attention and empathy, and the client’s own commitment to achieve change. According to the ‘contextual model’ a necessary prerequisite for both specific and common factors is the fact that the client perceives the treatment to be taking place in ‘a healing context’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1473325011431649">Frank and Frank, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1473325011431649">Wampold, 2001</xref>), otherwise it is not effective.</p>
<p>All psychotherapies are based on a therapeutic contract, an agreement on where, when and how the therapist and client should meet. This contract also defines the relationship between client and therapist and addresses issues related to secrecy and confidentiality. The aim of the therapeutic contract is to guarantee the contents and the process of the therapy.</p>
<p>Although the importance of the client’s contribution was emphasized by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1473325011431649">Lambert already in his meta-analysis of 1992</xref>, that special aspect of the therapeutic process has received comparatively limited scientific attention. There is thus a great need to study clients’ experiences of the therapy process in order to gain a better understanding of this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1473325011431649">Bohart and Tallman, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1473325011431649">Elliott, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1473325011431649">Elliott and James, 1989</xref>). In such research, qualitative methods have proved valuable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1473325011431649">McLeod, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1473325011431649">Nilsson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1473325011431649">Rennie, 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1473325011431649">2001</xref>).</p>
<p>Qualitative studies have shown that clients are active agents using psychotherapy in different ways for their unique requirements depending on how they understand their problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1473325011431649">Kühnlein, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1473325011431649">McKenna and Todd, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1473325011431649">Rodgers, 2002</xref>). Another perspective of the client’s active contribution to the therapy process is <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1473325011431649">Ole Dreier’s (1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1473325011431649">2008</xref>) conclusion that therapy cannot fulfil its desired purpose until clients can create links between their experiences in the therapy context and their experiences in their life context. The importance of the therapist – relating to success as well as failure – has been brought out in a survey of studies on clients’ experiences of therapy in different psychotherapy methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1473325011431649">Hodgetts and Wright, 2007</xref>). In a qualitative meta-analysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1473325011431649">Timulak (2007)</xref> included seven studies which were all focused upon what the client identified as significant events and their impacts. A main finding was that similar processes and impacts were found across therapeutic approaches.</p>
<p>To sum up, knowledge of the client’s significant role in the therapeutic process has led to an increased interest in qualitative studies dealing with clients’ experiences. The number of studies is however insignificant and the body of knowledge needs to be broadened and encompass a wide range of different contexts for the interventions. Since all psychotherapy methods – irrespective of orientation – contain a <italic>therapeutic contract</italic> and a <italic>therapeutic process</italic> these two concepts constitute a meaningful basis for the study of clients’ experiences.</p>
<p>The aim of the present study was to describe and gain an understanding of clients’ experiences of psychotherapy contracts and processes in CBT and PDT.</p>

<sec id="sec3-1473325011431649"><title>Context of the study</title>
<p>The setting of the study is a publicly funded Psychotherapy Centre in a medium-sized Swedish town. Persons with a psychiatric diagnosis were referred to the centre by psychiatrists and assigned by an experienced psychotherapist to CBT or PDT, based on the diagnosis according to DSM-IV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1473325011431649">American Psychiatric Association [APA], 1994</xref>), the availability of psychotherapists, and the client’s preferences which were occasionally expressed and set out in the written referral. The psychotherapists were generally recommended to spend a maximum of 25 sessions with each participant in order to reduce the waiting list. The licensed psychotherapists, eight with PDT and three with CBT orientation, in the present study were social workers, psychologists and a physician. All had 5 to 20 years of experience practising psychotherapy with one exception (a trainee psychotherapist under the supervision of a licensed psychodynamic-oriented psychotherapist). The therapies were carried out without the use of standardized manuals.</p>
<p>The study was approved by the Regional Ethical Review Board at Uppsala University, Sweden (Dnr 2004: 14-243).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1473325011431649" sec-type="subjects"><title>Participants</title>
<p>With the aim of achieving information richness the informants were selected with as great a variation as possible in relation to life context, i.e. gender, age, marital status, occupation, number of sessions and psychotherapy orientation. Therapy orientation was defined based on the formal qualifications of the psychotherapists treating the patients. The persons selected received oral and written information about the study and all of them accepted to participate providing a written consent. When fourteen informants had been included we judged the variation to be sufficient for this study (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1473325011431649">Table 1</xref>).

<sec id="sec5-1473325011431649"><title>Interviews and procedure</title>
<p>A semi-structured interview guide comprised the following open-ended questions: How did you expect psychotherapy to help you? What was the goal for the therapy? What is your experience of the venue of the sessions, length of sessions, frequency of sessions, and number of sessions? What is your experience of how the therapy was carried out with therapeutic tools and techniques? What is your experience of your own and the psychotherapist’s contribution in the therapy? What is your experience of the cooperation with the psychotherapist? The guide was used with follow-up questions in order to obtain illustrative examples, and was tested in two interviews not included in the study.</p>
<p>Face-to-face interviews were carried out 6–14 months after ending psychotherapy, and lasted between 60 to 120 minutes. The interviews took place at the Psychotherapy Centre and at a Research Centre, between January 2006 and June 2007.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-1473325011431649"><title>Interview analysis</title>
<p>Qualitative content analysis was chosen for this study since it is regarded as an appropriate method to describe and understand the perspectives of the participants and thus deal with manifest as well as latent content in a text (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1473325011431649">Baxter, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1473325011431649">Downe-Wamboldt, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1473325011431649">Graneheim and Lundman, 2004</xref>). The interviews were audio- and videotaped, and then transcribed into text. The software program NVivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1473325011431649">QSR-International, 2002</xref>) was used to facilitate the organization and the analysis of the text.</p>
<p>Each interview text was read several times both by the first and the second author in order to get an overall impression. After that the text from the interviews with the six participants having experienced CBT and the text from the eight participants with PDT experiences were classified into two separate <italic>units of analysis</italic> (CBT or PDT). The next step in the analysis was focused on what the text described in each interview. The text from all the interviews was divided and grouped in <italic>meaning units</italic> (words, statements, sentences) including descriptions with similar content. Then the meaning units were reduced into <italic>condensed meaning units</italic> by considering the significant content. At that stage the researchers realized that the condensed meaning units presented great similarities in the two units of analysis (CBT and PDT) which led up to a fusion thus creating a joint unit of analysis. The condensed meaning units were sorted into different <italic>categories</italic>, and were given notations reflecting the common characteristics of the condensed meaning units. A <italic>category</italic> is thus made up of a collection of similar descriptions which constitute the <italic>manifest content.</italic> After that the condensed meaning units and categories were controlled and compared to the interview text.</p>
<p>The next step in the analysis was focused upon the interpretation through reflections and discussions of how the descriptions in the categories could be understood and linked together. This part of the analysis had in view the <italic>latent content</italic>, i.e. the underlying meaning in the text, expressed in <italic>themes</italic>. Themes catch the main threads of meaning running through the meaning units, the condensed meaning units, the categories, and the interaction between them. The analysis process is illustrated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1473325011431649">Table 2</xref> by statements from two of the informants in the study with references to the informant’s gender, age and therapy orientation in parenthesis.

<p>This category comprises descriptions of the agreement between the informant and the therapist including the therapeutic relationship, the venue, the duration, frequency and number of sessions, and the goal of the therapy. Informants who had experienced PDT always described the psychotherapist’s consulting room as the venue whereas informants who had experienced CBT also mentioned dentist surgeries, bus stations, cinemas and town squares. The 25 sessions granted were more often presented as an upper limit for informants in the CBT group and as a minimum for informants in the PDT group. The limitation was described as a possible threat to an informant’s faith in the therapy being a success.<disp-quote>
<p>Then I knew that we had a limited number of sessions, […] that was a dilemma I felt the whole way through. (Woman, 48, CBT)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>An agreement concerning the goal of the therapy was described in both therapy orientations as being less well-defined than agreements about date and venue. Where the goal was set at the beginning of the treatment period it was described in the CBT oriented therapies as learning to master particular problems and in the PDT oriented therapies in more general terms such as feeling better, understanding and handling problems. The goal was not always expressed in the contract but it emerged during therapy, constituting a part of the psychotherapy process.<disp-quote>
<p>Perhaps the goal was set while we discussed things, by me saying what I wanted and how I felt and what I expected from this, maybe that’s how it was, not that we sat down particularly and talked of goals, we didn’t do that. (Woman, 48, CBT)</p></disp-quote></p>

<sec id="sec11-1473325011431649"><title>Psychotherapy was ‘hard work’</title>
<p>The personal commitment started with expectations of what the therapy would lead up to. One’s own experiences of psychotherapy and contacts with somatic, psychiatric and primary care, as well as those of other people, had an influence on one’s expectations. The expectations, containing both fear and hope, held the insight that it was necessary to get help in order to achieve change.<disp-quote>
<p>It has helped so many other people that I know of. (Man, 53, PDT)</p>
<p>I was petrified the first time I went there and I thought I would never go back again. But it wasn’t as bad as I first thought. (Man, 37, CBT)</p>
<p>You want someone else to help fix your problems […] hope that they have some type of patented medicine, almost like hypnosis, and then you’re fixed. But that’s not how it is, at the end of the day it’s up to you to go out and practise anyhow. (Man, 46, CBT)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Motivation was found to be a crucial issue.<disp-quote>
<p>I became more motivated when I was offered another type of therapy, had a child and had to feel better. (Woman, 25, PDT)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>All participants with experiences from CBT stressed the fact that part of the therapy work was to do homework in between therapy sessions whereas only some of those with experiences of PDT described a similar situation.<disp-quote>
<p>Yes, I was supposed to go out and go into town and meet people and stuff, practise. (Man, 46, CBT)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Overlapping the two psychotherapy orientations the informants stated that it was unusual, difficult and sometimes unexpectedly painful to start talking about one’s feelings and thoughts which one normally keeps to oneself in one’s everyday life context. The informants’ descriptions contained statements that this called for personal efforts which were sometimes quite demanding.<disp-quote>
<p>To start with, before I learnt to talk spontaneously, that was the hard thing, but finally I got used to it, I think. (Woman, 39, PDT)</p>
<p>I was on periodic sick leave because it used up so much of my energy. Yes, I was able to put the energy that I needed into fixing this and I feel satisfied with my contribution. (Man, 39, PDT)</p>
<p>Sometimes I felt that I didn’t want to – that I would rather dig a hole to hide in and forget everything. But at the same time I knew that I had to get through this to feel better. (Woman, 28, CBT)</p>
<p>To begin with I was forced to practise talking quite simply. I’ve never talked before. Tried to express feelings and so on. (Woman, 35, CBT)</p></disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec12-1473325011431649"><title>The psychotherapist’s skill and personal traits inspired confidence</title>
<p>Regardless of experiences from CBT or PDT the participants emphasized the importance of empathy and a sensitive ear in the psychotherapist and her/his ability to adapt her/his psychotherapeutic interventions and exercises to the needs and the capacity of the informants.<disp-quote>
<p>She could see when I got upset and intervened and took control and took it easier to start with, a bit easier, so she was really present the whole time, when I was doing the talking. (Man, 53, PDT)</p>
<p>She adapted the breathing and movement exercises to how I was feeling. (Woman, 48, CBT)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>When the psychotherapist’s skill was experienced as insufficient the therapy was described as insecure.<disp-quote>
<p>It was mainly towards the end. It was terribly difficult to sort of leave, she started to distance herself. And when we were going to stop it was awful and even during her holidays it was of course really difficult. (Woman, 35, CBT)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>The personal traits of the psychotherapist were valued in relation to how they were used professionally.<disp-quote>
<p>I sometimes got a bit irritated that she didn’t react more than she did because she was very indifferent, it felt like that. Then after a while I understood that that was what she was like, that it was the way she worked, then it didn’t irritate me as much. (Woman 25, PDT)</p>
<p>The therapist created a sense of trust and just being pleasant wouldn’t have been enough. (Man, 37, CBT)</p>
<p>Yes she felt safe and she was very knowledgeable. She had worked for a long time. She was very calm and it was very relaxing, it really was. (Man, 63, PDT)</p></disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec13-1473325011431649"><title>Psychotherapy aimed at self-help</title>
<p>Regardless of therapy orientation the informants stated that the therapy work comprised identifying and regulating feelings, restructuring thoughts, and changing behaviour. The informants described how techniques were used in order to help them find their own way to self-help.<disp-quote>
<p>To realize that it is not a question of someone telling me what is right or wrong, for me to follow, but I myself must assume responsibility for myself. (Woman, 28, CBT)</p>
<p>The working method emerged from my progress first with guided affective imagery and then with talk and guided affective imagery again. (Man, 21, PDT)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Informants who had experienced either CBT or PDT both highlighted talking as an important contribution to sharing feelings and thoughts with the psychotherapist. The way of working of the CBT therapists was described as actively guiding through explanations in the carrying out of exercises and exposures. The specific therapeutic technique exposure was only described by informants who had experienced CBT.<disp-quote>
<p>Then we went through town and people came up behind me and I felt stressed, didn’t know whether to let them go past, stand aside, but then he said that I should keep walking and so we kept walking and I had to force myself and see what happened. (Man, 46, CBT)</p>
<p>Yes we went out to shops together among people, went by bus, went to the cinema. (Woman, 35, CBT)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>The working methods of the PDT therapists were described as alternating between actively making comments, listening in a holding way and interpreting past and current context of the client.<disp-quote>
<p>When we analysed the pictures it depended on what I was able to see and what I wasn’t, but with the pictures where I saw a lot she was very passive and only made a few comments but at other times when I missed things she was more active. (Man, 21, PDT)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Informants with experience from PDT described how they had been helped to clarify their problems and reactions and managed to make connections with present and past life contexts.<disp-quote>
<p>I talked and then she fell into it […] I suppose she sat and thought out further ideas about what we were talking about. We went back in time and we talked about what things are like today and about suggestions as to how to solve it. (Man, 63, PDT)</p></disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec14-1473325011431649"><title>Cooperation with the psychotherapist was created continuously</title>
<p>Regardless of the therapeutic orientation the cooperation with the psychotherapist was described as a form of interaction aiming at finding out and using effective therapeutic techniques.<disp-quote>
<p>At last she used trial and error to find a way that suited me. (Woman, 28, PDT)</p>
<p>So I think our cooperation was good because he really tried to get me to understand and I tried to understand what he said. […]. So during the journey I thought that I wouldn’t have been helped as much with another form of therapy, no this felt like the right thing for me at that particular time. (Woman, 28, CBT)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>When this did not work, the prerequisites for the therapy disappeared.<disp-quote>
<p>The cooperation was untenable and I didn’t feel that it was good so I quit […] I felt insecure, just felt it was horrible. I think he let me go too far back and too far down in the misery too quickly. (Woman, 43, PDT)</p></disp-quote></p>

<sec id="sec15-1473325011431649"><title>Themes</title>
<p>In the continued interpretation two themes emerged, the first dealing with <italic>Creation of a new context.</italic> The latent content captured by this theme was that the therapeutic context offered a possibility for the informant to get full attention. Irrespective of differences in the therapeutic contracts these were described as helpful in offering predictability and security in order to go through the therapy process. There were problems however in creating a new and helpful context for the informant when rules and limitations for the therapy and the therapeutic relationship were difficult to tolerate. This theme was discovered mainly in the descriptions that constitute the category <italic>The contract laid down the conditions for the psychotherapy</italic>. This latent content of the text ran however also through the other categories, which are in keeping with the informants’ descriptions of the therapy work as an ongoing interaction between the different aspects listed in the categories.</p>
<p>The second theme, <italic>The working method and the cooperation with the psychotherapist made up a whole,</italic> captures the latent content of the informant’s descriptions in which accounts of the cooperation with the psychotherapist were intertwined with the therapy techniques used. Regardless of therapy orientation the techniques became effective for the informants only when they could be used in cooperation with the therapist. This theme appeared as a latent content mainly in the descriptions contained in the four process categories (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1473325011431649">Table 3</xref>), but by analogy with what has been described above, it also occurred in the contract category.</p>
<p>To sum up, the study shows that from the informants’ perspective the essential thing about psychotherapy is the creation of a new context in which another person – the psychotherapist – displays a keen interest in oneself and in the problems one is grappling with. Furthermore the study shows that from the informants’ perspective there is no distinction between the psychotherapist and her/his therapy method – they are conceived as a whole. Nor do the informants perceive the therapy contract as something preceding the therapy. On the contrary, ‘negotiations’ in relation to the goal, the character of the relationship, the number of sessions, and the choice of techniques are permanently ongoing. The study also shows that the informants experience psychotherapy as hard work in which their own contribution is a prerequisite for change to be achieved.</p>

<sec id="sec16-1473325011431649" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title>
<p>The aim of the study was to describe and gain an understanding of clients’ experiences of psychotherapy contracts and processes in CBT and PDT. The findings in relation to the informants’ experiences were expressed in the two themes <italic>The creation of a new context</italic> and <italic>The Working method and the cooperation with the psychotherapist made up a whole.</italic> These two themes will be discussed in relation to the aim and their importance for the psychotherapy work.</p>
<sec id="sec17-1473325011431649"><title>A new context and a joint responsibility</title>
<p>The informants’ descriptions were characterized by their feeling of entering a new and helpful context, which is expressed in the theme <italic>The creation of a new context</italic>. This can be understood in terms of the psychotherapeutic context being markedly different from ‘ordinary’ social contexts of which these informants are parts – family, work, relatives, and neighbours. The experience of the new context is described irrespective of therapy orientation and the new context was created in the therapy room – or outside, in the bus, at the marketplace, and even while doing one’s homework. This evokes Dreier’s theories about the need of creating links between the ‘therapeutic context’ and the ‘life context’, and about the client as the primary agent of change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1473325011431649">Dreier, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1473325011431649">2008</xref>), and the descriptions by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1473325011431649">Frank and Frank (1993)</xref> of a ‘healing context’.</p>
<p>In the cases where the context was described as not helpful or failing, both the cooperation with the therapist and her/his techniques were experienced as insufficient and unsafe. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1473325011431649">Saypol and Farber (2010)</xref> describe this phenomenon in terms of attachment. Their study showed a significant positive relationship between the sense of security perceived by adult psychotherapy patients in their attachment to their psychotherapist and a greater level of self-disclosure, and the level of positive feelings followed by the disclosure.</p>
<p>The therapeutic work of uncovering and changing feelings, thoughts and behaviour was described as ‘hard work’ for which one had to assume the responsibility irrespective of the orientation of the therapist and her/his techniques. This could be seen in the light of the fact that the intention of psychotherapy is to enable self-help, something which was stressed by patients as an effort you had to struggle with. Some informants stated that they had to reluctantly accept that the psychotherapist did not resolve the problems. The therapist’s ability to adapt the techniques to the needs and skills of the informants was emphasized, and the therapist’s personal qualities were valued in relation to how they were used and how they affected the therapy work.</p>
<p>As a red thread throughout the informants’ descriptions it appeared that what was crucial for making the therapy useful was a negotiating and secure cooperation between the client and the psychotherapist. Regardless of whether the techniques were related to CBT or PDT, they could not be separated from the ability to handle them in a collaborative effort; this was formulated in the theme <italic>The Working method and the cooperation with the psychotherapist made up a whole</italic>. Our findings correspond with the conclusion stated by Norcross and Wampold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1473325011431649">2011</xref>, p. 98) who claim that ‘the therapy relationship makes substantial and consistent contributions to psychotherapy outcome independent of the specific type of treatment’. In a recently published meta-analysis it also appeared that outcomes were positively related to the quality of the alliance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1473325011431649">Horvath et al., 2011</xref>). In the recommendations for good practice set out in the same article the authors emphasize among other things that the development and enhancing of the alliance are affected by – and constitute an inseparable part of – everything that happens in therapy. The dynamic character of the therapeutic process has been illustrated in a study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1473325011431649">Viklund et al. (2010)</xref> in which they analyse what happens when there is disagreement between clients and psychotherapists. An investigation using conversation analysis showed that the most common way for therapists to handle disagreement was to invite the client to elaborate her/his point of view in order to establish a shared understanding that was acceptable to both parties. However, it also emerged that the clients accept such a responsibility for example by not expressing criticism openly. The clients’ taking on of responsibility for the therapeutic process has also been highlighted in a study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1473325011431649">Neander and Skott (2008)</xref>. In our study the clients’ partial responsibility was manifested in the shaping and ‘renegotiations’ of the contract, in the commitment, the ‘hard work’ that the client put into the therapy and the continuous shaping of the cooperation with the therapist.</p>
<p>Our own pre-understanding differed from that of our informants in so far as we, from our professional perspective, perceive the therapeutic method and the person of the psychotherapist as two separate ‘phenomena’. This distinction however receives no support empirically. In the informants’ descriptions the statements about techniques are totally interwoven with their statements about the psychotherapists. This illustrates the obvious fact that there is no method or no techniques without a therapist – and also no therapist without a method or techniques.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec18-1473325011431649"><title>Similarities and differences between therapy orientations</title>
<p>On the basis of the researchers’ pre-comprehension, formed by an ‘insider’s perspective’, important dissimilarities were expected between the different therapy orientations, something which is reflected in our initial idea of separating the data into two analysis units (CBT and PBT). At a later stage, and on an empirical basis, we were led to combine the two analysis units into one, an illustration of the fact that the similarities were greater than the dissimilarities.</p>
<p>An explicit factor in our study indicating whether the statement originated from a person with experience from CBT or PDT was, however, the inclusion of descriptions of the venue of the therapy. When the context was not the therapist’s consulting-room it was always a question of CBT. From a theoretical perspective one could imagine that the ‘new context’ was favoured by the therapy always being given in the same secluded room, which is the case with PDT. It is possible that the very seclusion of the room contributes to the creation of a feeling of security which promotes the therapeutic process. On the other hand the work on linking insights and skills from therapy to everyday life might be favoured by the fact that therapy is not isolated to a given room, but can actually take place in the middle of everyday life, which is common practice for social workers.</p>
<p>Another Swedish study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1473325011431649">Nilsson et al., 2007</xref>), which like ours is a qualitative study on patients having concluded CBT or PDT at a publicly funded psychiatric outpatient clinic in an average-size Swedish town, presented clear differences between the patients’ descriptions of the outcomes of the two therapy orientations. The CBT patients who were satisfied with the therapy stated that they had developed an ability to apply specific techniques to cope with specific problems, whereas satisfied PDT patients said that they had become more self-reflective and attained a wider range of personality-related changes. We had different aims, but as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1473325011431649">Nilsson et al. (2007)</xref> we found differences in our study in relation to descriptions of the therapeutic process. In our study the CBT oriented psychotherapists were more often described as assuming an active, guiding role and providing explanations and techniques in exercises and exposures. The PDT oriented psychotherapists were more often described as listening, holding, and interpreting the client’s past and current life context.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1473325011431649">Nilsson et al. (2007)</xref> also found certain similarities between satisfied patients’ experiences from CBT and PDT, one being that both groups stated that they had gained better coping abilities. The main impression from our study is that the similarities in the informants’ descriptions between the therapy orientations outweighed the dissimilarities. All categories found in the body of the text in relation to the importance of the contract, the hard work, the therapist’s skill and personal traits, the orientation towards self-help, and the continuous cooperation between the client and the psychotherapist were based on descriptions from both CBT and PDT clients.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec19-1473325011431649"><title>Methodological considerations and trustworthiness</title>
<p>The selection of participants by gender, age, psychotherapy orientation and number of sessions had the advantage of gaining experience of therapeutic practice from informants with varied lives and therapeutic contexts. The professional background of the first and second authors made it difficult to ask ‘naive’ questions about the therapy, which might be considered a drawback. Inspired by our own experience of providing psychotherapy and supervision to psychotherapists with different theoretical orientations we chose to design an open-ended semi-structured interview guide. The guide was used to ensure that similar questions were put to all clients. Since transparency at every stage of the research process is important for trustworthiness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1473325011431649">Morrow, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1473325011431649">2007</xref>), we present the questions in the section with the interviews and procedure. The psychotherapies were carried out by licensed CBT and PDT psychotherapists which ensures that the clients’ experiences really refer to these therapy orientations, which might be considered a strength of the study.</p>
<p>The findings are limited to a small group and we do not claim that they invite generalizations. However the results may prove of value for the readers as long as they can transfer them to their own frame of reference or context. Further research is needed on aspects of clients’ experiences of psychotherapy not covered in this study, like the patients’ problems, life situation, and relationships before and after psychotherapy.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec20-1473325011431649"><title>Conclusions and implications for practice</title>
<p>When the informants in this study described their experience of the psychotherapy process it appeared to be a laborious and sometimes difficult piece of work. In this respect psychotherapy can be seen as a resource-demanding investment for the client. To speak about feelings and thoughts which are normally kept private in the context of ordinary life was experienced as unusual and sometimes painful. It was made possible by the fact that it took place within a new context which allowed the psychotherapist to give full attention to the informant and her/his problems. This new context was not a static one but was shaped in a process in which both the informant and the therapist seemed to strive towards the creation of a ‘healing context’ adapted to the purpose of the therapy, namely to find the client’s own way to self-help. Such a context was found irrespective of whether the therapy orientation was one of CBT or of PDT.</p>
<p>Throughout the descriptions it became apparent that the informants were describing their overall experience within which they did not distinguish between the techniques and the cooperation with the psychotherapist. Since from the client’s point of view, cooperation with the psychotherapist is inextricably linked to the method, it is important not just to focus on which specific methods and techniques should be recommended to provide benefit for the individual. In the training of psychotherapists, irrespective of therapy orientation, attention should be paid to the cooperation, i.e. the building up of trust, the adaptation of the techniques to the client’s needs and capacities, and also to the contract negotiations.</p>
<p>Another implication from this study is that the client’s knowledge of her/his needs and difficulties, her/his desire for change, her/his capacity to make an effort and her/his readiness to assume responsibility point to the fact that the client’s voice always needs to be listened to, made clear and allowed to influence the psychotherapy contract and process.</p>
