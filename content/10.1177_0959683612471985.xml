<abstract>
<p>A combination of pollen and sedimentary charcoal stratigraphies are used in conjunction with historical records to determine the relationships between climate, vegetation change and changing disturbances over the last 800 years in the Sierra Nevada, California. This period witnessed significant climate variability (the ‘Medieval Climate Anomaly’ followed by the ‘Little Ice Age’), as well as expansion of Native American, then Euro-American, populations. From <italic>c</italic>. <sc>ad</sc> 1300 to about <sc>ad</sc> 1800, the meadow was surrounded by a <italic>Pinus ponderosa</italic>–mixed conifer forest. The abundance of charcoal and carbonaceous spheres in the sediments suggests fire repeatedly burned across the meadow between <italic>c</italic>. <sc>ad</sc> 1300 and <italic>c</italic>. <sc>ad</sc> 1550, suggesting frequent surface fires. A similar pattern was noted previously in nearby Yosemite Valley, associated with a proto-historic Miwok population expansion (Anderson and Carpenter, 1991). Subsequently, cooler conditions with greater meadow soil moisture prevailed during the LIA, but with little decline in burning. We interpret this as evidence for continued Native American burning. Beginning in the mid-19th century <sc>ce</sc>, pine pollen percentages declined substantially, then rebounded somewhat during the 20th century. Grass pollen increases, and introduced herbs (<italic>Erodium, Plantago, Rumex, Zea</italic>) increase, documenting Euro-American settlement of the local Wawona area, with harvesting of economically important trees, livestock grazing and small-scale farming. These changes are consistent with the historical record. The sedimentary record largely confirms the fire scar record, documenting the anomalous nature of the absence of fire in the vicinity, which is critical to our understanding of the importance of this process on pre-European landscapes.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Although an important vegetation type in the Sierra Nevada, the late-Holocene history of environmental change in the ponderosa pine (<italic>Pinus ponderosa</italic>) lower montane forest of that range is poorly known. One reason for this is that few lake basins exist where organic sediment containing pollen, plant remains and charcoal particles accumulate in this dry, Mediterranean-type climate. This is in stark contrast to higher elevations, where lakes and wet meadows are abundant (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0959683612471985">Anderson and Smith, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0959683612471985">Anderson et al., 1997</xref>), resulting not only from lowered evaporation and higher precipitation rates, but also a larger number of basins, often originating from glacial action, which hold water and collect sediments year round.</p>
<p>In this study we use the pollen, charcoal particle and sedimentary record to determine former environments at Wawona Meadow in the Sierra Nevada’s Yosemite National Park over the course of the last 800 years, a period encompassing a rapid expansion of Native American populations within these forests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0959683612471985">Gassaway, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0959683612471985">Moratto, 1999</xref>). General agreement exists that Native American activities have had an influence on the landscape of western North America (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0959683612471985">Anderson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0959683612471985">Lewis and Anderson, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0959683612471985">Vale, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0959683612471985">Whitlock and Knox, 2002</xref>), but the scale of disturbance remains under discussion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0959683612471985">Anderson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0959683612471985">Minnich, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0959683612471985">Parker, 2002</xref>). At least in one case for the Sierra Nevada, manipulation of fire and vegetation in a montane valley is clear from the paleoecological and archaeological evidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0959683612471985">Anderson and Carpenter, 1991</xref>). The scale of landscape disturbance in the Sierra Nevada by Euro-Americans is much more obvious, as witnessed by historical records and repeat photography (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0959683612471985">Johnston, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0959683612471985">Vale and Vale, 1994</xref>). The paleoecological record from Wawona Meadow is important in that the record preserves a history of vegetation change for the <italic>Pinus ponderosa</italic> lower montane forest where it presently occurs during the late Holocene, and perhaps most importantly, allows a rare glimpse at the history of disturbance for the period before, during and since Euro-American settlement began there during the mid-19th century.</p>
<p>Equally as important, it has allowed us to reconstruct a detailed, high-resolution fire record from fine-interval sampling of charcoal in the sediment core that can be compared with the more detailed tree-ring fire scar chronologies already produced from near the meadow. These data assist in determining the natural range of variability in both the characteristics of the landscape and the process of landscape disturbance as a result of climate and human activities.</p>

<title>Site setting</title>
<p>Wawona Meadow (37°31′20″N, 119°38′20″W) is a large, NW–SE trending wet meadow in the SE corner of Yosemite National Park (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0959683612471985">Figure 1</xref>). The meadow is approximately 2 km long by 300–400 m wide, the upper end occurring at <italic>c</italic>. 1340 m (4400 ft) elevation, dropping to <italic>c</italic>. 1280 m (4200 ft) at the lower end. A small, discontinuous stream generally follows the meadow’s southern margin. Today, a golf course occupies the lower (northwestern) end of the meadow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0959683612471985">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Modern vegetation</title>
<p>Wawona Meadow occurs within the lower montane vegetation, as defined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0959683612471985">Fites-Kaufman et al. (2007)</xref>. Ponderosa pine (<italic>Pinus ponderosa</italic>) – mixed conifer forest grows around Wawona Meadow. Dominants in this forest also include incense-cedar (<italic>Calocedrus decurrens</italic>), sugar pine (<italic>P. lambertiana</italic>), and white fir (<italic>Abies concolor</italic>), with variable amounts of Douglas-fir (<italic>Pseudotsuga menziesii</italic>), black oak (<italic>Quercus kelloggii</italic>) and mountain dogwood (<italic>Cornus nuttallii</italic>). Common understory shrubs include manzanita (<italic>Arctostaphylos</italic> spp.), deer brush (<italic>Ceanothus integerrimus</italic>), mountain misery (<italic>Chamaebatia foliolosa</italic>), rose (<italic>Rosa</italic> spp.), and creeping snowberry (<italic>Symphoricarpos mollis</italic>) (terminology as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0959683612471985">Hickman, 1993</xref>).</p>
<p>Vegetation at the coring site on the meadow was dominated by graminoids. Much of the meadow is covered by rough sedge (<italic>Carex senta</italic>) and Nebraska sedge (<italic>C. nebraskensis</italic>) (M Buhler, personal communication, May 2010). Graminoid associates may include <italic>Juncus nevadensis, J. mexicanus, Glyceria striata</italic> (= <italic>elata</italic>), <italic>Agrostis</italic> sp. and other species. Near the coring site are willow shrublands, including arroyo (<italic>Salix lasiolepis</italic>), red (<italic>Salix laegivata</italic>), shiny (<italic>S. lucida</italic>) and Lemmon’s white (<italic>S. lemmonii</italic>) willows (M Buhler, personal communication, May 2010). At the time of coring, small, infrequent pools of open water nearby contained stands of cattail (<italic>Typha latifolia</italic>).</p>
<p>Tree-ring fire scar from nearby forest stands evidence suggests that mean fire interval of these forests varied prehistorically from <italic>c</italic>. 4.6 to 6.6 years, with weather conditions most conducive to the start of fires in the summer and into the fall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0959683612471985">Caprio and Swetnam, 1995</xref>).</p>

<title>Settlement</title>
<p>Little is known about the prehistoric settlement of Wawona Meadow in comparison with neighboring Yosemite Valley, which has been occupied periodically for over 5000 years. However, changes in artifacts suggest that the most recent immigrants, the protohistoric Miwok, arrived in Yosemite Valley 450 to 700 years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0959683612471985">Gassaway, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0959683612471985">Moratto, 1999</xref>). Since estimates of pre-contact Native populations of the Sierra Nevada approach <italic>c</italic>. 100,000 individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0959683612471985">Anderson and Moratto, 1996</xref>), it is likely that Wawona Meadow was also occupied during this period.</p>
<p>Subsequently, the Wawona Meadow area was settled by Euro-Americans, perhaps by <italic>c</italic>. 1856, when Yosemite’s famous Galen Clark settled there, and built a 160 acre homestead (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0959683612471985">Sargent, 1961</xref>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.yosemite.ca.us/library/wawonas_yesterdays">http://www.yosemite.ca.us/library/wawonas_yesterdays</ext-link>). Clark’s Station was a lodging house for travelers, and Clark probably used the meadow for haying. By the time this area was incorporated into Yosemite National Park in 1890, the general vicinity had attracted several additional homesteaders, including the Washburn family (by 1874), who erected a hotel in 1879, along with a series of other buildings. The Washburns, and undoubtedly others, logged the area around Wawona Meadow, concentrating on sugar pine (<italic>Pinus lambertiana</italic>). They eventually sold their timber rights to the Madera Sugarpine Company, which operated from 1897 into the 1930s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0959683612471985">Sargent, 1961</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0959683612471985">Sargent (1961)</xref> described the ‘…serene meadows, which appear today much as they did in 1856 or 1910, although the golf course has tamed the lower end’. In his book <italic>Yosemite Trails</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0959683612471985">Chase (1911)</xref> described Wawona Meadows as ‘ “the Sleepy Hollow of the West”. It is the most peaceful place that I know in America, and comes near being the most idyllic spot I have seen anywhere … Here is unbroken meadow, green as heaven, a mile long, wing knee-high with all delicious grasses and threaded with brooklets of crystal water’. Old photos of the location document haying the meadow grasses and harvesting and sawing local trees (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.yosemite.ca.us/library/wawonas_yesterdays">http://www.yosemite.ca.us/library/wawonas_yesterdays</ext-link>), which testified to the early impact of Europeans around and near the meadow.</p>

<sec id="section6-0959683612471985" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>Several sites along the southern margin of the meadow were probed for sediment depth and characteristics. Subsequently, a single sediment core was obtained at <italic>c</italic>. 1310 m (4300 ft) elevation from the southern margin of the meadow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0959683612471985">Anderson and Carpenter, 1991</xref>) using a Livingstone square rod piston corer. The entire core consisted of 751 cm of alternating colluvial organic sands and peats. In the field, the core was wrapped with plastic wrap and aluminum foil in segments, and stored in wooden boxes to take back to the Laboratory of Paleoecology (LOP), Northern Arizona University. Since the time of extraction, the core has been stored in a large cooler, maintained at a consistent 5°C.</p>
<p>Only the top 200 cm of the core was used for this analysis. In the lab, sediment color and characteristics were described. Two <sup>14</sup>C (radiocarbon) ages from below 55 cm and a <sup>239+240</sup>Pu profile from the upper 30 cm provide a chronology for the core. We also combined the record of exotic pollen types combined with historical records for the 19th and early 20th centuries to provide additional age points in the chronology. Pollen types that were important in this regard included plantain (<italic>Plantago</italic>), filaree (<italic>Erodium</italic>), dock (<italic>Rumex</italic>) and maize (<italic>Zea mays</italic>) (see below).</p>
<p>Pollen analysis followed a modified <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0959683612471985">Fægri and Iversen (1989)</xref> procedure, using 1 cm<sup>3</sup> of sediment. Processing included pretreatment with (NaPO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>6</sub> to deflocculate clays and the addition of <italic>Lycopodium</italic> spores for calculation of pollen concentration. Sediments were suspended in Na<sub>4</sub>P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> and sieved, then treated with HCl, HF, and acetolysis solution. Samples were stained and suspended in silicone oil, and analyzed at 400–1000× using a light microscope, with comparison with the modern pollen reference collection at the LOP and published keys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0959683612471985">Kapp et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0959683612471985">Moore et al., 1991</xref>).</p>
<p>Pollen grains were identified at 400× magnification with a goal of 300 terrestrial pollen grains (range 273–337 grains). Pollen were identified to their lowest taxonomic level, mostly genus, sometimes family or other grouping. Where possible, pine (<italic>Pinus</italic>) grains were differentiated based on morphology of the leptoma. Both diploxylon (<italic>Pinus ponderosa</italic>/<italic>jeffreyi</italic>) and haploxylon (<italic>P. lambertiana</italic>/<italic>monticola</italic>) types were encountered, and the remainder was combined into a single <italic>Pinus</italic> undifferentiated category. Members of the Cupressaceae and Taxaceae were not differentiated from each other, and since the dominant tree of this group is incense-cedar (<italic>Calocedrus decurrens</italic>), we retain that name here. Both <italic>Abies concolor</italic> and <italic>A. magnifica</italic> are combined as <italic>Abie</italic>s. Members of the sunflower family (Asteraceae) were divided into sagebrush (<italic>Artemisia</italic>), ragweed-type (<italic>Ambrosia</italic>), thistle (<italic>Cirsium</italic>), dandelion-type (Lactuceae), and other Asteraceae (all other members of this family). Rosaceae was divided into mountain-mahogany (<italic>Cercocarpus</italic>-type) and Rosaceae (all others). Different morphotypes of Brassicaceae and Lamiaceae were distinguished. <italic>Lycopodium</italic> tracers, spores, sedge (Cyperaceae), and other aquatic pollen and spore types were tallied separately. The raw counts were transformed to pollen percentages based on the sum of terrestrial pollen, excluding wetland and aquatic pollen and spores. The total pollen count was recalculated into pollen concentration for each level, which is a measure of pollen density (grains per cc of sample sediment (g/cc)). Complete pollen data are deposited in the North American Pollen Database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/paleo/pollen.html">www.ngdc.noaa.gov/paleo/pollen.html</ext-link>). We used TILIA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0959683612471985">Grimm, 1993</xref>) to graph the pollen data.</p>
<p>For high-resolution charcoal analysis we analyzed the sedimentary charcoal content of contiguous sediment samples. Sediment subsamples (1 cc) from each linear 0.5 cm of the core length were disaggregated in water. Sediment samples were sieved with 125 mm and 250 mm mesh, and examined using a dissecting microscope. We used the calculated sediment accumulation curve to determine the age of each charcoal sample, then used methods of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0959683612471985">Higuera et al. (2009)</xref> to calculate the charcoal accumulation rate (CHAR) of each sample by multiplying the charcoal concentrations (pieces/cm<sup>3</sup>) by the sedimentation rate (cm/yr). The CHAR data were entered into CharAnalysis (version 0.9) and decomposed into two components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0959683612471985">Gavin et al., 2006</xref>). The background CHAR (<italic>C</italic><sub>background</sub>) component represents integrated contributions from across a landscape and comes from distant fires or from sediment redeposition within the basin (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0959683612471985">Clark and Royall, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0959683612471985">Higuera, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0959683612471985">Higuera et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0959683612471985">Lynch et al., 2004</xref>). The second peaks component (<italic>C</italic><sub>peak</sub>) is calculated as the difference between CHAR and <italic>C</italic><sub>background</sub>, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0959683612471985">Gavin et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0959683612471985">Higuera, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The background component was calculated using a locally weighted regression (Lowess) filter with a 100 yr window, which we felt was sensitive enough to capture centennial-scale changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0959683612471985">Gavin et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0959683612471985">Hallett and Anderson, 2010</xref>). Background CHAR accumulates during non-fire years and is fairly constant among sites within a region, but varies among regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0959683612471985">Clark and Royall, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0959683612471985">Higuera et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0959683612471985">Lynch et al., 2004</xref>).

<title>Stratigraphy and chronology</title>
<p>Wawona Meadow Core 01 consisted of 751 cm of sediment, of which only the top 200 cm was analyzed for this study. The stratigraphy analyzed consisted of <italic>c</italic>. 50 cm of coarse sedge peat overlying 150 cm of organic colluvium. Within the colluvium were layers of medium to coarse sands. Pollen samples were taken from the more organic portions of the colluvium, as well as from the peat section. Charcoal samples were taken from the entire 200 cm core section.</p>
<p>Three <sup>14</sup>C AMS ages were obtained from Core 01 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0959683612471985">Table 1</xref>). One sample (UCIAMS 67130) was too young based on the other stratigraphic indicators, and this date was rejected. Each date in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0959683612471985">Table 1</xref> was corrected for <sup>13</sup>C/<sup>12</sup>C fractionation and calibrated to calendar years before present (cal. yr BP) using the CALIB 6.0 software program (Reimer et al., 2004). For the uppermost part of the record we used the age of the core top plus the <sup>239+240</sup>Pu stratigraphy. The peak in <sup>239+240</sup>Pu production occurred during the 1963–1964 height of atmospheric nuclear testing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0959683612471985">Ketterer et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0959683612471985">Ritchie and McHenry, 1990</xref>), and the <sup>239+240</sup>Pu peak activity in the sediment core at about 8 cm depth suggests that this depth corresponds to <sc>ad</sc> 1963–1964. To construct the final age model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0959683612471985">Figure 3</xref>) we used the <italic>clam</italic> code (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0959683612471985">Blaauw, 2010</xref>), fitting all of the age–depth points with a smoothed spline.

<p>The Wawona Meadow record of the last 800 years suggests two main phases of environmental history, with the timing of major change occurring at <italic>c</italic>. <sc>ad</sc> 1800. Additionally, within the last two centuries, pollen and charcoal evidence suggests a second shift in environmental conditions on the meadow around the turn of the 20th century.</p>
<p>From the bottom of the record at <italic>c</italic>. <sc>ad</sc> 1200 to about <sc>ad</sc> 1800, the meadow was surrounded by a <italic>Pinus ponderosa</italic> – mixed conifer forest. <italic>P. ponderosa</italic>, with perhaps <italic>P. lambertiana</italic>, grew mixed with <italic>Calocedrus decurrens</italic> and other trees in the uplands around a sedge and grass meadow. The pollen and macrofossils of meadow graminoids – primarily sedges – prior to <italic>c</italic>. <sc>ad</sc> 1550 suggest that the meadow itself was drier than today. However, the tree pollen assemblage of the entire time period is nearly identical to modern pollen found elsewhere in the lower montane forests of the Sierra (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0959683612471985">Anderson and Davis, 1988</xref>), including the occurrence of <italic>Ceanothus</italic>, Asteraceae and Rosaceae pollen more characteristic of the understorey. Abundant ferns grew in this open environment, and trees were never far from the coring site, as witnessed by the abundance of termite faecal pellets in the sediments.</p>
<p>The early part of this period was the transition out of the ‘Medieval Climate Anomaly’ (MCA), the main phase of which lasted in the Sierra and vicinity from approximately the 10th to the 13th–14th centuries <sc>ad</sc> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0959683612471985">Kleppe et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0959683612471985">MacDonald et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0959683612471985">Millar et al., 2006</xref>), and preceded the ‘Little Ice Age’ (LIA; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0959683612471985">Konrad and Clark, 1998</xref>).

<p>Fire has been a dominant and pervasive factor of disturbance in the forest around Wawona Meadow. Essentially all of the 400 levels that we analyzed in this core contained charcoal, suggesting that fires frequently burned near, and often across, the meadow. If the occurrence of charcoal and carbonaceous spheres in the sediments is an indication of fire proximity, fire may have repeatedly burned near and across the meadow between <italic>c</italic>. <sc>ad</sc> 1300 and <italic>c</italic>. <sc>ad</sc> 1550. Carbonaceous spheres, thought to be burned remnants of fungal sclerotia of the genera <italic>Sclerotium</italic> and <italic>Cenococcum</italic> and related species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0959683612471985">Adams, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0959683612471985">Scott et al., 2010</xref>) are commonly produced as a result of low temperature combustion of soils and the organic remains within them. Although these spheres are found higher in the core, they are not as abundant above this section. However, since studies relating the abundance of burned fungal schlerotia to specific fire characteristics do not exist we are unable to directly gauge the significance of this decline. This shift could suggest either a change in fire events or in the manner of charcoal and schlerotia deposition in the upper section of the core. Though charcoal influx clearly increased by <italic>c</italic>. <sc>ad</sc> 1375, the record up to <italic>c</italic>. <sc>ad</sc> 1500 is best characterized by lower peaks of charcoal than found higher up in the core, and might suggest more frequent surface fires.</p>
<p>Unlike the long records of fire obtained from fire-scarred giant sequoia trees in the nearby Mariposa Grove and further to the south in Sequoia National Park (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0959683612471985">Swetnam and Baisan, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0959683612471985">Swetnam et al., 2010</xref>), most sites within the ponderosa pine–mixed conifer forest near Wawona do not have tree-ring records that extend back in time to <italic>c</italic>. <sc>ad</sc> 1550 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0959683612471985">Swetnam and Baisan, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0959683612471985">Swetnam et al., 1990</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0959683612471985">1998</xref>). For this reason, we cannot directly compare this early period in the Wawona sedimentary charcoal record to the local tree-ring record. However, generally within the Sierra Nevada, the highest fire event frequencies in the giant sequoia tree-ring series occurred during the warm, dry MCA, centered about <sc>ad</sc> 1200–1300 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0959683612471985">Swetnam, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0959683612471985">Swetnam et al., 2010</xref>). That remarkable record is closely matched by the general abundance of sedimentary charcoal from meadow cores taken adjacent to the tree-ring sites as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0959683612471985">Anderson et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0959683612471985">Swetnam et al., 2010</xref>). The fact that charcoal influx during the MCA at Wawona appears to be lower than at other periods is curious (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0959683612471985">Figure 7</xref>), because we expected it to follow the broader pattern of higher charcoal influx (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0959683612471985">Marlon et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0959683612471985">Power et al., 2013</xref>). But its increase by <italic>c</italic>. <sc>ad</sc> 1375, when we would expect fire activity to decline, may reflect increasing fire activity by Native American burning (see below).</p>
<p>Little change occurred in the upland forest from <italic>c</italic>. <sc>ad</sc> 1550 to 1800, suggesting that fire occurrence or changing climate had little impact on those ancient forests. But after <sc>ad</sc> 1550 <italic>Salix</italic> increased within the meadow, followed by expansion of sedge at about <sc>ad 1700</sc> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0959683612471985">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0959683612471985">6</xref>). These indicators suggest generally wetter conditions within the meadow itself, caused either by a general increase in groundwater-table within the marsh (greater sedge component), or perhaps by greater channel flow (more abundant <italic>Salix</italic> nearby). These changes occurred during the LIA dating in the Sierra Nevada to <italic>c</italic>. <sc>ad</sc> 1400–1900 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0959683612471985">Clark and Gillespie, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0959683612471985">Konrad and Clark, 1998</xref>). During the early part of the LIA climatic conditions at lower elevations remained relatively dry, with only modest increases in snowmelt to low-elevation lakes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0959683612471985">Stine, 1990</xref>). However, subsequently, as cooling climates prevailed, treeline elevations declined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0959683612471985">Lloyd and Graumlich, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0959683612471985">Scuderi, 1987b</xref>) and glaciers advanced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0959683612471985">Clark and Gillespie, 1997</xref>). These regional changes indicating increasing effective precipitation are consistent with the local record from Wawona Meadow.</p>
<p>However, the cooler and/or effectively wetter conditions did not lead to decreased burning. Although the abundance of carbonaceous spherules is less, in fact, charcoal influx increased substantially. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0959683612471985">Anderson and Carpenter (1991)</xref> noted a similar pattern of burning at Yosemite Valley, which was concurrent with a major change in artifact assemblages, suggesting arrival of the protohistoric Miwok in Yosemite Valley at that time. Similar changes are documented from elsewhere in the central Sierra Nevada (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0959683612471985">Gassaway, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0959683612471985">Moratto, 1999</xref>) beginning <italic>c</italic>. 450 to 700 years ago. We infer from these studies that Native American burning was, in large part, responsible for this anomalous fire event pattern. This increased charcoal deposition lasted well into the 19th century in Yosemite Valley and into the early 20th century at Wawona.</p>
<p>Beginning in the mid-19th century, pine pollen percentages declined substantially, then rebounded somewhat during the 20th century. Although changing climate may be a factor, we believe that this was a result of Euro-American settlement of the local Wawona area in the mid-19th century, and the subsequent cutting, mostly of sugar pine trees. Pine percentages have not subsequently rebounded to pre-<sc>ad</sc> 1800 levels. Other tree and forest shrub species may have been favored with the opening of the pine forest locally, as seen in increases in oak (<italic>Quercus</italic>), Rosaceae (perhaps <italic>Chamaebatia</italic>), <italic>Ceanothus</italic> and <italic>Cercocarpus</italic>, and even <italic>Artemisia</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0959683612471985">Figure 4</xref>). But perhaps the greatest change occurred in the meadow itself. Grasses came to dominate the herbaceous component, at least early on, with increases in plants usually associated with livestock grazing, such as <italic>Plantago, Rumex</italic>, and <italic>Erodium</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0959683612471985">Anderson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0959683612471985">Mensing and Byrne, 1998</xref>), as well as disturbance (i.e. <italic>Ambrosia</italic>). A single grain of <italic>Zea mays</italic> was found during this time period, suggesting that at least some corn was being grown locally for part of the time. All of these changes are consistent with the historical record suggesting intensive use of the meadow proper for pasture or limited agriculture during the late 19th century (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0959683612471985">Sargent, 1961</xref>).</p>
<p>The fire history record of this period is much more extensive than the earlier period discussed above. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0959683612471985">Swetnam et al. (1990</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0959683612471985">1998)</xref> documented detailed fire histories for at least two sites near the eastern end of Wawona Meadow (their WWL and WWR sites). Both sites show frequent fire from the beginning of the records in the early 1700s to at least <sc>ad</sc> 1858 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0959683612471985">Swetnam et al., 1998</xref>: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0959683612471985">figure 7A</xref>), with an additional fire dated to <sc>ad</sc> 1889. Using our chronology for the Wawona Meadow core, we date the last recorded fire in this record at <italic>c</italic>. <sc>ad</sc> 1905, which suggests that our chronology may be off by ± two decades for this section of the core. However, a small charcoal peak occurring at <italic>c</italic>. 5 cm in our core dates to the late 1960s–early 1970s, in perfect agreement with the fire scar record (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0959683612471985">Swetnam et al., 1998</xref>: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0959683612471985">figure 7A</xref>). Even with some leeway provided for the difference in dating methods of the Swetnam study and ours, the general minimum in charcoal in the upper 25 cm of our core mirrors the general lack of fire in the fire scar tree ring record near Wawona. As with several other recent studies (i.e. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0959683612471985">Allen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0959683612471985">Anderson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0959683612471985">Swetnam et al., 2010</xref>), this provides reaffirmation of the ability of the sedimentary charcoal method to determine the general fire history of a site.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Using a fine-interval sampling approach the Wawona Meadow sediments have produced a late-Holocene, <italic>c</italic>. 800 yr record of paleoenvironmental change for Wawona Meadow, located within the ponderosa pine–mixed conifer forest in southern Yosemite National Park. This record joins only a handful of other published sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0959683612471985">Anderson, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0959683612471985">Anderson and Carpenter, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0959683612471985">Davis et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0959683612471985">Smith and Anderson, 1992</xref>) in the lowest montane forest for the region. Two important aspects of this study include (1) the record of vegetation change recorded in the pollen that can be matched with the historical record, and (2) the sedimentary record of charcoal that can be compared with both the detailed fire-scar, and archaeological and historical records of fire.</p>
<p>Pollen evidence suggests that for essentially all of the last 800 years, ponderosa pine–mixed conifer forest grew around the meadow. Little change in the upland vegetation occurred until the immigration and settlement of Euro-Americans in the mid-19th century. We suspect that the Miwok and their ancestors may have manipulated the meadow and perhaps the vicinity by frequent burning of the meadow surface. Their arrival some 700 years ago coincided with an increase in charcoal influx to the sediments, during a period known to be wetter and cooler. This was certainly the case for Yosemite Valley, where <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0959683612471985">Anderson and Carpenter (1991)</xref> documented the co-occurrence of environmental change with indicators of increasing populations in the valley. It is likely that the Wawona Meadow area, though apparently without the substantial water source found in Yosemite Valley, would have been attractive as well, and it was noted that a small settlement existed in the meadow at the time of the first Euro-American contact in 1851 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0959683612471985">Sargent, 1961</xref>).</p>
<p>Evidence for Euro-American impact on the local environment is found in sediments deposited during the last 150 years. These begin with evidence of loss of pines around the meadow, but also include the establishment of introduced herbs, such as <italic>Erodium</italic>; an increase in disturbance indicators (i.e. <italic>Ambrosia</italic>); establishment of plant indicators of livestock grazing (<italic>Plantago, Rumex</italic>), and perhaps planting of crops (i.e. <italic>Zea mays</italic>). It seems likely that these developments would have had an impact on the characteristics of the meadow itself, as shown by the large increase in grass pollen at this time. It is impossible to know whether this increase in grass pollen indicates an introduction of non-native grasses through intensive grazing, cutting of trees along the margin of the meadow allowing the meadow to expand, or is simply a natural process. The data for this are ambiguous, however several lines of evidence can assist in our interpretations. First, grasslands in many parts of California consist in large part of introduced grass species, and it is likely that this would be the case for Wawona Meadow. In addition, passages and photos in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0959683612471985">Sargent (1961)</xref> document the lush grasses that were cut for hay during this early settlement period. Second, trees were indeed cut near the meadow, and although the concentration of termite faecal pellets in sediments does not decline until the 20th century, plant macrofossils of dominant tree species become generally rarer in sediments of the 19th and 20th centuries. Additional studies are needed to answer this question.</p>
<p>Finally, the record from Wawona Meadow is important in documenting the general importance of fire on and near the meadow community over the last 800 years. Our work on the sedimentary charcoal largely confirms the much more detailed analyses using fire scars on tree rings (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0959683612471985">Swetnam et al., 2010</xref>). While we may not be able to match exactly individual charcoal peaks in the sedimentary record with known fire scar dates because of dating inaccuracies in the meadow record – nor can we say whether specific peaks in charcoal originate from fires that burned only the meadow, the surrounding forest or both – the general patterns are similar. More importantly, the fact that the sedimentary record and the fire scar record both document the anomalous nature of the absence of fire in the vicinity is critical to our understanding of the importance of this process on pre-European landscapes.</p>
<p>Clearly, additional studies are needed to answer questions of the relative impacts of humans on the landscape over the longer term, pre-European portion of the record. Even so, the record from Wawona Meadow provides us with an important opportunity to document the late Holocene history of the lower montane forest in the southern part of Yosemite.</p>
