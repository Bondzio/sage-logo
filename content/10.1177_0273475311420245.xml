<abstract>
<p>This study focuses on the use of mentoring by a peer as a way to help teachers of marketing to develop their teaching skills. Using self-ethnography, we elaborate on the potential of intradepartmental faculty mentoring in teaching (FMIT) to enhance the quality of marketing education. The study describes FMIT, a novel type of mentoring, reviews its benefits, and reveals the threats to its rewarding implementation. Three major elements related to rewarding intradepartmental mentoring were identified—organizational support, knowledge sharing in mentoring discussions, and handling emotions in mentoring. Accordingly, FMIT requires the establishment of an official status and permanent support structure. An existing colleague relationship and a long-term experience of collaboration provide facilitative conditions both for knowledge sharing and other rewards for both actors. The courage and ability to give and receive constructive feedback makes the mentoring relationship mutually beneficial. Organizational support in the form of training and coaching reduces the emotional challenges, further highlighting the importance of organizational commitment to FMIT.</p>

<p>Teaching continues to be less valued than research (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0273475311420245">Sharma, Albers-Miller, Pelton, &amp; Straughan, 2006</xref>), even though a strong teaching performance also increases research productivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0273475311420245">Baxter Magdola, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0273475311420245">Stack, 2003</xref>), and despite constant calls to improve the quality of teaching in higher management education (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0273475311420245">Schibrowsky, Peltier, &amp; Boyt, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0273475311420245">Van Fleet &amp; Peterson, 2005</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-0273475311420245">Van Fleet and Peterson (2005)</xref> encourage the use of a peer-review process for teaching by involving peers from other academic departments or institutions to ensure the independence of any review. This echoes corporate mentoring, where mentors and mentees are usually from different departments. However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0273475311420245">Kilburg and Hancock (2006)</xref> found problems arising when mentoring dyads did not share a field of interest or were situated in different buildings. Thus, they argue for the importance of the actors being from the same school. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0273475311420245">Harnish and Wild (1994)</xref> for their part suggest that discipline is not a significant factor influencing the success of peer mentoring in a college context.</p>
<p>As research is evidently divided on the pros and cons of intradepartmental faculty mentoring, this study takes as its starting point the findings of the past three studies above to discuss the use of intradepartmental mentoring among marketing teachers. For the purpose of this study, we have modified the definition by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0273475311420245">Zellers, Howard, and Barcic (2008)</xref> and define intradepartmental faculty mentoring in teaching (FMIT) as reciprocal learning relationships characterized by trust, respect, and commitment, in which a mentor and a mentee share their experiences, emotions, and knowledge of teaching as peers.</p>
<p>Although research on corporate mentoring (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0273475311420245">Boyatzis, Smith, &amp; Blaize, 2006</xref>), mentoring students, and young people (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0273475311420245">Crisp &amp; Cruz, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0273475311420245">Miller, 2002</xref>), and mentoring as a part of teacher training (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0273475311420245">Carver &amp; Katz, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0273475311420245">Meijer, Zanting, &amp; Verloop, 2002</xref>) is well established, a review by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0273475311420245">Zellers et al. (2008)</xref> criticizes faculty mentoring research for being of low quality and building on corporate mentoring research, despite few organizational parallels existing between academia and business. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0273475311420245">Clutterbuck and Lane (2004)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0273475311420245">Sands, Parson, and Duane (1991)</xref> argue that faculty mentoring research lacks detailed descriptions of the mentoring relationships and the mentor’s role, making generalizing very challenging. Research on faculty mentoring in <italic>teaching</italic> in the context of higher education is almost nonexistent. Exceptions are <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0273475311420245">Harnish and Wild (1994)</xref> on peer mentoring and studies on peer observation of teaching (POT; e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0273475311420245">Gosling, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0273475311420245">Millis, 1989</xref>), although POT lacks some of the essential elements of mentoring (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0273475311420245">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<p>The scarcity of research may be a consequence of the lack of pedagogical training among faculty members. However, requirements for pedagogical qualifications for faculty members are now common in several countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0273475311420245">Hubball &amp; Burt, 2006</xref>), so the situation is changing. Mentoring is a challenging task, and more research efforts are needed to support teachers in that task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0273475311420245">Bullough, Young, Hall, Draper, &amp; Smith, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>This exploratory study examines FMIT in a marketing department. Mentoring can be of help to doctoral students and senior marketing staff alike seeking to enhance their pedagogical competence (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0273475311420245">Madhavaram &amp; Laverie, 2010</xref>) and to apply new methods to ensure students are equipped with appropriate skills. With new learning and assessment methods, such as action learning (see e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0273475311420245">Young, 2010</xref>), active learning (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0273475311420245">Wright, Bitner, &amp; Zeithaml, 1994</xref>), oral examinations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0273475311420245">Pearce &amp; Lee, 2009</xref>), and e-learning (see e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0273475311420245">Demirbag Kaplan, Piskin, &amp; Bol, 2010</xref>), students learn to apply marketing knowledge, communicate effectively, build relationships and teams, and use technology—all skills required from marketing professionals beyond the entry level (see e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0273475311420245">Pefanis Schlee &amp; Harich, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-0273475311420245">Walker et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>In the sections that follow, we first position FMIT among the current mentoring models and review previous research on mentoring to define its facilitators and rewards. The scarcity of FMIT research leads this study to apply research on corporate mentoring, mentoring in teacher training, and POT. After the theoretical section, we present the empirical setting and the self-ethnographic methodology of the study. The analysis provides a description of participants’ experiences of FMIT and provides insights into the merits of FMIT, how it might be applied to enhance professional development and offers guidance on avoiding its potential pitfalls.</p>
<sec id="section1-0273475311420245">
<title>Positioning FMIT in the Mentoring Tradition</title>
<p>Different mentoring models share some similarities (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0273475311420245">Table 1</xref>). A classic view of mentoring sees it as a counseling relationship between the experienced senior, a mentor, and a less experienced junior, a mentee (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0273475311420245">Arnold, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0273475311420245">Miller, 2002</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0273475311420245">1</xref></sup> This also applies to mentoring in teacher training. POT can be performed either by senior staff or educational developers or by peers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0273475311420245">Gosling, 2002</xref>). However, mentoring can also be seen as a collaborative, dynamic, creative, and symmetric relationship between equals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0273475311420245">Rippon &amp; Martin, 2003</xref>), emphasizing a common learning experience and dialogue, instead of the seniority of the mentor. This view applies to FMIT, and consequently, confidentiality, trust, respect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0273475311420245">Fowle, 2000</xref>), and the presence of emotions and commitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0273475311420245">Bullough &amp; Draper, 2004a</xref>) are here considered the core elements of an FMIT relationship.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0273475311420245">Table 1</xref> also shows where FMIT differs from all three other types of mentoring. First, the actors in all other types of mentoring are not usually close colleagues, as is the case in intradepartmental FMIT. Second, although FMIT shares the wide developmental focus with corporate mentoring, it only focuses on teaching. However, its focus is wider than in POT, and both the mentee and mentor share knowledge during their FMIT mentoring relationship. Third, although the evaluative POT may also evoke negative connotations, it does not imply that the teacher being reviewed needs help, but that implication is more likely in the case of FMIT because of the potential prejudices of other teachers.</p>

<title>Review of Mentoring Facilitators and Rewards</title>
<p>Mentoring research reveals <italic>organizational support, knowledge sharing</italic>, and <italic>managing emotions</italic> to be the facilitators and rewards related to FMIT. Each is discussed in detail in the following subsections.</p>
<sec id="section3-0273475311420245">
<title>Organizational Support for Mentoring</title>
<p>For a department to develop a lasting mentoring system, both the culture of the school and the prevailing strategies and reward practices for faculty development need to support mentoring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0273475311420245">Albers-Miller, Straughan, &amp; Prenshaw, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0273475311420245">Arnold, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0273475311420245">Moran &amp; Dallat, 1995</xref>). Although research merits determine academic success and promotion, incoming faculty members are indoctrinated with that emphasis and it becomes part of a shared value system (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-0273475311420245">Sharma et al., 2006</xref>). Consequently, efforts to develop teaching may be undervalued and receive inadequate support. However, one of the success factors of formal mentoring programs is organizational support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0273475311420245">Harnish &amp; Wild, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0273475311420245">Moran &amp; Dallat, 1995</xref>), referring to both the tangible and intangible support offered to the actors. It ranges from the verbal encouragement of an immediate supervisor to training and monetary resources and also includes the allocation of sufficient time to mentoring meetings to realize its full benefits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0273475311420245">Arnold, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0273475311420245">Moran &amp; Dallat, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>Mentoring training facilitates the process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0273475311420245">Finkelstein &amp; Poteet, 2007</xref>). It equips mentors to set the tone of the mentoring discussions, implement appropriate intervention, assess performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0273475311420245">Harrison et al., 2005</xref>), and to adopt suitable mentoring strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0273475311420245">Carver &amp; Katz, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Rewarding faculty mentoring also requires various resources from the participants (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0273475311420245">Eby, 2007</xref>), especially practical knowledge from the mentor. By relating their own experience, mentors can help mentees put theory into practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0273475311420245">Meijer et al., 2002</xref>). To become an expert requires work experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0273475311420245">Harrison et al., 2005</xref>), and teacher education often uses the learners’ experience (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0273475311420245">Dewey, 1938</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0273475311420245">Knowles, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-0273475311420245">Orland-Barak, 2002</xref>). Teacher-training programs are more effective when learning addresses the participant’s daily dilemmas and is relevant to his or her professional development stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0273475311420245">Burden, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0273475311420245">Knowles, 1978</xref>). Moreover, effective adult learning encourages sharing experiences with colleagues in supportive and challenging conversations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0273475311420245">Clark, 1995</xref>). This brings us to the next facilitator and reward of mentoring—knowledge sharing.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0273475311420245">
<title>Knowledge Sharing in Mentoring Discussions</title>
<p>Knowledge sharing refers to the socialized communication of knowledge that occurs through direct and personal interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0273475311420245">Jordan &amp; Jones, 1997</xref>). Although of major importance, knowledge sharing is not a simple task. The highly routinized and tacit nature of teaching expertise poses a challenge to knowledge sharing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0273475311420245">Meijer et al., 2002</xref>). Another challenge arises from the underlying assumptions of the actors. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0273475311420245">Hawkey (1998)</xref> suggests that both the mentor and the mentee make almost ontological assumptions regarding teaching and learning and the roles of the mentor and mentee. The roles may be unclear and shifting, because of the lack of effective communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0273475311420245">Beck &amp; Kosnik, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0273475311420245">Bullough &amp; Draper, 2004b</xref>).</p>
<p>To facilitate knowledge sharing, certain topics should be discussed. The main task of the mentor is to frame the mentoring dialogue by asking questions that reveal the mentee’s ontological assumptions about learning and teaching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0273475311420245">Harrison et al., 2005</xref>). Unless made explicit, different underlying assumptions and role ambiguities may cause emotional tension and defensive reactions during mentoring, potentially ruining the relationship (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0273475311420245">Bullough, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0273475311420245">Graham, 1997</xref>). The mentor needs to provide an adequate challenge to the mentee by setting targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0273475311420245">Carver &amp; Katz, 2004</xref>) and providing honest, critical, and direct feedback (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0273475311420245">Bullough &amp; Draper, 2004a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0273475311420245">Harrison et al., 2005</xref>). However, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0273475311420245">Edwards and Protheroe (2004)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0273475311420245">Blackmore (2005)</xref> demonstrate that even when specifically asked to, mentors give little critical feedback. This can lead to an excess of support over challenges, which hinders learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0273475311420245">Reiman &amp; Thies-Sprinthall, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>The previous discussion, similar to most mentoring research (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0273475311420245">Allen, Eby, O’Brien, &amp; Lentz, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0273475311420245">Boyatzis et al., 2006</xref>), focuses on the benefits to mentees. However, the benefits to mentors are also important (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0273475311420245">Eby, Durley, Evans, &amp; Ragins, 2006</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0273475311420245">Hoerner, Clowers, Lichtman, and Allkins (1991)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0273475311420245">McCann and Radford (1993)</xref> show that mentors are often assigned the role rather than volunteering for it. It is essential to motivate mentors so that they appreciate their professional development during the mentoring process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0273475311420245">Lopez-Real &amp; Kwan, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Skilled mentors can both assist mentees to reflect on their practical work and analyze their own practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0273475311420245">Moran &amp; Dallat, 1995</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0273475311420245">Lopez-Real and Kwan (2005)</xref> report that 70% of teacher mentors benefit from mentoring. They learn through self-reflection, from the mentees, through mutual collaboration, and from university tutors. Knowing that they are role models encourages mentors to work to ensure that their own teaching is of the highest quality. Mentoring also acts as a catalyst for further mentoring and knowledge sharing between teachers, and thus has a long-term effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0273475311420245">Lopez-Real &amp; Kwan, 2005</xref>).</p>

<p>The process of learning to teach is in itself an emotional one, and the mentor has an important role to play in the process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0273475311420245">Bullough &amp; Draper, 2004a</xref>). Honest feedback is one of the main topics in mentoring discussions. However, giving and receiving critical feedback is an emotional challenge, and acquiring the requisite skills is important for both mentors and mentees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0273475311420245">Rippon &amp; Martin, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0273475311420245">Rix &amp; Gold, 2000</xref>). If the mentor is not skilled in giving feedback and the mentee cannot make use of it, mentoring discussions lose their impact.</p>
<p>However, individual skills are not enough to manage emotions. The basic assumptions of mentoring dictate that the relationship itself engenders trust and demonstrates the actors’ commitment (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0273475311420245">Luna &amp; Cullen, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0273475311420245">Zellers et al., 2008</xref>). Thus, a mentoring relationship needs to be “a safe place” for both actors.</p>
<p>Other sources of stress for faculty member mentees include time constraints, student interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0273475311420245">Dey, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0273475311420245">Gmelch, Wilke, &amp; Lovrich, 1986</xref>), and teaching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0273475311420245">Hart &amp; Cress, 2009</xref>). Since overall job satisfaction and support from colleagues can reduce stressors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0273475311420245">AbuAlRub, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0273475311420245">Lindholm &amp; Szelényi, 2009</xref>), a mentoring relationship can also help in reducing work-related stress. Mentors may even be viewed as therapists or providers of emotional support.</p>

<title>Empirical Study on Faculty Mentoring in Teaching</title>
<p>Intradepartmental FMIT is a distinct type of mentoring meriting empirical examination of its facilitating factors, hindrances, and rewards. Existing theory suggests that organizational support, knowledge sharing, and managing emotions are important elements in rewarding mentoring. We use a case study to empirically ground these suggestions.</p>
<p>Although, quantitative, cross-sectional and nondyadic data have dominated mentoring research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0273475311420245">Allen et al., 2008</xref>), mentoring relationships are situational and thus best studied in their organizational contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0273475311420245">Clutterbuck &amp; Lane, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0273475311420245">Kammeyrer-Mueller &amp; Judge, 2008</xref>). This study answers the call of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-0273475311420245">Zellers et al. (2008)</xref> and builds on qualitative and dyadic narrative data.</p>
<sec id="section7-0273475311420245">
<title>The Empirical Setting</title>
<p>The study empirically examines intradepartmental FMIT as a part of voluntary studies for a formal pedagogical qualification for higher education teaching. The training program the mentees participated in was co-organized by a European university and a school of vocational teacher education. Both mentors and mentees were marketing teachers. As a part of their teaching practice, mentees designed and executed a bachelor’s- or master’s-level marketing course. It was the first time FMIT had been conducted, so experienced teachers also participated to achieve the pedagogical qualification.</p>
<p>The mentors participated voluntarily and had to be pedagogically qualified teachers. In addition to their mentors, a tutor from the school of teacher education and a coach (M.Sc. Education) from the university were involved in the process (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0273475311420245">Figure 1</xref>). The coach nominated the mentors to be matched with the mentees. The mentors received a small monetary reward and were supported by a mentor training and coaching group. The monthly meetings of the group covered specific themes, such as a mentor’s role, evaluating competence as a mentor, assessing a mentee, and time management.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0273475311420245-fig1.tif"/></fig>
<p>The mentoring started with the mentee’s written plan for the marketing course, including a description of the learning goals, contents, and teaching and evaluation methods. In addition, the plan included a description of the pedagogical solutions the mentee envisaged to enhance both the marketing students’ learning and the mentees’ own professional development. During the course, the mentor observed at least three classes and afterward discussed what had happened during each class with the mentee. Finally, after the course, the mentor officially reported on the mentee’s practice to both the mentee and their tutor.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0273475311420245">
<title>Data Collection and Analysis</title>
<p>The research method chosen is an autobiographical self-study or self-ethnography, commonly used in the development of teacher education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0273475311420245">Bullough &amp; Pinnegar, 2001</xref>) and here applied in a business school setting. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0273475311420245">Alvesson (2003</xref>, p. 174) defines self-ethnography as “a study and a text in which the researcher-author describes a cultural setting to which s/he has a ‘natural access,’ as an active participant.” The method involves both fieldwork conducted as a participant and describing the process in writing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0273475311420245">Alvesson, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>Each author participated in FMIT as either a mentor or mentee. In addition to the aim of contributing to a better understanding of the intradepartmental FMIT, we wanted to develop FMIT in the marketing department. The primary empirical data collected for this insider or participatory action research (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0273475311420245">Coghlan, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0273475311420245">McTaggart, 1991</xref>) consist of personal narratives of the Mentors A and B and Mentees A and B. Hence, the four narratives are autoethnographies of personal experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0273475311420245">Ellis &amp; Bochner, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0273475311420245">Richardson, 2000</xref>, p. 931) that offer a dyadic and insider view on two mentor–mentee relationships (A-A and B-B) and Mentor A’s view on her second mentoring relationship (A-C). Unfortunately, Mentee C changed jobs and therefore was not able to participate in the final study.</p>
<p>A central part of the mentees’ teaching practice was experimentation, reflection, and making notes over the whole practice period. Those reflection notes were the basis for the mentees’ narratives on the mentoring process. The mentors’ notes made during mentoring focused on the coaching meetings and their feedback to their mentees. The narratives about mentors’ experiences with the mentoring process were written retrospectively and were also based on the notes. Thus, the narratives are free stories of the personal experiences of the mentors and mentees. Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0273475311420245">Alvesson (2003</xref>), the participation was later complemented with narratives in a research-focused sense.</p>
<p>To be able to validate context-related claims, we used our insider knowledge of the cultural context (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0273475311420245">Coghlan, 2007</xref>), connecting the everyday aspects of teaching marketing with that of broader organizational agendas and practices of the organization (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0273475311420245">Boyle &amp; Parry, 2007</xref>). Although our university is research focused, both it and the Department of Marketing are at the forefront of the drive to increase the quality and prestige of teaching. In contrast, the school had a more passive role in FMIT.</p>
<p>The inductive analysis of the narratives was conducted by a single researcher (Mentor B). The central themes that arose from the data were <italic>the mentor–mentee relationship, the mentee’s rewards</italic>, and <italic>the mentor’s rewards</italic>. This early analysis of the importance and meanings of the different elements of the main themes was discussed with the other three authors (Mentor A and Mentees A, B) so as to check the analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0273475311420245">McTaggart, 1991</xref>) and reflect on personal interpretations. A second round of analysis was conducted by the same researcher after she had familiarized herself with the existing studies and discussed the theoretical frame with colleagues. The process revealed that not all the facilitators and rewards of mentoring mentioned in the literature were present in the data, leading to a discussion of what was “missing” and why. The central themes are discussed below with emphasis on elements that facilitated or hindered rewarding FMIT.</p>

<sec id="section9-0273475311420245">
<title>Empirical Findings</title>
<p>Although the dyadic data show that both mentees and mentors found mentoring rewarding, it also reveals aspects that they missed in the mentoring process and areas that could be improved. The facilitators of and hindrances to mentoring are discussed below in relation to the organizational level, the mentoring relationship, the mentee, and the mentor.</p>
<sec id="section10-0273475311420245">
<title>Organizational Facilitators and Hindrances</title>
<p>The university supported FMIT by financing the extra working hours that the mentors put into the process. However, compensation is not mentioned in the mentors’ written accounts, and it does not appear to have been a factor in the decision to participate in the process. The mentors’ support group was, however, important for the mentors.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>. . . the mentors’ support group has given very important support. (Mentor A)</p>
<p>It was superb to see so many members of the University staff that were pedagogically qualified and wanted to be part of helping others to join that group. (Mentor B)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Moreover, the marketing department offered support, since Mentor B was the Head of Department, who also encouraged Mentor A to take part in FMIT. Additionally, the mentees could complete the teacher training in the course of their departmental duties. Thus, the absence of school-level support did not hinder mentoring.</p>
<p>On the other hand, although teacher mentoring was part of formal pedagogical training, the mentors felt that the school of vocational teacher education did not offer enough support. Some of the instructions about mentoring were either unavailable or became available too late. This could, to some extent, be expected since mentoring was undertaken for the first time. Moreover, the mentors found that their official role remained somewhat unclear. The tasks of a mentor proved to be more formal than the mentors had expected based on the initial information and their knowledge of corporate mentoring.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>It seems that the role of a mentor is much more official than I am familiar with . . . In the first mentor team meeting, it became very clear that some of the mentors already had too heavy workloads. (Mentor B)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The data revealed that the tutors from the school of vocational teacher education did not have a supporting role in the process. The narratives lack descriptions of the actions of the tutors, indicating that their role was unclear. The mentors expected the tutors to fill the gap in the formal organizational support.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0273475311420245">
<title>Relational Facilitators and Hindrances</title>
<p>First, the commitment and time the mentors invested in the mentoring discussions facilitated the process and produced rewards for both the mentor and mentee. The mentoring relationships consisted of several lengthy discussions dealing with a variety of topics.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>We also talked a lot about the current learning culture. (Mentee A)</p>
<p>We discussed many issues with Mentee A outside the official mentoring discussions. (Mentor A)</p>
<p>The mentor put quite a lot of effort into becoming familiar with <italic>my</italic> course and teaching. (Mentee B)</p>
<p>The thing that I regret now is that I was too busy at the time, as I could not follow more of the mentee’s teaching. (Mentor B)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The data illustrate the mentor’s commitment because the process was more voluntary for the mentors than for the mentees. The mentees were required to take part in mentoring as part of their pedagogical studies, whereas mentors had the option to commit less, since their actions were not evaluated by the teacher-training organization.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the data reveal little about the commitment of the mentees. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0273475311420245">Kram (1985)</xref> advises against very formal mentoring programs because they might result in unfitting and unwanted relationships and a general lack of commitment from both mentors and mentees. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0273475311420245">Noe (1988)</xref> also suggests that formal mentoring produces less interactive and shorter term mentoring than does the informal variety. In our case, the mentoring arrangements were very formal for three reasons. First, the mentoring was compulsory for the mentees as a part of their teaching practice; second, the mentors were recruited by the mentors’ coach to evaluate the mentees; and third, only two mentors were qualified for the task, so the opportunities to find a good fit between the mentor and the mentee were limited. Despite these issues, no mentee or mentor noted a lack of commitment on the mentees’ part or mismatched pairings. The fact that all the mentors and mentees knew each other and could unofficially influence the pairing decreased the potentially negative effects of the formal arrangement.</p>
<p>The second facilitator was the very fact that the participants already knew each other. This was reflected in the atmosphere of the discussions and the class observations. Moreover, the actors had had ongoing discussions about teaching and learning before the mentoring started, in case of the B-B relationship over several years.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>The atmosphere was very encouraging and supportive. (Mentee A)</p>
<p>We had a feeling of equality (Mentor A)</p>
<p>The fact that I knew my mentor well eased the [class observation] situation. (Mentee B)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Third, because of existing personal relationships, the discussion topics were not new and some of the ontological assumptions each individual held about teaching and learning were already known at the beginning of the mentoring relationship. However, when this was not the case, a preliminary discussion of the actors’ understanding of learning and teaching at the university was required.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I was surprised how uncomplicated and open the discussions were, although initially we did look for how to do this. (Mentor A on A-C relationship)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Fourth, the mentoring relationship was easier if the mentee realized that the mentor also appreciated feedback. This reflected equality and openness to mutual knowledge sharing, which also relieved the pressure a mentee might feel to demonstrate perfect teaching.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>My mentor very openly invited me to come [to observe classes] and encouraged me to give feedback. I was shown how important it is for everyone to get feedback. (Mentee B)</p>
<p>This was the first time for me to receive comments from a colleague from observing my teaching in a real situation, which is really valuable. (Mentor B)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0273475311420245">
<title>Mentee’s Rewards and Hindrances</title>
<p>Mentoring and knowledge sharing produced several rewards for the mentees. First, they received concrete suggestions and advice on how to deal with difficult teaching situations. Moreover, some advice could be implemented almost instantaneously, as the first mentoring discussion took place before the mentee started teaching.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I received a lot of good and concrete advice. An outsider often sees the situation very differently. (Mentee A)</p>
<p>Planning the evaluation criteria would have been postponed until the end of the course if the mentor hadn’t reminded me to do it . . . it was nice to get tips before you go wrong. (Mentee B)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Second, since receiving peer feedback on one’s teaching is so rare, the mentees considered getting any as a positive element, and positive feedback helped the mentees to see themselves more clearly as teaching professionals, and it helped them handle their own high expectations of their teaching performance. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-0273475311420245">Skovholt (2001</xref>, p. 139) refers to self determined “good enough” standards as a means to deal with the fact that as a faculty member, you can always do more and do it better.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>When receiving positive feedback, I realized that I might be actually doing a good job, although it doesn’t always feel like it . . . I understood that I cannot influence everything. Each student is also responsible for his/her own learning. (Mentee A)</p>
<p>I feared that I had been too critical and demanding [of the students], but the mentor’s feedback was that I handled the situation really well. (Mentee B)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Finally, the mentees felt that the mentor acted as a channel for relieving their own emotional pressures. We see this benefit of mentoring as only arising if the mentor and mentee trust each other and are committed to the mentoring relationship. That level of trust and commitment might take more time to develop than is possible in mentoring built around a single course lasting from a 5-week period to a semester. However, in this setting, the first (A-A) and the second (B-B) mentor–mentee pairs had a long relationship before the mentoring started and so the benefit was apparent.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Mentoring discussions are a good channel for letting the pressure out, when students’ attitudes towards teaching really sicken you. (Mentee A)</p>
<p>The discussion was very free from pressures, because the course had not yet started, so I felt I could still change many things. (Mentee B)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The two rewards above are connected with the <italic>emotional support</italic> that the mentees received from their mentors. The following quotation from Mentee A illustrates the spirit of the discussions: “I could express my emotions . . . without any kind of anxiety.”</p>
<p>Despite the relaxed and trusting atmosphere, both mentees also expressed feelings of tension, insecurity, and vulnerability. It was an emotional challenge for the mentees to receive and process feedback on their jobs, even from colleagues, as it was the first time the mentors had actually observed the mentees’ course plans and teaching and, according to Mentee B,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0273475311420245">2</xref></sup> “it was quite nail-biting when the mentor was present and observed my teaching.” Moreover, mentees need the skills to handle the feedback, especially comments that relate to their personal working style.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>However, I noticed that the feedback discussions always affected me somehow, even quite severely. It is still difficult for me to be objective when talking about and evaluating my own performance. (Mentee A)</p>
<p>. . . but still, as a teacher trainee I felt quite vulnerable to criticism [during the first observation session] . . . Even the feedback on my persona and conduct, which was at first the most difficult to receive, felt useful afterwards and offered a different view on things. (Mentee B)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The second hindrance relates to the workload of the mentees. Although permitted to use work time for the teacher-training and mentoring discussions, the mentees’ workloads were not generally reduced. Consequently, the mentees needed to either reduce the time they spent on other tasks or attend teacher-training classes in their spare time.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I managed to do my planning at the last minute—I realized that I had planned such a tight schedule for myself that I could barely follow it. (Mentee B)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0273475311420245">
<title>Mentor’s Rewards and Hindrances</title>
<p>The mentors anticipated some personal benefit when considering whether or not to mentor, although their primary motive was to help the mentees. The anticipated benefits related to their own personal growth, and the mentors did indeed develop professionally and learned by reflecting on their own teaching during the mentoring.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Being a mentor has developed me as a teacher and raised my self-esteem as part of the work community . . . It is inevitable that you think about your own way of teaching, why the mentee acted that way and what I would have done in the same situation. This self-reflection continued even after the mentoring was over—The most rewarding aspect has been to watch the mentees’ teaching development and to discuss issues that have preoccupied us both. (Mentor A)</p>
<p>I selfishly thought that I could update my teaching “tools.” It’s been a while since my teacher training, pedagogical courses, and studies of education science and I acknowledge that I do not experiment much if I’m not pushed to. (Mentor B)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The other benefits were unexpected because they arose from the group of mentors. The emotional and practical support received in mentor coaching made the mentoring process more fluent. The meetings also offered a secure place for mentors, where they could acknowledge their uncertainties and receive appreciation for their efforts to improve the quality of teaching at the university. This feeling stems from the fact that in the business school, time and effort put into the development of teaching and learning were not genuinely supported.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>At first we were searching for the way to work, but during the year this team proved to be very important. For all of us the situation was new, and often we discussed very profound and even painful topics. (Mentor A)</p>
<p>It was a relief to hear of other’s experiences and solutions that I could also use with my mentees. I think I spent more hours with the team [than with the mentee]—did I receive more support than my mentee? (Mentor B)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The hindrances that the mentor’s narratives reveal are related to the lack of organizational support for developing teaching in general and to the emotional challenges they faced in the mentor relationships. The marketing department contained only two people who qualified as mentors because the mentors needed to have pedagogical qualifications. Thus, Mentor A was assigned two mentees and Mentor B, three.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0273475311420245">3</xref></sup> Luckily, the timing of the mentees’ practical evaluation differed, so that the mentors could concentrate on one mentee at a time.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>With some hesitation, I accepted the task of being a mentor—I happened to be the only other person with a formal qualification for the job. (Mentor A)</p>
<p>Since so many marketing teachers took part—and only Mentor A and I were pedagogically qualified, I kind of felt that I was obliged to be involved. (Mentor B)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The mentors were uncertain of their own competence, particularly at the beginning of the process when expectations were unclear. Moreover, although the mentor team provided support, the mentors did not receive comprehensive training, such as in giving critical feedback.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>It did quite terrify me at the start to think that I was supposed to guide colleagues with PhDs and much longer careers.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0273475311420245">4</xref></sup>//It is not an easy task for a mentor to give feedback. My emotions during the year ranged from confusion, fear, uncertainty, pride, and joy to being happy for the mentee. (Mentor A)</p>
<p>Luckily my mentee has taught for years at the university, so I didn’t have to worry about spoiling anyone. (Mentor B)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Mentor A was clearly concerned about competence and Mentor B about the influence she might have on her mentee. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0273475311420245">Blackburn, Chapman, and Cameron (1981)</xref> discuss a “cloning phenomenon” where mentors are drawn to select mentees that resemble themselves. However, after expressing her concerns in the mentors’ support group, Mentor B decided to trust the mentees’ subjectivity.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Can it be that by sharing my own experiences of dealing with the same problems that the mentee is facing, I try to guide the mentee to act against her character, in other words act like me? In the end I decided to trust the mentee and her own evaluation of what suits her and what doesn’t. After all, we all do this job with our own personality. (Mentor B)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>In recent years, the workload of faculty members has increased, and both pressures to perform and time pressures were also apparent in the mentors’ narratives. A few mentor group sessions were cancelled because of other tasks. However, although a mentor might have felt unable to invest enough time in the process, mentees felt that their mentor was putting a lot of time and effort in and, as a consequence, were sometimes unhappy with their own time management. The individuals in both roles set themselves quite high standards in their desire to do a good job.</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I was very busy at the time of the mentee’s course. That is why I did not follow more sessions than was mandatory [six hours], and thus I could not really follow the drama loop in the course. (Mentor B)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Although these mentoring relationships took place within a department and one mentor was then the Head of Department, no narrative took up the issue of academic competition or the fear that mentoring could negatively influence one’s career. That suggests that an atmosphere of trust and a desire to improve teaching quality mitigates such negative issues.</p>

<p>The mentors’ provision of support—meaning advice on developing teaching skills, feedback following class observations, and providing a channel for relieving the pressures related to teaching—was the source of the rewards the mentees experienced. The time management issue and emotional challenge in handling feedback were the main hindrances to the mentees. For the mentors, the emotional challenge was related to the unfamiliarity of the mentoring practice in this context, which created insecurity about the mentors’ competence and the mentees’ subjectivity. The support received from the mentees and the organization encouraged the mentors to overcome the time management challenges. The rewards arose from self-reflection, following and observing the mentees, and discussing issues with them and the other mentors.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study described the rewards and pitfalls of intradepartmental FMIT for marketing teachers. Teaching development is a specific context, which emphasizes certain aspects of mentoring. Consequently, the research design stressed the empirical and applied an inductive approach. As a result, three major elements related to rewarding intradepartmental mentoring were identified, organizational support, knowledge sharing in mentoring discussions, and handling emotions in mentoring.</p>
<p>The case highlights two premises concerning organizational support. First, support may come from many people within the university. We found limited organizational support at the school level, but sufficient support at the department and university levels. Second, the actors’ responsibilities may be unspecific, owing to the tradition of academic freedom. Both premises suggest the opportunity to create support teams at various levels and the freedom to choose to work with like-minded colleagues outside departmental borders. On the other hand, echoing the literature (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0273475311420245">Ugrin, Odom, &amp; Pearson., 2008</xref>), our findings reveal a lack of time and resources available for mentoring. Therefore, it seems that to organize and realize FMIT requires the establishment of an official status and permanent support structure.</p>
<p>An existing colleague relationship and a long-term experience of collaboration seemed to provide facilitative conditions both for knowledge sharing and a variety of other rewards for both actors. An existing relationship also helped the parties to clarify their personal assumptions related to teaching and toward each other, which research also recognizes as one of the prerequisites for rewarding mentoring (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0273475311420245">Hawkey, 1998</xref>). However, our experiences suggest that without organizational support, relying on collaborative mentoring relationships will not be sufficient to sustain rewarding FMIT.</p>
<p>An unexpected finding is that our data showed no signs of competition or jealousy despite the intradepartmental context. This counters existing research suggesting that acknowledging that one needs mentoring might be viewed as an inability to perform tasks independently, and that showing weaknesses to a mentor creates vulnerability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0273475311420245">Boice, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0273475311420245">Murray, 2001</xref>). Our FMIT genuinely aimed at developing the actors, instead of evaluating the mentees’ performance and revealed evidence of working collectively and willingly to develop teaching quality. This finding can be understood from its cultural context, where the mentors genuinely aimed at developing the actors. The marketing department shared an atmosphere of communal teaching development without individual competition. Thus, in a supportive micro-environment or organizational culture (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0273475311420245">Arnold, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0273475311420245">Gibson, 2006</xref>), both individual and organizational goals may be achieved simultaneously. Thus, this study supports the view that intradepartmental peer mentoring can be rewarding (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0273475311420245">Harnish &amp; Wild, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0273475311420245">Kilburg &amp; Hancock, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>We identified both emotional benefits and challenges related to mentoring. When focusing on the professional development of marketing teachers, support from colleagues can be highly relevant as it underpins critical thinking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0273475311420245">Brookfield, 1987</xref>), the cornerstone of academic work. A rewarding interaction in the mentoring relationship provides a basis for reflection as a collegial activity, which helps in gaining the “informed collaboration of colleagues” in the ongoing efforts to learn to teach better (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0273475311420245">Moran &amp; Dallat, 1995</xref>, p. 22). In addition, for both parties, mentoring relationships served as a way to relieve teaching-related pressures (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0273475311420245">Bullough &amp; Draper, 2004a</xref>).</p>
<p>Giving and receiving feedback was a major challenge, a finding in line with earlier research (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0273475311420245">Bullough &amp; Draper, 2004a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0273475311420245">Harrison et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0273475311420245">Rippon &amp; Martin, 2003</xref>). University staff typically has twin researcher and teacher roles. As researchers, our studies are exposed to reviews, and we also give feedback as referees. Nevertheless, as we seldom give or receive detailed collegial feedback on our teaching, it remains quite a sensitive topic and difficult to handle. This may also reflect an underdeveloped teacher identity, at least when compared with our identities as researchers. That factor may also be reflected in the mentors’ insecurity about their competence in the role. Organizational support in the form of training and coaching seemed to reduce these challenges, further highlighting the importance of organizational commitment to FMIT.</p>

<title>Practical Implications for Marketing Educators</title>
<p>The lack of <italic>teacher</italic> mentoring in business schools is in sharp contrast with the deployment of mentoring in companies, where 50% to 69 % offer mentoring or coaching to employees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0273475311420245">Boyatzis et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0273475311420245">Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development, 2010</xref>). Limited surveys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0273475311420245">Cunningham, 1999</xref> on Christian College Coalition; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0273475311420245">Schrodt, Stringer Cawyer, &amp; Sanders, 2003</xref> on the National Communication Association members) suggest that roughly 50% of faculty members have received faculty mentoring; however, no data were found on mentoring <italic>in teaching</italic>. This study supports the potential of FMIT as a pedagogical method and the importance of organizational support especially for <italic>teacher</italic> mentoring (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0273475311420245">Boyatzis et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0273475311420245">Moran &amp; Dallat, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>Organizational support and policies motivate potential mentors to take the time to listen, provide advice, serve as a role model, and provide direction to other teachers. For a senior faculty member, mentoring can be a rewarding (albeit a time-consuming) activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0273475311420245">Ugrin et al., 2008</xref>) and therefore, both intangible and concrete forms of support are needed. For a marketing faculty, verbal encouragement, coaching, providing time resources, and rewarding professional development should encourage it to adopt an approach focused on internal customers and co-creation of value (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-0273475311420245">Åkesson &amp; Skålén, 2011</xref>) via FMIT. Moreover, the rewards could be included in performance evaluations in the same way research is recognized, and studying marketing education could be actively supported.</p>
<p>Organizational support is needed to train the mentors to avoid the danger of using FMIT as a management control tool (for studies on POT see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0273475311420245">Blackmore, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0273475311420245">Lomas &amp; Nicholls, 2005</xref>) instead of a development tool. The pilot studied here emphasized the development as a part of pedagogical qualification. Training should focus on specific interaction and feedback skills, which define the atmosphere of the mentoring relationship. The courage and ability to give and receive constructive feedback makes not only the mentoring relationship mutually beneficial, but definitely helps in applying the active (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-0273475311420245">Wright et al., 1994</xref>) and action learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-0273475311420245">Young, 2010</xref>) and authentic assessment practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0273475311420245">Hubball &amp; Burt, 2006</xref>) important in marketing classes.</p>
<p>Committed mentors seemed to feel a great responsibility for the mentee’s professional development. Mentor coaching should provide a place for exchanging experiences and offering and receiving peer support. Although the senior mentor often has authority over the mentee (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0273475311420245">Arnold, 2006</xref>), a more balanced relationship seems to be a good basis for mutually rewarding FMIT. Such a relationship can develop into “coaching with compassion” (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0273475311420245">Boyatzis et al., 2006</xref>), encouraging a mentee to safely express the negative and positive emotions that teaching triggers, without fear of being labeled unprofessional.</p>
<p>Although we suggest that mentoring be a permanent and well-supported feature of organizations, it should nevertheless be a voluntary process, similar to co-creation of value. Forced mentoring would seem to counter the development of the open and trusting atmosphere (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0273475311420245">Fowle, 2000</xref>) essential for knowledge sharing. The knowledge sharing that FMIT enables could even move an individualistic culture into a more collective direction, where FMIT mentees develop into mentors, as has happened in the department studied, and longer term should improve performance in university quality audits and accreditation processes.</p>
<p>Finally, this study suggests that when connected to marketing course planning and execution, FMIT works best. The mentee can apply the advice already when planning the course and thus jointly develop it with the mentor. With the help of FMIT, mentee can safely apply new teaching and learning methods, resulting in both individual and departmental benefits.</p>

<title>Evaluation of the Study and Future Research Suggestions</title>
<p>The challenge of studying our own organization has been, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0273475311420245">Alvesson (2003</xref>) suggested, difficult but rewarding. Taking advantage of the unique access to rich data when studying experiences in the researchers’ own cultural context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0273475311420245">Alvesson, 2003</xref>), the study is enriched by personal experience instead of just addressing impersonal aspects of the organization. Participant researchers gain a profound knowledge of the setting and can use it to analyze the data on insider experiences.</p>
<p>Using autobiographical data requires that we distance ourselves from our own acts, words, and assumptions and those of other colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0273475311420245">Alvesson, 2003</xref>). The present study used both data source and investigator triangulation (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0273475311420245">Denzin, 1989</xref>) to maintain distance. Our different backgrounds and positions in the marketing department and the discussion of individual experiences and interpretations helped us to avoid self-evident interpretations. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0273475311420245">Alvesson (2003</xref>) suggests, we engaged in two reflexive loops of data analysis. These loops also decreased the threat to validity that was created by the fact that both mentors and mentees provided data and coauthored this study.</p>
<p>Self-ethnographic research also involves political aspects. A researcher may be tempted or even pressured by superiors to present the organization in a polished, uncritical, or unfair manner to influence its image (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0273475311420245">Alvesson, 2003</xref>). This study had little need to take organizational politics into account because it was a pilot and involved the Head of Department. The study was supported both at the department and university level and its results were used in developing FMIT in the marketing department.</p>
<p>The results of self-ethnographic or participatory action research seek not statistical but naturalistic generalizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0273475311420245">Alvesson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0273475311420245">Stake, 1995</xref>). Hence, the study’s findings should appeal to readers acquainted with similar kinds of settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0273475311420245">Stake, 1995</xref>) and provide a solution to a problem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0273475311420245">McTaggart, 1991</xref>); accordingly, this study has prompted an FMIT solution for our department.</p>
<p>The rewards acquired from FMIT are only discussed from the actors’ point of view as there was no analysis of the student evaluation of the mentees’ subsequent courses. A new student feedback system was implemented during this study, and it produces mainly quantitative data, which cannot be compared with the qualitative feedback from the same courses the year before. Thus, the influence of FMIT on the quality of teaching as perceived by the marketing students merits more research.</p>
<p>Because of the scarcity of research on intradepartmental FMIT, our research is explorative, and future studies should be conducted in other cultural contexts. A particularly useful avenue would be to examine the facilitators of FMIT more closely; do they differ in different cultural contexts, what is their relative influence and importance, and how can they be enhanced or complemented if missing?</p>
