<bold>Claire Bidart</bold> and <bold>Johanne Charbonneau</bold>, “How to Generate Personal Networks: Issues and Tools for a Sociological Perspective”, <italic>Field Methods</italic> (2011, 23(3): 266-286). The debate on the limits and relevance of the different name generators comes with the development of social network studies. The core questions are: What are they supposed to construct? For what research question? Some procedures tend to choose a precise target with a unique name generator; others prefer to use a series of name generators. The authors discuss some specificities and advantages of these methods for ego-centered networks. The authors then present the “contextual” name generator, which was developed in longitudinal qualitative panel studies in France and Québec. This tool gives access to a great variety of information focused on sociological questions. Its original design differentiates two complementary stages to distinguish the global context-based network from specific resource-based networks. This tool remains flexible and may be adapted to different topics.</p>

Co-authorship links actors at the micro-level of scientists. Through electronic data bases, we now have enough information to compare entire research disciplines over time. We compare the complete longitudinal co-authorship networks for four research disciplines (biotechnology, mathematics, physics and sociology) for 1986–2005. We examined complete bibliographies of all researchers registered at the national Slovene Research Agency. Known hypotheses were confirmed as were three new hypotheses. There were different coauthoring cultures. However, these cultures changed over time in Slovenia. The number of coauthored publications grew much faster than solo authored productions, especially after independence in 1991 and the integration of Slovenian science into broader EU systems. Trajectories of types of co-authorship differed across the disciplines. Using block-modeling, we show how co-authorship structures change in all disciplines. The most frequent form was a core-periphery structure with multiple simple cores, a periphery and a semi-periphery. The next most frequent form had this structure but with bridging cores. Bridging cores consolidate the center of a discipline by giving it greater coherence. These consolidated structures appeared at different times in different disciplines, appearing earliest in physics and latest in biotechnology. In 2005, biotechnology had the most consolidated center followed by physics and sociology. All co-authorship networks expanded over time. By far, new recruits went into either the semi-periphery or the periphery in all fields. Two “lab” fields, biotechnology and physics, have larger semi-peripheries than peripheries. The reverse holds for mathematics and sociology, two “office” disciplines. Institutional affiliations and shared interests all impact the structure of collaboration in subtle ways.</p>

<p>The Fuhse and Mützel article, “Tackling Connections, Structure, and Meaning in Networks: Quantitative and Qualitative Methods in Sociological Network Research” (pp. 1067-1089), will also be of interest to <italic>BMS</italic> readers: The paper systematizes the role of qualitative methods, statistical analyses, and formal network analysis in sociological network research, and argues for their systematic combination. Formal network analysis mainly aims at a description of network structures and at an explanation of the behavior of the network at the systemic level. Formal network analysis can also be used to explain individual behavior or the existence of individual connections from network structure. Statistical analyses of ego-centered networks are used to correlate individual attributes with the structure and composition of the individual embeddedness, thus providing a statistical explanation of network effects and determinants. Qualitative methods are important for exploring network structures, and for understanding the meaning connected to them. A historical overview shows that these three strands have long co-existed in sociological network research without engaging in combined research efforts. Combinations of these methods prove useful when considering the various aspects of networks (individual connections, structural patterns, and meaning).</p>

<bold>Tom A</bold>. <bold>B</bold>. <bold>Snijders</bold>, “Statistical Models for Social Networks”, <italic>Annual Review of Sociology</italic> (2011, 37: 131-153). Statistical models for social networks as dependent variables must represent the typical network dependencies between tie variables such as reciprocity, homophily, transitivity, etc. This review first treats models for single (cross-sectionally observed) networks and then for network dynamics. For single networks, the older literature concentrated on conditionally uniform models. Various types of latent space models have been developed: for discrete, general metric, ultrametric, Euclidean, and partially ordered spaces. Exponential random graph models were proposed long ago, but now are applied more and more thanks to the non-Markovian social circuit specifications that were recently proposed. Modeling network dynamics is less complicated than modeling single network observations because dependencies are spread out in time. For modeling network dynamics, continuous-time models are more fruitful. Actor-oriented models here provide a model that can represent many dependencies in a flexible way. Strong model development is now going on to combine the features of these models and to extend them to more complicated outcome spaces.</p>

A Game Theoretic Approach”, <italic>Social Networks</italic> (2011, 33(3): 191-200). In this paper, we define a family of centrality measures for directed social networks from a game theoretical point of view. We follow the line started in a previous paper and, besides the definition, we obtain a characterization of the measures and an additive decomposition in three summands that can be interpreted in terms of emission, betweenness and reception centrality components.</p>

In this note, the Cramer-Rao lower bound of variance by using the two decks of cards in randomized response sampling has been developed. The lower bound of variance has been compared with the recent estimator proposed by Odumade and Singh at equal protection of respondents. Real practical face-to-face interview data collected using two decks of cards has been analyzed and the results are discussed.</p>
