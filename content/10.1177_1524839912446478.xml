<p><italic>Introduction</italic>. Most of the U.S. population is affiliated with faith-based organizations (FBOs) and regularly attends services. Health and wellness activities (HWA) delivered through FBOs have great potential for reach, but the number of FBOs offering health programs and the characteristics of these programs are currently unknown. The purpose of this study was to better understand rates, characteristics, and factors influencing faith-based HWA across the United States. <italic>Method</italic>. Faith leaders (<italic>N</italic> = 844) completed an online survey assessing faith leader demographics and health, FBO demographics (e.g., denomination, size, location, diversity), and details of HWA within their FBO. <italic>Results</italic>. Respondents were primarily White (93%), male (72%), middle-aged (53.2 ± 12.1 years), and affiliated with Methodist (42.5%) or Lutheran (20.2%) denominations. Although most faith leaders report meeting physical activity recommendations (56.5%), most were overweight/obese (77.4%), did not meet fruit and vegetable recommendations (65.9%), and had been diagnosed with 1.25 ± 1.36 chronic diseases. Respondents reported offering 4.8 ± 3 HWA within their FBO over the past 12 months. Most common HWA included clubs/teams related to physical activity (54.8%), individual-level health counseling (54%), and providing health/wellness pamphlets. Leaders cited a lack of lay leadership (48.1%) and financial resources for staff time (47.8%) as the most common barriers to HWA. An increase in interest/awareness in health topics from FBO members was the most common facilitator for HWA (66.5%). <italic>Conclusion</italic>. Although faith-based HWA are prevalent nationally, types of HWA and the factors influencing HWA are dependent on FBO characteristics. Future faith-based interventions should consider existing capabilities and moderating factors for HWA.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In the United States, preventable chronic disease has significant negative consequences for quality of life, life expectancy, and the economy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1524839912446478">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services [USDHHS], 2010</xref>). As outlined in Healthy People 2010, public health strategies to reduce chronic disease need to employ multilevel interventions (e.g., policy, environment, community settings, individual) to have large and broad impact on the nation’s health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1524839912446478">USDHHS, 2010</xref>). Specifically, partnerships formed with social institutions such as health care settings, schools, worksites, and faith-based organizations (FBOs) allow for large reach and implementation of culturally appropriate and tailored health programming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1524839912446478">Bopp &amp; Fallon, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Health programming through FBOs provides many benefits, including long-standing, trusting relationships with community members; cultural sensitivity; and access to community services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1524839912446478">Ammerman et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1524839912446478">Lasater, Carleton, &amp; Wells, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1524839912446478">Peterson, Atwood, &amp; Yates, 2002</xref>). According to the Pew Forum for Religion in the Public Life, nearly 80% of the U.S. population reports an association with a Christian faith, of whom 39% attend religious services once a week and an additional 33% attend monthly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1524839912446478">Pew Research Center, 2008</xref>). This potential for reach and long-term sustainability of health programs is perhaps the most compelling rationale for partnering with FBOs for health promotion.</p>
<p>In a literature review, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1524839912446478">DeHaven, Hunter, Wilder, Walton, and Berry (2004)</xref> found strong support for delivering health programs through FBOs, targeting a variety of health conditions and behaviors. Since DeHaven et al.’s review, several faith-based health programs have provided empirical evidence of their ability to influence health attitudes and behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1524839912446478">Bopp, Fallon, &amp; Marquez, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1524839912446478">Resnicow et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1524839912446478">Whitt-Glover, Hogan, Lang, &amp; Heil, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1524839912446478">Wilcox et al., 2007</xref>). Literature addressing the effectiveness of faith-based initiatives provides persuasive rationale for partnering with these community institutions for a greater public health impact.</p>
<p>As evidenced by the above information, FBOs are excellent settings for reaching large groups, though the number of FBOs delivering health promotion programs and the quantity or type of programming is currently unknown. Documenting the national prevalence and characteristics of existing FBO health programs will provide significant insight for health promotion professionals to effectively engage FBOs to plan, develop, implement, and evaluate health programs. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to better understand health and wellness activities (HWA) among FBOs nationwide. Specifically, we documented (a) estimates of the national prevalence of FBOs offering HWA, (b) common types of HWA, (c) characteristics of these programs, and (d) commonly reported barriers and facilitators of FBO HWA.</p>

<sec id="section2-1524839912446478" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>An online survey system (Axio Learning Systems, Manhattan, Kansas) was used to conduct a cross- sectional study examining faith-based health and wellness programming. This survey was approved by the institutional review board.</p>
<sec id="section3-1524839912446478">
<title>Recruitment</title>
<p>A convenience sample of faith leaders from across the United States was collected. Based on Pew Forum data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1524839912446478">Pew Research Center, 2008</xref>), we identified the top three most common religious denominations for each state. Subsequently, we searched for Internet websites representing that denomination’s state-level organization, conference, or diocese. These websites allowed us to gather e-mail addresses for faith leaders (e.g., pastor, priest), secondary leaders (e.g., associate pastors), and administrative professionals, resulting in 13,644 unique e-mail addresses.</p>
<p>The data collection period was March to December 2009. During this time, we sent an initial e-mail invitation requesting participation in “A Survey on Faith and Health.” This e-mail explained the purpose of the survey, assured confidentiality, indicated that it would take approximately 15 minutes to complete, and provided a link to the survey. To increase response rates, respondents were given a chance to enter a drawing for prizes at the end of the survey and two e-mail reminders were sent 2 to 3 weeks after the initial invitation e-mail.</p>
<p>Some initial e-mails were returned as undeliverable (<italic>n</italic> = 1,468; 10.7%), resulting in 12,176 eligible respondents. During the data collection period, 1,012 people electronically accessed the survey, and 844 individuals completed the survey. Thus, 6.9% of the eligible recipients (defined as those whose e-mails were apparently delivered) completed the survey. It is important to note, however, that this is an overly conservative response rate as the e-mails may have been diverted to spam or sent to defunct but functioning e-mail accounts. Furthermore, of those accessing the survey, 83.4% completed it.</p>

<title>Measures</title>
<sec id="section5-1524839912446478">
<title>Faith leader demographic and health information</title>
<p>Faith leaders reported their age, sex, racial/ethnic group, and education level; their primary responsibility at the FBO (e.g., primary leader, secondary leader, etc.); if they were employed full time or part time, and the length of time they had been a faith leader. Using the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System physical activity module (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1524839912446478">Centers for Disease Control Prevention, 2010</xref>), participants were asked to report on their frequency of participation in moderate- and vigorous-intensity physical activity and minutes/week. The number of daily fruits and vegetables consumed was also assessed. Participants reported their chronic health conditions and height and weight (for calculating body mass index [BMI]). Perceived health status was assessed with a single item using a 5-point Likert-type scale (1 = <italic>excellent</italic> to 5 = <italic>poor</italic>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1524839912446478">
<title>Faith organization information</title>
<p>Respondents reported their FBO’s zip code, church/congregation size, racial/ethnic diversity of the congregation, and religious affiliation. Zip codes were matched with region, states, and counties, and the county’s Rural–Urban Continuum (RUC) code was assigned and categorized as urban (RUC codes 1-3), nonmetro (RUC codes 4-6), or rural (RUC codes 7-9; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1524839912446478">Nance et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1524839912446478">U.S. Department of Agriculture, 2008</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1524839912446478">
<title>Health and wellness activities</title>
<p>Participants reported their FBO’s health-related activities in the past year, including action-oriented programs (clubs/teams related to physical activity, individual counseling about health, educational classes about health, screenings for health conditions, hands-on instruction about health, group counseling about health, or health fairs) and providing educational materials (health pamphlets, bulletin boards, inclusion of health and wellness information in church materials, health library, instruction about health and wellness as a part of other church classes). The sum of these materials and activities was calculated. The faith leaders also self-reported their role in initiating or organizing the action-oriented programs by selecting one of the following options: initiated and overseen by myself, initiated by myself and overseen by others, initiated by others and overseen by myself, or initiated and overseen by others. Leaders were considered to be involved in the activity if they indicated one of the first three options.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1524839912446478">
<title>Barriers and facilitators to faith-based health programming</title>
<p>Using a six-item measure, participants indicated whether various barriers influenced HWA on a 5-point Likert-type scale (1 = <italic>not a barrier</italic> at all to 5 = <italic>a very large barrier</italic>). Specifically, these barriers were lack of financial resources, lack of interest, lack of lay leadership, leadership does not believe that health and wellness should be addressed at the FBO, and competition for time and space with other institutional activities. A summary score was created, with possible scores ranging from 6 to 30. Participants also indicated (yes/no) whether various factors would be useful for motivating the FBO to increase HWA. Specifically, these facilitators were additional trainings, financial resources, and interest/awareness from congregation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1524839912446478">
<title>Perceived health concerns of faith institution</title>
<p>Faith leaders were asked to select what they perceived as the top five health concerns for members of their FBO from a list that included several chronic diseases and conditions (e.g., heart disease, cancer, diabetes, stress) and special populations (e.g., child or maternal health).</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1524839912446478">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>Basic descriptive statistics and frequencies were used to describe the faith leader characteristics, faith organization characteristics, health program characteristics, and influences on programming. All analyses were conducted with the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences Version 17.0.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1524839912446478">Table 1</xref> provides the characteristics of the faith leader sample. Participants (<italic>n</italic> = 844) were primarily White, male, middle-aged, and serving as the primary (72.9%) or secondary (17.8%) leader at their FBO. Respondents most often reported that their FBO was affiliated with Methodist (41.1%) or Lutheran (20.4%) denominations. For the purposes of comparison, denominations were collapsed into the top five categories (Methodist, Lutheran, Catholic, Baptist, and United Church of Christ/Congregational), whereas the remaining denominations were placed in an “Other” category: Episcopal (<italic>n</italic> = 16), Church of Christ (<italic>n</italic> = 6), Free Evangelical (<italic>n</italic> = 15), Assembly of God (<italic>n</italic> = 2), Nondenominational (<italic>n</italic> = 7), Jewish (<italic>n</italic> = 5), African Methodist Episcopal (<italic>n</italic> = 1), Presbyterian (<italic>n</italic> = 14), Christian (<italic>n</italic> = 1), and Church of the Nazarene (<italic>n</italic> = 3). FBOs were medium sized (100-500 members), with little diversity (&gt;90% White) and located in urban areas within Midwestern United States.</p>

<p>Most faith leaders perceived their health to be very good or excellent (55.9%). The majority (56.5%) of individuals reported meeting current physical activity guidelines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1524839912446478">Haskell et al., 2007</xref>), and 44.2% reported consuming five or more fruits and vegetables daily. Based on BMI data, 77.4% were overweight or obese, with a mean BMI of 29.67 ± 6.03 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. Respondents reported 1.25 ± 1.36 chronic health conditions.</p>
<p>On average, leaders reported 4.65 ± 3.24 HWA at their FBO (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1524839912446478">Table 2</xref>). For action-oriented activities, FBOs reported offering clubs or teams related to physical activity (54.8%) and individual-level counseling related to health and wellness (54%) most often. The most commonly available educational activity was access to health and wellness pamphlets or brochures (48.9%; see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1524839912446478">Table 3</xref>). Most faith leaders reported low levels of involvement in the action-oriented activities, except for individual-level health counseling where 71% of faith leaders reported that they were directly involved (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1524839912446478">Table 3</xref>). Leaders reported (in order of importance) that heart disease, cancer prevention, diabetes, high blood pressure, and stress were significant health concerns for their congregations.</p>

<p>The types of action-oriented HWA offered differed by congregation size, urban/rural location, and denomination (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1524839912446478">Table 4</xref>). Small institutions reported individual counseling for health and wellness (43.6%) as their most common activity, whereas medium (52.5%), large (70.6%), and extra-large (74.6%) FBOs reported clubs/teams as their most common HWAs for physical activity. Urban FBOs indicated that clubs/teams for physical activity (59.6%) were the most common activity, whereas nonmetropolitan (54.8%) and rural FBOs (44.4%) reported individual counseling as their most common activity. Methodists (53.4%), Baptists (66.7%), and Lutherans (63%) reported clubs/teams for physical activity as their most common activity. Catholics (60.2%) reported health screenings were the most common activity, and United Church of Christ/ congregational (75%) and Other denominations (50%) reported that individual counseling were the most common activities they offered. For all categories, the most common educational activity reported was having health- or wellness-related pamphlets or leaflets.</p>

In small and medium churches, a lack of lay leadership was a commonly cited barrier to HWA. Large institutions reported a lack of financial resources for staff time for activities most often, and extra-large institutions frequently reported a competition for time and space with other institutional activities as a barrier. Rural and nonmetropolitan churches also indicated a lack of lay leadership was a common barrier, whereas urban institutions reported their main barrier was a lack of financial resources for staff time for activities or programs. Among Methodists, Lutherans, United Church of Christ/Congregational, and Other denominations, a lack of lay leadership was most often mentioned, whereas Catholics frequently cited a lack of financial resources for staff time or programs and Baptists referred to a competition for time and space with other institutional activities as the most frequent barriers. For motivating factors, leaders frequently cited improved interest awareness from their congregation/membership would result in more programming (66.5%).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Faith-based health promotion research has been very successful for improving health attitudes and behaviors for numerous health behaviors and health/disease outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1524839912446478">DeHaven et al., 2004</xref>). Most of this research has high internal validity and provides excellent detailed accounts of program implementation and process evaluation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1524839912446478">Peterson et al., 2002</xref>). Some limitations to this field, however, are (a) the majority of faith-based research has been limited to churches within relatively close geographical proximity to one another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1524839912446478">DeHaven et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1524839912446478">Peterson et al., 2002</xref>), (b) the majority of research uses churches/ participants representing homogenous religious affiliations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1524839912446478">DeHaven et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1524839912446478">Peterson et al., 2002</xref>), and (c) there is little empirical data informing public health professionals of factors influencing the translation of faith-based health promotion research into practice. Thus, the current study is important because it is the first to offer a national perspective on faith leader health and health behaviors, the quantity and types of faith-based HWA, and common factors influencing faith-based health programming across the United States. Given the significant public health potential for FBOs to reach and influence millions of individuals in the United States, the results of this study are immensely important for public health professionals interested in developing and/or facilitating the reach, adoption, implementation, and sustainability of faith-based HWA.</p>
<p>Our findings suggest different types of activities, level of faith leader involvement, and barriers for HWA, across FBO size, urban/rural location, and denomination. Thus, practitioners engaging FBOs should consider how these factors will influence the process by which they choose to engage FBOs, and the types of HWA implemented within the FBO. An extensive formative research plan should address the likely barriers and facilitators found among various FBOs, as these will affect the reach, adoption, implementation, and sustainability of HWAs.</p>
<p>With regard to the most common types of HWA, individual-level counseling for health and clubs/teams related to physical activity were the most common action-oriented programs, whereas offering health- or wellness-related pamphlets was the most common educational activity. Individual-level counseling for health is a natural fit for FBOs, given that faith leaders or FBO staff are often called on to counsel in other times of crisis and have developed and adapted counseling skills for this setting. This suggests that FBOs with no HWA offerings or those interested in increasing the number of HWA offerings may be most interested in starting with these kinds of programs. Future research should consider online websites for the delivery of faith-based health education pamphlets and training materials to increase proficiency in health-related individual/small-group counseling.</p>
<p>Many studies have noted the importance of involving the key faith leader for program success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1524839912446478">Bopp et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1524839912446478">Campbell et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1524839912446478">DeHaven et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1524839912446478">Demark-Wahnefried et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1524839912446478">Peterson et al., 2002</xref>). Our results corroborate these findings such that faith leader involvement was minimal in most HWA activities. One exception to this finding, however, was high levels of faith leader involvement in individual-level health counseling, which may be similar to or highly integrated with their primary role as a counselor for the congregation’s spiritual and emotional needs. This finding suggests there may be a high degree of reach, implementation, adoption, and sustainability for the following intervention channels: (a) combining health-oriented information and counseling skills with the instruction seminary schools provide on spiritual/ emotional counseling strategies and techniques, (b) engaging FBO annual conferences to conduct trainings to deliver individual/small-group health counseling, and (c) offering online trainings for the delivery of individual/small-group health counseling.</p>
<p>Smaller FBOs and those located in nonmetropolitan and rural areas cited a lack of lay leadership as a significant barrier to HWA. Among smaller FBOs, it seems likely to overburden the few volunteers who are willing and able to coordinate complex HWA. Rural FBOs may face similar difficulties in enlisting lay volunteers for delivering activities since they are more likely to draw from larger geographical areas, resulting in large travel/time constraints. Therefore, among smaller and rural churches, disseminating previously developed materials from trusted organizations (e.g., American Heart Association, National Cancer Institute) would be the most logical HWA to accommodate the limited time of FBO leaders and lay volunteers. The development of online health and wellness resources could also be a viable option for these congregations, providing a greater potential reach within the FBO with less financial or personnel input. Additionally, it may be beneficial to facilitate the collaboration of several small or rural FBOs to combine resources, thereby maximizing access to faith-based health programming for minimal effort/resource cost of individual FBOs.</p>
<p>Faith leaders reported that a lack of lay leadership and a lack of financial resources were the main barriers to delivering HWA at their FBO. Most felt that improved congregation interest for health would be a significant motivator to overcome these barriers. This presents an opportunity for faith leader skills education/training, addressing recruitment and retention of volunteers as a part of a health ministry/committee or increasing interest among FBO members for health and wellness topics. Workshops, seminars, or conferences on motivating church volunteers for health education/promotion or seeking grant funding could provide some ideas or strategies that could be effective. Additionally providing some instruction in seminary school on motivating the congregation may result in a comprehensive strategy for reaching a large portion of faith leaders. Considering the many roles and responsibilities of a faith leader, their ability to directly oversee the initiation and coordination of HWA may be limited, though their verbal and resource allocation support seems crucial for the success of HWA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1524839912446478">Demark-Wahnefried et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1524839912446478">Peterson et al., 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite the substantial contributions of this study, a number of limitations must be noted. First, some religions/denominations and states were better than others at offering viable contact information for faith leaders, limiting recruitment to individuals who (a) had an FBO website offering contact information, (b) had a current e-mail address specifically for the faith leader (and not an FBO administrator, or general church e-mail address), and (c) filtered our e-mail invitation into their inbox, rather than junk mail or spam mailboxes. Second, there was a volunteer bias, such that individuals motivated or interested enough to access and complete the survey were likely those individuals with positive perceptions of the link between spiritual and physical health and who offered HWA at their FBO. However, our study sample is representative of faith leaders nationwide. Among the two largest denominations in our study, Methodists and Lutherans, the majority of faith leaders nationwide are male, between the ages of 35 and 60 years, and White (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1524839912446478">Lewis Center for Church Leadership, 2006</xref>), which speaks to the generalizability of our results. Third, this was a self-report survey and therefore subject to self-report bias and the perceptions of a single individual within a FBO. Fourth, the cross-sectional study design is limited in our ability to determine predictors of FBO HWA and/or fluctuations in HWA over time. Future research would benefit from random-sampling procedures and providing increased incentives for participation for a better response rate.</p>
<p>In conclusion, this study provides public health professionals with valuable knowledge of national trends in faith-based health and wellness programming. The current reach and implementation rates of HWA among U.S. FBOs are substantial and warrant increased attention from researchers and practitioners interested in chronic disease prevention via evidence-based practice. Future investigations may include a more in-depth assessment of the demographics of congregation as well as the effectiveness of FBO HWA impact on health behaviors and health outcomes. There is little doubt, however, that HWA offered at FBOs have great potential to positively affect public health by offering education and activities to millions of individuals.</p>
