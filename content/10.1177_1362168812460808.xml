<abstract>
<p>Submissions to conferences can provide rich material for analysing characteristics and trends within a conference’s history and that of similar conferences, as well as the associated field at large. The present study uses data gathered over 30 years from a language teachers’ conference in Japan (JALT National) to expound upon patterns related to (1) strands and themes, (2) methodological and topical trends over time, (3) influential researchers, and (4) how JALT compares to other major language teaching conferences. The findings emerged from frequency counts, keyword searches and a detailed analysis of JALT’s digital archive, which focused on presenters’ abstract titles and abstracts consisting of a one-million-plus-word corpus. Beyond the content analysis of the conference under study, the use of the review study as a method for a broader understanding of how conferences both reflect and impact the field is discussed.</p>

<title>I Introduction</title>
<p>Conferences are venues where scholars gather to share their ideas with peers and to seek feedback. These gatherings, which bring hundreds or even thousands of members of a given field together, are held at regular intervals, each of which serves as a benchmark for the community it serves. Huge sums of money are spent and an enormous amount of time is expended not only by organizing committees but also collectively by the participants who conduct research, prepare their talks, gather funding and travel to conferences. In sum, conferences are eventful occasions that occupy a significant place in most scholars’ schedules. The present study, which uses data gathered from a conference on language teaching in Japan marking its 35th year, serves as a case study of how a survey of conference materials can shed light on an organizational body as well as its associated discipline.</p>
<p>Members of each scholarly community usually have a choice of conferences when deciding where to submit a paper, and this is often dictated by multiple forces, including the perceived quality of the conference, the location, the plenary speakers, the acceptance rate, and the like. Because scholars have a choice of where to submit their paper, in order to remain viable, conferences must broadly reflect the interests in a field at a given time. In this sense, when conference criteria, such as strands, are examined over time, they can reveal trends in a profession. Likewise, abstract submissions to conferences represent a bank of material that reflect the extant interests and knowledge in a field; they can also hold the names of scholars who have the most influence, at a particular moment in time. Therefore, the total corpus of materials related to a conference – i.e. the organizational criteria, plus submission titles and abstracts – represent a dataset that can be mined for painting a larger picture about a field, both at a certain time, as well as over a time period.</p>
<p>When such material is gathered and analysed as a survey, it is often referred to as a ‘review study’. The review study is a well-established way to broaden and deepen understanding in a field. In essence, review studies investigate existing bodies of research looking for patterns beyond a limited specific situation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1362168812460808">Torraco, 2005</xref>). Systematic reviews or meta-analyses in the health sciences, for example, are conducted in order to assess myriad findings about medical treatments for a given disease with the goal of suggesting best practices. In the field of education, one of the earliest and most famous was Glass and Smith’s meta-analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1362168812460808">1979</xref>) of 725 studies comparing class size with quality of schooling. This study, which suggested that reduced class size is associated with better achievement, beyond providing strong evidence for its main conclusion, also illustrated the power of the review study. The mention of class size and methodology here is a reminder that review studies require a distinct focus given the enormous amount of data available for review. In the present study, data from one conference over a period of years is processed and analysed with a particular focus on areas of interest (themes and strands), degree of empiricism and topical nature, influential researchers, as well as how the conference compares with other similar ones. While review studies that synthesize findings about health care and schooling often make suggestions about best practices, other such studies synthesize past studies in order to ‘reveal the depth and diversity of the literature’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1362168812460808">Chaudron, 2001</xref>, p. 58) or serve as a summary of where a given field has been, and to project where it may head.</p>
<p>Several review studies in language teaching have been published over the past few years, most, if not all of which, surveyed journal articles and other written documents such as book chapters and doctoral theses. Many of these have examined trends in research methodology, largely noting the increase of empirical studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1362168812460808">Stapleton &amp; Collett, 2010</xref>) and, among empirical studies, the growing increase in qualitative studies relative to quantitative ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1362168812460808">Benson, Chik, Gao, Huang, &amp; Wang, 2009</xref>; Ellis, 2005; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1362168812460808">Gao, Li, and Lu, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1362168812460808">Lazeraton, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1362168812460808">Lazeraton, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1362168812460808">Magnan, 2005</xref>). Beyond research methodology, review studies in language teaching have covered a myriad of areas, such as effectiveness of L2 instruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1362168812460808">Norris &amp; Ortega, 2000</xref>); effectiveness of written corrective feedback (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1362168812460808">Ferris, 2010</xref>); and the effects of L2 instruction on interlanguage pragmatic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1362168812460808">Jeon &amp; Kaya, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Although reviews of journals and their contents have become standard practice within a field, the literature reveals very few reviews of conferences. On the one hand, this may be considered understandable because, compared to journal articles and the like, conference presentations generally rank lower in terms of academic achievement; they also have higher rates of acceptance and their findings have yet to be subject to rigorous peer review. For example, for many conferences, only an abstract is required for vetting. On the other hand, data from conferences, unlike journals, can shed light on various aspects of a given membership and, to a certain extent, its associated discipline, which a review of journals and their articles cannot. Information on the number of submissions and acceptances, for example, can be used by organizers of future conferences to make decisions about how to position the event in terms of areas of interest, not to mention the success of locales. Similarly, an analysis of abstract submissions can indicate trends in research themes and methodologies over the time period surveyed. If it is true that research presented in conference proceedings precedes research in journals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1362168812460808">Becker, Ibragimova, &amp; Jones, 2004</xref>), trends noted in conference submissions may be precursors of directions in a given field. Because areas of interest are usually stated in the call for papers as distinct categories, often called ‘strands’, their emergence and disappearance can be taken as indicators of trends in the field which are much more difficult to attain from a review of journal articles. Likewise, a corpus analysis of abstract submissions over time has the potential to reveal trends in a field. Accordingly, in the present study, data from one conference JALT (Japan Association for Language Teaching), were collected and analysed in order to address the following questions:</p>

<title>II JALT conference</title>
<p>In this article, because of ready access to the historical records of one longstanding language teaching conference in Japan,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1362168812460808">1</xref></sup> I have chosen this conference for analysis. While the choice of a regional-level conference for analysis may not be the most obvious one, the access to data is critical for noting trends in both quantitative and qualitative senses. More to the point, one of the main purposes of the present study is to highlight methodological possibilities for assessing trends in the field via conference data.</p>
<p>The first JALT conference was held in 1975 in Odawara near Tokyo, although at that time the conference was known as ‘TEFL Conference 1975’. It was not until 1980 that the acronym ‘JALT’ appeared under the conference name. While the first conference had only 40 attendees, in the following years, significant growth often occurred from one year to the next, and by the eleventh conference 1,600 participants were on hand. In the late 1990s, attendance surpassed 2,000 for several years running; however, recently conference numbers have been ranging from 1,500 to 2,000. Digital records of presentation titles and their associated year and strand date back to 1978, comprising 12,524 presentations; however, the digital archive of all submitted abstracts (250 words) dates back only to 2003. In recent years the acceptance rate of submitted proposals has been in the range of 50–60%.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1362168812460808" sec-type="methods">
<title>III Method</title>
<p>In order to answer the research questions above, I classified strands according to themes on a database of presentation titles and their associated strand from the JALT conference dating from 1978 to 2010. This was done by a process in which strands were first grouped according to their general nature – i.e. skills-oriented, language acquisition oriented, research-oriented etc. – and then upon these, broad categories, called themes, were determined. In addition, frequency counts using a concordancer were performed on strategically chosen keywords related to research methodology and topical nature found in a database of accepted abstracts (maximum 250 words) in a digital archive from 2003 to 2010 and abstract titles from 1978 to 2010. A count of frequently mentioned researchers was also performed on the corpus of abstracts from 2003 to 2010. Comparisons were also made with other major language teaching conferences with regard to themes and strands.</p>

<title>1 Themes and strands</title>
<p>The areas of interest, or strands, on offer at a conference are one way to understand the prevailing concerns and issues in a given field. Similar to many conferences, potential presenters at JALT are asked to designate a strand that aligns with the content of their talk. In the case of the JALT conference, the first appearance of strands was in 1978 at the fourth annual meeting. The fact that strands appeared at this stage is an indication of the field’s self-organization. Before this, submissions were not categorized. However, as 1978 was a formative year with a total of only 71 presentations, I combined the years, 1978–80, to represent the early themes and strands. In total, 39 strands appeared over those three years and these are categorized according to theme below (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1362168812460808">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<fn id="table-fn1-1362168812460808"><p><italic>Note</italic>. * Study Abroad has been included under this strand because its purpose is chiefly viewed as being for student language improvement.</p></fn>
</table-wrap-foot></table-wrap>
<p>In order to organize the three-dozen-plus strands into more manageable categories, I developed broader themes. The theme that appeared to encompass the most strands was designated ‘Language Skills and Classroom Content’. In 1978–80, eleven strands appear under this theme: Business, Culture, Grammar, ESP (English for Specific Purposes), Listening, Literature, Pronunciation, Reading, Speaking, Vocabulary and Writing. A second theme that emerged was ‘Classroom pedagogy’, which includes Activities/Games, Audio-Visual Aids, CLL (Community Language Learning), Drama and Music, Large Classes, Materials, Methodology, Notional-Functional, Silent Way, Suggestopedia and TPR (Total Physical Response). Another group of strands was categorized under the theme ‘Academic/Research’. These included Applied Linguistics, Curriculum Development, Discourse Analysis, Language Acquisition, Research, Sociolinguistics, Teacher Education, and Testing and Evaluation. Three strands were related to a theme called ‘Level of Learner’: Teaching Children, JSHS (Junior and Senior High school), and College and University Educators (post-secondary). Finally, there were three strands under the ‘Administration’ theme: Employment, Language Programs and Non-teaching Content. Finally, one strand stood on its own: JSL (Japanese as a Second Language).</p>
<p>When this list is compared to the most recent one over 30 years later (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1362168812460808">Table 1</xref>), both considerable differences and similarities are noted. Again, the theme ‘Language Skills and Classroom Content’ remains, composed of the following strands: Business English, Culture, ESP, Extensive Reading, Listening, Pronunciation, Reading, Speaking, Study Abroad,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1362168812460808">2</xref></sup> Vocabulary and Writing. Here, there appears to be little change, although Grammar has disappeared and Vocabulary has been added. The second most important theme (based on the number of strands over 30 years ago) was Classroom Pedagogy. However, in 2010, strands representing this theme appear to have greatly declined in importance, although it may be argued that Audio-Visual Aids, classified under Language Pedagogy 30 years earlier, has been replaced by Language and Technology. The third theme, Academic/Research, includes versions of several of the original strands: Sociolinguistics, Teacher Education and Testing and Evaluation; however, two have disappeared based on the original classification: Applied Linguistics, and Curriculum; while eight more have been added: Bilingualism, Corpus, Gender Awareness, Global Issues, Learner Development, Motivation, Pragmatics and Professional Development. As for the Level of Learner, this theme has largely been appropriated to another level of the submission process, although Teaching Children remains under another strand title: Elementary and Pre-school. The Administration theme, which originally contained two strands, presently appears to have been conflated to one: Administration, Management, and Employment Issues. Conversely, while JSL remains among the recent conference strands, another similar strand has appeared: Languages Other than English or Japanese. Finally, I could not usefully associate three other new strands – Framework and Language Portfolio, Materials Writing and Design, and Teachers Helping Teachers – with any of my original macro-categories.</p>
<p>Data also existed for the numbers of presentations made under each of the strands for each year. Since the number of presentations was quite small during the early years of JALT, the three years 1978–80 were combined (<italic>n</italic> = 242) in order to capture a fuller picture of the early years (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1362168812460808">Figure 1</xref>), while only one year, 2010 (<italic>n</italic> = 546), is displayed for the most recent conference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1362168812460808">Figure 2</xref>). Briefly, these figures reveal that two themes – Classroom Pedagogy and Language Skills – dominated the content of presentations (collectively over two-thirds of presentations) in the early years. Moreover, under this theme the ‘humanistic’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1362168812460808">Johnson, 2008</xref>) or ‘designer’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1362168812460808">Nunan, 1989</xref>) methods – i.e. CLL, Silent Way, Suggestopedia, TPR – accounted for over 10% of the presentations. However, in the 2010 conference, although Speaking and Communication was the most ascribed strand, the second most popular strand was Teacher Education, whose earlier counterpart, Teacher Development, was well down the list 30 years previously. Likewise, Learner Development and Motivation were the third and sixth most prevalent strands in 2010; however, these cognitive-oriented strands did not exist 30 years ago. Other notable changes include the advance of writing from the least to the most popular of the four core skills. Similarly, Testing and Vocabulary received little attention 30 years ago, but in 2010 these two strands ranked seventh and eighth respectively, together accounting for 13% of all presentations.</p>

In the former year there were 492 presentations, while in the latter, 546, roughly an 11% increase. Taking the word ‘data’ for illustrative purposes, there was an increase in frequency from 74 instances in 2003 to 178 in 2010, almost double the frequency.

<title>3 Comparisons with other major conferences</title>
<p>Considerable convergence among conferences with strong ties to second and foreign language teaching, such as American Association of Applied Linguistics (AAAL), Association Internationale de Linguistique Appliquée (AILA), International Association of Teachers of English as a Foreign Language (IATEFL), and Teachers of English to Speakers of Other Languages (TESOL), can be seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1362168812460808">Table 3</xref>, with many strands either overlapping in name or in kind. Unlike the other conferences in which the strands appear without themes, the AILA conference has themes for its strands. Appropriating these themes, I categorized the associated strands from the four other conferences (including JALT) under each of AILA’s themes. While other means of classification are available – for example Hinkel’s eight themes of research in second language teaching (2011) – AILA’s themes were used because they already existed as a standard for one conference. In many cases, the strands in the other three conferences mapped either identically or closely onto AILA’s, e.g. sociolinguistics and pragmatics were classified under ‘Language in Societies’. However, in some cases, strands did not cleanly fit under the AILA themes; these were classified under ‘Other’. While it is beyond the purview of this study to compare these conferences in detail, some broad observations can be made.</p>

<p>As one would expect, because categories were taken from AILA, this conference displays the best balance with each theme including several strands. Strands from AAAL also tended to correspond well with AILA’s, although with less overall balance. However, for JALT, TESOL and IATEFL, there were a distinctly large number of strands under the Language Teaching and Learning theme while few strands were listed under either Language Acquisition and Processing or Applied Linguistics and Methodology. In addition, several strands from these two conferences were classified under ‘Other’.</p>

<title>4 Researchers</title>
<p>While it is not customary to include citations in abstracts, examining frequency counts of researcher’s names is one way to determine which individuals have influenced the field. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1362168812460808">Figure 3</xref> shows the frequency counts of most cited researchers in presentation abstracts over an eight-year period starting in 2003 in a corpus of 1,032,682 words. This large sample, to some extent, compensates for the relative infrequency of occurrences of names in the abstracts. Because only vague notions existed about which researchers would be most cited, rather than searching for specific individuals, a generic search of the word frequency list had to be performed for each year. This in itself posed certain hazards because simple lexical items can sometimes be mistaken for family names, e.g. nation and brown. In addition, adjectival references to researchers, e.g. Vygotskian, had to be counted. Multi-citations of one researcher within one abstract were counted as one mention. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1362168812460808">Table 4</xref> reveals the specialty of each researcher who was cited at least once in each of the eight years.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1362168812460808">3</xref></sup> The specialty area for each researcher was determined by noting the context surrounding the citation in each abstract where they were mentioned.</p>

<title>1 Themes and strands</title>
<p>In this section, the changes in themes and strands that have occurred between the early conferences and the most recent one are examined in an effort to note patterns and suggest reasons behind some of the trends which appear.</p>
<p>As one may expect from a conference focusing on language teaching, Language Skills and Classroom Content was the theme encompassing the most strands both at the early and most recent JALT conferences. However, changes in the strands within this broad theme to some extent reflect movements and beliefs within the field. For example, the appearance of Vocabulary coupled with the disappearance of Grammar is indicative of quite a significant shift in thinking that has emerged. Traditional beliefs about language instruction that have long given primacy to grammar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1362168812460808">Schmitt, 2000</xref>) while assuming that vocabulary acquisition can take care of itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1362168812460808">Nation, 1990</xref>) have gradually been replaced by a recognition of vocabulary’s importance in language teaching. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1362168812460808">Schmitt (2000)</xref> notes that in fact, ‘grammar and vocabulary are fundamentally linked. Evidence from large corpora … shows that there is more lexical patterning than ever imagined, and that much of what was previously considered grammar is actually constrained by lexical choices’ (p. 14). This realization suggests that a strand called ‘lexicogrammar’ may better reflect current understandings; however, there is often a struggle within a conference organization bureaucracy with multiple competing forces vying for influence, including the need to (1) appeal to a broad audience by following perceived trends; (2) be as inclusive as possible; and (3) best reflect cutting-edge research. The breakdown by strand of submitted abstracts at the most recent JALT conference illustrates these needs well. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1362168812460808">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1362168812460808">2</xref> reveal how some strands draw many more submissions than others.</p>
<p>One of the most striking changes over the 30 years, as noted above, was the almost complete disappearance of strands associated with Classroom Pedagogy. Approaches to language learning in the 1970s such as CLL, Silent Way, Suggestopedia and TPR, which at one time drew enough interest to have strands of their own, are now only rarely mentioned in abstract submissions. Indeed, these four techniques which together accounted for over 10% of submissions in 1978 disappeared completely as strands by 1985. Between 1995 and 2010, not one abstract title out of 7,900 submissions mentioned Silent Way. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1362168812460808">Brown (2002)</xref> likens these humanistic methods to an early flurry of approaches in psychotherapy ‘which burgeoned with a plethora of “methods” of therapy’ (p. 10).</p>
<p>This movement away from a focus on classroom methods and techniques may suggest a maturation of the organization in which presenters view themselves less as practitioners and more as theoreticians. It may also reflect a separation between these two sets of professionals; JALT, whose membership is presently largely composed of academic and teaching staff at universities, has moved in the direction of research and theory, although not to the extent to which AAAL and AILA are at present. In the meantime, the disappearance of humanistic methods, which focus more on practice than theory, gives pause to reflect on their present day alternatives, such as task-based language teaching, which may be following a similar trend. As an aside, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1362168812460808">Figure 4</xref> shows occurrences of the word ‘task’ or ‘TBLT’ in presentation titles over a 32-year period (<italic>n</italic> = 12,523). While one may easily dismiss humanistic methods as naïve efforts in the early days of communicative language teaching, the movement away from methods as strands may reflect a redefining of our understanding of method, which has come about because of pessimism over the continuous cycling and recycling of methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1362168812460808">Kumaravadivelu, 2003</xref>). In this post-method environment, teachers act autonomously and pragmatically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1362168812460808">Kumaravadivelu, 2003</xref>) under the recognition that one size (set of methods) does not fit all. It is interesting to observe that over two decades ago, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1362168812460808">Tarone and Yule (1989)</xref> presciently noted the growing eclecticism among teachers who select among techniques depending on the group of students in front of them ‘rather than [assessing] … whether the lesson format might fit into some theory’ (p. 10). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1362168812460808">Brown (2002)</xref> argues in retrospect that:<disp-quote>
<p>[t]hrough the 1970s and into the early 80s, there was a good deal of hoopla about the designer methods … they were … symbolic of a profession at least partially caught up in a mad scramble to invent a new method when the very concept of method was eroding under our feet. (p. 11)</p>
</disp-quote></p>

<p>The salient point here for the purposes of this study is that the conference data via changes in strand titles has been able to capture the rise and fall of humanistic methods providing a snapshot of the times.</p>
<p>Filling the void left by the absence of the Classroom Pedagogy theme are new strands that have emerged from research into cognitive and sociocultural factors, such as Motivation and Learner Development, and Corpus, Culture, Gender Awareness, Global Issues, Pragmatics and Sociolinguistics respectively. It is in this realm that broader insights into past and future directions may be attained.</p>
<p>Although the shift away from behaviorism and associated methodologies such as the audio-lingual approach occurred in the 1960s, there continues to be an expansion of interest in the cognitive processes of the learner as reflected in the two strands, Learner Development, which is largely concerned with the intentions of learners, and Motivation. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1362168812460808">Figure 2</xref> reveals that Learner Development received the third largest number of submissions, and Motivation, which was a new strand just four years earlier, was in sixth place. Together these two strands accounted for 15% of the total submissions. Likewise, the sociocultural strands, most of which did not appear in the early conferences, now comprise close to 20% of the total number of submissions. This roughly equal sharing of the cognitive and socialization aspects of language learning dovetails with the notion that ‘neither a strict cognitivist nor a strict socioculturalist position alone can fully illuminate the complexities inherent in SLA [second language acquisition]’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1362168812460808">Watson-Gegeo &amp; Nielsen, 2003</xref>, p. 170).</p>
<p>Among the many cognitive sub-topics that have been deemed important enough to merit their own strand, Motivation stands out. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1362168812460808">Figure 5</xref> shows how the word ‘motivation’ has increased and recently decreased in abstract titles over the past 32 years. Similar to the recent decline in occurrences of the term ‘task’, it is too early to speculate whether 2006 marks the peak of interest in motivation; nevertheless, tracking keywords in this way sheds light on trends in the profession.</p>

<graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1362168812460808-fig5.tif"/></fig>
<p>Related to this is a more creative visual display of keywords in title clouds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1362168812460808">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-1362168812460808">7</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1362168812460808">Steinbock, 2006</xref>), revealing the most frequently appearing words hierarchically by font size during two time periods. A quick glance highlights some of the points made above. Beyond the most common words such as ‘English’ and ‘teaching’, the early years are peppered with words related to classroom teaching (technique, approach, method, CLL, TPR, Silent), The most recent years, on the other hand, include cognitive and sociocultural terms (thinking, motivation, creative and culture, identity, global) respectively. Other points of interest include the rise of vocabulary and writing and the words ‘meeting’ and ‘SIG’ (special interest group), which possibly indicate movements towards a self-structuring of the organization. A broader methodological point here is the statement being made about the capability of software to instantly generate these figures that quickly provide a snapshot of a conference’s keywords.</p>

<title>2 Keywords: Movement towards research</title>
<p>The use of keyword frequency counts may also serve as a crude instrument for deriving indications about the extent to which presenters discussed empirical studies at the conference; specifically, it can provide some clue as to whether presentations were moving in any particular direction. Indeed, the increase in frequency of the chosen keywords that were closely associated with data-producing studies (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1362168812460808">Table 2</xref>) suggests that, in general, presenters were trending towards more formally investigating teaching practices over the eight years in question. Such a movement dovetails with the results of other studies that reveal a focus on research studies. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1362168812460808">Magnan (2005)</xref>, editor of <italic>The Modern Language Journal</italic>, noted that from 1996 to 2005, research articles comprised 82% of the published papers in that journal, while only 18% were essays. Similarly, both the frequency and increase in counts of the word ‘qualitative’ mirror the rise in the use of qualitative methods in the language teaching field noted by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1362168812460808">Benson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1362168812460808">Ellis, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1362168812460808">Gao et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1362168812460808">Lazaraton, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1362168812460808">Stapleton &amp; Collett, 2010</xref>). Another indicator, albeit somewhat unconventional, comes from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1362168812460808">Hinkel (2011)</xref>, whose handbook of second language teaching and learning lists four chapters under the ‘Research Methodology’ theme, three of which are qualitative against one quantitative.</p>
<p>Although the uncovering of this methodological trend at the JALT conference comes as no surprise, the method used for revealing the trend, i.e. tracking frequency counts of keywords in presentation titles and abstracts, may offer an effective means of verifying such patterns. Other trends besides the one related to research methodology can also be tracked in a similar fashion as noted above with the words ‘task-based’ and ‘motivation’.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1362168812460808">
<title>3 Comparison with other conferences</title>
<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1362168812460808">Table 3</xref>, which illustrates the themes and strands of five major conferences, reveals considerable self-organization as well as divergence into distinct areas of interest, and while there are differences among the five, it is their similarities which are striking. Of particular note is the emergence and apparent growth of themes and strands that cover areas beyond language pedagogy, ostensibly one of the original raison d’êtres of the broader field. Language in Society, for example, is a well-represented theme at all the conferences that reflects the now firmly, yet relatively recently, established beliefs about the socially mediated nature of language. Within this theme, there appears to be considerable variation with focuses ranging from issues related to how language is actually spoken and written (corpus, discourse and pragmatics) to socioculturally oriented matters (gender, multilingualism, global issues). Even within the most ‘natural’ or fundamental of themes, Language Teaching and Learning, under which all five conferences offer more strands than any other, the diversity is remarkable with strands ranging far beyond the traditional language skills extending from areas associated with learner autonomy to the use of technology. This diversity, yet apparent convergence among the conferences, as illustrated by themes and strands, suggests a maturation of the field where the reach has become wide, with some agreement about what is important. On the other hand, each conference has its own unique strands, e.g. Study Abroad in JALT and Dogme in IATEFL, and there are numerous strands that defy classification under a theme, which is also indicative of a field spawning new ideas.</p>

<title>4 Researchers</title>
<p>Among the dozen most-cited researchers, only one comes from outside the language teaching field, Lev Vygotsky, a developmental psychologist whose writings have helped inform the basis of sociocultural theory. That Vygotsky, ranking second, has been drawing multiple citations over an extended period, i.e. eight years, suggests a keen interest among presenters for matters related to socially mediated psychology. In general, the dozen researchers represent a healthy cross-section of themes and sub-areas within language teaching and, through these, some broad statements can be made about the conference with regard to leanings, which in turn serve to characterize the conference itself. One of the sub-themes that ranked highly based on researcher citations was vocabulary acquisition represented in the top dozen by Paul Nation and Batia Laufer (ranking first and tenth, respectively). Clearly, vocabulary acquisition has struck a chord among JALT presenters. Another sub-theme with a disproportionately large interest was motivation represented by Zoltan Dornyei and R.C. Gardner (ranking third and eighth, respectively). Why these two areas of research have drawn marked interest is uncertain and would require considerable investigation. However, such a question rises to the surface only upon processing the data in the manner of this study.</p>
<p>It is interesting to note that some of the top-dozen-cited researchers have made frequent visits to the JALT National conference as plenary and keynote speakers. Whether an invitation to perform a plenary results in increased citations, or vice versa, is difficult to say. One can speculate, however, that ideas not only rest on their intrinsic merits, but also the marketing of them by their authors, and it is here where conferences differ from publications. The number of conference plenary invitations received by a scholar does not necessarily dovetail with the associated researcher’s degree of influence in the field. In this sense, the data again raises questions about how new ideas take hold (or do not do so).</p>

<title>VI Conclusions</title>
<p>While much of this articles’s content has focused on trends and characteristics of a given conference, a larger significance may be at play. Through the review and synthesis of large amounts of data, the nature of one conference has been summarized and made more meaningful. However, this process shows that what is buried in conference archives has the potential, when synthesized, to bring perspective not only to trends within an individual conference, but also to broad directions within a field. In other words, knowledge that has been fragmented as researchers become increasingly specialized, and then tucked away over the years, can resurface and be made comprehensible via synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1362168812460808">Major &amp; Savin-Baden, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>As for conferences themselves, findings arising from reviews and syntheses can help organizers better understand where their conference stands in comparison to other similar ones so they can better position their offerings, such as themes and strands, in accordance with their own aims as well as the perceived needs of potential presenters. Similar statements apply for those researchers who are looking for conferences to present their ideas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1362168812460808">Becker et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>While observing trends over lengthy periods as this study has done can be an interesting exercise in itself, it also gives pause to reflect on a larger state of affairs. In noting the rise and fall of methods and ways of thinking over a 30-year period, some perspective is gathered on how beliefs about language learning are influenced by larger forces – in this case, cognitive and sociocultural theories – and, in turn, how these theories impact methods. For example, without a doubt, sociocultural theories have hastened interest in motivation, corpus studies and pragmatics just to name a few.</p>
<p>Although predicting the future is often called a fool’s game, recent trends do point in particular directions. One of these is the advance of brain science and its impact on how languages are learned. Recent studies using fMRIs which measure blood flow in the brain show great promise. The work of Patricia Kuhl on babies’ brain responses to phonetic stimuli using magnetoencephalography (MEG; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1362168812460808">Kuhl, 2010</xref>) is one area of many that points to a deeper understanding of language acquisition beyond classroom pedagogy. Just as this study has revealed the movements into cognitive and sociocultural spheres over the past generation, the next may move towards the neurological domain.</p>
