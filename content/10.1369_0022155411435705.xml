<abstract>
<p>CDC50 proteins are β-subunits for P4 ATPases, which upon heterodimerization form a functional phospholipid translocation complex. Emerging evidence in mouse models and men links mutations in P4 ATPase genes with human disease. This study analyzed the tissue distribution and cellular localization of CDC50A, the most abundant and ubiquitously expressed CDC50 homologue in the mouse. The authors have raised antibodies that detect mouse and human CDC50A and studied CDC50A localization and glycosylation status in mouse liver cells. CDC50A is a terminal-glycosylated glycoprotein and is expressed in hepatocytes and liver sinusoidal endothelial cells, where it resides in detergent-resistant membranes. In pancreas and stomach, CDC50A localized to secretory vesicles, whereas in the kidney, CDC50A localized to the apical region of proximal convoluted tubules of the cortex. In WIF-B9 cells, CDC50A partially costains with the trans-Golgi network. Data suggest that CDC50A is present as a fully glycosylated protein in vivo, which presumes interaction with distinct P4 ATPases.</p>

<p>P4 ATPases are a subfamily of P-type ATPases implicated in the transport of phospholipids from the exoplasmic to the cytosolic leaflet of biological membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022155411435705">Halleck et al. 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0022155411435705">Holthuis and Levine 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022155411435705">Paulusma and Oude Elferink 2005</xref>). P4 ATPase transcripts, including alternative splice variants, are ubiquitously expressed, with most P4 ATPases in various parts of the central nervous system; exception is ATP8B3, which is almost exclusively expressed in the testis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0022155411435705">Halleck et al. 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0022155411435705">Wang et al. 2004</xref>; reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0022155411435705">Paulusma and Oude Elferink 2005</xref>; and see Allen Brain Atlas Resources at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.brain-map.org">http://www.brain-map.org</ext-link>).</p>
<p>Deficiency of the mammalian P4 ATPase ATP8B1 causes progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis type I and benign recurrent intrahepatic cholestasis type I, characterized by a chronic and a periodic cholestasis, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022155411435705">Paulusma et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0022155411435705">van der Woerd et al. 2010</xref>). Besides ATP8B1, the mammalian P4 ATPase family includes 13 members, (14 in the mouse), which are poorly studied. Inactivation of some murine P4 ATPases suggests roles in fertility-related disorders, insulin resistance, and obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0022155411435705">Folmer et al. 2009</xref>). Recently, ATP11C-deficient mice have been described, which display B-cell lymphopenia and intrahepatic cholestasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022155411435705">Siggs et al. 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022155411435705">Siggs et al. 2011b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022155411435705">Yabas et al. 2011</xref>). Studies in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, and <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> have indicated that P4 ATPases are important determinants of the vesicle-generating machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022155411435705">Muthusamy et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022155411435705">Paulusma and Oude Elferink 2010</xref>). In addition, studies on the (patho)physiology of ATP8B1 have indicated that P4 ATPases are, either directly or indirectly, important in maintaining an optimal physical state of the (plasma) membrane, which is essential for proper membrane barrier and membrane protein function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0022155411435705">Paulusma et al. 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>P4 ATPases act in concert with members of the conserved CDC50 protein family, probable β-subunits for these proteins. The mammalian genome encodes three CDC50 proteins, CDC50A-C, which are glycosylated, ~50-kDa, two-membrane-spanning proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0022155411435705">Katoh and Katoh 2004</xref>). Accumulating evidence indicates that CDC50 proteins are required for stability and exit of P4 ATPases from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). In nonpolarized cell lines, ectopically expressed CDC50A and CDC50B facilitate exit of multiple P4 ATPases from the endoplasmic reticulum and colocalize to the plasma membrane and/or the endomembrane system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022155411435705">Paulusma et al. 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022155411435705">Bryde et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022155411435705">van der Velden et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022155411435705">Coleman and Molday 2011</xref>). Ectopic expression of CDC50A in polarized, hepatocyte-derived, WIF-B9 cells resulted in a predominant apical localization but also to subapical and endosomal vesicles when coexpressed with ATP8B1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022155411435705">Paulusma et al. 2008</xref>). Apart from facilitating exit of the P4 ATPase out of the ER, it is poorly understood how mammalian CDC50 proteins contribute to the function of the P4 ATPase. Studies in the plant <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, which expresses 12 P4 ATPases and 5 Cdc50 orthologs, have demonstrated that Cdc50 proteins do not determine subcellular localization nor substrate specificities of the interacting P4 ATPase; however, assembly of Cdc50 proteins with the P4 ATPase was essential for obtaining a functional heterodimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0022155411435705">Lopez-Marques et al. 2010</xref>). Recently, data were published to indicate an essential function of CDC50A in the reaction cycle of ATP8B1 and ATP8B2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022155411435705">Bryde et al. 2010</xref>), while <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022155411435705">Coleman and Molday (2011)</xref> demonstrated phosphatidylserine flipping activity upon reconstitution of CDC50A and ATP8A2 into liposomes; furthermore, these authors showed that endogenous CDC50A and ATP8A2 are present as a heterodimer in photoreceptor disc membranes.</p>
<p>In the present study we analyzed murine tissue distribution and cellular localization of CDC50A with special emphasis on the liver. In liver, CDC50A is present as a complex-glycosylated protein that resides in detergent-resistant membranes in hepatocytes and sinusoidal endothelial cells. In addition, the localization of CDC50A in several tissues and cell lines was studied.</p>

<title>Production of Polyclonal Antibodies</title>
<p>Polyclonal antibodies to CDC50A were raised in rabbits against synthetic peptides corresponding to the N- and C-terminus of the human protein (Double X program, Eurogentec, Seraing, Belgium). The following peptide sequences were selected: AMNYNAKDEVDGGPPC (N-terminus, residues 1–17) and CNHKYRNSSNTADITI (C-terminus, residues 347–361). A cysteine residue was coupled to the C- and N-terminus of respectively the 1–17 peptide and 347–361 peptide for coupling to MBS- (m-maleimidobenzoic acid N-hydroxysuccinimide ester) conjugated KLH (keyhole limpet hemocyanin) carrier protein. After the first immunization and 4 successive boosts, the animals were bled. Antiserum was affinity purified after coupling of the peptides to Toyopearl AF-Amino-650 media resin. In a Western blot, the C-terminal and N-terminal affinity-purified antibodies and the total serum showed the same results. In the immunostainings, the C-terminal affinity-purified antibody was applied; the N-terminal affinity-purified antibody displayed the same staining pattern.</p>

<title>Glycosidase Treatments of CHO and Mouse Liver Cells</title>
<p>Parenchymal, nonparenchymal, and CHO cell lysates (50 µg protein) were treated with endoglycosidase H (Roche) and PNGase F (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) according to the manufacturers’ instructions. Endo H-treated lysates were first denatured in 0.02% SDS/1% β-mercaptoethanol for 10 minutes at 37ºC. Endo H and PNGase F were incubated for 2 hours at 37ºC, and samples were analyzed by Western blotting.</p>

<title>Immunohistochemical Analyses</title>
<p>Immunohistochemical analyses were performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0022155411435705">He et al. 2010</xref>). Briefly, tissues were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) overnight at 4ºC, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned at 7 µm. Paraffin-embedded sections were dewaxed, rehydrated, and autoclaved for 10 min in 0.01 M sodium citrate buffer (pH 6.0) to retrieve epitopes. Endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked with 0.03% H2O2. Sections were blocked in Teng-T (10 mM Tris/HCl, pH8.0, 5 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl, 0.25% gelatin [w/v], 0.05% Tween-20 [v/v]) for 1 hr at room temperature (RT) and incubated with C-terminal affinity-purified CDC50A antibody, anti-glutamine synthetase, or horse radish peroxidase (HRP)–conjugated Arachis hypogaea lectin (peanut agglutinin, PNA; EY Laboratories Inc.) for 16 hr at 4°C. As secondary antibodies, HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or mouse IgG (Dako, Heverlee, Belgium) were used. In the negative control, the first antibody was omitted from the incubation. HRP was visualized by incubating the slides with metal enhanced 3,3′-diaminobenzidine (DAB) substrate according to the manufacture’s instructions (Pierce, Rockford, IL). Periodic acid–Schiff (PAS) staining (glycogen) was performed by incubating the sections with 0.5% periodic acid for 30 minutes. Sections were mounted in Entellan.</p>

<title>Indirect Immunofluorescence</title>
<p>CHO cells and WIF-B9 cells were grown on glass coverslips and fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 minutes at RT. After permeabilization in 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS (PBS/Tx), cells were incubated with N-terminal affinity-purified CDC50A antibody, anti-HA (clone 3F10; Roche), anti-TGN38 (BD Transduction Laboratories), or anti-MRP2 (M2III6; Abcam) in PBS/Tx for 1 hr at RT. In the negative control, the first antibody was omitted from the incubation. The immunoreactivity was visualized with goat-anti-rat, affinity-purified, Texas Red–conjugated IgGs (Rockland) or goat-anti-mouse or goat-anti-rabbit alexa 594 (Molecular Probes), incubated in PBS/Tx for 1 hr at RT. After the first and secondary antibody incubations, coverslips were washed 5 × 5 min with PBS/Tx. Frozen mouse tissue sections were air-dried, fixed in 100% acetone for 10 min at RT, and blocked for 1 hr at RT in 5% normal goat serum in PBS/0.05% Tween-20 (PBS/Tw). All other incubations were as described above.

<title>Tissue Distribution of Cdc50 mRNA in Mice</title>
<p>Tissue distribution of the three Cdc50 homologues was assessed in a panel of mouse tissues. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022155411435705">Fig 1</xref>, Cdc50a mRNA was expressed in similar amounts in all tissues examined. Cdc50b mRNA was more or less confined to the gastrointestinal tract, and its expression levels were approximately 100-fold lower compared to Cdc50a. Cdc50c mRNA was highly and almost exclusively expressed in the testis. These data show that Cdc50a is ubiquitously expressed and is the most prominent Cdc50 homolog in mouse tissues.</p>

<title>Characterization of CDC50A Antiserum</title>
<p>Antibodies to CDC50A were raised against synthetic peptides corresponding to the N- and C-termini of the human protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0022155411435705">Fig 2A</xref>). The N- and C-terminal peptides displayed respectively 82% and 100% amino acid identity with the corresponding mouse CDC50A sequences. To assess antibody specificity, we stably expressed HA-tagged human CDC50A in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. In a Western blot, the CDC50A antiserum recognized one band with an apparent molecular mass of ~50 kDa in cells expressing HA-CDC50A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0022155411435705">Fig 2B</xref>). In control CHO cells and cells expressing HA-CDC50B, no protein bands were detected, indicating that the CDC50A antiserum specifically reacts with CDC50A. Cells were seeded on glass cover slips and stained with affinity-purified CDC50A antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0022155411435705">Fig 2C</xref>). Fluorescent signal was only detected in HA-CDC50A overexpressing CHO cells, indicating that the antiserum was also suitable for immunohistochemical analyses. CDC50A expression was analyzed in several mouse tissues and in parenchymal and nonparenchymal cell fractions using C-terminal affinity-purified antibody. Several protein bands were detected of which one prominent band disappeared after using a 5-fold excess of competing peptide (Suppl <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0022155411435705">Fig 1</xref>). This was, in particular, evident in liver cell fractions. Peptide competition experiments were also performed in immunofluorescent detection of CDC50A immunosignal in liver and kidney using C-terminal affinity-purified antibody. In these experiments, excess peptide resulted in complete loss of CDC50A immunostaining (Suppl <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0022155411435705">Fig 2</xref>). These experiments indicate that the CDC50A antibody specifically reacted with the C-terminal CDC50A sequence.</p>

<title>Immunohistochemical Detection of CDC50A in Mouse Liver</title>
<p>CDC50A immunostaining was observed in membranes of cells lining the sinusoids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0022155411435705">Fig 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0022155411435705">D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0022155411435705">E</xref>). Interestingly, CDC50A immunostaining was zonally distributed throughout the liver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0022155411435705">Fig 3A</xref>); intense staining was observed in the pericentral area (demonstrated by glutamine synthetase staining of a parallel section; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0022155411435705">Fig 3C</xref>), which gradually decreased toward the periportal area. Larger magnifications (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0022155411435705">Fig 3F</xref>) revealed intracellular staining in small nuclei-containing cells. These stainings suggest that CDC50A localizes to the plasma membrane, and possibly to intracellular vesicles, of pericentral hepatocytes and/or endothelial cells lining the sinusoids.</p>

<title>MACS and (Detergent-Resistant) Membrane Isolations of Liver Cells</title>
<p>Next, we studied CDC50A-positive cell type(s) and membrane domains in mouse liver. Livers were fractionated into a parenchymal (hepatocyte-containing) and nonparenchymal cell fraction. From the nonparenchymal fraction, liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSEC) were isolated using CD146-MACS beads. CD146 is a membrane marker of endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0022155411435705">Harder et al. 1991</xref>). Purity of the cell fractions was analyzed by FACS analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0022155411435705">Fig 4A</xref>) and Western blotting for the hepatocyte-specific marker glutamine synthetase. Immunoblotting revealed CDC50A in all fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0022155411435705">Fig 4B</xref>). Furthermore, mixed liver plasma membranes were separated into canalicular (cLPM) and basolateral membranes (bLPM) by sucrose density centrifugation and analyzed for CDC50A expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0022155411435705">Fig 4C</xref>). Purity of these fractions was assessed with the basolateral resident SLC10A1 (basolateral bile salt transporter) and the canalicular resident ABCC2 (MRP2). CDC50A predominantly resided in bLPMs, but lower levels were also observed in the canalicular fraction. These plasma membrane preparations have some contamination with ER membranes, but the detergent resistance (see below) precludes the possibility that substantial amounts of CDC50A reside in this compartment. Finally, mouse liver membranes were solubilized in 1% Triton X-100 and run on a 30% to 5% continuous sucrose gradient. CDC50A cofractionated with alkaline phosphatase activity and caveolin-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0022155411435705">Fig 4C</xref>), both of which reside in detergent-resistant membrane domains. ATP8B1 was also present in CDC50A-enriched fractions. Collectively, these data indicate that CDC50A predominantly resides in detergent-resistant membranes of hepatocytes and LSECs.</p>

<title>Glycosidase Treatment of CDC50A</title>
<p>Next, we analyzed the glycosylation status of CDC50A in mouse liver cells. PNGase treatment of parenchymal and nonparenchymal cell lysates resulted in the appearance of the deglycosylated protein running at a molecular weight comparable to the theoretical molecular weight of ~40 kD (band C in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0022155411435705">Fig 5A</xref>, lanes 4, 7). Endo H treatment resulted in the appearance of one protein band with a slightly higher electrophoretic mobility, indicating that at least one of the four potential N-glycosylation sites in CDC50A is decorated with high-mannose oligosaccharides (band B in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0022155411435705">Fig 5A</xref>, lanes 3, 8).

These data indicate that in mouse liver cells, CDC50A is present as a terminally glycosylated protein and suggest that CDC50A is present as a heterodimer with a P4 ATPase in the plasma membrane and/or membranes of endosomes and/or GA.</p>

<title>Localization of CDC50A in Other Tissues of the Mouse</title>
<p>In the pancreas, strong CDC50A immunostaining was observed in zymogen granules, secretory vesicles containing digestive enzymes that are present in the acinar cells of the exocrine pancreas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0022155411435705">Fig 7</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In mammals, 3 CDC50 proteins and 14 P4 ATPases (15 in mice) are expressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022155411435705">Paulusma and Oude Elferink 2010</xref>). Accumulating in vitro evidence suggests that CDC50 proteins are the β-subunits of P4 ATPases, which can form a functional lipid-flipping protein heterodimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022155411435705">Paulusma et al. 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022155411435705">Bryde et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022155411435705">Coleman and Molday 2011</xref>). Recently, CDC50A and ATP8A2 were copurified from photoreceptor membranes and displayed phosphatidylserine flipping activity upon reconstitution into liposomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022155411435705">Coleman and Molday 2011</xref>). Most likely, many, if not all, P4 ATPases interact with a CDC50 protein; however, the specificity of physiological relevant CDC50–P4 ATPase interactions is presently not known.</p>
<p>Cdc50a is the most abundant and ubiquitously expressed Cdc50 isoform in mice. In mouse liver, CDC50A localized to liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) and to the plasma membrane (mostly basolateral) of hepatocytes. Interestingly, CDC50A is zonally distributed with highest expression in the pericentral areas. Despite morphological uniformity of hepatocytes, many metabolic pathways in the liver are zonally regulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0022155411435705">Moorman et al. 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022155411435705">Jungermann and Kietzmann 1996</xref>); For instance, metabolism of xenobiotics by cytochrome P450 enzymes, nitrogen metabolism, and glucose uptake/storage are handled by the pericentral hepatocytes, whereas periportal hepatocytes are important for gluconeogenesis, ammonia metabolism, cholesterol synthesis, and bile formation. Furthermore, albumine mRNA expression displays a zonal expression pattern with decreasing expression going from portal to central (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0022155411435705">Moorman et al. 1990</xref>). Zonal heterogeneity of liver sinusoidal endothelial cells has been reported with regard to their filtering capacity (fenestration) and binding capacity for lectins and immune cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0022155411435705">Jungermann and Kietzmann 1996</xref>). Endothelial cells in the pericentral area have more but smaller fenestrae compared to periportally localized endothelial cells, resulting in a higher porosity of pericentral sinusoids. Apart from a filtering function, endothelial cells have very high endocytic activity. Since the CDC50-P4 ATPase heteromeric complexes have been implicated in vesicle biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022155411435705">Muthusamy et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022155411435705">Paulusma and Oude Elferink 2010</xref>), it is tempting to speculate that CDC50A plays a role in endocytosis in LSECs and/or basolateral membranes of hepatocytes.</p>
<p>On the basis of our previous work, we hypothesized that CDC50A is the β-subunit for ATP8B1 in hepatocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022155411435705">Paulusma et al. 2008</xref>). ATP8B1 is expressed in the canalicular membrane of hepatocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0022155411435705">Eppens et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0022155411435705">Ujhazy et al. 2001</xref>). Furthermore, ectopically expressed CDC50A and ATP8B1 colocalized in the subapical region and in the apical membrane of hepatic WIF-B9 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022155411435705">Paulusma et al. 2008</xref>). In the present study however, we could not detect CDC50A in the canalicular membrane of mouse hepatocytes. There are several explanations for this unexpected result. First, CDC50A is not expressed, or its expression is extremely low in the canalicular membrane and is not uncovered due to high expression levels in LSECs and basolateral membranes of hepatocytes. Second, CDC50A merely functions as a chaperone and cycles between the canalicular membrane and the endomembrane system, delivering ATP8B1 to the canalicular membrane. Our deglycosylation experiments indicate that CDC50A is present as a terminal-glycosylated protein, suggesting that CDC50A is present as a late Golgi, endosomal, and/or plasma membrane-associated protein. However, the exact subcellular location of CDC50A can only be determined by using immunoelectron microscopy. Third, since ATP8B1 can assemble with both CDC50A and CDC50B in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0022155411435705">Paulusma et al. 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0022155411435705">Bryde et al. 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0022155411435705">van der Velden et al. 2010</xref>), it cannot be excluded that CDC50B is the physiological relevant binding partner for ATP8B1 in hepatocytes. Indeed, mouse hepatocytes do express very low levels of Cdc50b mRNA (DF, unpublished results).</p>
<p>It thus remains to be determined whether CDC50A and ATP8B1 form a physiological relevant protein complex in hepatocytes. It is possible that CDC50A assembles with multiple other hepatic P4 ATPases. Recently, ATP11C was identified as an important determinant of proper bile formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0022155411435705">Siggs et al. 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0022155411435705">Siggs et al. 2011b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0022155411435705">Yabas et al. 2011</xref>). ATP11C is highly expressed in hepatocytes and LSECs and thus may form a heterodimer with CDC50A in both cell types. Furthermore, Coleman and Molday recently demonstrated that CDC50A and ATP8A2 exist as a heterodimer in photoreceptor membranes in the eye (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0022155411435705">Coleman and Molday 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>In pancreas and stomach CDC50A staining was observed in zymogen granules, which, upon stimulation, fuse with the apical membrane to release their contents. The presence of CDC50A in zymogen granules of acinar cells in the exocrine pancreas is in accordance with a proteomic analysis of rat pancreatic zymogen granules, which listed CDC50A (referred to as transmembrane protein 30A) as a granular protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0022155411435705">Rindler et al. 2007</xref>); in addition to CDC50A, ATP8B1 and ATP8A1 were characterized as granular proteins. CDC50A staining was also observed in the insulin-secreting β-cells in the islets of Langerhans of the pancreas. As was shown in other organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0022155411435705">Muthusamy et al. 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0022155411435705">Paulusma and Oude Elferink 2010</xref>), our observations suggest that mammalian CDC50A (together with a P4 ATPase) may be involved in the biogenesis of transport vesicles at the TGN and/or plasma membrane. Thus, in the exocrine pancreas and stomach, CDC50A may be important in the generation of digestive enzyme-containing secretory vesicles. In the β-cells of the islands of Langerhans, CDC50A may be important in generating insulin/amylin-containing secretory vesicles. Alternatively, CDC50A is important in generating or maintaining a fusion-competent vesicular membrane, which is a prerequisite for releasing the vesicular contents. In the kidney, CDC50A localizes to the brush border of the proximal tubules, which key function is the reabsorption of water and electrolytes (i.e., Na+, Cl<sup>−</sup>, SO4<sup>2−</sup>, and HCO<sub>3−</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0022155411435705">Markovich and Aronson 2007</xref>). CDC50A could be important in maintaining the asymmetric distribution of phospholipids within the brush border membrane, guaranteeing proper membrane protein function. Alternatively, CDC50A is an important determinant of protein trafficking to or from the brush border membrane. Whether CDC50A fulfills such functions in these mammalian cells/tissues, and if defects in this machinery lead to disease, is a subject for future research.</p>
