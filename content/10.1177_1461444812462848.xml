<abstract>
<p>This article argues that paying close attention to key findings within the study of religion and the Internet, a subfield of Internet Studies, can enhance our understanding and discussion of the larger social and cultural shifts at work within networked society. Through a critical overview of research on religion online, five central research areas emerge related to social practices, online–offline connections, community, identity, and authority online. It is also argued that observations about these themes not only point to specific trends within religious practice online, but also mirror concerns and findings within other areas of Internet Studies. Thus, studying religion on the Internet provides an important microcosm for investigating Internet Studies’ contribution in a wide range of contexts in our contemporary social world.</p>

<title>Religion and the Internet as a microcosm for studying trends and implications within Internet Studies</title>
<p>The very notion that there is a field of research called Internet Studies raises the question of what is truly unique about this technology and the studies it has birthed. The Internet as an object of study has given rise to a number of discernible areas of cross- or inter-disciplinary research, from digital game studies and computer-mediated communication to information ethics and online community research. The work pursued within these overlapping research specializations often addresses similar topics related to how digital technologies influence issues related to gender, ethics, governance, and sexuality, for example. At the heart of these explorations is the question: to what extent does the study of the Internet and associated phenomena illuminate something truly new about our fundamental perceptions of reality, the self, social patterns and community building? Does such research simply reflect previous learning on these topics? What is the relationship between online and offline beliefs and behaviors learned from these areas of study?</p>
<p>One sub-area within Internet Studies that has received growing attention is the study of religion and the Internet. Here scholars have asked questions related to the role the Internet plays in shaping, conceptualizing, and/or extending users’ religious engagement and spiritually motivated interactions, both online and offline. I argue that looking in detail at this area of Internet Studies provides valuable insights into the extent to which the Internet is transforming social practices, or reflecting changes at work within wider culture. By analyzing current research detailing how religion is being practiced online, several themes emerge that illuminate not only what we have learned about how religion functions or is lived out online, but also how the traits of religion online mirror larger investigations about the nature of Internet-based social and cultural practices. By looking at these themes we gain understanding about how to interpret the embedded nature of the Internet in everyday practices.</p>
<p>This article suggests that interrogating and analyzing research conducted on religion and the Internet for common themes provides a valuable case study approach. Through a critical literature review of this subfield of Internet Studies, five characteristics of religious practice online are highlighted—convergent social practice, embedded reality, networked community, identity as performance, and shifting authority—which aid our understanding of how the Internet functions as a social and cultural sphere. Thus, this article contributes to Internet Studies as a whole, by demonstrating how critical analyses of work in subfields can illuminate more fully the Internet’s influence on the social world.</p>

<title>Situating studies of religion and the Internet</title>
<p>Research on religion and the Internet emerged in the mid-1990s as scholars began to document the different ways in which religious users and groups were engaging the Internet and the potential implications this use might have for religious belief and practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1461444812462848">Ess, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1461444812462848">O’Leary and Brasher, 1996</xref>). Many early books on the topic were journalistic or observational accounts focusing on: how various religions were being imported or negotiated online (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1461444812462848">Brasher, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1461444812462848">Zaleski, 1997</xref>), the ethical and moral challenges posed by digital technologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1461444812462848">Houston, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1461444812462848">Wolf, 2003</xref>), ways in which the Internet may reconnect people with spirituality in postmodern society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1461444812462848">Cobb, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1461444812462848">Wertheim, 1999</xref>), explorations of online adaptations of traditional forms of religiosity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1461444812462848">Bunt, 2003</xref>), and the rise of new cyber-religion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1461444812462848">Davis, 1998</xref>). Over time, studies of religion online expanded to investigate power struggles in religious organizations due to web use and the reinterpretation of ancient rituals online. In the past 15 years different waves of research have appeared, moving the field from simply identifying new phenomena and trends within religious practice online to offering a critical reflection on the “bricolage of scholarship coming from different backgrounds”, providing valuable insight into the nature and perceptions of sociality and spirituality online (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1461444812462848">Hojsgaard and Warburg, 2005</xref>: 9). The current research seeks to provide a more detailed analysis not only of online religious engagement, but also of the relationship between online and offline religious practice and socialization (i.e. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1461444812462848">Campbell, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1461444812462848">Helland, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>In order to assess the common themes explored within studies of religion and the Internet, a critical review was conducted. This included a survey of chapters from three often cited edited collections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1461444812462848">Dawson and Cowan, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1461444812462848">Hadden and Cowan, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1461444812462848">Hojsgaard and Warburg, 2005</xref>), as well as notable special issues of journals dealing with religion and the Internet in the past decade, including <italic>Religion</italic> (2002, vol. 32, issue 4); <italic>Online – Heidelberg Journal of Religions on the Internet</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1461444812462848">2005</xref>, vol. 1 issue 1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1461444812462848">2006</xref>, vol. 2, issue 1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1461444812462848">2008</xref>, vol. 3, issues 1 and 2); <italic>Religious Studies Review</italic> (2006, vol. 32, issue 4); <italic>Studies in World Christianity</italic> (2007, vol. 13 issue 3); <italic>Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication</italic> (2007, vol. 12, issue 3); and <italic>Masaryk University Journal of Law and Technology</italic> (2009, vol. 3, issue 1). From a review of 109 articles and chapters, central themes and topics on which these essays were focused were identified and counted. Through this analysis a number of common research foci emerged, including: the exploration of religious rituals and practices online (n=48); how the Internet influences definitions and understandings of religion (n=16); the relationship between online and offline forms of religion (n=15); and the study of religious community (n=12), identity (n=11) and authority (n=7) in relation to the Internet. When these themes are examined in light of the common threads noted in three literature reviews of the field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1461444812462848">Campbell, 2005b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1461444812462848">2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1461444812462848">2010</xref>), several commonalities are further underscored. These include: (a) users’ tendency to combine traditional and new forms of social and spiritual engagement in a type of convergent practice, (b) the extent of the interconnection or embeddedness of online and offline contexts, (c) how the Internet facilitates new forms of community, (d) how the Internet contributes to the fluid construction of religious identities, and (e) how the Internet highlights shifting understandings of authority related to the online context, and the implications of these phenomena. Looking carefully at each theme demonstrates that concerns within the study of religion online closely mirror other thematic explorations within Internet Studies. In the following discussion I will explore these five themes in order to demonstrate how common findings within religion online mirror claims made in other areas of Internet Studies. While in practice these five categories have some overlap, here I am separating them for the purpose of analytical discussion.</p>
<sec id="section3-1461444812462848">
<title>Internet rituals and religious negotiations as a form of convergent practice</title>
<p>A central theme in the study of religion online has been the investigation of how religious users employ the Internet to perform and re-create religious rituals. Within studies of ritual online a common observation is that of convergent practice—the blending of rituals and information from multiple sources in ways that can make spirituality online highly individualized and self-directed. Early studies of religion online found that religious adopters of the Internet readily defined it as a sacred space in order to import traditional rituals online and create new forms of religiosity in the space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1461444812462848">O’Leary and Brasher, 1996</xref>). These studies highlighted various forms of adaptation of offline religious ritual, such as prayer in online environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1461444812462848">Schroeder et al., 1998</xref>), the creation of cyber-altars or shrines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1461444812462848">Brasher, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1461444812462848">Cowan, 2005</xref>), and the performance of religious ceremonies and worship services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1461444812462848">Prebish, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1461444812462848">Young, 2004</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1461444812462848">Helland (2008)</xref> argues that the very structure of the Internet supports and even encourages importing diverse religious activities, especially those that facilitate members’ connections to religious sites, festivals, or fellow believers with which they might normally be disconnected due to time–space limitations within contemporary life. Importing religious rituals and artifacts online means religious practitioners can reinterpret context and use, thereby transforming traditional religious practice in ways that challenge religious communities. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1461444812462848">MacWilliams (2006)</xref> discusses how the production and display of Internet <italic>gohonzon</italic>, traditionally a calligraphic scroll and an object of Buddhist veneration, sparked controversy as it made personal and public a sacred artifact normally only accessible to priests or a specific community.</p>
<p>As the Internet offers religious seekers a degree of autonomy, and as more religious information becomes available online, convergent practice facilitates a potential freedom in the acquisition of ritual knowledge that is individualized rather than absorbed from traditional gatekeepers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1461444812462848">Kruger, 2004</xref>). Individuals are encouraged to pursue religious knowledge that will benefit their personal lives, rather than what is required by their community. Convergent practice is also seen in studies of Wiccan communities online, where a member’s sense of belonging comes from engaging in information sharing about solitary magical acts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1461444812462848">Kruger, 2005</xref>). Therefore, sharing discursive reinterpretations of symbols and forms related to religious practice creates an experiential environment, allowing members to come together, yet separately live out their faith.</p>
<p>This blending by users of rituals and information from multiple sources contributes to a self-directed form of spiritual engagement online. The Internet thus provides practitioners with an array of resources and experiences from which they can assemble and personalize their religious behavior and beliefs. The Internet offers greater freedom to religious users by removing many established entry barriers, such as formalized mentoring or training requirements, enabling them to bypass the lengthy initiation processes traditionally required. Convergent practice allows users to create hybrids of traditional rituals, combining different sources of knowledge and practice to create individualized patterns of spiritual life.</p>
<p>However, this flexibility of practice and tendency towards individualism online is not limited to online religious practice. Researchers within other areas of Internet Studies have found the Internet encourages involvement in contexts that allow the production of multiple identities simultaneously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1461444812462848">Katz and Rice, 2002</xref>). This finding highlights that Internet use may encourage a hyper-autonomy. Scholars have noted that online practice may reinforce what is described as “networked individualism”, a movement towards personalized networks facilitated by the social structures of networked society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1461444812462848">Rainie and Wellman, 2012</xref>). The result of this move from place-to-place to person-to-person connectivity means individuals can switch more easily between different social contexts and activities, and so have more control over the sources of knowledge they will draw on and the connections they will make. Concern has been raised by some about networked individualism’s implications for offline socialization and community practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1461444812462848">Campbell, 2004</xref>). Indeed, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1461444812462848">Armfield and Holbert (2003</xref>: 139) found “individual-level religiosity is negatively associated with Internet use”, meaning that Internet users primarily interact at an individual rather than a community level, which might encourage a “secularism model” of engagement. In the case of religious Internet use, this tendency encourages highly individualized patterns of practice rather than linking to official institutions. Thus the Internet offers a marketplace of possibilities guiding users towards personalized convergent practices, creating highly individualized patterns of life online.</p>

<title>The embedded online–offline connection in Internet practice</title>
<p>Another key observation within studies of religion online is the interconnection between online and offline contexts, as practices and beliefs from online and offline contexts are simultaneously connected and engaged. Thus offline attitudes and behaviors often inform life online, and vice versa. Scholars noting this connection between the online and offline contexts have argued that for many, online religious practice may simply be an extension of offline religiosity. For example, Helland’s work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1461444812462848">2007</xref>) shows how members of Hindu and Buddhist traditions actively utilize the Internet to develop network connections between their diaspora communities and country of origin, through web links to sacred sites in India and Tibet or participating in online <italic>puja</italic> where rituals and sacrifices are performed on behalf of a devotee via temple websites. Thus, the Internet allows immigrants in geographically dispersed contexts to connect with each other and their sacred homelands and to create safe, supportive, and religiously tolerant environments online (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1461444812462848">Cheong and Poon, 2009</xref>). In other words, online religious practice is intertwined with rather than divorced from traditional religious frameworks. For many, offline space and architecture serve as a template informing the design and functions of online ritual structures, as many virtual temples and churches emulate the architecture of specific offline religious sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1461444812462848">Jacobs, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1461444812462848">Jenkins, 2008</xref>). In many respects offline religion serves as a source book for religious practice online, creating a trajectory for how online practitioners utilize the Internet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1461444812462848">Campbell, 2005a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1461444812462848">Martinez-Zarate et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Because of the diffuse and boundless nature of the Internet, people often revert to historic narratives for a sense of orientation and to mark the Internet as sacred space; thus, online use becomes informed by established religious narratives. Scholars have found that religious groups’ history and beliefs inform their decision-making regarding technology; similarly, these factors guide their choices related to how and why they use the Internet. For instance, Israeli Orthodox Jews often evoke established Halakhic laws concerning moral behavior when considering the boundaries of Internet use by members of their community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1461444812462848">Campbell, 2010</xref>). Yet because the Internet also offers the possibility to alter traditional religious practices as they are imported online, religious engagement can both enhance and complicate one’s offline religious patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1461444812462848">Robinson-Neal, 2008</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1461444812462848">Piff and Warburg (2005)</xref> found that some Baha’i were able to more fully engage in religious discourse with community members via email lists than in offline contexts. This interconnection means the boundaries between online and offline realities can become blurred, challenging offline institutions seeking to maintain control over their online counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1461444812462848">Barker, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Because online practices are often informed by offline ways of being, the online is closely connected with the offline reality of its users. It is recognized that the Internet has become increasingly assimilated into daily routines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1461444812462848">Wellman and Haythornthwaite, 2002</xref>), and patterns of Internet use often arise out of users’ offline patterns of behavior and belief (i.e. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1461444812462848">Bakardjieva, 2003</xref>). Fears that online practices might supplant engagement in offline groups or routines continue to be challenged by research demonstrating that Internet-based social activities frequently serve as an extension or supplement to offline engagement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1461444812462848">Katz and Rice, 2002</xref>), and in some cases may stimulate social interaction rather than reduce overall social involvement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1461444812462848">Kavanagh and Patterson, 2002</xref>). This contrasts early claims that Internet users would become “sad and lonely” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1461444812462848">Kraut et al., 1998</xref>). Research studies into offline architecture and issues of embodiment further show how these frames inform online interactions within digital social spaces and users’ motivations and behaviors within them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1461444812462848">Stromer-Galley and Martey, 2009</xref>). While tensions may exist between offline and online contexts, researchers increasingly see the intersection of these areas as a blended space, where user choices made in one context often affect others. Researchers recognize that the online–offline distinction is blurred as the Internet has become embedded in everyday realities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1461444812462848">Bakardjieva, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1461444812462848">Campbell and Lövheim, 2011</xref>); or, as Ess and Consalvo argue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1461444812462848">2011</xref>), that for many, the dualistic framing of the online versus the offline no longer holds true.</p>
<p>As religious actors deal with questions of how the Internet shapes sacred conceptions of time, space, and identity, we see a flow between traditional sources of knowledge and their online counterparts. Thus, the Internet becomes an embedded reality, where users’ negotiations between time-honored and new forms of behavior and affiliation can be studied.</p>

<sec id="section5-1461444812462848">
<title>Building community as networks online</title>
<p>Scholars of religion and the Internet have paid notable attention to the growth of online religious communities, and how these groups inform members’ conceptions of and participation in offline religious communities. Seeing community as a network acknowledges that online groups typically function as loosely bounded social networks with varying levels of religious affiliation and commitment. That research has transformed conceptions of religious community, showing that online religious communities often function quite differently from conventional religious institutions and structures. In the late 1990s researchers began investigating the perception of community emerging around online religious groups, from new forms of socialization offered by Islamic cyber-communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1461444812462848">Bunt, 2000</xref>) and Buddhist cybersanghas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1461444812462848">Taylor, 2003</xref>) to marginalized fundamentalist communities now able to attain a public discursive platform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1461444812462848">Howard, 2000</xref>). This research moved from descriptive studies to explorations of members’ motivations for joining and investing in online communities, and how online participation might affect offline community. For example, studies of Christian community online, expressed both in denominational and independent church websites, show that it is not unconnected from offline Christianity, even though traditional communal rituals and practices—such as prayer or Bible study—may need to be modified when imported online (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1461444812462848">Young, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Concerns raised by online communities practices to offline religious institutions have been addressed by studies showing that communities online frequently serve as a “supplement, not substitute” for offline church involvement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1461444812462848">Campbell, 2005a</xref>), as members join online communities to meet specific relational or informational needs rather than to replace a shared, embodied worship experience. Researchers have also recognized that patterns of being online point to shifts in expectations regarding community. For example, Kim’s study of online Buddhist communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1461444812462848">2005</xref>) found that discussion forums function as belief, relational, affective, and/or utilitarian forms of community for their members. Thus, social structures online highlight members’ general desires and expectations regarding how contemporary religious organizations could or should function. Such findings require interrogation of the interpretive and integrative roles that these groups fulfill for members, rather than just looking at instrumental functions.</p>
<p>The network metaphor has become an important way to describe social relations online and offline. Early studies of community online explored questions raised by these blurring social boundaries regarding who goes online, how they create community in an unbounded space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1461444812462848">Baym, 1995</xref>), and how they describe or perform in these groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1461444812462848">Reid, 1995</xref>). Such studies described social practices surfacing online related to negotiation of behavioral and legal boundaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1461444812462848">Mnookin, 1996</xref>), as well as violations of social norms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1461444812462848">Dibbell, 1996</xref>). These studies soon shifted to more critical reflection on the nature of an online community, as compared to the nature of other social forms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1461444812462848">Jones, 1998</xref>). Here researchers highlighted how computer networks uniquely function as social networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1461444812462848">Wellman et al., 1996</xref>). The Internet served as a metaphor for describing emerging patterns of socialization in western society, mirroring shifts from geographic, static affiliations based on familial ties to dynamic networks of relations based on shared interests and preferences. Members of online communities were often identified through shared characteristics or values that drew them to specific online groups (i.e. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1461444812462848">Kollock and Smith, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>Researchers within Internet Studies have also sought to identify different roles and structures within online communities and to demonstrate varying levels of attachment to the community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1461444812462848">Blanchard and Markus, 2004</xref>). Contemporary research frequently focuses on the implications of online–offline interaction between groups, as studies of online community offer insights into larger social shifts and changing notions of the nature of community within society (i.e. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1461444812462848">Kennedy et al., 2008</xref>). In fact, it can be argued that approaching community as a network has become a dominant approach within community studies. Increasingly, communities resemble loose social networks, with varying levels of affiliation and commitment. Recognizing that religious communities function as networks further acknowledges this shift.</p>

<title>The Internet as space for identity performance</title>
<p>Traditionally, studies of religion have been concerned with the integration, consolidation, and control of certain religious identities by groups and institutions. Yet the mediation of social relations online often bypasses traditional structures of identity formation, adding new complexities to such studies. Identity online becomes an act of performance, in which individuals select, assemble, and present their senses of self through a variety of different resources available to them. Early researchers of religion online became concerned about what function traditional religious structures could continue to play in processes of identity construction in a globalized, networked society. Such studies investigated the ways in which religious individuals were being empowered or constrained within online environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1461444812462848">Fernback, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1461444812462848">O’Leary and Brasher, 1996</xref>). Many focused on online religious identity construction amongst youth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1461444812462848">Lövheim, 2004</xref>); new religious movements, i.e. neo-paganism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1461444812462848">Berger and Ezzy, 2004</xref>); and religious minorities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1461444812462848">Cheong and Poon, 2009</xref>). This work showed that the Internet offers new possibilities for building and presenting religious identity, especially for people who lack such opportunities in their local offline context, or those belonging to fringe groups who may face a higher degree of public scrutiny (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1461444812462848">Dawson and Hennebry, 2004</xref>). It also presented the Internet as a tool to assemble religious identities in ways that are less structured than the avenues offered by official institutions, such as allowing young practitioners of Witchcraft to develop their Wiccan identity by drawing on multiple online sources beyond the oversight of a single coven (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1461444812462848">Lövheim and Linderman, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Yet the anonymity and transience of online interactions can also bring unintended consequences, such as identity fragmentation and conflict between the truth claims of online religious authorities and their offline counterparts. It has been suggested that such experiences can inhibit an individual’s ability to develop a cohesive religious identity, or restrict one’s reaffirmation of the accepted boundaries between traditional and personal religious identity. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1461444812462848">Lövheim (2004)</xref> found that Swedish Christian youth seeking to present their personalized faith narrative online struggled between what they perceived as authentic religious identities and those which religious leaders might interpret as “fake” or unsanctioned. Current research on religious identity online affirms findings within online community studies noting that online interaction often becomes a supplement and not a substitute for offline religious engagement. Thus, expressions of religious identity online are not separate from an individual’s identity in life outside the Internet, and should not be studied as such (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1461444812462848">Clark, 2004</xref>). The Internet becomes a place for building one’s religious self, combining experimentation with different ways of being and the adoption of traditional identity roles.</p>
<p>It is clear from contemporary research that religious identity is not seen as absorbed through the Internet, nor is it purely imported from the offline context. Identity online is highly malleable rather than something that is fixed. This notion has raised many questions related to how identity is assembled and presented online. Identity online as a performance draws on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1461444812462848">Goffman’s (1959)</xref> idea of the dramaturgical approach, where social identity is understood as something that is performed by the individual. Here an individual actor draws on a variety of communicative sources in order to perform a given persona. Increasingly, the Internet is seen as one of a number of tools within modernity empowering individuals to act out their identity in unique ways.</p>
<p>Identity negotiation has been an important focus within Internet Studies, as early researchers explored the potential of computer-mediated communication to transform the social construction of identity (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1461444812462848">Turkle, 1995</xref>). In the 1990s the Internet was often framed as an “identity workshop” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1461444812462848">Bruckman, 1992</xref>) and so concerns were raised about how online identity experimentation might destabilize identity, as reduced self-regulation online seemingly promoted uninhibited behavior, dishonesty, and deception (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1461444812462848">Donath, 1998</xref>). However, over time researchers found that Internet users tended to create online identities that closely resembled their offline identities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1461444812462848">Baym, 1998</xref>), and even ascribed or evaluated other identities online based on offline stereotypes, such as gender or race (i.e. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1461444812462848">Burkhalter, 1999</xref>). Recent studies of identity online emphasize the need to study identity construction online as a <italic>social</italic> process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1461444812462848">Kendall, 2002</xref>). Paying attention to the features of different online environments becomes important for understanding how identity becomes integrated within an individual’s social context in their everyday life, acting as a foundation for building offline relationships and attitudes (i.e. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1461444812462848">Elias and Lemish, 2009</xref>). Thus identity online, both in religious and non-religious contexts, creates new, dynamic opportunities for self-expression of belief and lifestyle, presenting identity as a process of performance.</p>

<title>The Internet’s contribution to changing conceptions of authority</title>
<p>Finally, the diversity of religious practice online, from worship in cyberchurches to seeking religious counsel on “ask the rabbi” or “ask the imam” sites, highlights a potential struggle between traditional and new sources of authority. Discussion about how webmasters, moderators and designers may constitute new classes of religious leaders or emerge as religious interpreters online simply due to their prominence online raises interesting questions about the nature of authority on the Internet. Authority online is marked by a tension between the rise of new authority figures and traditional offline leaders. For instance, Anderson’s early work on Islam online (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1461444812462848">1999</xref>) identified several classes of online religious interpreters—from computer professionals whose technical skills grant them status online to digital entrepreneurs who use the Internet to promote specific agendas—highlighting the Internet’s ability to create positions of power outside traditional structures. Other scholars note the rise of “instant experts” online, allowing people to have an online influence through perceived expertise, thwarting the time- honored religious training or prescribed initiation rites that would traditionally establish their position offline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1461444812462848">Berger and Ezzy, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1461444812462848">Krogh and Pillfant, 2004</xref>). Online leadership roles have also been noted to influence individuals’ standing in their offline religious communities. Herring’s Christian newsgroup study showed how the roles established in online conversation communities may have the ability to inform and change perception of offline religious power hierarchies by introducing new forms of ”governing authority” online (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1461444812462848">Herring, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Researchers have further noted that the Internet allows online groups to transgress established religious structures by taking the normally private discussions reserved for institutional administrators into public forums, enabling members to engage in debate on beliefs or policy in a way that is often not possible offline. Such acts may undermine authority structures, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1461444812462848">Piff and Warburg (2005)</xref> found in their study of a Baha’i discussion forum where online debates over the offline governing body policy challenged official positions and the perceived unity of the community. Thus online discourse and social capital become a new way of establishing religious authority and exerting public influence within a given community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1461444812462848">Helland, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1461444812462848">Turner, 2007</xref>). The rise in unofficial or unsanctioned sites for certain religious groups illustrates the challenge that the Internet poses to traditional, “legitimate” sources of sacred knowledge—for example, Islamic online fatwa sites may offer the counsel of both recognized religious scholars and independent web experts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1461444812462848">Bunt, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>However, while the Internet creates complexities for offline religious authorities, it can also provide opportunities for maintaining or re-establishing control. Offline religious authorities may infiltrate their online counterparts in order to monitor members’ behaviors, and use such knowledge to reinforce their established structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1461444812462848">Barker, 2005</xref>). Some communities may establish official policies or online filtering tools in order to monitor acceptable Internet use and thereby control online behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1461444812462848">Campbell, 2010</xref>). The result is that the Internet may be used to fortify community boundaries, thereby creating another sphere controlled by offline religious institutions or traditional forms of authority (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1461444812462848">Barzilai-Nahon and Barzilai, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Authority online has been a concern not just for religious groups, but for other social and political organizations as well (i.e. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1461444812462848">Ahuja and Carley, 1998</xref>)—yet it has often been treated as a broad, undefined concept (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1461444812462848">Campbell, 2007</xref>). Thus, claims that the Internet challenges traditional authority online often fail to clarify what aspects of authority are actually being challenged. Recent research has sought to explore authority online in more concrete ways by distinguishing between authority roles, structures, ideological systems, and sources of legitimation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1461444812462848">Busch, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1461444812462848">Campbell, 2007</xref>). The result has been that the Internet is framed as a threat to certain roles and hierarchies and as a tool of empowerment for others. It represents a sphere for the renegotiation and canonization of new sources of authority (i.e. webmasters, forum moderators and bloggers), which become framed as knowledge experts as they achieve social power. It is also framed by some offline authorities, political as well as religious, as a realm in which to solidify their positions and control. Thus, Internet Studies becomes an important space to investigate how authority is constructed, maintained, and communicated within a networked society, and to reconsider previous debates about the nature of authority and who holds the legitimate voice for a particular community in the Internet age.</p>

<title>Religion online as a microcosm for discussing key issues in Internet Studies</title>
<p>This critical review of the research shows a number of common trends can be observed within studies of religion online. These include encouraging the convergence of traditional and new forms of ritual or social practice, recognizing online and offline contexts, supporting networked forms of community, facilitating fluid performances of religious identities and contributing to shifting conceptions of authority. Together, these characteristics of religion online describe a loosening or re-presentation of traditional boundaries and practices representing a type of “networked religion”, where religion is framed and functions in terms of networked relations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1461444812462848">Campbell, 2012</xref>). However, this overview also argues that key concerns within the study of religion online—regarding how digital culture shapes notions of identity, community, authority, and authenticity—are clearly evident within Internet Studies as a whole. Thus this article suggests that focusing on studies of religion online creates a defined microcosm within which researchers can engage in a close reading of the ways traditional narratives, social practices, and structures have evolved in and adapted to a network society. Paying close attention to the key findings from subfields such as religion and the Internet helps scholars to more clearly identify the wider effects of the Internet on everyday life.</p>
<p>Arguably, studies of religion online have not addressed every core area of inquiry found within Internet Studies as a whole. For example, scholarly interest and critical investigations of power structures online as they relate to issues of gender and sexuality, which have been a key interest within Internet Studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1461444812462848">Ess and Consalvo, 2011</xref>), are often overlooked in studies of religion and the Internet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1461444812462848">Campbell and Lövheim, 2011</xref>). Other dominant research themes noted by Internet scholars—such as the influence of the Internet on civic participation, political contexts, and knowledge management and production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1461444812462848">Rice, 2005</xref>)—that have potential implication for religion online have also been largely unexplored. Yet the core issues noted in this review—related to issues of networking, community, identity, public relationships and influence and daily practices—are recognized as common, shared concerns amongst Internet scholars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1461444812462848">Rice, 2005</xref>). Studying the particular within Internet Studies can offer a concrete way to explore how this medium impacts the broader social and cultural interactions of Internet users, and how we as global citizens in a network society create meaning for our lives. Thus, comparing findings across subfields within Internet Studies becomes essential in order to verify claims about the effects this technological space may have on society, and to more fully describe the new borderlands of interactions, or third spaces, emerging between online and offline contexts. Therefore I argue that studying life online within a specific microcosm, such as the practices of religious Internet users, can lead to a more refined understanding of the changes within the complex, interconnected, wired world that Internet researchers seek to explore.</p>
