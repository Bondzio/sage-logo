<p>This book provides an excellent and concise account of the pathogenesis, complications and management of diabetes. I found this a very well-written and easy-to-read book. The figures, photographs and tables are all excellent and appropriate. The book is also well laid out with clear chapter titles that will help the reader target key areas of interest. It is suitable for a wide range of health professionals in primary and secondary care and is of a size that can fit into a jacket pocket or handbag.</p>
<p>The importance of a working knowledge of diabetes by health care professionals is underlined by an early statement: ‘Diabetes and its sequelae accounted for about 3.8 million deaths in 2007, approximately 6% of the total world mortality.’ Recent audits in the UK have found that on average 15% of hospital inpatient beds are occupied by a patient with diabetes. So it is important that an understanding of diabetes should extend across speciality barriers and this text would go some way to achieve this.</p>
<p>The first two chapters on epidemiology and diagnosis are concise and to the point. These are followed by three chapters on the different types of diabetes (type 1, type 2 and MODY and other types of diabetes). This is very important as it clearly delineates the ‘other causes’ from, in particular, type 2 diabetes, which I know confuses many groups of health care professionals, and also dispels the misconception that there is only either type 1 and type 2 diabetes. This first section is followed by chapters on treatment of the different diabetes disorders and also a chapter on diet and exercise. Then there is a longer, well-illustrated chapter on complications, followed by one each on hypoglycaemia and on diabetic ketoacidosis and HONK.</p>
<p>My only criticism with the book is that the section on erectile dysfunction, a condition that affects up to 70% of men with type 2 diabetes, had only a brief mention with no consideration of psychological impact, or the knowledge that there is a high prevalence of hypogonadism and failure of phosphodiesterase inhibitor therapy is associated with low testosterone.</p>
<p>In the introduction, the authors state: ‘The aim of this third edition of <italic>Fast facts: Diabetes mellitus</italic> is to provide readers with an up-to-date picture of our understanding of diabetes mellitus and its various causes, its clinical manifestations and the treatment strategies that can be used to reduce the burden of its metabolic consequences.’ In my mind the book has more than adequately achieved this goal.</p>
