<p>Australia and New Zealand both face significant psychiatry workforce shortages. With substantial proportion of psychiatrists in both Australia and New Zealand approaching retirement age, recruitment into psychiatry remains a critical challenge. The 1999 Australian Medical Workforce Advisory Committee (AMWAC) report on the <italic>Specialist Psychiatry Workforce in Australia</italic> found that access to psychiatrists was inadequate, particularly in rural areas. Overall, for every one RANZCP Fellow:</p>
<list id="list1-1039856213479470" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>In Australia there are 8919 people; and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>In New Zealand there are 15,000 people.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Statistics taken from the Medical Schools Outcome Database (MSOD) in 2008 showed that from all medical students entering medical school in 2008, only 3.2% chose psychiatry as their preferred area of medicine to pursue.</p>
<p>Several organisations have developed recruitment strategies to deal with shortages in specialties with varying levels of effectiveness. Most notably, The Royal College of Psychiatrists in the United Kingdom has embarked on a five year College Recruitment Strategy, aiming to increase recruitment to their core training year one (CT1) grade of Core Psychiatry Training, achieving a 50% increase in applications and a 95% fill rate by the end of the five year campaign, running from 2011–2016.</p>
<p>A number of RANZCP’s strategic priorities over the current three year period (2012–2014) focus on recruitment into psychiatry, including:</p>
<list id="list2-1039856213479470" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Attract an increased number of medical graduates to the speciality of psychiatry;</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Support for workforce planning, recruitment growth, retention and challenging role of psychiatrists both in public and private sectors and rural and disadvantaged areas.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The RANZCP together with the Commonwealth Department of Health and Aging (DoHA) recognise recruitment into psychiatry as a vital pathway to meeting future mental healthcare demands in Australia and New Zealand. The Recruitment into Psychiatry Project is a new initiative the RANZCP will undertake over 2 years which will be funded by the DoHA. The project will aim to increase recruitment into the College training program by better engaging with potential trainees including medical students, medical graduates and other medical practitioners. The recruitment project is coordinated centrally by the College, and the implementation is at a local level.</p>
<p>The RANZCP is developing a range of strategies within this project which will aim to attract the increasing number of medical students to the College training program. Strategies will look to address misconceptions about the specialty, better engage potential trainees, and increase their exposure and understanding of the speciality. The RANZCP will also have increased involvement with universities offering the Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS) to facilitate increased engagement with medical students.</p>
