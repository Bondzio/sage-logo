<abstract>
<p>Although there is evidence that oral antibiotic prescriptions for children have decreased since the 1990s, antibiotic resistance continues to be a problem. This study evaluated the caregivers’ understanding of antibiotic use for their children and identified demographic characteristics that may contribute to inappropriate antibiotic-seeking behavior. Caregivers were asked how often the child should receive antibiotics for common medical conditions and about factors to improve patient compliance. This study found that caregivers overexpected antibiotic use with upper respiratory infection, ear infection, and pneumonia. Caretakers with lower incomes and on Medicaid comprised the higher percentage of overusers. The most important factors to improve patient compliance were explanation of the name and indication for antibiotic use. This study showed that demographic variables play a role in caregivers’ expectations of antibiotic use. Effective communication of physicians with caregivers on antibiotic use can be an important strategy to improve patient compliance.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Although there is evidence that oral antibiotic prescriptions for children have decreased by 20% to 40% since the 1990s,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922812439243">1</xref></sup> antibiotic resistance continues to be a problem. The causes of antimicrobial resistance are multifactorial. Antibiotic overuse is a most likely cause. Parental misconceptions about the use of antibiotics contribute significantly to antibiotic overuse and, thus, to health care overuse.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0009922812439243">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0009922812439243">3</xref></sup> One study showed that physicians who thought that a parent wanted an antibiotic prescription were more likely to give a bacterial diagnosis (70% vs 31%) and to prescribe antibiotics to them (62% vs 7%).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0009922812439243">4</xref></sup> In addition, physicians are reportedly being pressured to prescribe antibiotics to expedite return to work, school, and day care.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0009922812439243">2</xref></sup> Research done in Minnesota and Wisconsin showed that providing multiple and varied informational messages about antibiotics may increase knowledge of appropriate antibiotic use and lessen patient demand for antibiotic prescriptions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0009922812439243">5</xref></sup> In a study by Bauchner and colleagues, 78% of the physician respondents cited that educating parents is the single most important program to reduce inappropriate antimicrobial use.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0009922812439243">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0009922812439243">6</xref></sup> They recommended that to reduce the use of inappropriate antimicrobial agents in the outpatient setting, changes in patient–physician communication need to be done. Barden’s study showed the differences in physician and parent perceptions on antibiotic use.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0009922812439243">7</xref></sup> The authors suggested that educational efforts to improve communication between parents and physicians are crucial for improving antibiotic use.</p>
<p>Research projects have been completed, focusing at the physician level. A study done by Watson et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0009922812439243">8</xref></sup> evaluating antimicrobial use for pediatric upper-respiratory infections showed that although physicians recognize the problem of antibiotic resistance, their reported practices were found to be not in line with current published recommendations. Considerable variations in prescribing practices were seen among physicians. Most important, patients’ beliefs were correlated with their physicians’ practices. Thus, the authors recommended that education of parents and patients on the appropriate use of antibiotics by their physicians is as important as establishing more uniform standards for antibiotic use among physicians. Much as all these studies emphasized patient education on antibiotic use, very few studies have been done, however, to evaluate the parents’ or caregivers’ perspectives on how physicians educate them on the use of antibiotics and their baseline knowledge on antibiotics. Very little is known about how parental cultural and demographic characteristics may contribute to inappropriate antibiotic-seeking behavior. Much needs to be known if different educational strategies must be use to target patients based on their demographic characteristics and culture. This study was undertaken to evaluate caregivers’ understanding and expectations of antibiotic use for their children and to identify caregivers’ demographic characteristics that may contribute to inappropriate antibiotic-seeking behavior. Secondary objectives were to obtain caregivers’ perspectives of the communication between them and their children’s physicians about the use of antibiotics and to identify factors that contribute to patient compliance.</p>

<sec id="section2-0009922812439243" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>This study was a prospective, observational, and cross-sectional study of primary caregivers of patients 0 to 18 years of age in an academic pediatric clinic and 2 private pediatric clinics. The academic pediatric clinic has larger African American and Hispanic populations than the other private clinics. It has 4 primary care providers, whereas the 2 private pediatric clinics have 3 primary care providers.</p>
<p>A survey was administered randomly to primary caregivers of patients in these clinics over a 2-month period. Adults who were not primary caregivers of the patients were excluded from the study. Survey forms were administered in English and Spanish. The survey was approved by the institutional review board, and all data were anonymous. Caregivers completed the survey without assistance and placed the completed forms in a sealed box. The literacy level of the survey was a Flesch-Kincaid grade level of 8.8. A pilot survey was initially conducted, but these data were not included in the analysis.</p>
<p>The survey requested the child’s current age, gender, ethnicity, health insurance coverage, household income, the number of children in the household, the number of caregivers in the household, and the primary caregiver’s age and highest level of education.</p>
<p>The survey first asked how often the caregiver believed that the child should receive antibiotics for 20 medical conditions. Caregivers were asked to circle one of the following options—always, sometimes, never, and don’t know—for each condition listed. In the final analysis, the authors focused on 8 most common disease conditions in pediatrics: upper-respiratory infection or cold, diarrhea, ear infection, throat infection, pneumonia, fever, viral infection, and eye infection. The authors evaluated the appropriateness of treatment with antibiotics of these 8 medical conditions based on evidence-based medicine. The conditions never treated with antibiotics were upper-respiratory infection, cold, and viral infection. The conditions sometimes treated with antibiotics were diarrhea, ear infection, throat infection, pneumonia, fever, and eye infection.</p>
<p>The survey then asked the caregivers if the child had ever received an antibiotic. If the child had never received an antibiotic, they were asked to turn in the survey because it was complete. Those who responded yes, were asked to complete the reverse side of the survey and were asked how long antibiotics should be given, if they keep antibiotics that were not finished, and what factors they believed contributed to improved patient compliance on antibiotic use. They were also asked about counseling points provided by their physicians and how well they felt the physician communicated to them about the antibiotic. Finally, they were asked where they obtained their antibiotic prescriptions and where they obtained information regarding antibiotics.</p>
<p>A series of <italic>t</italic> tests was used to determine if demographics were linked to knowledge of indications for antibiotic use on the 8 medical conditions of interest. The dependent variable for the model was a score based on the prescribing beliefs of the 8 most common conditions. For this analysis, we compared participants who answered 4 or more conditions incorrectly with an overexpectation of getting antibiotics versus those who did not have an overexpectation. Overexpectation was defined as expectation of antibiotic use that was more than what is recommended.</p>
<p><italic>t</italic> Tests were also used to compare differences in demographics among those who tend to complete the full course of antibiotics versus those who did not and among those who kept unfinished antibiotics versus those who did not.</p>

<sec id="section3-0009922812439243" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>There were 246 caregivers who completed the study. A total of 75% of the patients had received antibiotics, and 25% of the patients had never received antibiotics previously. The age range of the caregivers’ children was 2 weeks to 16 years of age, with a median of 2 years; 53% were younger than 2 years of age. Demographic data of the caregivers are provided in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0009922812439243">Table 1</xref>. The age range of the caregivers was 20 to 62 years, with a median of 27 years of age. The number of children in the household ranged from 1 to 9, with 73% of the households having 2 or fewer children. Among the households, 75% had 2 caregivers or more, and 25% had only 1 caregiver.</p>

For these analyses, we compared the demographic characteristics of caregivers who overexpected antibiotic use for 4 or more of the 8 medical conditions incorrectly (overusers) versus those who overexpected antibiotic use for 3 or fewer of the 8 medical conditions incorrectly (nonoverusers). The analysis found that Hispanics made up 9% of the overusers and 25% of nonoverusers (<italic>P</italic> = .001).

Lower frequency of dosing was very important to 42% of the caregivers, and shorter length of treatment was very important to 37% of the caregivers for compliance. Cost was very important to 27% of the caregivers, but only 20% of the caregivers considered taste as very important for compliance.</p>

<p>The most common sources of antibiotic prescriptions were physician clinics (90%), the emergency room (49%), walk-in clinics (16%), and the health department (9%). The most common sources of information for antibiotic use were physicians (86%), pharmacists (76%), and nurses (44%). It was found that 24% of the caregivers relied on the Internet, 11% relied on newspapers or magazines, and 7% relied on the television for information on antibiotic use. Only 7.6% of the caregivers obtained information from child care centers.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our study showed that misconceptions and lack of knowledge exist among caregivers regarding antibiotic use. The caregivers expected antibiotic use to be more than what is recommended for upper-respiratory infections, ear infections, and pneumonia. Patient education strategies need to focus on these 3 conditions. However, misconceptions about antibiotic use for the 8 medical conditions commonly seen in pediatric practice ranged from 46% to as high as 70%. Therefore, every effort should be made by physicians to educate caregivers on appropriate antibiotic use for these medical conditions. Specifically, caregivers need to learn that many infections are caused by viruses, and antibiotics are not effective for viral illnesses.</p>
<p>The demographic characteristics of caregivers were seen to play a role in overexpectation of antibiotic use in our study. It disproves the assumption that caregivers, in general, expect antibiotic prescriptions from their physicians when they seek medical care for their children. In our study, caregivers with a higher annual income (more than $60 000) and patients with private insurance tended not to expect antibiotic prescriptions. Hispanic caretakers tend not to expect antibiotic prescriptions. A possible explanation for this is that most are uninsured or underinsured, and they usually have to pay out-of-pocket for medications. There could also be a cultural belief to use herbals or home remedies versus medication, but our survey did not inquire about these products. Caregivers of Medicaid patients and those with lower annual incomes ($20 000-$60 000) were categorized more as overusers. The demographic characteristics of age and gender of the child as well as Caucasian and African American ethnic background were not different between overusers and nonusers. The education level of the caregiver also did not play a role in determining if a caregiver was an overuser or nonoveruser. Health care providers may assume that a more educated caregiver would understand more about the child’s disease and treatment; however, our study did not show this.</p>
<p>Although the caregivers ranked the physicians very well in terms of always explaining the medication name, dose, length of treatment, and indications for their use, only two thirds of the caregivers said that their physician extensively and effectively educated them about the use of antibiotics. Although attempts to explain the medication name, use, and indications were always made by the physicians, the caregivers still thought that antibiotic use was not extensively and sufficiently discussed with them. Only about half of the caregivers said that their physicians always explained adverse effects of the antibiotics. This means that the quality of patient–physician communication needs to be improved.</p>
<p>The most important factors to improve patient compliance were related to physician communication regarding medication use and the indications for their use. The adverse effects and frequency of dosing were fairly important to the caretakers. As mentioned previously, adverse effects were always explained to only half of the caretakers. Surprisingly, the largest percentage of patients’ caregivers did not consider cost and taste as important factors for compliance. Cost may not be a factor because the majority of the patients had Medicaid or private insurance, which usually provides drug prescription coverage. Some children easily take medications, whereas others do not. We did not ask the caregiver about ease of administration to the child in our study but would have predicted that improved taste would lead to increased compliance.</p>
<p>The major sources of antibiotic prescriptions were the physicians’ clinics. However, half of the patients’ caregivers obtained antibiotic prescriptions from the emergency department (ED). One study demonstrated that increased parental use of the ED was associated with increased childhood ED use, particularly nonurgent visits, after controlling for other factors that contributed to high childhood ED use.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0009922812439243">9</xref></sup> Thus, we emphasize the need to educate caregivers on ED use for nonurgent medical visits and to provide open communication with them at all times to minimize unnecessary ED visits.</p>
<p>The majority of the caregivers obtained information from physicians, pharmacists, and nurses. However, a substantial number of our caregivers obtained information on antibiotic use from nonmedical sources, such as the Internet, newspapers, magazines, television, and child care centers. Information from nonmedical sources can sometimes have commercial biases and may not always be accurate. Specific information on Web sites was not asked for in the survey, so the caregivers could be using reputable health care Web sites that are HONcode certified. Misinformation can contribute to misconceptions about antibiotic use.</p>
<p>A limitation of the study concerns caregiver misconceptions about the questions because they were asked to complete the survey without assistance from the investigator. The survey was also conducted locally, and caregivers’ understanding for antibiotic use could vary in various areas of the United States. Foster and colleagues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0009922812439243">10</xref></sup> conducted a study focused on the Hispanic population and children’s medication use. They found a difference between Spanish-speaking and English-speaking Hispanic patients, but our study did not compare these subgroups of the patient population.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>This study determined that certain caregiver demographics correlate with understanding and expectation of antibiotic use in children. Educating the patients’ caregivers on antibiotic use is important in potentially reducing antibiotic-seeking behavior. It is important for physicians caring for children to understand that parents and caregivers have a long-standing knowledge of antibiotics, which they have acquired from their own personal experiences in the past. There is a need for physicians to be able to identify the caregivers’ understanding of and expectations regarding antibiotic use and to be able to individualize their approach in trying to educate caregivers on appropriate antibiotic use. Physicians need to develop more effective and easily understood ways of communicating to patients’ caregivers about antibiotic use because physician communication on the use of antibiotics was the most important factor in improving patient compliance. Educational interventions aimed at minimizing nonurgent ED visits should be directed at the caregivers. Physicians need to encourage caregivers to openly discuss with them information and antibiotic prescriptions that they have obtained from other sources to minimize misconceptions about antibiotic use.</p>
