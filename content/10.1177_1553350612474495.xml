<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Since the first documentation of natural orifice translumenal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) in 2004 by Kalloo et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1553350612474495">1</xref></sup> there has been substantial progress, yet many of the original questions posed by the 2005 White Paper<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1553350612474495">2</xref></sup> remain unanswered. In particular, issues regarding methods of education and training at both individual and collective levels further lead to questions regarding who is best suited to carry out NOTES procedures. Opinion at the time was largely in favor of multidisciplinary team–led procedures, combining skill sets from both gastroenterologists and gastrointestinal laparoscopic surgeons.</p>
<p>Driven by the possibility of fewer scars, less abdominal trauma, and possibly enhanced patient recovery, the field has seen a rapid expansion in interest and ideology. Indeed, looking at the scope of laparoscopic procedures available now since the very first studies almost 20 years ago,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1553350612474495">3</xref></sup> the possibilities for NOTES are likely to extend well beyond the current remit. This highlights the imminent need for a training pathway if NOTES is to have staying power as a credible and advantageous clinical option for individual procedures and patients in the future. The importance of this issue cannot be underestimated. Errors and misjudgments by surgeons can endanger patients’ lives,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1553350612474495">4</xref></sup> highlighting the need for extensive evaluation and research in NOTES prior to widespread implementation, particularly if the learning curve is similar to or steeper than that seen during the introduction of laparoscopic surgery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1553350612474495">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1553350612474495"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1553350612474495">7</xref></sup></p>
<p>Any adjuncts used to augment training would thus undoubtedly be vital. Animal models, box trainers, and virtual reality simulators have been used successfully for many years in training surgeons in laparoscopic and endoscopic techniques and are continually evolving and becoming ever more sophisticated. In today’s surgical training, the use of simulators plays a key role, reflected by their use by the Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons training in both laparoscopy and endoscopy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1553350612474495">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>The aim of this article is to review current evidence relating to education and methods of training in NOTES and to evaluate the wider training needs and opportunities for future NOTES surgeons.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section3-1553350612474495">
<title>Literature Search</title>
<p>A review of all the published literature on education and training in NOTES was performed, with the aim of evaluating the following questions:</p>
<list id="list1-1553350612474495" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>What are the current training methods and modalities in use for NOTES, and what is the level of evidence to support their use?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>How has clinical training in NOTES been quantified, and what is the evidence relating to performance of NOTES operators of different skill sets and backgrounds?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>What clinical NOTES training programs have been established and what are the future wider training needs?</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>A comprehensive database search was undertaken using PubMed, MEDLINE (Ovid), EMBASE, and Google Scholar. Inclusion criteria included all original studies evaluating education and training modalities in NOTES, including those comparing proficiency of different NOTES operators. The search terms used were the following: <italic>natural orifice endoscopic surgery, simulation, training, virtual reality, box, education</italic>, and <italic>programme</italic>.</p>
<p>In PubMed, the following search algorithms were used: “(Natural Orifice Endoscopic Surgery) AND (simulation OR training OR virtual reality OR box)” and “(Natural Orifice Endoscopic Surgery) AND (surgeon OR gastroenterologists).” MESH terms included were education, endoscopy, and natural orifice endoscopic surgery.</p>
<p>Studies have been evaluated using the Oxford Centre for Evidence-based Medicine Levels of Evidence,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1553350612474495">9</xref></sup> commonly used for clinical trials.</p>
</sec></sec>
<sec id="section4-1553350612474495" sec-type="results">
<title>Results</title>
<p>There were 25 studies included in this review, evaluating 11 nonanimal studies, 8 animal studies, and 6 descriptions of NOTES education and training programs. The majority of evidence supporting simulator use in NOTES education is on the ELITE (endoscopic-laparoscopic interdisciplinary training entity) phantom, with 5 reports on this box trainer system.</p>
<sec id="section5-1553350612474495">
<title>What Are the Current Training Methods and Modalities in Use for NOTES, and What Is the Level of Evidence to Support Their Use?</title>
<sec id="section6-1553350612474495">
<title>ELITE Trainer</title>
<p>The ELITE is an ex vivo model designed for endoscopic-laparoscopic and NOTES training. It is a full-scale replica of a human female adult with various translumenal abdominal access points (transesophageal, transgastric, and transrectal). The gastrointestinal tract and abdominal cavity are airtight, and other abdominal viscera are present to help simulate real operating conditions. The ELITE trainer is supported by 5 publications.</p>
<p>In the initial study by Gillen et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1553350612474495">10</xref></sup> a mixture of novices, endoscopists, laparoscopists, and dual experts each received multiple cycles of training on the ELITE manikin. The task was to remove check marks placed in all 4 of the abdominal quadrants. A linear learning curve was shown with a significant reduction in overall time in all participants over subsequent attempts. The reduction in time taken was significant in endoscopic and laparoscopic novices but not in experts. The performance outcomes comparing endoscopic experts with novices demonstrate construct validity of the phantom. Participants were additionally assessed on a Likert scale, with results indicating that training on the ELITE makes sense, is realistic, is recommendable, is suitable for further skill assessment, improves NOTES skills, and improves endoscopic skills, thus demonstrating face and content validity of the simulator.</p>
<p>In the second study by Gillen et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1553350612474495">11</xref></sup> performance in a simulated transsigmoidal cholecystectomy of novices and endoscopic and laparoscopic experts was compared between those who had received training on the ELITE and a control group who had no training. Results showed the trained group to have a significantly shorter operative time, suggesting predictive validity on the simulator. There was no significant training effect in laparoscopists. The fact that novices were overall faster than endoscopists (although not statistically significant), yet slower than laparoscopists suggests that the construct was biased toward laparoscopists. Face validity was again assessed using a Likert scale, with all participants recommending the ELITE model and suggesting that it improved NOTES skills.</p>
<p>The study by Clark et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1553350612474495">12</xref></sup> compared NOTES navigation between novices and endoscopic experts. Novices took significantly longer to complete the task supporting construct validity of the ELITE simulator. Analysis of the hand movements was also carried out based on video tracking and graded on a scale of 0 to 9 (9 implying most control and 0 erratic behavior), with experts scoring 7 and novices 6.</p>
<p>Sodergren et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1553350612474495">13</xref></sup> used the ELITE manikin to perform navigation to the appendix and gallbladder, diathermy of the appendix base and gallbladder fossa, and clipping of the cystic duct during the investigation of horizon stabilization software. No overall significant improvement was shown, and there was no learning curve demonstrated.</p>
<p>The final ELITE study reported was by Fiolka et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1553350612474495">14</xref></sup> However, in this case, the phantom was adjusted with a cotton sponge layer integrated into organs as a dissection layer. Organ shift secondary to respiration was also introduced. Surgeons of varying grades participated in NOTES cholecystectomies, and a Likert scale graded 1 to 6 was used to assess face and content validity. In all aspects, the ELITE model was graded either 5 or 6, with only materials being found as satisfactory (graded as 3).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1553350612474495">
<title>Box Trainers</title>
<p>Five box trainer simulators for NOTES were evaluated in the literature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1553350612474495">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1553350612474495"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1553350612474495"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1553350612474495"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1553350612474495">19</xref></sup> Spaun et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1553350612474495">15</xref></sup> used a simple training box (36 × 28 × 15 cm<sup>3</sup>), with endoscopes passed through “structural holes,” providing stability. The bimanual task consisted of grasping a rubber ring from a Sea Spikes Pod (a small bowl-shaped object with flexible rubber cones of differing lengths, shapes, and colors), transferring between instruments and replacing on another spike. The 27 participants were a mixture of experts (surgeons with &gt;7 years endoscopy and laparoscopy experience) and novices (surgeons with &lt;7 years endoscopy experience/NOTES lab experience only). Three different endoscopes were trialed with the same task, and overall, experts were significantly faster than novices, implying construct validity of the simulator. However, it should be noted that of the 3 different endoscopes used with the same task (a nonproduction R-Scope [Olympus], Direct Drive Endoscopic System [Boston Scientific], and a standard a dual-channel endoscope [Olympus]), the difference between experts and novices was only significant for the dual-channel endoscope.</p>
<p>Spaun et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1553350612474495">16</xref></sup> used a bench-top trainer to further compare the EndoSAMURAI platform from Olympus with the standard dual-channel endoscope. As opposed to the previous box trainer study, this used a trainer with a structural hole 12 cm from the target. Participants were 2 novices, 7 intermediates, and 3 experts (surgeons with endoscopic, laparoscopic, and NOTES experience). The tasks were picking pins and dropping inside a small door and suturing. They compared 2 tasks and found the newer EndoSAMURAI platform to be significantly faster and more accurate (number of pins dropped and reliability of suture). Experts showed faster times in both tasks compared with the other groups, and the intermediates showed faster times than the novices, indicating a degree of construct validity; however, neither difference was statistically significant.</p>
<p>Thompson et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1553350612474495">17</xref></sup> performed a study to evaluate the use of the Direct Drive Endoscopic System mentioned previously in NOTES procedures with laparoscopic and endoscopic experts involved. A bench-top model of a sphere with dots placed on it was initially used to evaluate movement of the platform, followed by a similar trial as mentioned before with the Sea Spikes Pod. This was followed by endoscopic mucosal resection from 2 ex vivo porcine stomachs. Finally, a transcolonic NOTES exploration was performed on a live porcine model, with suturing and knot tying. It is documented that a learning curve “was evident with all prescribed tasks,” with accuracy and speed improving after repetition.</p>
<p>Wagner et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1553350612474495">18</xref></sup> used a box trainer designed and constructed by them but not further described in the study. The speed of performing tasks of picking up items and placing them in different locations was compared between novices, gastroenterologists, and laparoscopists. The first task assessed maneuverability, the second was to pick up a swab and place it in a basket, and the third was to pick up a swab and place it on a shelf. They found novices to be significantly worse than both endoscopy and laparoscopy experts in all tasks, supporting construct validity of the box trainer. In addition, linear learning curves were found for all tasks.</p>
<p>Finally, the natural orifice simulated surgical environment (NOSsE), a converted box trainer for NOTES simulation was originally described by Clark et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1553350612474495">20</xref></sup> The NOSsE is described as a standard laparoscopic training box adapted with access points through the box itself and lumenal organs contained inside it simulated from liquid latex and solid organs made with foam filler.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1553350612474495">20</xref></sup> James et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1553350612474495">19</xref></sup> compared the speed at which novices and endoscopic experts navigated the NOSsE cavity using a flexible endoscope. Experts showed increased performance during this task, viewing the selected targets significantly more often in the set time, supporting construct validity of the NOSsE.</p>

<title>Animal Models</title>

<title>In vivo models</title>
<p>Gillen et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1553350612474495">11</xref></sup> compared novices, surgeons, and endoscopists performing in vivo porcine cholecystectomies following training on the ELITE model mentioned previously. As mentioned, results showed the trained group to have a significantly shorter operative time, suggesting construct validity of the ELITE. It was also found that overall (with and without training), surgeons were faster than novices and endoscopists in porcine cholecystectomy. An objective view of each group’s intraoperative performance using a Likert scale showed the trained group to be better, but this did not reach statistical significance.</p>
<p>Fowler et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1553350612474495">21</xref></sup> used equal numbers of experienced laparoscopists and gastroenterologists in live in vivo porcine models to visualize and touch 4 different abdominal sites in 2 separate cycles. The participants were randomized to 2 different spatial orientation devices, using one or the other on each cycle. The overall mean time to complete the task decreased significantly from first to second attempts, suggesting another linear learning curve, although there was no significant difference when comparing the improvements seen between staff grades and senior residents.</p>
<p>Freeman et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1553350612474495">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1553350612474495">23</xref></sup> studied NOTES ovariectomies in an in vivo trial with 20 dogs by a trained gastroenterologist and a veterinary surgeon with laparoscopic experience. The first 10 dogs were used for a feasibility study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1553350612474495">22</xref></sup> The mean operative times dropped significantly, compared with the first 5 procedures for the second 5 and the final 10, with a 3-factor exponential equation being produced to fit the learning curve.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1553350612474495">23</xref></sup> It was found that 10 procedures were required for the operative time to be within the 95% confidence interval for the time at an infinite procedure number. This study supports construct validity of the animal model.</p>
<p>Lomanto et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1553350612474495">24</xref></sup> performed 5 successive porcine transvaginal abdominal wall hernia repairs. The procedures were conducted by gastroenterologists and surgeons, with operative times decreasing from 93 to 52 minutes; however, no statistical information was provided, and no documentation of the learning curve was made.</p>
<p>Fuchs et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1553350612474495">25</xref></sup> performed transgastric procedures in 10 swine models, including fallopian tube ligation, cholecystectomy, cardiomyotomy, and small bowel resection. The team consisted of 2 surgeons with laparoscopic and endoscopic expertise as well as 1 gastroenterologist and 1 surgical resident. Learning curves were found for all procedures, measured by the time taken, with substantial reductions occurring after 5 cases.</p>
<p>Fuchs et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1553350612474495">26</xref></sup> next described laparoscopic-assisted NOTES transgastric bowel resection and anastomoses in 13 live pigs. The operations were performed by a group of unspecified surgeons. The pigs, of different weights, were split into 2 groups operated 6 months apart. Operative times were shown to decrease in both groups.</p>
<p>Kavic et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1553350612474495">27</xref></sup> used 5 live pigs over a 7-month period to perform NOTES-simulated appendectomies using fallopian tube models. Laparoscopic and endoscopic experts were involved. Laparoscopy was used to monitor the NOTES procedure and assist with hybrid tasks. A steep learning curve was encountered, especially in gaining access to the peritoneal cavity, with the time taken diminishing from 4 to 5 hours down to less than 1 hour.</p>

<sec id="section10-1553350612474495">
<title>Ex vivo models</title>
<p>Becerra Garcia et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1553350612474495">28</xref></sup> used porcine livers and gallbladders embedded in an ex vivo trainer based on the Tuebingen Trainer (Richard Wolf GmbH, Knittlingen, Germany), with 3 laparoscopic surgeons performing around 30 cholecystectomies each. Logarithmic learning curves were demonstrated for all 3 participants, with a plateau after 15 cases. However, only for the intermediately experienced surgeon (75-100 laparoscopic cholecystectomies) was there a significant reduction in operative time between the initial 10 procedures and final 10.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>There appears to have been a rapid expansion of NOTES procedures worldwide, with the number of registered cases in Germany alone being more than 2000 at the time of writing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1553350612474495">35</xref></sup> However, the number of institutions and surgeons performing NOTES may not have increased substantially. Several international committees and conferences have also been set up, such as the EURO-NOTES Foundation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1553350612474495">36</xref></sup> and the Natural Orifice Surgery Consortium for Assessment and Research (NOSCAR).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1553350612474495">37</xref></sup> However, the original questions posed by the 2005 White Paper have limited answers. Current training in NOTES is minimal at best, further limited by a lack of new endoscopic technologies. Overall, NOTES currently only plays a fringe role in everyday clinical practice, with the majority of surgeons considering NOTES to still be very much experimental.</p>
<p>Two main categories of training have been evaluated—animal models and box trainers (either actual boxes or simulated abdominal cavities)—with some studies using a combination of both. Some of the box trainers and tasks used are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1553350612474495">Figure 1</xref>. Frequently, the descriptions of box trainers are poorly documented and, therefore, have limited reproducibility.</p>

</fig>
<p>Despite the large quantity of work produced looking at simulators and animal models in NOTES, there are no studies that show true evidence of concurrent and predictive validity for human NOTES. Furthermore, most studies evaluating construct validity use endoscopic and/or laparoscopic proficiency as markers of experience, when strictly speaking this should be NOTES experience; however, this may be understandable because the global number of true human NOTES experts is very small.</p>
<p>The well-documented ELITE model has shown repeated demonstrations of construct, face, and content validity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1553350612474495">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1553350612474495">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1553350612474495">14</xref></sup> Learning curves were demonstrated; however, they were not significant for laparoscopic surgeons. The significant improvements seen from using the ELITE trainer on porcine cholecystectomies (arguably the most realistic human model apart from cadavers) provides the strongest evidence of predictive validity of the trainer. Other box-type trainers, although less sophisticated, can simulate important NOTES skills. Spaun et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1553350612474495">15</xref></sup> and Wagner et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1553350612474495">18</xref></sup> found that endoscopy and laparoscopy experts performed significantly better with shorter task times than novices, suggesting validity of the respective box trainers. Between the ELITE trainer and the simple box trainers mentioned above is the NOSsE, which James et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1553350612474495">19</xref></sup> showed to have construct validity for a NOTES navigation task.</p>
<p>Animal models, especially porcine, appear well suited for NOTES training; however, there is currently no evidence that either box simulations or animal training has either concurrent or predictive validity in human NOTES. Once this is achieved, we can ascertain prehuman operative proficiency levels, which can help strive toward a validated simulator, which is cheap, easily available, and provides competency-based training. Statistically significant learning curves were found in several animal studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1553350612474495">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1553350612474495">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1553350612474495">28</xref></sup>; a lack of statistical support in others makes drawing conclusions from their data difficult.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1553350612474495">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1553350612474495">25</xref></sup> Hence although NOTES training can be shown to have a measurable impact on some well-defined skills, there is no evidence to show that this improves the operative performance in patients. At this stage of evolution, perhaps, only the most experienced laparoscopic surgeon or endoscopist will want to trial NOTES. The training methods evaluated may help form a program for such candidates, rather than for junior trainees. Several training programs have been set up to incorporate NOTES. The basis of these is that surgeons get minimal experience in endoscopy during their training. The NOTES training at present appears to be endoscopy focused,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1553350612474495">33</xref></sup> usually led by laparoscopists and endoscopists. Current NOTES training at our institution is based on a mixture of box simulation,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1553350612474495">20</xref></sup> ex vivo simulation in particular, with robotics work and in vivo work. The box simulation work uses our in-house designed NOSsE trainer, with the phantom abdominal cavity being used for practicing NOTES maneuvering techniques and visualizations and replacement of various intra-abdominal viscera with animal ones to replicate procedures.</p>
<p>In comparing surgeons with gastroenterologists, overall 3 out of the 4 studies found gastroenterologists to be faster (although only 2 were statistically significant<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1553350612474495">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1553350612474495">13</xref></sup>) at simple tasks. However, greater improvements were seen in surgeons,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1553350612474495">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1553350612474495">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1553350612474495">18</xref></sup> and in the porcine cholecystectomy comparison,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1553350612474495">11</xref></sup> surgeons were indeed faster. Confounding errors may occur where surgeons may also be dual-endoscopic experts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1553350612474495">10</xref></sup> However, overall, the limited data presented so far seem to indicate that gastroenterologists (endoscopists) have a “head-start” in simple NOTES tasks and navigation compared with surgeons; however, surgeons rapidly improve. With regard to more complicated procedures, surgeons appear to perform better, which is likely because of greater experience with the intra-abdominal cavity and viscera.</p>
<p>The issue of who should perform NOTES has in essence a simple answer: those who are best qualified to perform should do so. Gastroenterologists or gastrointestinal surgeons could be trained in both diagnostic and therapeutic NOTES procedures, or perhaps gastroenterologists could be preferred for diagnostic (including intensive care patients, patients with severe burns, and obesity) and basic procedures such as targeted tissue biopsy, whereas gastrointestinal surgeons could be preferred for more complex therapeutic cases where surgical skill and anatomical knowledge is essential. An even more tantalizing prospect is the rise of a new hybrid speciality.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1553350612474495">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1553350612474495">40</xref></sup> Indeed, development of new tools and machines may influence this hugely.</p>
<p>In <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1553350612474495">Table 2</xref>, we can see that the majority of evidence has relatively weak foundations, with no class 1 evidence as yet available and few class 2 studies seen. This should be considered when designing further studies because the lack of high-quality research will hinder the development of the field.</p>

<sec id="section17-1553350612474495" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Adding advanced endoscopic training to a surgical curriculum adds extra time and pressure to the already burdened trainee. Pushing further with NOTES may take many years of training, highlighting an issue in the undercurrent of all procedural specialties, where because of the rapid pace of change, a surgeon’s technical skills may become out of date within 5 to 10 years of completing training.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1553350612474495">8</xref></sup> Despite the research done, our knowledge of training and educating in NOTES procedures is limited, and hence a meta-analysis or formal review cannot be performed as yet.</p>
<p>Based on the findings of this article, it seems that individual NOTES training has a rapidly growing body of evidence, showing validity of various models. Simulators and animal models will continue to play a key role in NOTES training for years to come and may help develop techniques preclinically. Hybrid techniques currently used do not have suitable training schemes and fully NOTES training schemes are still at a premium, with few examples set worldwide. These would need to be expanded to educate the new generation of NOTES practitioners. However, uptake will be poor as long as technological limitations remain. It is possible that future NOTES surgeons will be subspecialty-trained surgeons with advanced endoscopic experience. However, further development of new instruments and technologies as well as the expansion of NOTES into other fields will undoubtedly affect the course NOTES takes in the future.</p>
