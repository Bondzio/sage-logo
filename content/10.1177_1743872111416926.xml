<abstract>
<p>This article interprets the Athenian Stranger’s story of the origins of written law from Book III of Plato’s <italic>Laws</italic>, to the end of filling out the picture we have of Plato’s views on the purposes of law. The Athenian argues that the origins of written law reside exclusively in the need to address the problem of violent conflict among men resulting from dangerous passions and the scarcity of resources. While recent scholarship on Plato has focused on the promotion of virtue as the highest objective of law, this article clarifies the lower, but immediate and enduring, aspects of Plato’s jurisprudence.</p>

<body>
<p>Scholarship in legal and political thought has long accepted as a commonplace that, for the ancient Greek philosophers, the chief objective of law is to render citizens virtuous. Whatever benefits a citizen might acquire within and through the laws of the political association, the most important remains the opportunity to cultivate human excellence.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1743872111416926">1</xref></sup> Precisely where this teaching emerges in the works of the Greeks, however, has lately become the subject of heightened scholarly attention. In all likelihood, the <italic>locus classicus</italic> of this conception of law is to be found in <italic>The Politics</italic>, in which Aristotle argues that the “political partnership must be regarded … as being for the sake of noble actions” (1281a1–4; cf. 1252b29–31, 1253a32–33),<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1743872111416926">2</xref></sup> rather than for other ends like economic enterprise or mere peace and order.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1743872111416926">3</xref></sup> But recently scholars have endeavored to show that this teaching emerges in coherent form in the thought of Aristotle’s teacher Plato as well, specifically in the <italic>Laws</italic>. Christopher Bobonich, for instance, in his expansive study of the dialogue, has explained that “the lawgiver must aim at <italic>a single goal</italic> and that is virtue.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1743872111416926">4</xref></sup> According to Ryan Balot, the model city that we readers find developed in the conversation of the <italic>Laws</italic>, namely Magnesia,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1743872111416926">5</xref></sup> is one in which “[a]ll citizens must strive to fulfill their potential to achieve virtue.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-1743872111416926">6</xref></sup> Edward Halper expresses this prevalent reading of Plato’s text in perhaps the most emphatic terms. Interpreting the prelude to the law about the gods described in <italic>Laws</italic> X, which is famously referred to as the “noblest and best prelude on behalf of all the laws” (887c1–2; cf. 887a1–3, 907d4–5),<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-1743872111416926">7</xref></sup> Halper argues, “[s]ince preludes to laws aim to insure that citizens follow laws, and since laws aim to make the citizens virtuous, the prelude to <italic>all</italic> the laws must aim to produce citizens with <italic>all</italic> virtues.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-1743872111416926">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>Such a pronounced development in the scholarship on Plato invites reexamination of his views on the purposes of law. This reexamination is justified, further and more deeply, by the fact that recent commentators on the condition of the liberal democratic laws under which we live have suggested that shortcomings of liberalism can and should be addressed by renewing our focus on virtue. Many, if not all,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-1743872111416926">9</xref></sup> of these theorists argue that classical political philosophy provides bountiful resources for enriching liberalism with a substantive vision of the human good, and to this end many focus our attention on Plato.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1743872111416926">10</xref></sup> Stephen G. Salkever, for instance, contends that the emphasis on virtue and “teleology” one readily finds in Platonic political philosophy has much to offer liberal politics. Specifically, he contends that “liberal theorizing can recover [a] more appropriate sense of its task” if it is open to learning from Plato’s pre-liberal conception of law and politics.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1743872111416926">11</xref></sup> Gerald M. Mara, for his part, has interpreted Plato’s rendering of Socrates as a model of the virtues of liberal citizenship, or rather, as demonstrating what a proper “attitude” toward politics in democracies should look like. By showing what it means to take seriously “foundational” questions about the human good – most importantly, the question of virtue – Plato’s Socrates represents a version of “liberal ironism” which remains deeply critical of “democratic culture,” but which “recognizes and is able to defend the not inconsequential value of liberal institutions.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1743872111416926">12</xref></sup> In short, this exhortation to turn to Plato for the benefit of our liberal laws and political life renders it especially important that we possess clarity about Plato’s conception of law.</p>
<p>In approaching this subject, then, there are indeed persuasive reasons for directing our attention toward the <italic>Laws</italic> as opposed to, say, the <italic>Republic</italic> or the <italic>Statesman</italic>, the most important being that this dialogue contains the most thorough articulation of Plato’s practical jurisprudential theory.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1743872111416926">13</xref></sup> There is, moreover, persuasive evidence from this text that the chief objective of law is to instill virtue. The Athenian Stranger, who is the chief interlocutor of the <italic>Laws</italic>, claims in Book IV that the “most honorable (<italic>timiōtaton</italic>)” end for human beings is not “preservation and mere existence,” but rather “for them to become as excellent (<italic>beltistous</italic>) as possible and to remain so for as long a time as they exist” (707d1–5). Later, in Book VI, he addresses the problem that Magnesia’s founding legislation cannot possibly encompass everything that will prove relevant to the city’s affairs, advising in response that future leaders be counted on to “help fill in the outline” of the lawcode in accordance with the end of the laws. This end, in short, requires that every serious effort be taken to ensure that “a member of the community, whether his nature be male or female, young or old, might ever become a good man (<italic>anēr agathos</italic>), possessing the virtue of soul (<italic>aretēn tēs psychēs</italic>) that befits a human being” (770c7–d2).</p>
<p>Be this as it may, that the chief purpose of law is to instill virtue remains merely part of the Athenian’s teaching. Indeed, a potential danger of focusing intently on the most elevated ends of law for Plato is to neglect other crucial elements of his jurisprudence. And one significant dimension to the theory of the <italic>Laws</italic> that has gone overlooked, I shall argue, is the Athenian’s explicit statement on the origins of written law. In a crucial section of the dialogue from the opening of Book III (676a1–681d5), the Athenian tells a story of the birth and growth of political life to his interlocutors, the Cretan Clinias and the Spartan Megillus. Beginning by imagining a flood coming suddenly to wipe out the vast majority of the human race, he explores how the political regime would have grown into its maturity from the survivors.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-1743872111416926">14</xref></sup> Emphasis is placed on the moment of the establishment of written laws, so as to shed light on the reason why such laws are brought into being. Indeed, because it may be somewhat puzzling, both to the Athenian’s interlocutors and to readers of the <italic>Laws</italic>, why he has sketched such a picture of the first men, he remarks that “what we’ve been saying, and all that is still to follow from it, has been said as a means to our coming to understand what need (<italic>chreia</italic>) the men of that time had for laws, and who was lawgiver for them” (679e6–680a1; cf. 702a2–b3).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-1743872111416926">15</xref></sup> In clarifying the need the first human beings had for written law, the Athenian’s account necessarily sheds light on the original purpose of that law. After all, the first legislators of the story institute law in order to address just this need.</p>
<p>Why <italic>written</italic> law, specifically, and not law, more generally? That the Athenian’s story is intended to address the original need for written law is implied by the Athenian himself, for he indicates explicitly that the phenomenon of lawgiving emerges only after the emergence of writing (680a3–7). Still, is it not peculiar that Plato would expend much effort discussing this particular class of law, given especially his thoroughgoing critique of writing that we encounter in other dialogues such as the <italic>Phaedrus</italic>? By the term written law, the Athenian means laws that are written down, published, and well promulgated for the regulation of life in a regime; or, what we might refer to as a body of statutes, including even constitutional laws. These laws are most directly in contrast to unwritten laws, such as the customs or practices of the citizenry, or moral laws that are not necessarily written down. In the text just cited, the Athenian draws a distinction between written laws, on the one hand, and “habits and … what are called ancestral laws,” on the other.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-1743872111416926">16</xref></sup> The terminology, then, reflects a common sense distinction between these different types of laws, all of which are encompassed by the Greek term <italic>nomos</italic>. But in light of Plato’s critique of writing, it is important to note that the Athenian’s purpose in the account from <italic>Laws</italic> III is not, say, to advocate written laws. It is rather to clarify the origins of written law, so as to clarify the nature of law – the larger class of which written laws are a species – as such.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-1743872111416926">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>With this article, I myself aim to shed light on Plato’s teaching in the <italic>Laws</italic> on the coming into being of written law, specifically as regards its original purpose. Although scholarship on this section of the dialogue has not, for the most part, appreciated that the Athenian endeavors here to address the original need for such law,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-1743872111416926">18</xref></sup> my article interprets the story of origins in light of the Athenian’s explicit statement of intention.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-1743872111416926">19</xref></sup> In so doing, I hope to enrich the scholarship on Plato’s legal and political theory, to the wider end of addressing commentators on liberalism, virtue, and Platonic political thought, as discussed above. I shall show that the Athenian here highlights important dimensions to the function of law that have little to do with directly instilling virtue and more to do with merely keeping peace and order. And while the origins of law do not, of course, reveal everything about this phenomenon, they bring to light these immediate and enduring purposes of law. As Thomas Pangle has correctly remarked in interpreting the Athenian’s story in <italic>Laws</italic> III, “the original, primitive needs from which civic life first springs” are those “which the city never leaves behind.”<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-1743872111416926">20</xref></sup></p>
<p>Taking the Athenian’s cue, then, the following questions come to light as most important. Why are the men who receive laws for the first time in need of them? What is the original function of law? To answer these questions, it is necessary to begin at the beginning, interpreting the story as thoroughly as possible – for the Athenian’s narrative proves to be nothing if not challenging.</p>
<sec id="section1-1743872111416926">
<title>I. The Story Begins: A Complex Tale of Dangerous Human Passions</title>
<p>The Athenian begins his narrative by calling on the testimony of the most revered texts. Assuming that men, cities, and the other political things have been in existence for “an immense and immeasurable time,” he begins by appealing to the “ancient sayings (<italic>palaioi logoi</italic>)” which tell of periodic natural disasters. The texts in which these <italic>logoi</italic> are to be found are those of the poets: evidence will be cited presently, for instance, from the poems of both Hesiod and Homer. Specifically, the Athenian elects to tell the story of a worldwide flood which wipes out all sign of human life and politics, save for small bands of herdsmen (<italic>nomēs</italic>) living on the mountain tops, where the flood waters do not reach.</p>
<p>By contrast to the stories of the poets, however, this disaster is a natural event, not punishment from the divine,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-1743872111416926">21</xref></sup> and in making the unspoken assumption that human beings have always existed, the Athenian discards the notion of divine creation taught by the poets. What is more, the ancient sayings do not necessarily address the fact of the herdsmen’s survival or their character, while the Athenian emphasizes these themes prominently (677a1–b4).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-1743872111416926">22</xref></sup> From the beginning, then, we readers notice several indications that the Athenian means to modify the ancient sayings to suit his purpose. He has already argued in <italic>Laws</italic> II that the poetry distinguished by its charming effect on old men, namely Homeric and Hesiodic epic, is not thereby necessarily true or best (658e7–659a2). As the Athenian’s account unfolds, he will pick and choose aspects of the poems that are particularly useful for telling his story, in addition to adding ancillary information. In short, while the Athenian begins from the ancient sayings as conveyed by the songs of the poets, he proceeds to assimilate them to what is naturalistic, in the sense that he grounds the account on his own observations of nature, both external and human, rather than on what the poets say about and on the authority of the divine (682a1–5; cf. 713a9–b4). The Athenian’s story of the growth of political life is meant to be a natural account.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-1743872111416926">23</xref></sup></p>
<p>What is crystal clear at the outset, however, is that the Athenian’s view on the need for law grows out of his portrayal of the character of the first men, the survivors of the flood. Mountain herdsmen would spend time tending their flocks, using the animals to supply provisions of meat and milk (678e10–679a5). The life and daily activity of a herdsman would be simple compared to that of a farmer or an artisan, not to mention that of a citizen. The Athenian wastes no time in drawing attention to the fact that the earliest men would have lost access to the arts (<italic>technai</italic>) of civilization – which is to say, the knowledge necessary for progress in the arts – and to the tools that would have supported arts like farming (677c5–d8, 678d4–8). All of these would have been buried in the flood, both literally and figuratively, for even their memory would have been wiped out. The Athenian explains that early man’s artlessness would have been the basis for a kind of primitive goodness. “Presumably men such as these, at least, necessarily lack experience in the arts, and especially in the contrivances that city dwellers use against one another, motivated by the desire to have more (<italic>pleonexias</italic>), the love of victory (<italic>philonikias</italic>), and all of the other mischief they think up against each other” (677b6–10). It is only in political life, and with the more sophisticated arts of the city, that men undertake “much wickedness” against one another.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-1743872111416926">24</xref></sup> The first herdsmen, representative of early humanity as such, are good precisely because they are inexperienced in the ways of wickedness.</p>
<p>The passage just cited is significant, for here the Athenian suggests not only that early men would have been more decent than their political counterparts. He also identifies two sources of wickedness in cities: the desire to have more, i.e. <italic>pleonexia</italic>, and the love of victory, i.e. <italic>philonikia</italic>. Owing to the former passion, men contrive to acquire more than they need or deserve over against the claims of others, however just or reasonable those claims may be (cf. 713c5–8, 875b6–c3).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-1743872111416926">25</xref></sup> Owing to the latter, they are driven to compete with one another for preeminence. Both desires encourage excessive self-regard at the expense of others, and the Athenian implies that both are wellsprings of injustice.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-1743872111416926">26</xref></sup> Indeed, regarding <italic>pleonexia</italic> specifically, the Athenian will explain in Book X that this passion “in cities and regimes, having had its name refashioned, is injustice” simply (906c5–6). Most important, the Athenian does not suggest that the sources of injustice are unique to life in regimes, such that the forces of civilization create or develop passions in men that were absent in the beginning – as Jean-Jacques Rousseau argues famously in his <italic>Discourse on Inequality</italic>, for instance. Instead, he stresses that early men are not “motivated” to act on passions which exist in man’s natural constitution (cf. 731d9–732b4). Because of the simplicity of their lives and their lack of knowledge, they do not know what ends may be achieved through injustice, and hence they do not suffer potentially dangerous passions (677c5–7, 679d3–e1; cf. 653b4, 672b8–c2). The crucial point, though, is that the earliest men possess the desire to have more and the love of victory – and perhaps other dangerous passions as well, for these are the only two referred to by name. “Inexperienced in the many beautiful things that go with urban life, and inexperienced in the opposite sorts of things as well,” men in the beginning were unable to become perfect in virtue and in vice (<italic>teleous pros aretēn ē kai pros kakian gegonenai</italic>). They were unable, in other words, to bring to completion what was already present in their souls (678b1–4).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-1743872111416926">27</xref></sup></p>
<p>The fact that these first humans are characterized, even if subtly, in terms of a complex political psychology is the most important feature differentiating the story in <italic>Laws</italic> III from that of Book II of the <italic>Republic</italic>, Plato’s other major treatment of the origins of the polity, in which Socrates and his interlocutors lay out the “city of utmost necessity” (369d11). Socrates famously turns to this account in order to discover what justice is within a city, so as to understand, in turn, what justice is for an individual soul. Arguing that the city “comes into being because each of us isn’t self-sufficient but is in need of much” (369b5–6), he explains that initially it would be comprised of a few individuals devoted to providing for the needs of the body, such as a farmer, a house builder, a weaver, and a cobbler. Yet even after this city has expanded, to the point of adding “a throng” of other workers and merchants to trade with foreign cities, Socrates and his companions are unable to discover any real problems in the city where justice might be found.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-1743872111416926">28</xref></sup> All citizens have everything they need and, most importantly, none desire to have anything more than what they need; therefore, the tension between individual goods and the common good that would seem to necessitate political law is wholly absent. In describing the city of needs in the <italic>Republic</italic>, Socrates abstracts from the human soul – that no citizen desires to have anything more, for instance, is a sign that <italic>pleonexia</italic> plays no role – rendering men nothing more than satisfiers of bodily or animalistic needs. This is the basis, of course, of Glaucon’s objection that Socrates’ city is nothing more than a “city of sows” (372d4).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-1743872111416926">29</xref></sup> By sharp contrast, the herdsmen of the <italic>Laws</italic> are presented as being motivated by concerns that go beyond the body, even if these passions are largely muted at the beginning. This is certainly one more reason to believe that Plato’s practical jurisprudential theory is truly found in the <italic>Laws</italic>: its story of the origins of political law begins with men that are more completely human than the abstractions we encounter in the <italic>Republic</italic>.</p>
<p>Returning to the text of <italic>Laws</italic> III, it is important to note that man, at this early point, possesses desires by nature which, if triggered, would necessitate law. This may be one reason for the Athenian’s seemingly random choice of mountain herdsmen as the first men. He could have chosen, alternatively, to begin with a great fire, which would have destroyed all life on the mountain tops while leaving the communities next to rivers and seas intact, as Plato’s readers can easily gather from the <italic>Timaeus</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-1743872111416926">30</xref></sup> Perhaps the Athenian chooses a flood because he wishes to suggest that the <italic>nomēs</italic>, herdsmen, possess the basic need for <italic>nomos</italic>, law, given their natural psychic makeup, even though law as such is absent from the earliest times.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-1743872111416926">31</xref></sup> Legal constraints would be needed to check the excessive expression of dangerous desires when they are expressed, forestalling the injustice stemming from them. If this suggestion is accurate, then the basic need for written law is present even in the earliest men, and the fact that the beginning epoch in the Athenian’s story is one of peace and goodwill, in which law seems to be at most latent, is accidental.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-1743872111416926">32</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1743872111416926">
<title>II. The Story Continues: Psychic Terror and Primitive Sociability</title>
<p>But if man needs law by nature, it is perplexing that the Athenian does, in fact, describe the first times as peaceful. For it is not obvious why men who do not suffer conflict would need written laws. And in interpreting the passage at the opening of <italic>Laws</italic> III, one must concede that the Athenian emphasizes the reasons why men would have been peaceful and happy in the beginning. He goes so far as to characterize early households as the sort where “neither insolence nor injustice, nor again jealousies and ill will, come into being …” (679b8–c2). How do human beings finally arrive at lawgiving?</p>
<p>The surviving herdsmen, continues the Athenian, would have faced “a vast and frightening (<italic>phoberan</italic>) desolation” and “a great mass of abundant land” (677e2–5). The Athenian assumes that the destruction caused by the cataclysm would have been almost total, with the mountain tops being the only parts of the world untouched by water. Presumably the “mass of abundant land” to which the Athenian refers means the land that gradually becomes available as the waters recede. In a world such as this, and after such a catastrophe, life as experienced by early man would have been saturated with fear, and the Athenian wastes no time describing this basic fact of human psychology.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-1743872111416926">33</xref></sup> “For I suppose,” he remarks, “that the fear (<italic>phobos</italic>) of descending from the heights into the valleys was ringing in everyone’s ears” (678c2–3; cf. 682c11). The narrative implies that there are three sources of primal terror. First, the early men would have remembered the disaster vividly, since it changed their lives to such a great extent and irreversibly. The Athenian insinuates, in fact, that memory of the flood would have been virtually the only memory to survive the disaster (682b10–c1). One might surmise that this is so because of the intensity of the psychological shock due to the deluge: it would have erased, or at least blurred, memory of everything else. Second, the sight of the destruction and scattered debris – that is, the many animals, including men, that were “destroyed” – would have been in all likelihood gruesome. Finally, the awareness of human solitude would have been frightening. And the Athenian intends this solitude to be understood not simply as the absence of other men. On the contrary, having suffered an unmitigated catastrophe that came and went without explanation, the earliest men would have had cause to doubt the existence of a providential source of care looking out for their good. Even if the gods did not cause the flood, neither the divine nor nature prevented it.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-1743872111416926">34</xref></sup></p>
<p>The basic psychic response of human beings to their place in the world, then, is fear. And the effect of pervasive fear during the earliest times would have been to drive men, however gradually, closer together. The Athenian explains that early men would have been “glad whenever they saw each other, because there were so few of them during that time” (678c5–9). This is tantamount to saying that a sort of primitive sociability, stemming from fear, exists in the beginning. Notwithstanding the fact that it would have been difficult “to mix with one another,” due to the destruction of the means of transportation, early men would have been driven together in order to assuage their terror. The Athenian goes so far as to claim that the first men would have been “delighted with one another and full of goodwill (<italic>ēgapōn kai ephilophronounto allēlous</italic>) on account of the desolation” (678e10–679a1). Rather than focusing on the fear they might have felt on encountering other men, the sort that the Cretan Clinias (see 626d6–10) and more recently Thomas Hobbes have emphasized,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-1743872111416926">35</xref></sup> he stresses the notion that a different, stronger terror “on account of the desolation” would in all likelihood bring men closer together and provide the ground for a primitive kind of friendship (cf. 698b2–c3).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-1743872111416926">36</xref></sup> Human society, according to the story, satisfies at least one of the basic needs of the soul, insofar as it helps to comfort men living in a frightening world.</p>
<p>But however comforting may have been the first social ties, the story suggests that they proved insufficient in managing fear. For, in addition to these early ties, informal rules of order appear to develop rapidly. To understand why, it is necessary to reflect on the condition of a soul in the throes of terror. Those human beings who suffer greatly from fear will also suffer, it is reasonable to assume, from psychic disorderliness. Anxiety is neither a great stabilizer nor a great harmonizer. This aspires to capture, of course, merely the common sense view of anxiety’s impact on the human soul. But the Athenian himself defends precisely this position at the beginning of <italic>Laws</italic> VII, where he indicates that the fundamental passion experienced by all human babies upon entering the world is terror, a passion which produces psychic madness, or a “harsh fluttering of the heart.” The “fear and the mad motion within” the soul, on the Athenian’s telling, are at the very least co-present; most likely, however, fear is the fundamental cause of the madness within the soul (790e8–791b8; cf. 672b3–c6). Most important, the Athenian implies that the disorderliness of soul is neither good nor pleasant. Human beings experience a basic, natural need for calm (791a8–b1).</p>
<p>Returning to the story of <italic>Laws</italic> III, it is with these ideas in mind that we notice that the early men, “whenever they heard something was noble (<italic>kala</italic>) or shameful (<italic>aischra</italic>), in their simplicity they considered what had been said to be the very truth, and believed it (<italic>epeithonto</italic>) … They believed (<italic>nomizontes</italic>) that what they heard about gods as well as about human beings was true, and lived according to these things” (679c4–8). The goodness of the early period appears to be supported by orderliness, which itself is achieved through rules that regulate human life – rules about what is noble and base, and about the divine. The earliest men quickly develop informal moral rules and stories about the gods to guide their lives.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-1743872111416926">37</xref></sup> In fact, the Athenian’s striking statement that the earliest men are “in every way more just” than contemporary men evidently means that they are more orderly, i.e. law-abiding, if by “law” we mean moral law. The greater justice of the first period consists in the willingness of men to obey what they have heard about the noble, the shameful, and the gods (679e2; cf. 680d10–e3).</p>

<title>III. The Story Concludes: Scarce Resources and Very Dangerous Men</title>
<p>To summarize the Athenian’s argument so far: despite the dangerous passions natural to humanity, the first human beings appear to live in peace because their psychic terror inclines them into social order, with moral and divine laws regulating it. Society and moral rules are natural because they develop as a response to natural psychic needs. But the tranquility manufactured as a response to psychic needs is far from the whole of the Athenian’s story, and one begins to see this upon addressing an objection to the idea that the souls of early men would have been riddled with fear. If the needs of the body had been provided for sufficiently, one might argue, then life would have been comfortable, and there would have been little reason for men to feel anxious over their place in the world. One interpreter whose work would raise such an objection is Eric Havelock, who views the portrait of the earliest times in <italic>Laws</italic> III as one of peace and prosperity. “Men,” Havelock says in commenting on this passage, “have lived in a Golden Age of moral equanimity, in <italic>completely</italic> peaceful co-operation and innocence … To support these moral qualities in man, earth afforded a bountiful sustenance …”.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-1743872111416926">38</xref></sup> The crucial issue here is that of scarcity. If the world provided abundantly for the bodily needs of early men, would there not have been a sort of calm based on the assurance of bodily comfort? Furthermore, would there not have been less reason for men to compete with one another, thereby mitigating one source of conflict that would necessitate law? For if the needs of the body are easily satisfied, then it is less clear why early men would have experienced a need for regulation by law in the first place.</p>
<p>This objection is a powerful one, for the Athenian appears to characterize the earliest times as plentiful enough to preclude conflict over resources. To be sure, he notes that cattle and other herd animals would have “barely supported the life of the herdsmen in the beginning” since so many animals were destroyed by the flood (677e5–678a1). But in short order, the situation seems to improve markedly. “[F]ood,” the Athenian notes, “was not something [the first men] fought over. At that time most lived from herding, and there was no lack of pasture land – except perhaps for some people at the start. So they didn’t lack milk and meat. Besides, by hunting they provided themselves with food that was neither poor in quality nor scanty in amount” (678e11–679a5). The only source of food in the beginning seems to satisfy the needs of early men. Additionally, these individuals appear capable of providing clothing and shelter for themselves with the basic arts of molding and weaving. According to the Athenian, “a god has given these two arts to provide [clothing and shelter] for human beings, so that whenever the human race finds itself in such straits it may be able to grow and progress” (679b1–4).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-1743872111416926">39</xref></sup> As a consequence, the first men “weren’t terribly poor, and weren’t compelled by poverty to differ with one another.” In fact, the Athenian attributes the happy detail that war and political discord were “destroyed” in the beginning partially to the plentiful collection of resources in the world after the flood.</p>
<p>Clinias, though, does not understand how it is possible for war and civil discord to have been “destroyed” by the flood, for his view is that humans are in conflict with one another by nature (678e9; see 625d9ff., 673b6–10). On closer inspection of the Athenian’s story, we too might be inclined to express skepticism on this matter. There are, in fact, several aspects to his story that make one question whether the first times would have been entirely peaceful. For one, the only source of food at the disposal of the first men is the herd animals and other game to be hunted. The Athenian indicates that agriculture does not begin until men have moved down from the mountain tops and into the more fertile foothills (680e7–681a1). And nothing is mentioned about the abundance – or even existence – of edible resources like fruits or vegetables growing spontaneously from the earth. Moreover, we must wonder if the Athenian’s seemingly cursory qualification regarding pasture land not being scarce “except perhaps for some people at the start,” is not more significant than he makes it sound. Herd animals might be enough to sustain some people, but what about those who have no access to pasture land? Hunting would have been an uncertain way of ensuring one’s nourishment, especially since the account has explained that so many animals were destroyed by the flood. And how much goodwill can reasonably be assumed from men who are starving (cf. 782e2–783a1, 831d3–e3)? Finally, given that useful things such as metal tools are extremely scarce after the flood, and those that are found would wear out easily, the paucity of these might also be considered another source of conflict.</p>
<p>These several observations lead us to suppose that the human situation after the flood is not as peaceful as the Athenian illustrates it, <italic>contra</italic> Havelock’s claim that the story portrays a golden age of perfect harmony. To be clear, this is not to say that the Athenian holds that the condition of the first men is one of widespread violent conflict, like Hobbes’s war of all against all, for instance. The problem of violence appears to be less rampant, perhaps because moral laws really do have an effect on the behavior of early men. However this may be, the Athenian implies that there are indeed powerful motives for men to fight with one another in the beginning, and the damage caused by violent conflict would not be insignificant. If this is true, then we notice another need for written law in the Athenian’s account: it curbs conflict among early men over scarce resources, conflict that disrupts the order of early times. It seems reasonable to add that the growth of human population would intensify the problems associated with scarcity, especially since the Athenian indicates that it takes a long time for men to discover the arts that might help to provide for them, most importantly agriculture (see 678b5–7; cf. 680e6–7, 682c6–7).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-1743872111416926">40</xref></sup></p>
<p>Perhaps the clearest suggestion that the beginnings are not perfectly harmonious comes slightly later in the story. During the discussion of the first regimes, or dynasties, the interlocutors consider a passage from Homer’s <italic>Odyssey</italic> as a representative portrayal of the way of life of this period. But instead of referring to men full of goodwill for one another, the text describes rather the household of the Cyclopes, who in Homer’s story are impious giants with a taste for human flesh. It is surely significant that the Athenian chooses Homer’s depiction of the Cyclopes and not that of Hesiod. Whereas in the latter, Hesiod sings of divine craftsmen who benevolently bestow the thunderbolt on Zeus, in the former, the Cyclopes are portrayed as savage cannibals posing a serious threat to human beings.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-1743872111416926">41</xref></sup> Moreover, Homer’s passage on the Cyclopes indicates that the land on the mountains where these giants live is extremely barren, offering poor sustenance for human life, which is another piece of evidence suggesting that the earth is not originally as bountiful as the Athenian makes it seem.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-1743872111416926">42</xref></sup> In short, the Athenian suggests, however quietly, that the earliest men are capable of being very much like the brutal Cyclopes (cf. 823b1–5), in conflict with other men with respect to food and willing to resort to violence to acquire whatever they need or desire. While the Cretan Clinias does not notice the shocking significance of the Athenian’s use of Homer, the Spartan Megillus does, for he remarks that the poet’s “myth attributes [the Cyclopes’] ancient ways to savagery (<italic>agriotēta</italic>)” (680d1–3).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-1743872111416926">43</xref></sup></p>
<p>The final indication in the story that the first times are prone to disrupting into violence is found in the discussion of the first cities, the form of community arising after dynasties. The Athenian remarks that cities originate when smaller family groups come together, each bringing with them their “own particular customs.” But there is a crucial distinction among families: “The variety of their different customs pertaining to the gods and to themselves derives from the variety in their parents and in those who reared them; the rather orderly (<italic>kosmiōterōn</italic>) have rather orderly customs and the manly (<italic>andrikōn</italic>) have rather manly customs” (681b2–5). Some clans are orderly, while others are manly, and they are so ultimately because the individuals in these clans are so. But this means, simply, that some human beings are by nature manly, which implies that some of these early men would be inclined to fight with others.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-1743872111416926">44</xref></sup> The Athenian had said that the arts of war are not known in the beginning, but now we learn that some men are indeed <italic>warlike</italic>, and this should not be surprising, considering that earlier in the story the Athenian had suggested that man naturally possesses passions threatening to civil harmony. Do men such as these have to know an art to incite the kind of conflict that would make law necessary? It is reasonable to assume not, especially on recalling the Athenian’s claim from <italic>Laws</italic> I that excessive and incorrectly educated courage (<italic>andreia</italic>) engenders savagery and the kind of disposition leading to civil strife (638a1–b10; cf. 766a1–5).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-1743872111416926">45</xref></sup> Certainly the manliness of the first men is nothing if not raw and uneducated. If this interpretation is correct, then of course it would not contradict the Athenian’s notion that the greatest wickedness is found in cities, owing to the knowledge that develops in civilization. But it should demonstrate one more reason why the earliest men need law: to restrain the manly.</p>
<p>We, along with the dialogue’s interlocutors, have now “stumbled unawares … upon the origin of legislation.” After the population has grown to the point where the smaller clans wish to unite together, men are chosen from each of the groups to survey all the extant informal customs in order to choose “the ones they find especially agreeable for the community.” And when the leaders of the people agree on a set of rules, these are given as laws (681c4–d5).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-1743872111416926">46</xref></sup> After ourselves having surveyed the complicated story of the origins of the regime in <italic>Laws</italic> III, we are in a better position to understand what need men of that time had for law. Human beings possess by nature passions that can cause them to commit wicked acts against one another, which in turn cause instability and violence. These passions include, specifically, the desire to have more (<italic>pleonexia</italic>) and the love of victory (<italic>philonikia</italic>), as well as a general disposition to manly aggression in some individuals. But the Athenian, furthermore, implies that human beings live in a world that is frightening and does not provide for them bountifully. Resources, many of which nature had wiped out in indifference to the fate of man, are somewhat scarce. And so people fight with each other in competition over these resources. One could argue that mankind’s attempt to surmount its originally imperfect condition – that is, to look for or invent the arts useful for the care of humanity – actually contributes to the condition of violent conflict, since the Athenian has indicated that the development of knowledge and of vice are proportionally related. We conclude, then, that the origins of law reside in the need to check violence among men stemming from dangerous human passions and scarcity. Written legislation acts as a bulwark to the order produced by the early informal moral rules.</p>

<title>IV. The Athenian’s Intention in Crafting the Narrative of <italic>Laws</italic> III</title>
<p>Before reflecting on how this conclusion enriches our understanding of Platonic jurisprudence, it is essential to address, even if briefly, an objection: doesn’t the Athenian’s teaching about the origins of law, as interpreted here, seem opposed – sometimes <italic>significantly</italic> opposed – to the story presented in the text of the <italic>Laws</italic>? Indeed, the success of this interpretation of <italic>Laws</italic> III requires an explanation as to why the Athenian would intend to conceal his views about the darker side of human affairs, presenting instead something like Havelock’s golden age of “completely peaceful co-operation and innocence.” Does the Athenian have such an intention?</p>
<p>It is important to recognize, on the one hand, that we have already seen the Athenian tinkering with his evidence of the earliest men, the ancient sayings of the poets. Indeed, near the end of his account, after coming upon the establishment of law, he himself blurs the line between <italic>logos</italic> and <italic>mythos</italic>, calling his own account a <italic>mythos</italic> (682a6 and e5).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-1743872111416926">47</xref></sup> The difference between <italic>logos</italic> and <italic>mythos</italic> in the ancient Greek language is often ambiguous, to be sure.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-1743872111416926">48</xref></sup> But given that the only prior occurrence of the word <italic>mythos</italic> in Book III appears as a way of identifying Homer’s story of the Cyclops (<italic>mythologias</italic>, 680d3), it is reasonable to suspect that Plato wants his readers to treat the Athenian’s story with the same kind of care as the Athenian takes with the ancient sayings. The latter does not piously assume the ancient <italic>logoi</italic> of the poets to be true; rather, he questions whether they contain “some truth” (677a1). Just as the Athenian assumes that unearthing the teaching of the poetic myths requires careful interpretative legwork, so too we interpreters may plausibly assume that the Athenian’s true teaching may require the same, and that it is not necessarily obvious from the apparent presentation of it.</p>
<p>On the other hand, and more important, the Athenian relates his story to certain individuals, Clinias and Megillus, the first of whom is the Athenian’s primary interlocutor in this passage and throughout the <italic>Laws</italic>. Could the narrative have been crafted so as to speak directly to the character of Clinias? In the conversation leading up to the discussion of the origins of law, both the Athenian and we readers learn at least two important, and surely unsettling, things about his understanding of humanity. First, as mentioned above, his view of the human condition is that men are naturally at war with one another, or as he says, “all are enemies (<italic>polemious</italic>) of all in public” (626d). His view is similar in spirit, then, to what we have identified as the Athenian’s true teaching on the origins of law. Second, Clinias reveals in <italic>Laws</italic> II that he is naturally inclined to regard the life of the tyrant – that is, someone “who does whatever he might desire throughout his whole life” and who has the resources to indulge these desires – as the best human life. He agrees with the Athenian that the life of the tyrant would be “unjust and insolent” and necessarily “shameful,” but he cannot admit that such a figure would live in a bad way (661e6–662a6). In other words, in the economy of Plato’s dialogue, Clinias represents the kind of individual who denies the necessary connection between justice and the good. For him, the requirements of virtue and a commitment to the common good are painfully burdensome; it would be better, therefore, for a human being to devote one’s life to pursuing one’s own desires, if it were possible to do so.</p>
<p>The Athenian is addressing a potentially dangerous man in the figure of Clinias. And his two unsettling opinions on humanity would serve, in theory, to reinforce one another: after all, these opinions deny, respectively, the naturalness of virtue and the goodness of virtue, in the fundamental sense of virtue as service for the good of others. At the very least, given that Clinias sees the human condition as one of perpetual conflict, there would be little in his soul to check or to moderate his potential ambition to tyranny. The Athenian, then, has a clear and compelling interest in trying to cover up his teaching about the origins of law, and it is to moderate the opinions of his companion in this conversation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-1743872111416926">49</xref></sup> In focusing on the rosier side of human affairs – indeed, in going so far as to make the case for mankind’s natural goodness – his narrative serves a dual purpose: it is intended both to affect the way that Clinias thinks about politics and to present, even if in a subtle or careful manner, his own understanding of the original need for law.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1743872111416926">
<title>V. Plato’s <italic>Laws</italic> on the Original Need for Law</title>
<p>If the interpretation of <italic>Laws</italic> III presented in this article is correct, then it points to a feature of Plato’s conception of law that is well worth noting. According to Plato’s Athenian, the reason why law is brought into being is essentially negative. It is negative in the sense that legislation serves the immediate purpose of extenuating the unsavory aspects of the human condition. In other words, written laws are established in order to prevent evils from happening, specifically to forestall violent conflict among men, rather than actively to promote the good things for human beings such as virtue or happiness. In short, written law is brought into being to help replace chaos with order.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50-1743872111416926">50</xref></sup></p>
<p>Moreover, and in a related vein, it appears that if written law is established in order to satisfy some human need, then it is brought into being to satisfy the needs of the body, not the soul. That this is so, however, is not readily obvious. To be sure, the Athenian’s reasons for conflict prior to legislation point to the fact that the lives and the material goods of early men would have been threatened by others. But has he not also identified existential fear as one of the features of early human life? And wouldn’t this imply that law also addresses problems of the soul? Yet, at the beginning of <italic>Laws</italic> III the Athenian is careful to distinguish between written laws, on the one hand, and customs, habits, and “ancestral laws,” on the other. While it appears that habits broadly understood are indeed established to address the problem of psychic fear, written laws are established to achieve a more modest task, that is, to keep the peace. According to the story of political origins, written legislation helps to preserve the lives and material goods of individual human beings.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn51-1743872111416926">51</xref></sup></p>
<p>These conclusions on the basis of <italic>Laws</italic> III are not widely appreciated as aspects of Plato’s legal and political thought. Indeed, as discussed at the beginning of this article, the recent scholarship on Platonic jurisprudence routinely emphasizes that law is distinguished by its positive function, namely to render citizens as virtuous as possible. Accordingly, the fact that Plato puts forward a rather hard-headed teaching on the human condition in the absence of law, and therefore a hard-headed teaching on the immediate function of law, tends to be overlooked. While it would be foolhardy to reject the importance of virtue as a part of Plato’s comprehensive theory of law,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn52-1743872111416926">52</xref></sup> still it is necessary to emphasize that the task of the opening section of <italic>Laws</italic> III is to highlight the other side of that coin, to show that wise legislation must also concern itself with lower, because negative, goals. Plato’s classical teaching on the origins of law shows that it specifically comes into being for exclusively these goals. Sensitivity to this teaching lends vivid color to the Athenian’s pithy statement, in Book IV (713e3–6), that “there can be no rest from evils and toils for those cities in which some mortal rules rather than a god” – by which the Athenian means the intelligence embodied in law.</p>

<p>That the Athenian chooses to begin his story with a catastrophe is interesting in its own right, given the growing literature on the political significance of catastrophe.

Still, the purpose of the Athenian’s focusing on a flood is not to provide a treatment of the phenomenon of catastrophe as such, but rather to facilitate his consideration, in thought and in speech, of how human beings are constituted in the absence of law and the political regime. The flood is, in other words, a logical conceit that paves the way for the Athenian’s philosophical speculation in <italic>Laws</italic> III.</p>

<p>Others have held that the Athenian tells his story of origins for different reasons. For R.F. Stalley, the account “sets out the principles which … should govern both our assessment of existing states and the construction of the new Cretan city.” R.F. Stalley, <italic>Introduction to Plato’s</italic> Laws (Indianapolis, IN: Hackett, 1983), p. 71. According to David Cohen (“Law, Autonomy, and Political Community,” p. 307), the story allows the Athenian “to reintroduce the subject of legislation,” which had been set aside in order to investigate the requirements of education. For Naddaf (“Literacy,” p. 339), its purpose is to initiate an investigation of “what conditions tend to preserve or destroy a constitution.” André Laks appears to agree with Naddaf’s reading: André Laks, “The <italic>Laws</italic>,” in <italic>The Cambridge History of Greek and Roman Political Thought</italic>, p. 261. Finally, Grene (<italic>Greek Political Theory</italic>, p. 183) argues that the story represents one “attempt to consider in cosmic terms the meaning of political community and to render an account … of what the ‘ideal’ history of such a political community could have been.” There is, to be sure, a sense in which all of these formulations are correct. Still, according to the Athenian’s explicit statement, his most immediate purpose in telling the story is to clarify humanity’s original need for written law.</p>

<p>If this suggestion is correct, then the Athenian is putting forward a remarkable teaching about the fear of the gods.

Cf. 646e2–647b7; see Benardete, <italic>Plato’s “Laws,”</italic> p. 98.

At the end of Book II, after the interlocutors have ended their first discussion of musical education, the Athenian gratifies his Dorian companions by promising to address next gymnastic education, or the training of the body (673d7–8). And while the opening of Book III appears to show the Athenian breaking his promise – after all, he turns to a discussion of the birth and growth of the political regime – it is likely that he is addressing the theme of bodily needs, insofar as he holds that law is brought into being to satisfy just those needs, chief among them being safety. Elizabeth L’Arrivee emphasizes that this section of <italic>Laws</italic> III covers “the gymnastic education” which “treats the needs of the body.” Elizabeth L’Arrivee, “The Logical Structure of Plato’s <italic>Laws</italic>,” <italic>History of Political Thought</italic>, 29 (2008), pp. 34–5.</p>

<p>The Athenian indicates, after all, that his story of political origins is situated within a broader viewpoint of “the progression of cities as they change towards virtue and at the same time towards vice” (676a5–6). Most likely on the basis of this line of text, Wallach (<italic>Platonic Political Art</italic>, p. 365) argues that the “overall aim of the Athenian Stranger’s story is to inform the interlocutors’ grasp of a state’s historical relation to the achievement of virtue.” Still, his analysis abstracts from the immediate purpose of the Athenian’s story. The speech from 676a is the centerpiece of Florencia Sal, “¿Hay una filosofía de la historia en <italic>Leyes</italic> III?,” in <italic>Plato’s</italic> Laws<italic>: From Theory into Practice</italic>, pp. 232–6.</p>
