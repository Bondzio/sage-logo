<abstract>
<p>Power in ancient eastern North America cannot be segregated a priori into political, social, and religious dimensions. Rather, it was a commonly dispersed attribute of human/non-human social fields that might be transferred, gathered, embodied, or emplaced. Thus, political power was realized, at least in part, through socio-religious practices involving ancestors, elements, and otherworldly forces. Deconstructing the dichotomy of religion and politics, we focus on practices of material manipulation, burning, and burial at and around the eleventh- and twelfth-century complex of Cahokia along the Mississippi River. Specifically, we detail a number of contexts where temple buildings, human remains, and objects were transubstantiated, especially through burning, and hence their power transformed. Persons were constructed, places of power were built, political agents were defined, and enemies were eliminated through fire and earth.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1469605311433369" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>In previous theoretical research, archaeologists have attempted to differentiate how power, as separate aspects of lived experience, was negotiated, held, and exercised within realms of politics, religion, and everyday social life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1469605311433369">Emerson, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-1469605311433369">Payne, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr82-1469605311433369">Trocolli, 2002</xref>). Certainly, power was a key concern of early postprocessual archaeologists, who differentiated ‘power to’ versus ‘power over’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1469605311433369">McGuire, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1469605311433369">Miller and Tilley, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-1469605311433369">Shanks and Tilley, 1982</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-1469605311433369">1987</xref>). However, from the point of view of contemporary relational theories of agency, materiality, and landscapes, these particular distinctions between the social, the political, and the religious are yet overly partitive and utilitarian. Likewise, they contrast with indigenous North American experience, where power was not segregated from these other supposed realms of social life. Instead, power – or perhaps more appropriately ‘powers’ – was a commonly dispersed attribute of both human and non-human relationality within interdigitated realms of political, religious, and social life. At the eleventh- and twelfth-century pre-Columbian city of Cahokia in the North American Midwest, dispersed powers were transferred, gathered (<italic>sensu</italic> Heidegger), organized, embodied, and emplaced through material practices of manipulation and transformation that permeated all facets of social experience.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-1469605311433369"><title>Theoretical and ethnohistoric context</title>
<p>In this article we examine specific places at which material practices (which were simultaneously religious, political, and social) were enacted and, in particular, the ways the elemental power of fire was implicated in these experiences. By focusing on earthen pyramids at Cahokia, ancestral temples at the nearby BBB Motor and Sponemann sites, and the ritual-residential complex at the East St Louis Site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1469605311433369">Figure 1</xref>), we argue that fire was a means of animating and transforming spaces and objects, and, in doing so, transferring power to particular social agents within the Cahokian polity.
<fig id="fig1-1469605311433369" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Regional map of the American Bottom with sites containing Late Stirling phase burned temples.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1469605311433369-fig1.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>We engage the concepts of object agency and relational networks as key to our argument that fire was instrumental in transforming objects, places, and people into powerful entities. We explore materiality as relational and contextual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1469605311433369">Meskell, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1469605311433369">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1469605311433369">Pels, 1998</xref>); objects are created as meaningful <italic>in relation</italic> to particular actions by or in the presence of particular people, at particular times and in particular places. Meaning is created in and through the production, use, and deconstruction/reconstruction of objects, ‘through action rather than simply through conceptualization’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1469605311433369">Meskell, 2005</xref>: 2).</p>
<p>Artifacts have politics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr85-1469605311433369">Weiner, 1992</xref>) and social lives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1469605311433369">Appadurai, 1986</xref>), meaning that objects, elements, places, spaces, buildings, and human remains were all active and power-laden entities (or ‘other-than-human persons’, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1469605311433369">Morrison, 2000</xref>) with the ability to cause, influence, and structure society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1469605311433369">Walker and Schiffer, 2006</xref>: 68). The attribution of agentic power to non-human entities requires some unpacking of the term ‘agency’, however. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1469605311433369">Pels (1998: 94)</xref> provides a cogent discussion of the divide between scholars who view agency as deriving solely from human interaction and inscription (spirit <italic>in</italic> matter) and scholars who see things as able to communicate their own messages (spirit <italic>of</italic> matter). Though focusing on commodities or objects with exchange value, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1469605311433369">Appadurai (1986)</xref> derives object agency from human agency; things are animated by human intervention and interaction. Likewise, Pels critiques <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1469605311433369">Miller (1987)</xref> for viewing objects as empty vessels into which humans breathe life and meaning. Rather, Pels argues for a spirit <italic>of</italic> matter, breaking down the dichotomies between subject and object, ideal and material.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1469605311433369">Meskell (2004: 4)</xref>, on the other hand, attempts to ‘contain the limits of agency’ and ‘contextualize the agency of objects’, requiring human practice (and seemingly intentionality) to animate things. However, along with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1469605311433369">Pels (1998)</xref>, Meskell also argues for agency to be contextually contingent; at some points in an object’s life its agentic power may have been inscribed by human intentions, while at others it may have seemed to be independently efficacious (2004).</p>
<p>In our usage here, we approach agency at its most basic point: as the ability to effect change or shape a social situation. We seek to approach materiality (and therefore object agency) much like Miller and VanBeek (as cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1469605311433369">Pels, 1998</xref>: 99–100), as a ‘quality of relationship rather than of things’. And though we agree with the contextual approach put forth by Meskell and Pels, we feel an attempt to identify intentionality and to classify how people in the past attributed the source of animation may not be plausible, and in some cases may be unnecessary for understanding the social relationships among persons (whether they be human or non-human). Instead, we are concerned with how people in the past <italic>related</italic> with specific things, places, elements, and objects <italic>as</italic> other social beings in specific moments, and specifically the social consequences of those relationships.</p>
<p>In making the argument that identifying the past loci of animating power may be unnecessary, we point to recent (and some not-so-recent) discussions of ontological alterity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1469605311433369">Alberti and Bray, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1469605311433369">Alberti and Marshall, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1469605311433369">Hallowell, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1469605311433369">Morrison, 2000</xref>). This approach allows for an understanding of a past in which people did not just have different world <italic>views</italic>, but rather inhabited worlds that were ontologically different from the world with which we as researchers engage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1469605311433369">Alberti and Marshall, 2009</xref>: 345). Applying an alternative ontological approach serves to invalidate the implicit dichotomization between a western reality that is scientifically ‘known’ and the ways that the same world was (‘falsely’) interpreted by Others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1469605311433369">Alberti and Bray, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1469605311433369">Alberti and Marshall, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1469605311433369">Morrison, 2000</xref>). This approach allows for worlds that are inhabited by human persons as well as ‘other-than-human persons’ (e.g. spirits, deities, agentic elements, and animated objects) alike, making the ‘supernatural’ natural (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1469605311433369">Hallowell, 1975</xref>).</p>
<p>Further, by engaging with alternative relational ontologies, we focus on the concept that objects, spaces, and places are persons engaged in a relationship with other persons based in a shared knowledge of experience. Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr88-1469605311433369">Zedeno (2009: 407)</xref>, relational ontology is the ‘notion that humans and objects exist in a reciprocal world’ and that this world is phenomenological ‘resulting from observation and experience of similarities and differences in the qualities of people, objects, places and entities’ (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1469605311433369">Black, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1469605311433369">Brown and Emery, 2008</xref>). A relational ontological approach allows archaeologists to move beyond typologies and instead focus on experiences evidenced in an object’s biography and relationships to other beings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1469605311433369">Gosden and Marshall, 1999</xref>). Within the context of the transference of power(s) through fire, an understanding of this relational animate ontology allows for the interpretation of fire as a person or a force of change rather than a tool of change.</p>
<p>Through the lenses of relational ontology, materiality, and agency, power was not only a singular act or experience, nor was it an object to be possessed. Rather, power was (and continues to be) an ongoing factor of social relationships produced through the creation of networks of elements (human, non-human) that gain meaning when part of a particular context (performative or otherwise) as well as through an object’s engagement with human actors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1469605311433369">Gillespie, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1469605311433369">Laneri, 2011</xref>: 79; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1469605311433369">Marcoux and Wilson, 2010</xref>). Acts of engagement with the world, which is inescapably material, interanimate and relate people, objects, and places (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1469605311433369">Kirk, 2006</xref>). The relationships woven between humans, animals, landscapes, objects, deities, and other co-dwellers continually reshape and reconstitute the relational network, or ‘meshwork’, of the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1469605311433369">Ingold, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1469605311433369">2011</xref>).</p>
<p>This concept of relational networks, we argue, allows archaeologists to interpret and investigate complex depositional contexts in order to determine how people engaged with their surroundings. Importantly for this discussion, we investigate how the element of fire – as it was implemented by human actors as part of such depositional contexts – became an agent in the construction of relationships of power. In particular, we ask how fire was utilized in multiple and diverse contexts on both the macro and the micro scales. Fire, as a powerful element that was supra-natural (see discussion below), was a part not only of public experience but also of private experiences, suggesting the knowledge of, use of, and relationship to the power of fire was dispersed across social communities.</p>
<p>While we recognize that attempting to make direct ethnohistoric analogies to people centuries or even millennia in the past is problematic, certain concepts, practices, and ways of life were so pervasive and widely dispersed at and after the time of European contact as to suggest deeper historical bases. As this seems to be the case regarding the conceptualizations of power and fire in the Eastern Woodlands, Southeast, and lower Plains of the United States, we feel that these ethnohistoric sources are valid places to begin to understand how power may have been framed, understood, and negotiated in the past. Likewise, such sources may provide a basis for beginning to understand the ontology of the world in which past Native persons dwelled through accounts of their engagement with that world.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1469605311433369">Pauketat (2008)</xref> has previously drawn upon the ethnohistorically documented Native American concept of an impersonal, widely dispersed cosmic force as a means of theorizing power and historical change. This conceptualization of power ‘dispersed across social fields’ and distributed among human and non-human agents, including animals, elements, objects, deities, natural forces and cosmic bodies, is known as Wa-kan-da among Siouan speakers, though similar concepts were known among Muskogean, Caddoan, and Algonquian speakers in the American midcontinent and South.</p>
<p>Among the Ho-Chunk, if an object was ‘wak’an’ it possessed agentic powers and was able to ‘bestow blessings’ upon people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1469605311433369">Radin, 1970[1923]</xref>: 283). Wah’Kon or Wa-kon-da was the ‘Mystery Force’ or life force recognized by the Osage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1469605311433369">Bailey, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1469605311433369">Mathews, 1961</xref>). This force became manifest in ‘all living, moving things’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1469605311433369">Bailey, 1995</xref>: 9). Similarly, Hewitt (in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1469605311433369">Hodge, 1910</xref>: 366) noted among the Fox and Iroquois the concept of ‘<italic>orenda</italic>’, a power ‘which was assumed … to be inherent in every body … and in every personified attribute, property, or activity’.</p>
<p>Algonquian speakers recognize a similar power:
<disp-quote>
<p>the <italic>manito</italic> ‘is an unsystematic belief in a cosmic, mysterious property … existing everywhere in nature … The conception of this something wavers between that of a communicable property, that of a mobile, invisible substance, and that of a latent transferable energy; … this substance, property, or energy is conceived as being widely diffused amongst natural objects and human beings … It is a distinct and rather abstract conception of a diffused, all-pervasive, invisible, <italic>manipulable</italic>, and <italic>transferable</italic> life-energy, or universal force … (Jones, 1905, as cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1469605311433369">Radin, 1970[1923]</xref>: 282; emphasis added)</p></disp-quote>The power of Wa-kan-da is embedded within all aspects of lived experience, mediating relationships between human and non-human agents or life-forces. This power is recognized in and negotiated through relationships between and among people, objects, ancestors, and natural and supernatural forces – including the element of fire.</p>
<p>Fire, among many Native North American groups, was considered to be the most beneficial of life-giving and sustaining forces – one that had been given to the people by supernatural beings; yet, at the same time, it was the most powerful, deadly and destructive force when uncontrolled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1469605311433369">Bailey, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1469605311433369">Bastian and Mitchell, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1469605311433369">Judson, 2000</xref>). The transformative power of fire was something recognizable by all members of the community – obviously it was used in cooking, home heating, and pottery production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1469605311433369">Hall, 1997</xref>). Its power as something beyond a resource, however, has been well documented. Among the Creek, fire was the earthly manifestation of the cosmic force or Wa-kan-da and the spark of the new (sacred) fire during the annual world-renewal ceremony was celebrated as a re-enactment of world creation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1469605311433369">Grantham, 2002</xref>). The Sacred Fire ‘possessed the power to resanctify things, relationships, and the entire community’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1469605311433369">Grantham, 2002</xref>: 81). Fire, as symbolic of the sun, featured prominently in the sacred houses of Osage chiefs. The fireplaces within these structures were consecrated and the embers taken from them were considered holy and possessing life-giving powers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1469605311433369">Bailey, 1995</xref>).</p>
<p>Fire acted as a messenger – transmitting messages and offerings by means of rising smoke (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1469605311433369">Radin, 1970[1923]</xref>). The Ho-Chunk regarded fire as a spirit who possessed powers useful to humans in exchange for offerings of tobacco (1970[1923]). Smoke was a line of communication between the current world of humans and the upper world of ancestral deities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1469605311433369">La Flesche, 1939</xref>). Ho-Chunk oral tradition tells of offerings of tobacco made to the buffalo spirits by means of smoke ‘ascending to the home of these spirits through a hole in the sky’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1469605311433369">Radin, 1970[1923]</xref>: 280). Smoke was also cleansing and purifying (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1469605311433369">Grantham, 2002</xref>). Fire, we argue, was used and experienced by Cahokians as both an object and an agent of power: meaning ancestors, mounds, and ancestral temples were created, manipulated, and transformed as persons and places of power in conjunction with or at the hands of fire.</p>
<p>Specifically among Cahokians during the late eleventh through the mid-thirteenth centuries, this dispersed cosmic power seems to have become concentrated in relationships and practices involving ancestral supernatural deities and extra-natural forces embodied in human remains, marker posts, and flintclay figurines, among other things. Drawing from a relational theory of social power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1469605311433369">Kovacik, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1469605311433369">O’Donovan, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr84-1469605311433369">Walker and Schiffer, 2006</xref>), we concern ourselves here with the relationships of power between Cahokians and their ancestor deities. We focus on the transference of the elemental power of fire to certain human remains in the creation of ancestors, the gathering of power in structures which house the remains of ancestors and religious paraphernalia, and the transubstantiation of these powerful structures and individuals through fire. Here we use transubstantiation (as opposed to transformation) intentionally, specifically following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1469605311433369">Gosden (2005</xref>: 209) who states: ‘A more useful word might be transubstantiation, which can look at how substances, such as stone, bone, metal or clay, take forms and qualities which transgress the boundaries between types of substances.’ Further, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr81-1469605311433369">Sofaer (2007</xref>: 2) argues that transubstantiation implies that the ‘line between subject and object is blurred’, meaning that the object does not just stand for something else, but it <italic>is or becomes</italic> something or someone else. Transubstantiation follows transformation in that it focuses on a change from one state to another, but moves beyond by incorporating not only the physical but also the emotional and spiritual components of things (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1469605311433369">Harvey, 2006</xref>: 118). So, based on the chronology in which events of transference, gathering, and transubstantiation took place, we suggest that these practices entangled religious and political powers within the realm of daily life, suggesting that Cahokia was at once both a political state and a religious state.</p>

<p>Cahokia’s florescence entailed rapid population growth due to large-scale local and regional immigration, reorganization of urban and rural spaces, and the initiation of construction on a series of monumental public works (earthen pyramids and engineered plazas) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1469605311433369">Alt, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1469605311433369">Dalan et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1469605311433369">Emerson, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1469605311433369">Pauketat, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1469605311433369">2004</xref>). Cahokian Mississippian society was a pluralistic, and, arguably, urban society with the inherent tensions of diverse histories, beliefs, and practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1469605311433369">Pauketat, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1469605311433369">2004</xref>). Pauketat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1469605311433369">1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1469605311433369">2004</xref>; also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1469605311433369">Emerson, 1997</xref>) suggests that perhaps Cahokia’s ascendancy suppressed or redirected tensions in the local political climate through a political-religious cult that facilitated a shared community identity. This religious cult appears to have entailed reverence for ancestor deities and supernatural heroes, as well as practices of maintaining equilibrium among cosmological forces (e.g. night and day; life and death; upper, lower, and middle worlds) and world renewal or perpetuation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1469605311433369">Emerson, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1469605311433369">Hall, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1469605311433369">Pauketat, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Following Emerson and Pauketat’s hypothesis that Cahokia was simultaneously a political and a religious state, power was likely attained from ancestor deities and supernatural beings who were active social agents within the Cahokian world. This power would have been most immediately harnessed in the post-mortem processing of and gathering together of human bodies, transubstantiating the dead into powerful ancestors within charnel structures, ancestor temples, and mound contexts. Interactions with the deceased provided intimate contexts where the living negotiated influential and powerful relationships with the ancestors through the physical manipulation and curation of human skeletal remains. Ancestral personages are often tied to the spiritual or supernatural realms, and relationships with these ancestors may legitimate an individual’s or a community’s power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1469605311433369">Chesson, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1469605311433369">Lucero, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1469605311433369">2010</xref>). In death, an individual can become an ancestor through post-mortem processing involving cremation, fragmentation, or burial in a specialized location (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1469605311433369">Chesson, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1469605311433369">Hertz, 1960</xref>). This new ancestor now is a component of a broader community, a connection between the living world and the upper world.</p>
<p>Specifically, acts of ancestor creation are identifiable at multiple Cahokian contexts like charnel structures and ancestor temples, including the foundational interments in Mound 72, a ridge-top mortuary mound at Cahokia, discussed below (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1469605311433369">Fowler et al., 1999</xref>). Dead persons were constructed as powerful entities, engaged with as mediators between the here-world and other spiritual worlds and able to intercede in the present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1469605311433369">Hall, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1469605311433369">Pauketat, 2010</xref>). In the context of relational networks, the living and the dead were intertwined in the construction of power in mortuary spaces, whether those spaces were public (mounds or plazas) or private (households). The living negotiated with and through the dead to invoke the powers of the gods and the ancestors, joining the present to the past (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1469605311433369">Pauketat, 2010</xref>: 27; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1469605311433369">Bradley, 1998</xref>). It was not uncommon for the living to keep the souls of the dead or for mourners to adopt their spirits, thus suggesting that the dead could be reincarnated through acts of curation, manipulation, and transubstantiation through cremation or other acts of burial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1469605311433369">Brown, 1953</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1469605311433369">Hall, 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1469605311433369">2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1469605311433369">Pauketat, 2010</xref>: 17).</p>
<p>Modest ancestor temples and charnel structures, notable for their anachronistic attributes (i.e. pre-Mississippian single-post construction), served as places to gather and manipulate powers, especially those of certain ancestral personages, using human skeletal remains among other religiously charged caches of objects (e.g. ground stone celts, arrowheads, stone hoes; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1469605311433369">Fowler et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1469605311433369">Pauketat and Alt, 2004</xref>). Simultaneously, through the inclusion of human remains within particular religious spaces, the living changed the dead into ancestors by separating the spirit from the body, while imbuing buildings and mounds with power.</p>
<p>While simultaneously constructing themselves as elite or religiously powerful, individuals created ancestors of the larger Cahokian community through the gathering together of their bodies into ridge-top mounds. A prime example of this gathering is Mound 72, a small ridge-top mound located south of Monks Mound and the central plaza (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1469605311433369">Fowler et al., 1999</xref>: 2, Figure 1.1) and constructed <italic>c</italic>.AD 1050 (concurrent with Cahokia’s ‘Big Bang’; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1469605311433369">Pauketat, 1994</xref>). Prior to the construction of the mound and later the ridge-top cap, a rectangular temple was used, decommissioned, and became a burial location for bundled and fragmented human remains. These individuals were interred on top of the location of the walls of this structure and covered over with a low soil platform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1469605311433369">Fowler et al., 1999</xref>: 48). Following the inaugural deposits at the temple structure and the beaded blanket burial, the remains of 272 people included primary interments of at least two elite individuals, and multiple bundled ancestors. The majority of persons (mostly young women) were interred in pits as sacrificial offerings (see below for detailed discussion; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1469605311433369">Fowler et al., 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>The transubstantiation of the dead into ancestors is exemplified by the beaded blanket burial comprising the primary (72 Sub 1) interment of Mound 72. This burial consists of two male adult individuals buried on top of and under a shell-beaded falcon-shaped blanket. These individuals have been interpreted as representing the ‘Bird Man’ deity depicted in various media and contexts at Cahokia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1469605311433369">Brown, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1469605311433369">Fowler et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1469605311433369">Hall, 2000</xref>). Conversely, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1469605311433369">Pauketat (2010: 24)</xref> argues that these two men embody the Morning Star god-man and his Thunderer twin. He suggests this performance of death was possibly a ‘scripted event’ involving the display of objects and bodies to emphasize the powerful relationships among the dead, the living, and the spirit world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1469605311433369">Pauketat, 2010</xref>: 24). Either interpretation suggests that these two males, upon their death, were constructed as powerful elite as they were transmuted into gods, evidenced by their association with the falcon-shaped blanket, orientation to the solstices, and their burial with seven sacrificed individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1469605311433369">Fowler, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1469605311433369">Pauketat, 2010</xref>). These burials served as a platform on which to establish a hierarchy, a burial program, and a religion from the onset of Cahokia’s creation. Through the highly visible mortuary theatrics, these individuals were transubstantiated into powerful ancestral agents and thus potential sources of power.</p>
<p>At Cahokia and in the upland Richland Complex, the deceased were likewise transubstantiated into ancestors through acts of burning, fragmentation, and bundling. For instance, a small charnel structure (1 by 1.6 m) was built atop a large decommissioned square public building at the Grossmann site, argued by Susan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1469605311433369">Alt (2006)</xref> to be a Cahokian ritual outpost. This building served to collect and store the fragmented remains of at least 18 identifiable individuals, the remains of 10 of whom were burned prior to burial in this small structure. Potentially, the experience of burning, fragmentation, and burial facilitated the transformation of the dead into ancestors, possibly changing their lived identity into one that embodied specific kin or social groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1469605311433369">Chesson, 1999</xref>). Simultaneously, the practice of burning transferred the elemental power of fire to these ancestors and marked them as sources of communal power as they were all buried simultaneously in this small charnel structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1469605311433369">Otten, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>The practices of gathering power hence <italic>empowered</italic> spaces and places as well as the persons who performed the gathering. Special purpose structures, into which powers of the ancestors, elements, and deities were gathered, have been identified at Cahokia and surrounding outposts based on atypical size or shape, location on or near mounds, extra-domestic artifact assemblages, or post-abandonment treatment. These buildings often had special storage alcoves (T- or L-shaped), which likely held ritual paraphernalia or medicine bundles, or were larger rectangular structures with internal divisions, benches, or platforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1469605311433369">Collins, 1990</xref>) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1469605311433369">Table 2</xref>). These structures appear to have served simultaneously as priestly residences, as suggested by the presence of activity areas containing typical domestic debris (e.g. flint-knapping debitage, flake tools, utilitarian pottery, food-preparation tools). Importantly, these spaces became empowered and animated during religious practices that also took place within these structures.

<p>Practices within these religious structures or homes of priests or elites gathered together powerful substances of the earth in pigments (galena, hematite or ochre, kaolin), crystals (mica, quartz), pots (symbolically decorated Ramey Incised pots) and stone implements (formal bifaces known as Ramey knives), all of which provide evidence of extra-domestic activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1469605311433369">Emerson, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-1469605311433369">Pauketat and Emerson, 1991</xref>). Power was contained within the element of fire, which embodied both sky (via the smoke spiraling upward) and earth (via the ashes left behind) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-1469605311433369">Pauketat, 2008</xref>), as well as the duality of destructive power and life-giving power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1469605311433369">Bailey, 1995</xref>). Fire was harnessed and ingested through practices of burning and smoking. Feathers and wing fans imbued costumed practitioners with powers of the sky. In addition to the ‘typical domestic debris’ outlined above, floors, hearths or pits within or near these structures often contained some combination of fragments of hematite, galena, quartz, or fluorite, fragments of carved pipes and seeds of tobacco, flint clay statues depicting supernatural heroes and forces, wing bones of swan, heron, goose, turkey or other large birds, and miniature vessels which may have contained medicines or were used to mix pigments.</p>
<p>An early twelfth-century example of a priestly residence or temple complex has been recovered at the northern end of the BBB Motor site, located two to three miles northeast of Cahokia (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1469605311433369">Figure 1</xref> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1469605311433369">Emerson, 1997</xref>)). This site encompassed a complex of ancestral temples, formal cemetery space, and one charnel structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1469605311433369">Figure 3</xref>). The ancestral temples specifically sat in association with the cemetery and possible charnel structure complex located at the site. The temples themselves were located on the edges of a possible courtyard and contained detailed structured deposits including, in one context, a fragmented carved-redstone female figurine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1469605311433369">Emerson, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1469605311433369">Emerson and Jackson, 1984</xref>). This statuette (the Keller figurine) depicts a female who is kneeling in front of what appears to be a woven basket (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1469605311433369">Figure 4</xref>); baskets such as these have been suggested to be repositories of sacred objects, even pieces of ancestors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1469605311433369">Reilly, 2004</xref>).

<p>This figurine was fragmented into two pieces: the upper torso and head were found in a shallow depression inside of a likely ancestral temple, the lower portion was recovered from a burned zone of a small pit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1469605311433369">Emerson and Jackson, 1984</xref>). Importantly, a large irregular pit with evidence of multiple episodes of prehistoric excavation, re-filling and re-excavation was located on the floor of this same temple structure. This pit contained exotic materials suggestive of a specialized meaning and extra-domestic use of the structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1469605311433369">Emerson and Jackson, 1984</xref>: 224). This temple structure was located approximately six meters east of a cluster of burials – some of which appear to have been emptied of human remains, possibly disinterred to be gathered into mound deposits. A second structure, probably related to the ancestral temple, contained an interior sub-floor hearth surrounded by several distinct areas of burning – suggesting multiple repeated practices in which fire was an agent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1469605311433369">Emerson and Jackson, 1984</xref>).</p>
<p>A rectangular structure with internal benches was excavated at the earlier, eleventh-century, southern end of the site (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1469605311433369">Figure 3</xref>). This structure was located two and a half meters east of a second cemetery area, suggesting this may have been a structure in which human remains were processed and housed (i.e. a charnel structure). The combination of a likely charnel structure, cemetery areas, fragmented human remains, ancestral temples, and fragmented ancestral figurines suggests that the BBB Motor site complex channeled the power of the ancestors through buildings, burials, human bone, objects, and, at times, through fire. The power gathered and embodied within eleventh- and twelfth-century religious buildings such as these, located at and near Cahokia, appears to have necessitated equally powerful forces of deconsecration, often enacted through an accelerated use of fire in the later part of the twelfth and into the early thirteenth centuries.</p>
<p>The intentional burning of structures appears to have had multiple meanings within the Cahokian world – some structures were intentionally cleaned out prior to burning. These buildings may have been burned as a termination or deconsecration practice, to mark the <italic>end of the use</italic> of a structure. Others were burned with a full or nearly full complement of religious paraphernalia. While the possibility remains that these structures burned as a result of accidental conflagration, the pattern of multiple isolated burned structures containing supra-domestic materials, recovered from non- or supra-domestic contexts (mortuary features, mound levels, etc.), together with the lack of evidence of fire spreading to nearby structures (a potentiality during a sudden accidental burning event), would suggest otherwise.</p>
<p>Likewise, the burning of structures is often associated with violent conflict and raiding – and is certainly part of later regional conflict during the late twelfth and into the thirteenth centuries in Cahokia’s northern hinterlands. Typically, the burning of structures during conflict appears to be more opportunistic and widespread (e.g. the village of Orendorf in the Central Illinois River Valley; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1469605311433369">Conrad, 1991</xref>), rather than targeted and contained. Instead, we argue, the burned structures containing religious or supra-domestic materials appear to have been burned independently of other structures as a religious act in which certain powerful substances and objects were transubstantiated through fire – connecting these gathered powers with other worlds. Examples of the first two types of burning are commonly found throughout the twelfth century (or Stirling phase) – what is considered the Classic Cahokian time period.</p>
<p>Burned structures with intact assemblages of powerful objects – likely offerings which were intentionally placed on the floor or within shallow interior pits prior to incineration – are found within layers of mound construction at Cahokia as well as at outlying religious centers. Late eleventh- and early twelfth-century burned structures are commonly found within mound contexts; buildings were incinerated and almost immediately covered with a purifying layer of soil, often evidenced by partial burning or heating of the soil spread over the burned contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1469605311433369">Pauketat, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1469605311433369">Smith, 1969</xref>).</p>
<p>The eleventh/twelfth-century (Lohmann/early Stirling phase) Murdock mound – a small flat-topped earthen pyramid on the northeast edge of Cahokia’s Grand Plaza – was constructed over a cross-shaped structure theorized to have ritual storage areas similar to those of the aforementioned T- and L-shaped buildings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1469605311433369">Smith, 1969</xref>: 54, Figure 29). This particular building was burned and while still smoldering immediately covered over with soil. In fact, most of the Murdock structures were burned and covered with soil prior to each episode of reconstruction. A few stratigraphic levels above the cruciform structure sat a single-set post L-shaped structure with a burned floor. Directly over that structure were two buildings – a rectangular structure and a circular ceremonial structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1469605311433369">Smith, 1969</xref>: 63, Figure 33). The rectangular structure within this complex contained a puddled clay floor, a formal clay hearth with a large Ramey Incised pot (a specialized Cahokian pottery style) with food residue. The circular structure had a clay-lined floor, mat-covered walls, and a clay-lined hearth with evidence for a continuous fire or fires used over a long period of time. Both of these structures were burned in a single event, evidenced by a continuous burned clay surface connecting the two buildings. These structures were immediately capped with soil, creating a mound platform upon which another large rectangular structure was constructed, burned, and subsequently buried (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1469605311433369">Smith, 1969</xref>).</p>
<p>Near the completion of the Murdock temple construction, deconsecration, and renewal sequence a platform was built and a large marker post was placed on top of these building episodes. On removal of the large marker post, the extraction ramp and post-hole were half filled with ash. Archaeologists suggest that this act was part of the inaugural ceremony for the construction of the temple mound – the largest clay mantle upon which a temple with thick wattle and daub walls was built (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr80-1469605311433369">Smith, 1969</xref>). This final structure was terminated by fire, suggesting that power lies in the animation of these buildings, mounds, and religious spaces.</p>
<p>Likewise, at the base of the Kunnemann mound in the northern part of the site was a structure with a storage extension or portico, woven mat wall coverings, a formal clay hearth, and numerous objects of specialized production (i.e. shell bead and shell pendant production) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1469605311433369">Pauketat, 1993</xref>). This early twelfth-century (Stirling phase) temple was incinerated and buried beneath a layer of black clay. This area was later topped with another large rectangular structure continuing a sequence of construction, destruction, and renewal. Elizabeth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1469605311433369">Benchley (1975)</xref> also noted a similar series of burned structures and mound mantles on the first terrace of Monks Mound suggesting this practice was important to creating, deconstructing, and commemorating powerful places.</p>
<p>Notably, a series of temple structures appear to have been burned during the late twelfth century as a political action, one that was simultaneously religious, which marked the termination of specific power-laden practices. The burning of buildings during the latter part of the twelfth century is qualitatively different from earlier practices, and in fact a number of these structures appear to have been burned during the same time period. A prime example of a non-mounded burned temple complex occurs at the Sponemann site just north of Cahokia (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1469605311433369">Figure 1</xref>). This late twelfth-century occupation included one structure with red cedar timbers. Tobacco, nightshade, two miniature beakers, a miniature jar, a Ramey Incised jar, quartz crystal, and a cache of agricultural implements were found within that structure, in addition to what would be considered typical domestic artifacts as previously described.</p>
<p>Significantly and similarly to the BBB Motor site, fragments of at least three flint clay female figurines recovered from the floor of that structure were shattered in the building’s termination fire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1469605311433369">Jackson et al., 1992</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-1469605311433369">Figure 5</xref>). Fragments of those three figurines were recovered from numerous feature contexts across the site. Two additional rectangular structures at Sponemann were burned, preserving in one structure the red cedar wall posts and a large cedar-cane hearth.

<p>A similarly burned twelfth-century (Stirling phase) structure was excavated in the East St Louis neighborhood of the Central Cahokian Administrative Complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1469605311433369">Figure 1</xref>); found on the floor of this building were areas of pigment concentration (powdered hematite and lumps of kaolin), burned acorn, corn and other seeds, a number of projectile points (both local and foreign styles), a small cedar post in a woven basket (possibly an ancestor), and a small female figurine buried in a shallow red-ochre-lined depression within the structure prior to burning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1469605311433369">Boles and Benson, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Other late twelfth-century (Stirling phase) and early thirteenth-century (Moorehead phase) burned temple structures are visible across the Cahokian landscape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1469605311433369">Figure 1</xref>). For example, a rectangular and a circular structure were identified at the Old Edwardsville Road and Vaughn Branch sites, located near each other in the northern American Bottom, a burned rectangular structure was excavated at the Baby Moon site southwest of Cahokia, and a large rectangular structure with possible internal platform was located at the Lawrence Primas site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1469605311433369">Jackson and Millhouse, 2003</xref>; Pauketat, personal communication; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1469605311433369">Pauketat and Woods, 1986</xref>). Like those detailed above, similar domestic and extra-domestic assemblages are often found on the floors and in shallow pits within these burned structures, including a full complement of ceramic vessels (cooking pots, serving vessels, storage jars), galena, hematite, quartz crystals, stone pipes, caches of stone hoes, and lithic debitage.</p>
<p>Finally, one of the most significant examples of catastrophic incineration was found in the East St Louis neighborhood. Here a series of up to 95 small square structures were found enclosed within a palisade – all of which had been burned in a single event (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-1469605311433369">Figure 6</xref>). Found within these structures were Ramey jars, formal bifaces, pigments, crystals, clay objects, and shelled maize in proportions suggesting these were not normal domestic stores. Rather, these appear to have been religiously significant stores very similar in content to other burned temples around the Cahokia realm (Fortier, 2007; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1469605311433369">Pauketat, 2005</xref>).
<fig id="fig6-1469605311433369" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p>Burned storage structures at East St. Louis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1469605311433369">Pauketat, 2005</xref>; used with permission of the Illinois State Archaeological Society).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1469605311433369-fig6.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The East St Louis palisade, along with the storage structures located within, was the only fortification in the American Bottom that was burned, though palisades also existed around the central precinct of downtown Cahokia (Iseminger et al., 1990) and at least one upland Cahokian outpost at the northern end of the American Bottom (the Olin site, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1469605311433369">Baltus, 2009</xref>). As no large-scale catastrophic burning occurred in the American Bottom, especially when compared to Cahokia’s northern hinterlands, the question remains as to whether these fortifications were built in response to extant warfare, as political posturing, as separation within the site due to internal factional conflict, or simply as a means to further delineate spaces.</p>
<p>Whether the storage structures at East St Louis were burned in an act of warfare, an action resulting from internal strife, or as a religious termination remains an unanswered question, one which current data does not lend itself to resolving (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1469605311433369">Pauketat, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1469605311433369">Pauketat et al., n.d.</xref>). Like the burned structures of the late eleventh and early twelfth centuries, these later burned buildings do not fit a pattern associated with accidental conflagration or wholesale burning during raiding. At the same time there are distinct dissimilarities with the earlier burned structures, most especially in their finality. Important for our discussion below is the timing, content, and social-historical context of burned structures.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-1469605311433369" sec-type="discussion|conclusion"><title>Discussion and conclusion</title>
<p>Previous discussion of burned structures at and around Cahokia often point to functional explanations. Buildings were burned through accidental conflagration or violent attack, preserving artifacts in situ, thus allowing archaeologists to identify indigenous use of space and ‘typical’ household assemblages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1469605311433369">Collins, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1469605311433369">Pauketat, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-1469605311433369">Pauketat and Woods, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-1469605311433369">Wilson and Bardolph, 2010</xref>), or were burned intentionally as a means of removing an abandoned structure from the immediate landscape, to rid the structural remains of insect or rodent infestations, or eliminate the smell of ‘waste’. However, in some instances, buildings were suggested to have been ‘ritually burned’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1469605311433369">Pauketat, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr86-1469605311433369">Wilson and Bardolph, 2010</xref>) as part of a ‘ceremonial killing of the structure’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1469605311433369">Jackson et al., 1992</xref>) during purification and renewal rites using meaningful materials and fire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1469605311433369">Pauketat, 2004</xref>). While acknowledging the use of fire surpassed purely functional explanations, most of the ‘ritual’ explanations do not engage fire itself as a social agent. Likewise, with the exception of Wilson and Bardolph, many of the discussions of burned structures do not contextualize the use of fire throughout Cahokian history.</p>
<p>Significantly, the non-mound structures, which had been catastrophically burned with both domestic and extra-domestic (i.e. ritual) objects inside, date to the later part of the twelfth century (late Stirling phase around or slightly later than AD 1150) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1469605311433369">Table 3</xref>). It would appear that the meaning of this later burning had changed from the religious associations attached to the earlier termination and reincarnation of structures within mound layers. This shift in meaning coincides with the construction of the palisade around the central core at Cahokia and at key upland villages, as well as with burned fortified villages and fatalities in Cahokia’s northern hinterlands (Aztalan in Wisconsin, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-1469605311433369">Rudolph, 2009</xref>; Central Illinois River Valley, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1469605311433369">Conrad, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr87-1469605311433369">Wilson and Steadman, 2007</xref>). The palisade walls at Cahokia, East St Louis, and the Olin site indicate a concern with protecting the core religious (and arguably elite) areas of the community rather than the entire site. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1469605311433369">Baltus (2009)</xref> has previously suggested, perhaps practices and identities associated with Cahokian religion had become targets of warfare within the region. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr83-1469605311433369">Trubitt (2000)</xref> suggests that the transition from the twelfth-century Stirling phase to the thirteenth-century Moorehead phase marks a shift in political strategy; potentially this political shift stemmed from competing chiefly contenders within the Cahokian polity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1469605311433369">Milner, 1998</xref>) or a socio-political revitalization which included the termination of the ‘traditional’ politico-religious materializations which fomented the Cahokian Mississippian era (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1469605311433369">Baltus, 2011</xref>). Regardless, it appears that the power of fire in the late twelfth century may have been utilized as a means of mediating politics, creating a physical break from past religious practices whether driven by internal (ritual termination) or external (threat of violence) forces.

<p>In early Cahokian history, places of power were constructed through the creation of ancestors through fragmentation, burning, and bundling, the gathering of ancestors in temples, through regular additions to monumental constructions and through repeated religious practices entailing burning and smoking. Important to our point here, the elemental power of fire – a power which was instilled to humans from a supernatural force – was harnessed by some in the act of termination of temple structures and the reincarnation of these structures through layers of earth. Powerful people, like powerful places and objects, were constructed as ‘part of the process of cultural construction’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1469605311433369">Emerson and Pauketat, 2002</xref>: 107). By the time of European contact, and most probably centuries before, mound summits were elite political and religious spaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1469605311433369">Bourne, 1904</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1469605311433369">Knight, 1989</xref>). We argue that these spaces, as well as elite identities, were constructed through religious practices which were simultaneously political as they harnessed the power of the elements, deities, and ancestors. While the practices that took place <italic>within</italic> specialized temples may not have been widely visible to all of Cahokia’s inhabitants and visitors, the deconsecration of buildings through incineration and subsequent burial in layers of mounded earth would have been widely observable and participatory, making the power of fire available to all who took part but probably concentrated in those who controlled it.</p>
<p>Fire in and of itself was a powerful entity as an agent of destruction as well as an agent of transubstantiation. Fire has the ability to fragment objects – separating a whole into parts (like the flint clay figurines previously mentioned, as well as buildings and human remains). Fragmentation in this manner ‘help[s] people think about and understand various types of social and spatial transformation’, potentially transforming spaces, bodies, and objects into powerful agents through fire and fragmentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1469605311433369">Bruck, 2006</xref>: 302). Social, political, and religious relationships are simultaneously created and altered through material transubstantiation. In the case of Cahokia, the elemental power of fire became a catalyst of change that was at once religious and political.</p>
<p>The burning event(s) that took place during the latter part of Cahokia’s history extended beyond termination of individual religious structures to burning hinterland villages and communities; this shift created an historical break with past practices which took place in those spaces, marking a politicized reorganization of religion. These burning events were categorically different from those which preceded them, as no reincarnation was instated, no earthen mound was constructed. Instead, villages and communities to the north of Cahokia were burned to the ground, religious buildings were no longer built with the specialized L- and T-construction, even everyday utilitarian pottery was made in a completely different manner. These changes in daily life at and around Cahokia mark for archaeologists the late twelfth-century/early thirteenth-century shift to the Moorehead phase. For Cahokians, the power of fire appears to have been the catalyst for a historical disjuncture, one that not only transmuted spaces visibly but also altered them spiritually and experientially.</p>
<p>In its daily use the transubstantive power of fire would have been recognizable by all – it turned raw resources into food, pottery, and workable stone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1469605311433369">Hall, 1997</xref>). Significantly, in the aforementioned contexts fire altered the powers of place, people, and objects from the quotidian to the supernatural. Ancestors and spirits were reached through the smoke from a fire; fires deconstructed and, together with earth, renewed buildings and mounds. Through a reconceptualization of power and politics, fire appears to have been a political agent itself, with the power to terminate politically charged religious places, paraphernalia, and even practices; Cahokia’s religious practitioners, through their ability to harness the supernaturally conferred power of fire, were constructed and defined as political agents and thus sources of power themselves. The visual and highly public experiences of certain rites, particularly fires, at temples and mounds emphasizes that the Cahokia religious experience was laden with power, whether that be the power of a central actor, the power of the object or element, or the power of the collective people.</p>
