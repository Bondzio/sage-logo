<abstract>
<p>The objective of this study is to explore preprint sharing in the context of quick sharing of scientific papers through the lens of knowledge sharing, which is largely overlooked by the previous literature. In this study, we developed a research model from the perspectives of motivation and trust basing on the Theory of Reasoned Action. We carried out an online survey of authors who had contributed their preprints to the Chinese preprint system, Sciencepaper Online. The results showed that trust is the key determinant of Attitude towards preprint sharing, while Anticipated Extrinsic Reward impacts both Image and Sense of Self-Worth which further impact Attitude. Attitude and Subjective Norm both impact Intention. These findings and their implications for theory and practice are discussed. We believe that the current research usefully contributes to the theoretical development of the structural model concerning quick sharing of preprints both in the specific context of Sciencepaper Online and other quick sharing platforms more generally, and also provide useful insights into and helpful suggestions for Chinese preprint sharing practice.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Quick sharing of a scientific paper is critical for the efficient utilization of its value. Too long a period between the submission and the publishing of a scientific paper is a big problem, which may make the paper lose its value before getting published. A preprint is a draft of a scientific paper that has not yet been published in a peer-reviewed scientific journal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0266666912449455">Jamali and Nicholas 2009</xref>). Previous literature has investigated the utility and usage of preprints in different scientific fields (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0266666912449455">Alan 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0266666912449455">Pinfield 2001</xref>). The emergence of preprints and the rapid growth of Internet technologies have contributed tremendously to the quick sharing of scientific papers. Researchers can freely exchange their academic ideas and new achievements quickly and in real time on quick sharing platforms, which have the effect of “reducing the lag time of waiting for a paper to appear” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0266666912449455">Wertman 1999</xref>: 8). Quick sharing platforms increase the dissemination of authors’ researches and “increase the profile of authors, institutes and countries” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0266666912449455">Prosser 2003</xref>: 169). All these to some extent relate to motivations such as Image and Sense of Self-Worth. However, the advantages to researchers may be lost if quick sharing platforms lack proper protection of intellectual property rights. This could expose knowledge contributors to the risk of opportunistic behaviour by knowledge users, as compared with the protection offered by the traditional and formal way of getting their papers published in peer-reviewed scientific journals. “Trust is crucial wherever risk, uncertainty, or interdependence exist” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0266666912449455">McKnight and Chervany 2001</xref>: 7022). So we include trust together with motivation in this study to better understand the sharing of preprints by Chinese researchers on quick sharing platforms.</p>
<p>It is suggested that “knowledge is the information processing that takes place in human minds, as well as personalized information related to facts, procedures, concepts, interpretations, ideas, observations, and judgments” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0266666912449455">Alavi and Leidner 2001</xref>: 109). From the formal aspect, preprints are very similar to published papers. However, researchers are more likely to treat preprints as their proprietary knowledge in the belief that once they share a preprint, the ownership and benefits based on it would disappear. Thus they may choose not to share their preprints if they perceive that they are valuable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0266666912449455">Yang and Lai 2010</xref>). In essence, preprint sharing is a kind of knowledge sharing behaviour and activity.</p>
<p>In China, preprint systems were the first open access strategy identified. In recent years, many institutions and organizations have set up preprint systems, including Sciencepaper Online (www.paper.edu.cn), Qiji Document (www.qiji.cn), National Science and Technology Library (prep.istic.ac.cn), and other small-scale preprint systems, so as to advocate and serve Chinese academics. Sciencepaper Online is sponsored by the Center for Science and Technology Development of the Ministry of Education (MOE) of the People's Republic of China and supervised by MOE, which enjoys relatively higher authority and reliability than those created and maintained privately. We thus chose Sciencepaper Online as the quick sharing platform context to understand the influence of motivation and trust.</p>
<p>Previous researches have established extrinsic and intrinsic benefits as motivators of human behaviour in several domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0266666912449455">Ganley 2011</xref>), including knowledge sharing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0266666912449455">Osterloh and Frey 2000</xref>). We thus based our study on motivation theory to explore motivators of researchers’ preprint contribution. Meanwhile, trust became a prominent factor in our study since “participants will be less hesitant to post information and knowledge on community of practice sites once they trust that the other members will not misuse the posted information and knowledge” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0266666912449455">Ardichvili, Page and Wentling 2003</xref>: 72). Previous literature has empirically studied knowledge sharing behaviour in many contexts such as organizational environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0266666912449455">Yang and Maxwell 2011</xref>), electronic knowledge repositories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0266666912449455">Kankanhalli, Tan and Wei 2005</xref>), virtual communities in general (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0266666912449455">Chiu and Wang 2011</xref>), and Wikipedia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0266666912449455">Yang and Lai 2010</xref>), but preprint sharing in the context of quick sharing of scientific papers was largely overlooked. The aim of this study is to explore how motivation and trust impact researchers’ preprint sharing on Sciencepaper Online.</p>
<p>Following this introduction, we review the theoretical background and literature, focusing on the Theory of Reasoned Action, motivation theory and trust in the context of knowledge sharing. Then we develop the research model and hypotheses, describe the research methodology and the results of the research and provide a discussion of these results. Finally, we discuss the implications for theory and practice.</p>

<title>Theory of Reasoned Action</title>
<p>The Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA) suggests that behavioural intention could facilitate individual behaviour and that intention is determined by attitude and subjective norms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0266666912449455">Fishbein and Ajzen 1975</xref>). Attitudes towards behaviour are determined by people’s most important beliefs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0266666912449455">Fishbein and Ajzen 1975</xref>). TRA has been used to explore knowledge sharing intention and behaviour in previous literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0266666912449455">Lin 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0266666912449455">Bock et al. 2005</xref>). “Since TRA can be applied to virtually any behaviour” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0266666912449455">Bock et al. 2005</xref>: 90), we thus believe that it is appropriate to use TRA as the basis to investigate preprint sharing behaviour in the context of our research.

<title>Motivation theory</title>
<p>Motivation theory has been widely used as the theoretical base for research on human behaviour. According to motivation theory, motivation can be divided into two categories: extrinsic and intrinsic motivation. Many recent knowledge sharing studies have also applied this theory to explore individual sharing behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0266666912449455">Hsu et al. 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0266666912449455">Wasko and Faraj 2005</xref>). We accordingly integrate intrinsic motivation and extrinsic motivation to explore factors impacting attitude towards sharing preprints on Sciencepaper Online. Extrinsic motivation involves performing knowledge sharing because it may serve to satisfy indirect or instrumental needs. In this regard, anticipated financial rewards and position promotion within the organization are the representative motivations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0266666912449455">Kankanhalli, Tan and Wei 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0266666912449455">Tiwana and Bush 2005</xref>). Compared with extrinsic monetary rewards, which are tangible, image can be seen as an intangible extrinsic motivation, being similar to reputation and status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0266666912449455">Yang and Lai 2010</xref>). Intrinsic motivation involves performing knowledge sharing behaviour for its own sake and is spurred by values provided directly within sharing behaviour itself. Sense of self-worth is an excellent example of intrinsic motivation and is found to play a facilitating role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0266666912449455">Sun and Liu 2006</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0266666912449455">
<title>Trust</title>
<p>Trust is a complex, context-dependent and multi-faceted concept (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0266666912449455">Kelton, Fleischmann and Wallace 2008</xref>). Trust can be categorized into two types: relationship-based and institution-based. The first type, “relationship-based trust, emerges on the basis of recurring social interactions between trustor and trustee, and takes root when actors get to know one another and are able to predict what to expect and how the other party will behave in a certain situation” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0266666912449455">Ardichvili 2008</xref>: 547). In terms of characteristics, trust in organizations ranks competence, benevolence and integrity as most important components of trust (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0266666912449455">Xie and Peng 2009</xref>). In the context of the Internet, a website represents an institution. Thus institution-based trust can be recognized as website-based trust in our research context. The website characteristics are identified as important factors to affect online trust (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0266666912449455">Zhou 2011</xref>). Website-based trust has been shown to increase a user’s intention to participate in knowledge sharing through websites and that it reduced uncertainty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0266666912449455">Bandura 1982</xref>). So Sciencepaper Online could potentially offer institution-based trust to researchers who would thus trust in the integrity of Sciencepaper Online as a whole, and in the benevolence of other researchers.</p>

<title>Objective and research model</title>
<p>The objective of this study is to explore preprint sharing in the context of quick sharing of scientific papers from the perspectives of extrinsic motivation (Anticipated Extrinsic Rewards and Image), intrinsic motivation (Sense of Self-Worth) and Trust. We incorporate TRA, motivation theory and trust to develop our research model so as to explore preprint sharing intentions. The complete research model is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0266666912449455">Figure 1</xref>.</p>

<title>Hypotheses</title>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0266666912449455">Wiley (1997</xref>: 263) compared four surveys of employees’ motivational preferences, suggesting that “A good wage is an extrinsic reward with intrinsic potency”. In China, many higher education institutions reward researchers for the papers that they have published in high quality journals so as to promote the production of high quality papers. Just as “monetary rewards communicate what the company values” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0266666912449455">Wiley 1997</xref>: 263), monetary rewards for high quality papers communicate what these institutions value. It is suggested that “about 80 per cent of the factors in satisfying job opportunities come from the elements of the job such as achievement, recognition, and the work itself” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0266666912449455">Wiley 1997</xref>: 271). Image has been an intangible extrinsic motivation and in the context of quick sharing of preprint, image is much related to the recognition, respect and prestige brought by sharing one’s preprint on Sciencepaper Online. Since “rewards reflect ability and competence” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0266666912449455">Wiley 1997</xref>: 272), we believe rewards can also reflect intangible recognition, respect and prestige. Compared with the papers published in high quality journals, preprints are unfortunately not what these institutions in China value at present. We thus posit that researchers who are not rewarded for their preprint sharing behaviour would be less likely to be aware of image. This leads to our hypothesis below:</p>
<p>
<italic>H1: Anticipated Extrinsic Reward has a positive relationship with Image.</italic>
</p>
<p>It is suggested that “rewards, such as wages, that reflect ability and competence may lead to greater intrinsic motivation” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0266666912449455">Wiley 1997</xref>: 272), thus monetary rewards for high quality research papers can also reflect the ability of the researchers, which may further lead to greater intrinsic motivation. Similarly, in the context of quick sharing of preprints, the absence of monetary incentives or of points for promotion, or both, can be regarded as a lack of extrinsic motivations. Sense of self-worth matches well with social psychological forces; we thus posit that researchers who are not awarded due to their sharing behaviour would be less likely to be aware of self-value, efficacy and competence in relation to helping other researchers solve problems or creating new opportunities for other researchers, etc. This leads to our hypothesis below:</p>
<p>
<italic>H2: Anticipated Extrinsic Reward has a positive relationship with Sense of Self-Worth.</italic>
</p>
<p>Trust has been proved to be an important facilitator in cooperation and knowledge exchange (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0266666912449455">Adler 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0266666912449455">Ardichvili, Page and Wentling 2003</xref>). When researchers think Sciencepaper Online is reliable, their perceptions of the recognition and prestige brought by sharing preprints on Sciencepaper Online are more likely to increase. Meanwhile, in terms of institution-based trust, researchers would have trust in the integrity of Sciencepaper Online as a whole, and in the benevolence of other users, perceiving that other users adhere to a set of principles and will not misuse the preprints by, for example, “taking undue advantage of confidential information, advancing one’s personal agenda at the expense of the platform or other members, using the posted preprint to personally attack those who posted it, etc.” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0266666912449455">Ardichvili, Page and Wentling 2003</xref>: 72). On Sciencepaper Online, other researchers can comment on the posted paper so as to exchange ideas with each other. When researchers can get feedback about their preprints that are shared on Sciencepaper Online, they would probably trust the commentators and be more likely to further have a sense of self-worth. This leads to our hypotheses below:</p>
<p>
<italic>H3: Trust in Sciencepaper Online has a positive relationship with Image.</italic>
</p>
<p>
<italic>H4: Trust in Sciencepaper Online has a positive relationship with Sense of Self-Worth.</italic>
</p>
<p>Apart from trusting beliefs between persons, “sociologists see trust as a social structure and suggest that the impersonal structures that are inherent in a specific circumstance will facilitate trust building in this circumstance” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0266666912449455">Li, Hess and Valacich 2008</xref>: 46). When institutional structures such as the mechanism of open access and quick sharing of preprints in our study are in place and the social environment such as Sciencepaper Online is in proper order, researchers “are more likely to grant trust in general” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0266666912449455">Li, Hess and Valacich 2008</xref>: 46) with the hope of “getting some feedback or guidance from colleagues before sending off the work for formal peer review” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0266666912449455">Wertman 1999</xref>: 8) which would further nurture the positive attitude towards preprint sharing on Sciencepaper Online. This is consistent with the previous literature, which suggests that institution-based trust is strongly associated with attitudes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0266666912449455">Gefen, Karahanna and Straub 2003</xref>). We thus hypothesize below:</p>
<p>
<italic>H5: Trust in Sciencepaper Online has a positive relationship with Attitude towards preprint sharing on Sciencepaper Online.</italic>
</p>
<p>Image is related to status in one’s social system and is one of the most important motivations for users of online knowledge forums to contribute their knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0266666912449455">Lee and Jang 2010</xref>). Rogers argued that “undoubtedly one of the most important motivations for almost any individual to adopt an innovation is the desire to gain social status” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0266666912449455">1983</xref>: 215). Increased recognition by colleagues or the organizational community can be an important motivator for employees to contribute their knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0266666912449455">O'Dell and Grayson 1998</xref>). Some non-monetary incentives, such as recognition from others, contributing to work performance, have been identified to be significant in attitude formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0266666912449455">Green 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0266666912449455">Bock et al. 2005</xref>). Sciencepaper Online is an open access platform, so that researchers who share their preprints on it would probably benefit from showing to others that they have achieved much in research and “they are knowledgeable persons with valuable expertise” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0266666912449455">Ba, Stallaert and Whinston 2001</xref>: 231), thus earning respect from others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0266666912449455">Constant, Kiesler and Sproull 1994</xref>) and a better image (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0266666912449455">Constant, Sproull and Kiesler 1996</xref>). Meanwhile, by sharing preprints on Sciencepaper Online, researchers can show to others that they enjoy helping others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0266666912449455">Ba, Stallaert and Whinston 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0266666912449455">Wasko and Faraj 2000</xref>), thus earning them another kind of better image. This leads to our hypothesis below:</p>
<p>
<italic>H6: Image has a positive relationship with Attitude towards preprint sharing on Sciencepaper Online.</italic>
</p>
<p>In an ongoing interactive setting such as quick sharing of preprints on Sciencepaper Online, appropriate feedback is very critical. The formation of self-concept, as a kind of intrinsic reward, stems from many different processes and self-worth is involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0266666912449455">Boas, Bobert and Michael 1993</xref>). A general sense of self-worth increases general self-efficacy, which is a source of strength and confidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0266666912449455">Boas, Bobert and Michael 1993</xref>) and effective performance. Therefore, a researcher who is able to sense the linkage between his or her quick sharing behaviour and the improvement of the research processes of other researchers would more likely to develop a favorable attitude towards sharing preprints quickly. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0266666912449455">Bock et al. (2005</xref>: 93) defined “this cognition as an individual's sense of self-worth from their knowledge-sharing behaviour” and suggested that “the greater the sense of self-worth through knowledge sharing behaviour is, the more favorable the attitude towards knowledge sharing will be”. Thus, we hypothesize as below:</p>
<p>
<italic>H7: Sense of Self-Worth has a positive relationship with Attitude towards preprint sharing on Sciencepaper Online.</italic>
</p>
<p>According to TRA, attitude towards knowledge sharing positively affects the intention to share knowledge. “Limiting the domain of the behavioural intention model to the rational actor, intention to engage in a behaviour is determined by an individual's attitude towards that behaviour” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0266666912449455">Bock et al. 2005</xref>: 91). Since a positive attitude towards knowledge sharing supports the intention to share knowledge by an employee (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0266666912449455">Bock et al. 2005</xref>), we similarly hypothesize according to the context of our study as below:</p>
<p>
<italic>H8: Attitude towards preprint sharing on Sciencepaper Online has a positive relationship with Intention to share preprint on Sciencepaper Online.</italic>
</p>
<p>The subjective norm construct has received considerable empirical support as an important antecedent to behavioural intention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0266666912449455">Taylor and Todd 1995</xref>). Quick sharing of preprints is much encouraged by the Chinese government, which is likely to form normative pressure on researchers. It is reasonable to argue that when researchers have more perception that people who are important to them think they should share their preprints on Sciencepaper Online, this kind of normative pressure would be heavier. Given the Chinese cultural preference for saving face, we argue that heavier normative pressure would push researchers to give more consideration to sharing. This leads to our hypothesis below:</p>
<p>
<italic>H9: Subjective Norm has a positive relationship with Intention to share preprints on Sciencepaper Online.</italic>

<p>All the constructs in the research model are from the literature and all the corresponding measure items are adapted from the literature to fit the context of quick sharing of preprints on Sciencepaper Online. The three constructs, Anticipated Extrinsic Rewards, Sense of Self-Worth and Attitude were adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0266666912449455">Bock et al. (2005</xref>).

<sec id="section10-0266666912449455">
<title>Data collection</title>
<p>The research methodology and data collection process consisted of two stages. Firstly, we invited 18 PhD candidates who had different major backgrounds and who were users of Sciencepaper Online to respond to a pilot survey. We also had the opportunity to interact with some of these students if they experienced any problems completing the survey. Based on this experience, we adjusted the wording of several items. Then we undertook a larger scale survey.</p>
<p>The large scale survey collected data for 8 weeks through an online survey website which provides convenient functionality for designing questionnaires. After publishing the questionnaire online, we randomly selected around 700 authors and their email addresses from the columns of preprints of Sciencepaper Online. After dropping repeated authors, we had 594 authors and their emails. We then sent invitation letters separately to these selected authors explaining the purpose of our study and soliciting their participation. The respondents were asked to click on the URL link provided in the email message, which linked to our online survey. Eight invitation emails were returned due to wrong addresses; consequently, the total number of emails sent successfully was 586.</p>
<p>As one of the incentives for participation, respondents were informed that in return for completing the survey, they would receive a general report of the results. Finally, 260 valid responses were available, rendering a response rate of about 44 percent. The t-test of the demographic characteristics of the participants who responded in the first 2 weeks did not significantly differ from those who responded in the last 2 weeks. On this basis, response bias was not considered to be a concern. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0266666912449455">Table 2</xref> documents the demographic information of the 260 respondents.</p>

<p>From <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0266666912449455">Table 2</xref>, we can see that researchers in natural science constituted 47.3 percent of the respondents, a little more than the number of respondents in social science (40.0 percent). This is in line with the distribution of subject areas on Sciencepaper Online, which serves not only natural science but also social science.</p>
<p>Since the constructs and items are all from or adapted from previous English papers, the original instrument was developed in English and then translated to Chinese. It was then back-translated to English to ensure equivalence of meaning. All data were collected in Chinese and recorded in English for this paper.</p>

<title>Measurement model validation</title>
<p>We applied PLS (Partial Least Squares) structural equation modeling (SEM) to verify our theoretical model using the software application SmartPLS<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0266666912449455">1</xref></sup>, since the PLS algorithm is a components-based structural equation modeling technique “allowing each indicator to vary in how much it contributes to the composite score of the latent variable”, thus being “preferable to other techniques” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0266666912449455">Chin, Marcolin and Newsted 2003</xref>: 197).</p>
<p>Before testing the hypothesized relationships, we first assessed measurement validity. This was assessed through content validity, convergent validity and discriminant validity. With regard to content validity, all constructs and items in this study are based on the previous literature. So, we believe these constructs and items each have clear and correct meaning.</p>
<p>The whole measurement model consists of seven reflective constructs. The second item of Attitude towards preprint sharing on Sciencepaper Online was reverse coded. It is suggested that “items should be dropped if they exhibit low item-total correlations as these items reduce the internal consistency of the measurement scale” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0266666912449455">Rai and Bajwa 1997</xref>: 951). In this study, one item (ATT2) was thus dropped. After finally running the model after dropping the above item, we obtained results that support the convergent validity and discriminant validity. Factorial validity such as item loadings and cross loadings can also be used to help assess convergent validity and discriminant validity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0266666912449455">Straub, Boudreau and Gefen 2004</xref>).</p>

From <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0266666912449455">Table 3</xref>, we can see that all the values of CR are bigger than 0.930, which suggests higher reliability of all the reflective constructs.</p>

<title>Discussion and implications</title>
<sec id="section15-0266666912449455">
<title>Motivation</title>
<p>In our study, we focus on motivations, finding that Image and Sense of Self-Worth both impact the Attitude towards preprint sharing on Sciencepaper Online. We can see from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0266666912449455">Figure 2</xref> that these two motivations each have different key determinants. This leads to our concern as to the underlying formation of them. In the context of our study, Image can be described as the degree to which quickly sharing preprints can enhance one’s status, such as recognition, respect and prestige in one’s social system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0266666912449455">Moore and Benbasat 1991</xref>). A researcher must win recognition, respect and prestige from others, suggesting that the formation of Image comes from outside. Receiving monetary rewards or additional points for promotion in return for sharing one’s preprint on Sciencepaper Online illustrates a certain kind of regulation which exists as an outside power. Compared with other factors, this outside power can impact Image much more, just as the effect of Anticipated Extrinsic Rewards on Image can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0266666912449455">Figure 2</xref>. However, in the context of our study, Sense of Self-Worth refers to an individual’s degree of self-liking, based largely on competence, power or efficacy regarding quick sharing of preprints on Sciencepaper Online (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0266666912449455">Gecas 1971</xref>). A researcher can feel some kind of self competence, power, or efficacy through quickly sharing preprints, since this behaviour can help other researchers solve problems or create new opportunities for other researchers, etc. suggesting that the formation of Sense of Self-Worth comes from inside.</p>
<p>In order to better measure the impact of Anticipated Extrinsic Rewards, we removed both the link from Trust to Image and the link from Trust to Sense of Self-Worth. Consequently, we found that the explained variance of Image is 0.475 (a little less than 0.528 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0266666912449455">Figure 2</xref>) and that of Sense of Self-Worth is only 0.140. This confirms that Anticipated Extrinsic Rewards has a bigger effect on Image than on Sense of Self-Worth.</p>
<p>Our study examines the interaction between extrinsic monetary rewards, extrinsic image and intrinsic motivation. The result of this empirical research informs us of the role of extrinsic monetary rewards in the context of preprint sharing. First, it is not directly linked to Attitude towards preprint sharing; rather it positively impacts Image and intrinsic motivation, which is consistent with the previous research where rewards can reflect ability and competence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0266666912449455">Wiley 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0266666912449455">Calder and Staw 1975</xref>). Secondly, it is strongly linked to Image, while Image has a relatively small effect on Attitude towards preprint sharing, compared with other factors.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-0266666912449455">
<title>Trust</title>
<p>The result of this empirical research can help us better understand the role of Trust. First, from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0266666912449455">Figure 2</xref>, we can see that the links from Trust to Attitude, from Trust to Image and then from Image to Attitude, from Trust to Sense of Self-Worth and then from Sense of Self-Worth to Attitude are all significant, suggesting that Image and Sense of Self-Worth both partially mediate the relationship between Trust and Attitude.</p>
<p>Secondly, to test the mediating effect of Attitude on the link between Trust and Intention, we followed the three-step method recommended by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0266666912449455">Baron and Kenny (1986)</xref>, i.e. Step 1: Independent variable (IV)→dependent variable (DV) is significant. Step 2: IV→agrave;mediator (M) is significant. Step 3: IV +M→agrave;DV; if M is significant and IV is not significant, M fully mediates the impact of IV on DV; if both M and IV are significant, M partially mediates the impact of IV on DV. The results indicate that Attitude fully mediates the impact of Trust on Intention. This means that, when including the construct Attitude, the link between Trust and Intention is not significant, suggesting an indirect impact of Trust on Intention. Meanwhile, we also found that Image both fully mediates the impact of Anticipated Extrinsic Rewards on Sense of Self-Worth and partially mediates the impact of Trust on Sense of Self-Worth.</p>
<p>Thirdly, Trust is the key determinant of Attitude, which is consistent with previous researches suggesting that Trust has been proved to be an important facilitator in knowledge sharing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0266666912449455">Adler 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0266666912449455">Ardichvili, Page and Wentling 2003</xref>).</p>

<title>Implication for theory</title>
<p>Preprints embody the knowledge created by researchers. In this study, we explore preprint sharing in the context of quick sharing of scientific papers through the lens of knowledge sharing. We believe that the current research usefully contributes to the theoretical development of the structural model concerning quick sharing of preprints both in the specific context of Sciencepaper Online and more generally in other quick sharing platforms. Our findings concerning motivation and trust in the context of Sciencepaper Online can usefully help us better understand the determinants of quick sharing of preprints.</p>

<title>Implication for practice</title>
<p>Sciencepaper Online was created on August 11, 2003, approved by MOE and has shown quick development. Its new version was online on May 8, 2010 with more functionality based on opinions coming from different sources<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0266666912449455">2</xref></sup>. With the development of Sciencepaper Online, more and more researchers hope to become users. Sciencepaper Online has invited many famous researchers who enjoy good reputations as excellent scholars in their research fields and has created a special column called ‘Excellent Scholars’ for them. However, the potential problems of quick sharing of preprints such as its quality and impact its degree of acceptance by practitioners and academics alike, still exist for Sciencepaper Online.</p>
<p>In order to better understand the status of preprint sharing by Chinese ‘excellent scholars', we analyzed the relationship between the numbers of their preprints and the numbers of their published papers they uploaded to Sciencepaper Online. We noticed that many excellent scholars were more likely to upload their published papers (a kind of information) rather than preprints (their proprietary knowledge). We randomly selected 187 authors from the ‘Excellent Scholars' column whose research fields include natural science, social science and interdisciplinary science We found that 96 of the excellent scholars (slightly more than half) had uploaded preprints, which accounted for only 10 percent of the total papers, much less than the number of uploaded published papers. These data can to some extent indicate that excellent scholars seldom shared their preprints. From <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0266666912449455">Table 4</xref>, we can see that the mean level of Trust is 4.971, higher than the mid level of 4, suggesting that more and more researchers begin to trust Sciencepaper Online. From <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0266666912449455">Figure 2</xref>, we can see that Trust impacts Attitude, which further impacts Intention. In this study, we didn't measure behaviour, since “external factors such as a lack of facilitating conditions may prevent individuals from taking intended actions” and thus “intentions do not necessarily predict behaviour” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0266666912449455">Goodhue 1997</xref>: 451). The second data we collected concerning behaviour may lack enough evidence, but the statistical data lead to our concern as to the lack of possible facilitating conditions in the context of our study. In China, the protection of intellectual property rights is relatively much weaker than that in Western countries. This would definitely strengthen the belief of Chinese researchers, especially the famous ones, that sharing their preprints on Sciencepaper Online would bring greater risk of opportunistic behaviour on the part of other users, who may lack consciousness of intellectual property rights.</p>
<p>The quality and impact of quick sharing platforms are critical. They are to some extent associated with researchers’ social psychological motivations which impact quick sharing of preprints. As we can see from our findings, Image and Sense of Self-Worth both impact the Attitude. Even though researchers are more likely to believe that sharing their preprints on Sciencepaper Online is not the same as the formal process of getting their paper published, this sharing of preprints is controlled by a kind of mechanism of “getting published first, being reviewed later” <sup>2</sup>. The uploaded preprints receive both comments and rankings. For each preprint, Sciencepaper Online provides information on ranking, comments, date of sharing, number of times downloaded, and number of times recommended to others. Meanwhile, authors can revise their preprints according to the comments and are encouraged to submit their preprints to journals. These methods can undoubtedly promote the quality and further the impact of Sciencepaper Online. However, there is a long way to go for Sciencepaper Online to reach high quality given the way of “getting published first, being reviewed later” and its quality is still a big concern compared with the formal peer-reviewed scientific journals. Since Sciencepaper Online is supported by MOE, we thus recommend that MOE should invest an amount of money to reward the contributors who shared high quality preprints (quality can to some extent base on their rankings) on Sciencepaper Online for a long period of time. Considering that extrinsic monetary rewards can impact Image and Sense of Self-Worth as we found in our study, we believe monetary rewards which “reflect ability and competence” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0266666912449455">Wiley 1997</xref>: 272) can usefully contribute to the formation of psychological motivations which further impact quick sharing of preprints. This kind of monetary rewards can also convey the value that high quality preprints are much appreciated by MOE, thus lubricating and facilitating efficient quick sharing of high quality scientific papers.</p>
<p>The degree of acceptance of Sciencepaper Online by practitioners and academics alike is also critical. Our findings indicate that Subjective Norm has a significant and direct impact on Intention. Subjective Norm reflects the effect of environmental factors such as the opinions of a researcher’s tutors, friends, schoolmates, and colleagues on sharing behaviour. At present, not many universities and institutions in China accept Sciencepaper Online as a formal outlet for publishing scientific papers. So this kind of impact coming from people who are important and who can exert influence would be relatively low. In this case, Sciencepaper Online should further propagate its objective, policy, advantages and social values, especially in the universities, research institutions and R&amp;D corporations, so as to convince more of these institutions to accept Sciencepaper Online; meanwhile it should further improve its quality, considering that these two aspects can inform each other.</p>
<p>Scientific journals have long been the most important outlet for publishing and exchanging scientific papers, but long delays between submission and publication seriously limit the efficient dissemination and utilization of such papers. Researchers need to consider how to seek useful information efficiently, since information selection, organization and handling are no longer confined to information professionals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0266666912449455">Yan and Davison 2011</xref>). We suggest that Sciencepaper Online would to some extent help improve the status of quick sharing of scientific papers, promote the effective allocation of information resources, and help satisfy the information needs of Chinese researchers more appropriately.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Preprints embody the knowledge created by researchers. In making their preprints available before publication in formal journals, authors are likely to fear that their knowledge advantage would be lost due to the possible opportunistic behaviour by knowledge users who may lack consciousness of intellectual property rights, in the context of weak protection of intellectual property rights. In this study, we explored the quick sharing of preprints from the perspectives of motivation and trust. We believe that the current research usefully contributes to the theoretical development of the structural model concerning quick sharing of preprints, both in the specific context of Sciencepaper Online and more generally on other quick sharing platforms. We used data from 260 respondents to test our model, and the findings provide useful insights into practical preprint sharing on Sciencepaper Online so that it can help more efficiently solve problems such as its quality and impact, its degree of acceptance by practice and academic alike, etc. The findings concerning motivation and trust in the context of Sciencepaper Online can usefully help us to better understand the determinants of quick sharing of preprints.</p>
