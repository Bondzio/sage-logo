<abstract>
<p>Hypersensitivity reactions to chemotherapeutic drugs have been documented for numerous cancer therapies. Clinical hypersensitivity to <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> asparaginase has been reported to range from 0% to 75%. Throughout the United States, nurses assume frontline responsibility for the assessment of asparaginase-related hypersensitivity reactions. It is essential that nurses educate themselves on the signs and symptoms of asparaginase-related hypersensitivity reactions as well as current supportive care approaches. The purpose of this review is to summarize acute lymphoblastic leukemia and the role of asparaginase and the pathology of allergic reactions. We will also update nurses on the differences in asparaginase preparations including dosing, half-life, rates of hypersensitivity, and routes of administration. A summary of current management and supportive care strategies will be provided as will a discussion of the relationship between allergy, antibodies, and asparaginase activity.</p>

<title>Introduction: Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) Incidence, ALL Treatment Regimens, Role of Asparaginase</title>
<p>Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common type of cancer affecting children and adolescents. An estimated 6050 patients in the United States will be diagnosed with ALL in 2012, of which, approximately 70% will be patients younger than 34 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1043454212471728">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, National Institute of Health [NIH], National Cancer Institute [NCI], 2012</xref>). Treatment for ALL has continually evolved over the past 50 years. Substantial improvement in event-free survival (EFS) has been realized, particularly for B-cell ALL, with current estimates of 5-year EFS ranging from 76% to 86% for children who are treated with protocol-based regimens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1043454212471728">Pui, Carroll, Meshinchi, &amp; Arceci, 2011</xref>). The primary factors leading to the improved survival of ALL include the use of multiagent chemotherapy regimens, inclusion of an intensification cycle of chemotherapy, central nervous system–directed therapy, and assignment of treatment regimens based on identified risk factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1043454212471728">Carroll &amp; Raetz, 2012</xref>).</p>
<p>Treatment for most patients will involve multiple chemotherapy agents, administered in phases (remission induction, consolidation or intensification, and continuation or maintenance) over a period of 2 to 3 years, depending on the patient’s risk status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1043454212471728">Pui &amp; Evans, 2006</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1043454212471728">Pui and Evans (2006)</xref> note that the purpose of induction therapy is to eliminate more than 99% of the disease and restore normal hematopoiesis. Although the overwhelming majority of children are able to achieve a remission at the end of induction therapy, they will still require the intensification phase, which consists of noncross resistant drugs given in an alternating fashion, in order to eradicate residual disease. The continuation or maintenance phase then serves to sustain the remission.</p>
<p>Asparaginase is a crucial drug in ALL therapy, and for more than 30 years, has been incorporated into multiagent chemotherapy regimens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1043454212471728">Steiner et al., 2012</xref>). Asparaginases are bacterial proteins that act by depleting plasma asparagine and glutamine, which are nonessential amino acids for normal cells but are essential to the survival of leukemia cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1043454212471728">Avramis &amp; Panosyan, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1043454212471728">Capizzi, 1993</xref>). For leukemia cells, which lack the ability to synthesize asparagine, the depletion of plasma asparagine leads to cell death by way of inhibition of protein synthesis and inhibition of RNA and DNA synthesis. Simply stated, the depletion of asparagine by an asparaginase product essentially starves the leukemia cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1043454212471728">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<p>NOTE: Asparaginase functions by depleting the serum of asparagine, thereby depriving cells of their exogenous source of asparagine. Most normal tissue is able to resynthesize its own asparagine through adequate stores of the enzyme asparagine synthetase. Lymphoblasts have low or undetectable levels of asparagine synthetase, and therefore asparagine becomes an essential amino acid for these cells. Depleting the lymphoblast of serum asparagine deprives the cell of an essential amino acid, causing lymphoblasts to undergo apoptosis, or programmed cell death.</p>

<p>The sensitivity or resistance of leukemia cells to asparagine depletion has been shown to influence treatment outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1043454212471728">Steiner et al., 2012</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1043454212471728">Capizzi (1993)</xref> noted that asparaginase products with very short half-lives are cleared rapidly from the plasma and have limited therapeutic duration. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1043454212471728">Pieters et al. (2011)</xref> later summarized the study results of the randomized trials by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer–Children’s Leukemia Group (EORTC-CLG 58881 trial) and by Dana-Farber Cancer Institute ALL Consortium (DFCI protocol 95-01) stating that asparaginase preparations with a shorter half-life resulted in an inferior EFS, although there was less toxicity, as compared with the asparaginase product with a longer half-life given at the same dose and frequency. Subsequent studies have shown that the dose intensity and duration of asparaginase therapy are more important than the type of asparaginase used in the treatment regimen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1043454212471728">Pui &amp; Evans, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1043454212471728">Woo et al., 2000</xref>). In the DFCI consortium study 91-01, outcomes were worse for pediatric patients who tolerated fewer than 26 weeks of asparaginase either native (asparaginase product with a short half-life of elimination) or pegylated (asparaginase with a long half-life of elimination), as compared with those who were able to receive at least 26 weeks or more of the planned therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1043454212471728">Silverman et al., 2001</xref>). In this study, a multivariate analysis showed that asparaginase intolerance was the only significant prognostic factor that predicted 5-year EFS. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1043454212471728">Silverman et al. (2001)</xref> indicated that one reason for intolerance to more than 25 weeks of asparaginase therapy was allergic reaction, which occurred in 19% of patients treated on their study.</p>
<p>This article will review the 3 types of commercially available asparaginase formulations in the United States with a focus on the management of hypersensitivity reactions associated with these products (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1043454212471728">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Allergic Reaction or Hypersensitivity to Asparaginase Products: Pathology of Allergic Reactions</title>
<p>For a substance to elicit an allergic reaction, it must be of a high molecular weight (ie, greater than 100 000 dalton), have a regularly reoccurring structure, and possess molecular epitopes on its surface so that it can activate B-cell receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1043454212471728">Müller &amp; Boos, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1043454212471728">Sompayrac, 2008</xref>). Since commercially available asparaginases are derived from a bacterial source, either <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> or <italic>Erwinia chrysanthemi</italic>, and are nonnative in the human species, they are targets for the immune system to produce anti-asparaginase antibodies, which in turn lead to allergic reactions on reexposure of the drug (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1043454212471728">Pieters et al., 2011</xref>). In the immune system, the B-cell lymphocytes, in response to the presence of an antigen, or allergen such as an asparaginase product, will proliferate and produce antibodies against the antigen. In the case of asparaginase hypersensitivity, the antibody is thought to be of the IgG (immunoglobulin G) class, although others have reported detecting both IgM and IgE antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1043454212471728">Avramis, Avramis, Hunter, &amp; Long, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1043454212471728">Körholz, Wahn, Jürgens, &amp; Wahn, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1043454212471728">Zalewska-Szewczyk et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>All antibodies are produced by B-cell lymphocytes. Class switching is an immune function that allows a B-cell to produce more than one class of antibody. In response to allergens, B-cells produce either IgG or IgE antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1043454212471728">Sompayrac, 2008</xref>). Antibodies are composed of a variable region with a fragment antigen binding (Fab) site, which is specific to an antigen or allergen, and a constant region (Fc), which interacts with other cells in the immune system. The Fc portion determines the class and function of the antibody (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1043454212471728">Abbas &amp; Lichtman, 2003</xref>). The Fc portion of an antibody, once its Fab region is bound to an antigen, is able to stimulate immune cells and proteins, including complement, T-cell lymphocytes, macrophages, and mast cells, to migrate to the antibody-coated antigen to eliminate it. IgE antibodies have a strong affinity to mast cells and attach their Fc region to the mast cell, leaving the Fab region available to encounter an allergen, as seen with Type I immediate hypersensitivity reactions. On repeated exposure to an identified allergen, the Fab region binds in clusters, or crosslinks, to the antigen, leading to degranulation of the mast cell and release of histamine. Histamine, along with other chemicals in the mast cell, increase capillary permeability, which, if left uncontrolled, can subsequently reduce blood volume, leading to hypotension, and can cause smooth muscles to contract, leading to difficulty in breathing, and subsequent anaphylaxis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1043454212471728">Sompayrac, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1043454212471728">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

<p>NOTE: Most individuals who encounter an allergen do not produce antigen-specific IgE antibodies or develop harmful reactions. Genetic predisposition may lead to the development of IgE antibodies. IgE synthesis is dependent on the activation of CD4<sup>‒</sup> helper T cells, subtype T<sub>H</sub>2, which secretes IL-4. T<sub>H</sub>2 cells also secrete IL-5, which activates eosinophils and IL-13, which increases bronchial secretions. Individuals prone to allergies have larger amounts of IL-4 secreting T cells and more IgE antibodies in circulation than do nonallergic individuals, who are likely to produce IgM and IgG antibodies in response to allergens. T<sub>H</sub>2 cells contribute to inflammation and have been found at the sites of immediate hypersensitivity reactions in the skin and bronchial mucosa. The allergen-specific IgE is produced by B-cells after stimulation by T<sub>H</sub>2 cells and cytokines. The IgE antibodies are responsible for sensitizing mast cells and the recognition of an allergen in immediate hypersensitivity reactions. IgE binds to the Fc receptor specific for the epsilon heavy chain, known as FcϵRI, on mast cells, eosinophils, and basophils. On reexposure to the allergen, the mast cells proliferate and release mediators such as histamines, which cause vascular leak and bronchoconstriction; prostaglandin, which promotes inflammation and neutrophil chemotaxis; leukotrines, which are associated with skin wheals and flare reactions; and cytokines, which trigger activation of other immune cells and further increase inflammation.</p>

(2009)</xref> found that IgG4 antibodies were likely the cause of asparaginase allergic reactions and that most of the antibodies were neutralizing, which suggests that they reduced the efficacy of asparaginase. Other researchers have found higher levels of IgG1, IgG2, and IgM antibodies in patients experiencing an allergic reaction or having decreased plasma levels of asparaginase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1043454212471728">Müller &amp; Boos, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1043454212471728">Table 2</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1043454212471728">Körholz et al.

<title>History</title>
<p>In the 1950s, guinea-pig serum was found to cause complete disease regression in lymphoma-bearing mice. The mechanism for the disease regression was the inhibition of asparagine incorporation into the lymphoma cell’s nucleic acid metabolism, which affects RNA and DNA synthesis and ultimately leads to cell death. Subsequently, it was discovered that enzymes from different bacteria could inhibit asparagine but that the <italic>E. coli</italic> enzyme 2 (EC2) and <italic>Erwinia carotovora</italic>, later renamed <italic>Erwinia chrysanthemi</italic>, showed the highest asparaginase activity over the others tested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1043454212471728">Avramis &amp; Panosyan, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1043454212471728">Capizzi, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1043454212471728">Müller &amp; Boos, 1998</xref>). The enzyme L-asparaginase catalyzes asparagine into aspartic acid and ammonia and thus depletes a crucial nutritional amino acid for leukemia cells. In the 1960s, a highly purified version <italic>of E. coli</italic> asparaginase was tested as a single agent in previously treated ALL patients and produced short remissions, resulting in a median survival of 122 days. <italic>E. coli</italic> asparaginase was subsequently combined with other chemotherapy agents to produce remissions in up to 98% of children with low-risk ALL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1043454212471728">Avramis &amp; Panosyan, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1043454212471728">Capizzi, 1993</xref>).

<p>Pegaspargase is formulated by covalently conjugating monomethoxypolyethylene glycol (PEG) to <italic>E. coli</italic> L-asparaginase. The mechanism of action for pegaspargase is the same as native L-asparaginase—depletion of serum asparagine.

An investigation performed by the Children’s Cancer Group (CCG-1962) was a pivotal study to support the approval of the drug for the first-line treatment of ALL. This study showed that 3 doses of pegaspargase, administered by intramuscular injection, were able to safely and effectively replace 21 doses of native <italic>E. coli</italic> asparaginase. In this study, 118 newly diagnosed standard-risk ALL patients, aged 1 to 9 years, were treated with combination chemotherapy which included either native <italic>E. coli</italic> asparaginase or pegaspargase; differences in the incidence of “high-titer” antibody development were reported. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1043454212471728">Dinndorf, Gootenberg, Cohen, Keegan, and Pazdur (2007)</xref> summarized that overall 11% of pegaspargase-treated patients as compared with 25% of native <italic>E. coli</italic>-treated patients developed anti-asparaginase antibodies at some time during the study.

<p>The COG and two major centers, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and SJCRH, have incorporated some form of asparaginase into pediatric protocols for years and have developed specific guidelines for managing toxicity associated with the asparaginase products.

<p><disp-quote>
<p>Today COG protocols advise that since pegaspargase is long acting, hypersensitivity reactions may not appear until hours following administration. Clinicians should monitor vital signs as well as for signs of fever, chills or acute allergic reactions including anaphylaxis. Nurses should have medications to treat hypersensitivity reactions readily available at each administration (e.g., epinephrine, corticosteroids, and antihistamines). Patients should be observed for one hour after administration of the drug for signs of hypersensitivity reactions. Parents and patients should be educated to observe for reactions at home post administration. Although rare, hypersensitivity reactions have been reported hours after drug administration.</p>
<p>Dose modifications recommended by COG include discontinuing pegaspargase if the patient develops a systemic allergic reaction which is Grade 2 or greater as defined by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0 (Table III). Premedication with antihistamines to decrease the risk of overt allergy symptoms is strongly discouraged since antihistamine use may mask the appearance of systemic allergy. Systemic allergy may be associated with the presence of asparaginase neutralizing antibodies, which renders asparaginase therapy ineffective.</p>

Severe reactions are defined as any other allergic reaction, including rash, urticaria, lip/tongue swelling, respiratory symptoms, and hypotension. For either mild or severe hypersensitivity reactions, a switch in preparation should occur as follows: If initial asparaginase is <italic>E. coli</italic> given intramuscularly, switch to intramuscular pegaspargase.

<title>Relationship Between Allergy, Antibodies, and Asparaginase Activity</title>
<p>Though many current practices assume a direct relationship between allergy, antibodies, and decrease in asparaginase activity, the picture is not nearly so clear when one reviews additional and recent published data on asparaginase hypersensitivity and antibodies. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1043454212471728">Avramis and Tiwari (2006)</xref> have reported that the risk of allergic reaction is reduced when a steroid and other immunosuppressive agents are administered concurrently with the asparaginase product. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1043454212471728">Asselin (2012)</xref> also theorized that pretreatment with glucocorticoids is expected to decrease the likelihood of developing anti-asparaginase antibodies and that “continuous” rather than “pulse” dosing of asparaginase may be less immunogenic. The rationale for preconditioning with a steroid and immunosuppression is to deplete helper-T-cells and subsequently decrease immune responsiveness to future asparaginase administrations. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1043454212471728">Avramis and Tiwari (2006)</xref> have noted that clinical allergic reactions may occur when the levels of circulating IgG antibodies, which are responsible for slight to moderate allergic reactions, become elevated after several doses of asparaginase. For this reason, they note the benefit of preconditioning to reduce an immune reaction. In an earlier publication, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1043454212471728">Avramis et al. (2002)</xref> noted that patients treated on the CCG 1962 study had received 3 days of high-dose prednisone prior to the asparaginase administration, either native or pegylated, and only 2 of 118 experienced an allergic reaction during their second exposure. In this study, patients treated with pegaspargase had more prolonged asparaginase activity compared with those patients treated with native asparaginase. Also, high-titer antibodies to asparaginase, which negated the activity of the drug, were associated with native asparaginase (26%) but not with pegaspargase (2%) during the first delayed intensification phase of treatment.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1043454212471728">Strullu et al. (2010)</xref>, prospectively evaluated the incidence of silent hypersensitivity (the phenomenon of antibody production in the absence of clinical allergy) to native <italic>E. coli</italic> asparaginase in 33 pediatric patients with newly diagnosed ALL. Patients were treated according to the FRALLE 2000 protocol (French chemotherapy protocol consisting of drugs for the treatment of ALL) and divided into two groups for this study—18 patients diagnosed with lower-risk B-cell ALL were part of the “A group” and 15 patients diagnosed with higher-risk B-cell and T-cell ALL were in the “B-T group.” Patients in the “A group” received less intensive chemotherapy overall, less prednisone therapy compared with dexamethasone, and higher doses of asparaginase at less frequent intervals during the second intensification compared with the “B-T group.” A significant increase in clinical allergic reactions was noted in the “A group” as compared with the “B-T group,” 72% versus 13%, respectively. Silent hypersensitivity was observed in 18% of the study population, the majority of which occurred in the “B-T group” (<italic>P</italic> = .07). However, no significant differences between asparaginase activity or asparagine depletion between the silent hypersensitivity and clinical allergy groups were observed. Additionally, at a median follow-up time of 5 years, no difference in outcome between the silent hypersensitivity and clinical allergy groups had been detected. The authors note that the probability of an allergic reaction was increased in those patients who did not receive concurrent prednisone-vincristine and who had a longer period of time between asparaginase doses. They further suggest immunosuppression with concomitant chemotherapy and corticosteroid therapy may have prevented either the development of or lowered the anti-asparaginase antibodies. Thus, by maintaining low-antibody titers, which are insufficient to initiate an allergic reaction, silent hypersensitivity antibodies may be present, but they did not affect the activity of the asparaginase.</p>
<p>Other studies have indicated that allergic reactions are associated with the development of antibodies which increase asparaginase clearance and may neutralize asparaginase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1043454212471728">Avramis et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1043454212471728">Panosyan et al., 2004</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1043454212471728">Willer et al. (2011)</xref> noted that although hypersensitivity reactions may limit the ability to administer asparaginase products, it is only when anti-asparaginase antibody levels become high, &gt;200 AU/mL, that the drug activity level is diminished. In this case, they state that <italic>Erwinia</italic> asparaginase may be an appropriate alternative to <italic>E. coli</italic> asparaginase. As part of a retrospective review of 1221 samples from 329 patients treated on the ALL-BFM (Berlin Frankfurt Munster group) 2000 and ALL-REZ (Germany, Austria, Switzerland group) BFM 2002 trials, Willer et al. assessed anti-asparaginase antibody levels and drug activity levels for patients treated with native <italic>E. coli</italic> (n = 403), pegylated (n = 453), and <italic>Erwinia</italic> asparaginase (n = 365). The samples from patients who received pegaspargase or <italic>Erwinia</italic> asparaginase were taken after they had an allergic reaction to native <italic>E. coli</italic> asparaginase. In this review, they found that in 81 of 99 patients (82%) who received only native <italic>E. coli</italic> asparaginase, clinically overt allergic reactions were associated with anti-asparaginase antibodies. Anti-asparaginase antibodies continued to increase in patient samples when switched to either pegaspargase or <italic>Erwinia</italic> asparaginase. Sufficient asparaginase activity, &gt;100 U/L, was detected in 65.1% of pegaspargase samples, measured 14 days after administration, and in 55.1% of <italic>Erwinia</italic> asparaginase samples, measured 2 days after administration. For patients with anti-asparaginase antibodies being treated with native asparaginase, a switch to pegaspargase increased the rate of samples with sufficient and borderline asparaginase activity, unless the antibody level was &gt;200 AU/mL. In this case, asparaginase activity was determined to be insufficient during the first and second weeks after administration of pegaspargase. For samples from patients switched to <italic>Erwinia</italic> asparaginase, no significant association between drug activity level and anti-asparaginase antibody level was found. In this review, the authors found that for patient samples with serum asparaginase activity levels &gt;100 U/L (considered sufficient for asparagine depletion from both serum and cerebral spinal fluid) and with intermediately positive antibody levels (20-200 AU/mL), patients treated with pegaspargase had higher drug activity levels, 75%, as compared with those samples from patients treated with <italic>Erwinia</italic> asparaginase, whose drug activity levels were 55%. The authors stress that when symptoms of clinical allergy are mild, antibody levels should be measured prior to changing to another asparaginase product.</p>
<p>In an adult cooperative group study reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1043454212471728">Wetzler et al. (2007</xref>; Cancer and Leukemia Group B 9511), the differences in disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) were compared for 85 newly diagnosed ALL patients based on asparagine depletion levels, defined as asparaginase activity levels of &gt;0.03 U/mL. Asparaginase levels were collected at multiple time points. The authors suggest that based on univariate analysis, the 22 patients who did not achieve asparagine depletion at some time point had inferior OS and DFS. More anti-asparaginase antibodies were detected in patients who did not achieve asparagine depletion as compared with patients who did, 7 of 22 (31.8%) versus 6 of 63 (9.5%), respectively (<italic>P</italic> = .012). Although anti-asparaginase antibodies were more prevalent in patients who did not achieve asparagine depletion, using multiple predictive models, the authors noted that they could conclude no meaningful association between antibodies and outcome. From this, the authors stated that even though patients eventually developed antibodies to asparaginase, which presumably may have had a neutralizing effect on the asparaginase, no decrease in antileukemic effect was noted. They did find that increasing age was associated with fewer pegaspargase doses being administered.</p>

<title>Discussion/Conclusion</title>
<p>Significant progress has been made during the past 50 years in the treatment of pediatric and adolescent patients with ALL. During this time asparaginase therapy has been a cornerstone in multimodal chemotherapy regimens used to achieve current cure rates nearing 90%. Much has been learned about the three commercially available asparaginase products in the United States as a result of extensive study in investigational protocols and during the evolution of ALL regimens. However, despite how much we currently know about asparaginase agents, questions persist about their optimal use within ALL regimens and precise adverse event profile with corresponding management.</p>
<p>It is becoming more evident that asparagine depletion directly correlates with outcome in both pediatric and adult patients. In vitro response versus nonresponse rates to asparaginase in pediatric ALL patients have been correlated with relapse rates—5% versus 57%, respectively (<italic>P</italic> = .0008; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1043454212471728">Asselin et al., 1999</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1043454212471728">Silverman et al. (2001)</xref> demonstrated improved survival in pediatric patients receiving at least 26 of 30 weeks of planned therapy compared with patients receiving 25 or fewer weeks. Analogous results were reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1043454212471728">Wetzler et al. (2007)</xref> in adult patients. This group looked at outcomes relative to asparagine depletion. Superior DFS and OS were realized in patients achieving adequate asparagine depletion (as defined as an asparaginase level &gt;0.03 U/mL) compared with those patients failing to achieve the minimum threshold of depletion. Although specific serum thresholds for asparagine and asparaginase concentrations as well as length of time for asparagine depletion remain unknown, asparagine depletion in ALL patients affects patient outcomes.</p>
<p>Data are less well elucidated with asparaginase therapy as it relates to allergy, anti-asparaginase antibody production, and outcome. As part of the CCG 1961 study, anti-asparaginase antibodies and asparaginase enzymatic activity were investigated in 1001 patients receiving either intramuscular native <italic>E. coli</italic> asparaginase or pegaspargase. Serum samples were assayed for determination of asparaginase antibody titers and enzymatic activity. Six hundred and eleven patients (61%) had a positive antibody titer (defined as &gt;110% over negative control). Among these 611 patients, 447 had no measurable asparaginase activity during therapy. In a small subset of patients (n = 280) evaluated for outcome relative to the presence of antibodies, 29% of patients experienced silent hypersensitivity and represented 25% of patients relapsing after therapy. Thus, antibody measurement could be a surrogate marker for poor outcome of the disease. The authors concluded that anti-asparaginase antibody was associated with undetectable asparaginase activity and may be correlated with adverse outcomes in high-risk ALL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1043454212471728">Panosyan et al., 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>In contrast to the above findings, research by other groups has failed to correlate anti-asparaginase antibody production to outcome. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1043454212471728">Strullu et al. (2010)</xref> observed both clinical allergy and silent hypersensitivity in pediatric patients with newly diagnosed ALL treated with intramuscular or intravenous native <italic>E. coli</italic> asparaginase. There were no reported differences in asparaginase activity, asparagine depletion, and outcomes in patients regardless of allergy type. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1043454212471728">Wetzler et al. (2007)</xref> could not correlate outcomes with antibody production despite observing a higher prevalence of antibody production in patients failing to achieve adequate asparagine depletion.</p>
<p>Prevention of allergies with prophylactic use of corticosteroids, antihistamines, and/or acetaminophen remains controversial. Most pediatric patients do not receive routine prophylactic medications so as not to potentially mask an allergic reaction. However, this practice of avoiding an antihistamine or steroid preparation may expose patients to a risk of hypersensitivity reactions and possibly anaphylaxis. Use of prophylactic medications is more common in adult patients. Specifically, in the adult cooperative group study, CALGB (Cancer and Leukemia Group B) 10403, one researcher has indicted that she has observed that “corticosteroid premedication has reduced the rate of toxicity allowing more patients to complete their asparaginase courses” (W. Stock, personal communication, July 29, 2012).</p>
<p>Finally, the importance of careful monitoring and meticulous documentation of hypersensitivity reactions is vital to our continued understanding and characterization of asparaginase hypersensitivity reactions. Allergic reactions to asparaginase products are diverse, ranging from grade 1 to grade 4 reactions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1043454212471728">Table 3</xref>) and often not well documented in the patients’ medical records. However, patients are often considered “allergic” to asparaginase therapy, regardless of the severity of the reaction. Since studies suggest that stopping therapy with asparaginase or delivering less than 80% of the planned asparaginase dose might lead to decreased EFS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1043454212471728">Silverman et al., 2001</xref>), it would seem wise to confirm any allergic reactions prior to discontinuing the drug. Tools exist to aid clinicians in classifying the severity of reactions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1043454212471728">Table 3</xref>) and management strategies, often dictated by research protocol or institutional guidelines, are available to ameliorate adverse events (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1043454212471728">Table 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1043454212471728">Stock et al., 2011</xref>). Complete description of reactions, including grade of reaction, route of administration, time to onset, and concomitant medications before and during an event, will not only guide future asparaginase therapy but will also assist clinicians in gaining a better understanding of asparaginase hypersensitivity reactions. To ensure the capture of such information, the nurse should perform and document the allergy assessment at time of the reaction.</p>

<p>Future directions in the area of hypersensitivity reactions associated with asparaginase products are exciting. With the recent commercial availability of <italic>Erwinia</italic> asparaginase, characterization of hypersensitivity reactions with this product will undoubtedly be increased and comparisons with native <italic>E. coli</italic> asparaginase and pegaspargase will be easier to ascertain. Questions remain about the relationship of antibody production and clinical outcomes in patients exhibiting silent hypersensitivity reactions. Monitoring patients throughout therapy for antibody production and making therapeutic decisions on which asparaginase product to subsequently administer, if any, remains investigational. Prophylactic use of corticosteroids, antihistamines, and/or acetaminophen requires further evaluation, particularly, in relation to the ability to deliver planned asparaginase therapy. By working to address these and other facets of asparaginase hypersensitivity reactions, we will have a greater understanding of how to optimize asparaginase therapy in ALL patients and ultimately improve outcomes.</p>
