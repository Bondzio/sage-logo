<abstract>
<p>Driven by new conditions of desperation and alienation, mass migration in postwar El Salvador has continued unabated. While this migration could be seen as a way of “opting out” of ongoing class struggle, we argue that it instead represents a critical dissipation of class relations and struggle. In the postwar context, the ruling class and the Salvadoran state seek to capitalize on the alienation of their own people and their responses to that alienation—migration and the remittances it generates. The ruling class has ensured its economic domination regardless of who controls the state. Seeking to legitimize and maximize the seizure of citizens’ income as it flows across borders as a matter of “economic” and “development” policy, the ruling class has depleted the productive base through which class struggle would ordinarily occur, creating new forces of alienation in El Salvador and increasing the need for many Salvadorans to migrate.</p>

<p>In <italic>The Eighteenth Brumaire</italic>, Marx noted that we “make [our] own history, but . . . not . . . just as [we] please; [we] do not make it under circumstances chosen by [our]selves, but under circumstances directly encountered, given, and transmitted from the past” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0094582X13492126">2000 [1852]</xref>: 329). In <italic>The German Ideology</italic>, he and Engels emphasized: “The first premise of all human existence and, therefore, of all history, [is] . . that [people] must be in a position to live in order to be able to ‘make history’” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0094582X13492126">1998 [1845]</xref>: 47).</p>
<p>What, specifically, are the circumstances that affect the Salvadoran people’s ability to live and make their own history? Our answer, in brief, is that, the ruling class’s recent dismantling of traditional class relations and its emergence as a transnational finance aristocracy generates new forms of alienation or estrangement for the poor that fuel and are fueled by mass emigration. These conditions greatly complicate the domestic class situation and possibilities for class struggle. By specifying this new “national reality” in El Salvador (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0094582X13492126">Ellacuría, 1991</xref>), we aim to highlight both key obstacles to and mechanisms for change.</p>
<p>Participants in and supporters of the insurgency during the civil war often saw their efforts in terms of “making their own history” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0094582X13492126">Wood, 2003</xref>). However, changes wrought by the war and economic restructuring have steadily undermined the conditions that sustain life, the first premise of history making. This fundamental form of alienation both drives and is perpetuated by migration. In what follows, we analyze how these changes relate to the dollarization of the Salvadoran economy, the implementation of so-called free-trade agreements (including the rhetoric versus the reality of maquilas), and constraints on domestic production. Although several studies examine particular aspects of these processes (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0094582X13492126">Almeida, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0094582X13492126">Anner, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0094582X13492126">Gammage, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0094582X13492126">Madrid, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0094582X13492126">Towers and Borzutzky, 2004</xref>), this is the first, to our knowledge, to examine the relationship among them in El Salvador and their connection with alienation. In closing, we tentatively explore what might be done to restore the capacity for making life and thus history in El Salvador.</p>
<p>Our analysis is based on both primary and secondary data. Primary data were collected mainly in two towns, Yucuaiquín and Masahuat, with similar histories of migration but different historical patterns of land tenure—the primary means of production prior to the war and the basis for the traditional relations of production that broke down during the war and in its wake. Research in El Salvador yielded 102 interviews and hundreds of hours of observational field notes.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0094582X13492126">1</xref></sup> Research in the United States with migrants from Yucuaiquín and Masahuat yielded an additional 16 interviews.</p>
<sec id="section1-0094582X13492126">
<title>Context</title>
<p>Outwardly, Yucuaiquín is a charming, colorful town that sits on a mountain peak and overlooks San Miguel, the city and volcano. Youth are stylishly dressed, the elderly impeccably so. The cobblestone streets are clean and wide, the neighborhoods long and winding. Wired megaphones mounted to telephone poles broadcast Catholic mass and public announcements. School children wearing blue-and-white school uniforms gather in the central park. Mud or cane-stalk homes are interspersed with cinder block houses, many of two stories, painted bright greens, reds, yellows, and blues. On the outer walls of every fourth or fifth home, signs advertising sodas, calling cards, and shaving razors indicate a small store within. Young girls and middle-aged women walk through town carrying baskets full of tortillas, <italic>totopostes</italic>,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0094582X13492126">2</xref></sup> or ice cream for sale.</p>
<p>Upon first glance, Masahuat is similar. Arriving by bus or car, the visitor is immediately greeted by gold lettering on the mayor’s office in the center of town. Brightly painted with tinted windows and air conditioning, the building has the feel of a tax-rich facility. Despite a few broken street lamps, the central park is inviting and clean. Most houses are made of cinder block, but only a few have two stories, and they are much smaller and more crammed together than in Yucuaiquín. Large cattle pastures and small <italic>milpas</italic>, or patches of corn and sorghum, pepper the hills surrounding the neighborhoods. A river circumscribes three-quarters of the town.</p>
<p>Migrant remittances have affected these towns in clear ways, particularly when compared with towns where weathered mud, tin, or thatched homes containing the barest essentials predominate, but what seems like wealth or well-being hides other realities (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0094582X13492126">Pedersen, 2004</xref>). Yucuaiquenses and Masahueños reveal deep anxieties about insufficient food and water, high (privatized) electric and water bills and the infrequency of service, and feeding their families on combined familial incomes of a few dollars a day. In Yucuaiquín, food is expensive. It comes from the city of San Miguel and beyond. The high price of fuel and inflated costs with dollarization mean that households must spend several dollars per day on food. In Masahuat, residents rely on their own produce for basic grains to make tortillas and <italic>pupusas</italic>,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0094582X13492126">3</xref></sup> but when their harvests fail—as they often do—they too have to buy grains, as well as meats and vegetables, from markets in Metapán, a city about 25 miles away. A health problem for a family member in either community can spell long-term financial trouble, despite the great assistance that remittances provide.</p>
<p>Residents of both communities express despair over declining local sources of production—whether in agriculture or industry—and the alienation that this creates. For them, postwar economic restructuring, including liberalization and dollarization, both necessitates and combines with migration to deepen their sense of alienation:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Martín (Yucuaiquín):</speaker>
<p>If in El Salvador we produced, maybe we could [stand on our own]. . . . There are poor people everywhere—across the globe—but here there are more. So while people continue living in cardboard houses, in the suburbs, while people are living in tin shacks that look like microwave ovens, [migration] is not going to stop. . . . Leaving . . . was never my priority because I got by, but now I look around and I think, we’re screwed.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Antonio (Masahuat):</speaker>
<p>There are factories here [in El Salvador], but they’re not from here. The foreigner always has one idea more. And as the governments allow other countries to come and take for themselves, agriculture will fail here. Before, one sold his harvest well. The dollar wasn’t here. The dollar robs the farmer of all his merit. . . . In the end, they’ll all [migrate]. On that alone they live. . . . They don’t have anything else.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Roxana (Masahuat):</speaker>
<p>There are some people here who don’t have anywhere [to go], not even anything to eat! And from there they get really hopeless, and they find a way to get some money so that the [migrant smugglers] will take them [to the United States]. It’s really hard. . . . If there were a place to earn at least a daily wage, we would be happy, because we would say, “I have my job, I’m going to eat!” But without work, and with nothing, one says . . . “I’m going to suck in my stomach. Drink water!” At least, thank God, we aren’t short on water.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Salvador (Yucuaiquín):</speaker>
<p>Now there really isn’t any way to earn an income. . . . Considering all the land that people used to farm, if the government provided incentives to get projects going, to encourage people so that we wouldn’t have to import cabbage, tomatoes—we’re importing vegetables when we could be cultivating them here!— . . . but we could develop programs to farm. Citrus. Lemons. Oranges. Oranges grow really well here. Maybe even avocados. The government should think about that—if there were only programs! Or even loans so that we could develop that kind of farming.</p>

<title>Overview</title>
<p>From 1980 to 1992, a bloody and prolonged civil war—in many ways a class war—was fought over extremely unequal access to the means of production and oppressive working conditions, the conditions that make life possible. As a fundamental means of production and sustenance, access to land in particular was extremely unequal, with most land controlled by a small but powerful landowning oligarchy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0094582X13492126">Dunkerley, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0094582X13492126">Paige, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0094582X13492126">Wood, 2003</xref>). For the bulk of the nation’s population, this inequality meant that the conditions of life were rather tenuous.</p>
<p>The war and the Salvadoran state’s attempts at economic restructuring only increased this tenuousness. War made life in the countryside especially difficult. Many landowners fled to the city or abroad, and land was abandoned or control over it was violently contested by military forces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0094582X13492126">Wood, 2003</xref>). Agricultural production for the market declined significantly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0094582X13492126">Dunkerley, 1988</xref>), stimulating the construction of national food import infrastructure and distribution systems that the state then used to suppress food prices in an effort to calm <italic>urban</italic> political unrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0094582X13492126">Hecht et al., 2005</xref>: 316). However, by lowering food prices through increased imports, state policy further suppressed domestic grain production and thus limited <italic>rural</italic> options for living, and those constraints persisted even after the civil war came to a close. Grain prices today stand at 27 percent of their 1978 value, and although 90 percent of Salvadoran households produce grains, they derive only 5 percent of their income from grain sales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0094582X13492126">Hecht et al., 2005</xref>: 316). Even profit-driven export crops such as coffee, which once dominated the Salvadoran economy, have fallen by the wayside as the Salvadoran state shifted its economic policies and resources away from agriculture to finance and industry, changes that hardly compensate for the lost employment in the nation’s agricultural regions.</p>
<p>Under these conditions, an estimated 25 percent of the Salvadoran population have emigrated, and 22 percent of those who remain receive remittances on a regular basis. On average, households receiving remittances rely on them to cover 84 percent of their total expenditures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0094582X13492126">UNDP, 2005</xref>: 30–31). In localities such as Yucuaiquín and Masahuat, the percentages are much higher; approximately 40 percent of households receive remittances on a regular basis and nearly two-thirds have at least one relative living abroad. The main source of El Salvador’s national foreign exchange has shifted over the past 30 years or so from agricultural exports (81 percent of foreign exchange earnings in 1978 vs. a mere 5 percent in 2004) to migrant remittances (only 5 percent of foreign exchange earnings in 1978 vs. 70 percent in 2004) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0094582X13492126">UNDP, 2005</xref>: 7).</p>
<p>In one sense, migration could be seen as a way of “opting out” of the class struggle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0094582X13492126">Hirschman, 1970</xref>). In another sense, however, a new form of exploitation and thus a new but more indirect and “mystified” class relationship has emerged via a vicious cycle in which the ruling class and the Salvadoran state seek to capitalize on the alienation of its own people and their primary response to that alienation—migration and the remittances it generates (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0094582X13492126">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

<p>Remittances deposited in national banks (which were privatized in the late 1980s and early 1990s) provided foreign exchange reserves that enabled elites to seek international loans from the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and the Inter-American Development Bank (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0094582X13492126">Segovia, 2002</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0094582X13492126">4</xref></sup> Largely through its control of the state, the ruling class divorced itself from the land while privatizing services, including telecommunications and transportation, that Salvadorans now pay for using income their relatives earn abroad. Having achieved privatization through structural adjustment, elites sold interests to actors in the United States, Asia, and Central and South America (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0094582X13492126">Segovia, 2005</xref>). Dollarizing the economy in 2001 and ratifying the Central American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) in 2004 accelerated these processes, since the thrust of these policies was to facilitate the transnationalization of Salvadoran capital and international investment in El Salvador’s financial and services sectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0094582X13492126">Madrid, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0094582X13492126">Segovia, 2005</xref>). At the same time, these maneuvers undermined domestic agriculture, in which most Salvadorans were employed, without providing equivalent jobs in industry. By 2007, finance was the largest and most dynamic economic sector in El Salvador, followed by transport, warehousing, and communications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0094582X13492126">Madrid, 2009</xref>: 200).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0094582X13492126">5</xref></sup> Limited domestic production exacerbated both underemployment and unemployment. Nearly one-third (32 percent) of the national labor force is underemployed, while almost half (49.8 percent) of the jobs in the urban sector are unpaid (e.g., work in relatives’ retail establishments) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0094582X13492126">DIGESTYC, 2008</xref>). The informal proletariat in El Salvador is larger than in Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Mexico, Panama, or Venezuela (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0094582X13492126">Portes and Hoffman, 2003</xref>: 52).</p>
<p>Elite interests are thus based on the relative absence of productive relations in El Salvador and the migration and remittances that this perpetuates. This change marks the emergence of a transnational capitalist class (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0094582X13492126">Madrid, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0094582X13492126">Robinson, 2003</xref>) that bears a striking resemblance to what Marx, in <italic>The Eighteenth Brumaire</italic>, called a “finance aristocracy”—a parasitic faction of the capitalist class with a direct interest in the indebtedness and bankruptcy of the nation or, more exactly, the nation’s people. For this emerging transnational capitalist class, the country has become merely a node in the regional and global economy that it can exploit by channeling global flows of money and capital, including remittances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0094582X13492126">Madrid, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0094582X13492126">Segovia, 2002</xref>), and the cheap labor supplied by the marginalized “surplus” population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0094582X13492126">Robinson, 2003</xref>). When this node has been sucked dry (recall Marx’s repeated depiction of capitalists as “vampires”), this transnational class is ready to move on to another node (consider, for example, the massive amounts of capital withdrawn from the country during the war and the more recent expansion of private banks into other Central American countries and the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0094582X13492126">Segovia, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0094582X13492126">Wood, 2003</xref>)).</p>
<p>We employ the basic premises of Marx’s approach to show that, rather than being “El Salvador’s newest and most important ‘export’” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0094582X13492126">Gammage, 2006</xref>: 75; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0094582X13492126">Taylor, 1999</xref>), migrants produce and “export” themselves because of alienation, domestic uncertainty, and desperation—and, as Gammage notes, typically at great cost to themselves and their families. Though scholars such as Gammage concede that migration is an unsustainable and self-defeating development strategy, their language suggests that it is the state or some form of organized enterprise that “exports people” and subsequently imports remittances as a form of revenue or profit. Migrants themselves, as opposed to their capacity to labor, are thus equated with commodities, which are typically produced and distributed in an organized and directed way. However, neither migration nor the sales of migrant labor power that generate remittances nor the decisions to remit are organized or distributed in any systematic or directed way (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0094582X13492126">Hernández and Coutin, 2006</xref>). The value represented by remittances is generated not by surplus labor (as when Salvadorans working in maquilas generate value far in excess of their wages) but by necessary labor, the labor required to ensure their own and their families’ survival. This means that while capitalists in the destination countries capture surplus labor and value from migrants by paying substandard wages, capitalists in El Salvador also profit, both directly and indirectly, from remittances—the sums of money that poor migrants have set aside out of their own wages (necessary labor) to help support family members back home. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0094582X13492126">Robinson (2003</xref>: 273–274) notes, “the new transnational migration helps capital dispose of the need to pay for the reproduction of labor power,” since “the site of labor power and its reproduction have been transnationally dispersed” (208). However, in El Salvador the possibilities for such reproduction have been undermined by the very restructuring that the presence of remittance dollars originally helped finance. The decline of agricultural production makes it much harder for many Salvadorans to survive without remittances. Given this new “<italic>trans</italic>national reality,” successive generations of Salvadorans will need to migrate as their alienation from the fundamental conditions of life and making history deepens at home.</p>

<title>Alienation and Migration</title>
<p>According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0094582X13492126">Hunt (1982)</xref>, “alienation” means that one’s “existence” contradicts one’s “essence.” For Marx, the capacity for “free, conscious activity” is the defining characteristic of the human species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0094582X13492126">1974 [1844]</xref>: 328). However, this capacity is possible only by virtue of the fact that we are fundamentally “social” beings (Marx clearly viewed “thought” as, from the beginning, a “social product”) whose decisions and actions are driven by our “passions” or emotions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0094582X13492126">2000 [1845–1846]</xref>: 183, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0094582X13492126">1974 [1844]</xref>: 390; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0094582X13492126">Weyher, 2012</xref>). It is only because of this that we are in a position to make our own history, and anything that stands in the way of our human capacity for free, conscious activity, our social nature, and the human passions that drive history making is a source of alienation or estrangement. Moreover, any obstacle to realizing that first premise of all history—the presence of life-sustaining conditions—is at the root of estrangement. Alienation from the conditions necessary for life thus supersedes all other forms of alienation, including those in the wage-labor process that are most closely associated with Marx’s theory.</p>
<p>The scale of Salvadoran emigration reflects—quite literally—the alienation of many Salvadorans from their own society and state and from their ability to sustain life and make history at home. Despite somewhat greater access to land in the postwar context, in the broader political economy of El Salvador today most Salvadorans are unable to use land as a life-sustaining means of production. National economic reform, including the liberalization of agriculture through CAFTA, subjects Salvadoran farmers (who make up 50 percent of the population) to widely fluctuating and often depressed prices for their produce while the cost of fertilizers and pesticides that are increasingly necessary to maximize production has risen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0094582X13492126">Acevedo, Barry, and Rosa, 1995</xref>: 2157; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0094582X13492126">Hecht et al., 2005</xref>). This is due, in part, to the Cristiani and Calderón Sol administrations’ reduction of domestic tariffs on agriculture from 230 percent to 15 percent and Cristiani’s closing of the Institute of Regulatory Supplies, which previously bought basic grains at prices above market value to sell abroad, thus guaranteeing prices for domestic producers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0094582X13492126">Madrid, 2009</xref>: 199). Today the Salvadoran state allows surplus grains from the United States to flood its markets. As a result, as Mauricio put it, “Agriculture is through the floor. . . . If you use fertilizer, your crop will grow but you won’t break even. . . . People invest 3,000 colones [approximately US$360] to harvest 25 loads [of corn], which make up an <italic>arroba</italic>. To sell here, with the dollar, we’re losing 60 dollars for every manzana [1.73 acres].” Unable to produce even for their own subsistence at times, many Salvadorans look to the urban sector or the United States for opportunities to earn a wage.</p>
<p>Salvadorans who seek work outside of agriculture in El Salvador, however, are rarely able to obtain work commensurate with their education or training. The inadequacy or absence of labor markets throughout much of the country means that many Salvadorans are alienated even from indirect means of accessing the means of production and earning wages to survive. In the departments where Yucuaiquín and Masahuat are located, only 47.5 and 55.3 percent, respectively, of those counted as employed actually receive formal wages for their work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0094582X13492126">DIGESTYC, 2008</xref>: 20). Many who are paid receive less than the minimum wage of US$152 per month, or about US$6 per day. At least half of the Salvadoran population works in the informal sector, alienated from the usual protections of society and law, and the earnings of US$4–5 per day typical for this sector are insufficient to meet the true cost of living. Whereas the Salvadoran Census Bureau (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0094582X13492126">DIGESTYC, 2008</xref>) estimates that the basic food basket (not including utilities) costs US$159 per month, the U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates that the average Salvadoran household needs US$300 to cover the basics if one includes the recently privatized utilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0094582X13492126">Anner, 2011</xref>: 29; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0094582X13492126">Rosen and Meade, 2001</xref>). Informants commented on this situation as follows:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Mateo:</speaker>
<p>Because a labor market doesn’t exist, we know we’re going to suffer if we don’t think about going [migrating]. This is frustrating. . . . We look for work with banks—walking around trying to sell credit cards or offering commercial loans to business people in the city. That’s it.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Silvia:</speaker>
<p>In this country, we are going from bad to worse. We can’t find work, and when we do, we are exploited so badly, you can’t imagine. For example, [where I work now] . . . in addition to our regular duties in the store, we have to babysit for our bosses’ children, wash their dishes, everything. And they send us to eat in the bathroom. In the bathroom! . . . We start at seven in the morning and leave at five, but from November to January we have to start at six in the morning and leave at seven in the evening. And for this wage [US$5 per day]; they aren’t going to pay us any more. I have a friend who left. She worked for two weeks, and do you know how much they paid her? Thirteen dollars and 27 cents. Not even enough to cover her bus ride! . . . All jobs are like this. There is no other work. . . . It’s hard. Out of necessity, pure necessity, we have to sacrifice our honor.</p>
</speech>
<p>Three forms of alienation are experienced in these processes: First, the response to such degradation is felt on a deep emotive level. Second, the absence of jobs renders unprecedented educational achievement meaningless and obstructs youths’ human capacity for free, conscious activity, a capacity that education augments. Third, such conditions compel many Salvadorans to migrate, alienating themselves from family, community, and home. In Silvia’s words: “I graduated [from high school] in 2004. Many of my classmates . . . left. . . . Often parents will give them money so that they can migrate. It’s as if giving them money to migrate is an inheritance. They leave this sort of inheritance so that their children can get ahead in life.” Migration, for most, thus seems like the only choice for a future, a family, a life. Yet, crucially, most Salvadorans would prefer to work locally.</p>
<p>Salvadorans who migrate to the United States without authorization (El Salvador ranks second, behind Mexico, as a source country for unauthorized migrants to the United States [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0094582X13492126">USCIS, 2009</xref>]) and are thus alienated from the rights usually granted to citizens or legal residents generally spend US$7,000–10,000 on their journey (nearly ten times the average annual national income) and collectively send billions of dollars of remittances to family and friends in El Salvador (some of which is to repay loans that facilitated their migration). Rather than constituting collective forms of foreign aid or exchange (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0094582X13492126">Durand, Parrado, and Massey, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0094582X13492126">Taylor, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0094582X13492126">Taylor et al., 1996</xref>), these remittances are in fact statistical aggregates of individual income transfers between relatives—private income meant to support families. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0094582X13492126">Hernández and Coutin (2006</xref>: 191; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0094582X13492126">Faist, 2008</xref>, for a variant on this point) argue, “comparing remittances to foreign aid elevates these exchanges to the level of state transactions, and permits governments to claim credit for generating remittances.” The decision to migrate is made out of desperation, simply to survive, and in spite of great risks. Yet even such acts are—through official language and accounting practices —ideologically appropriated and thus estranged from the agency of migrants themselves. The language of “exporting people” in order to “capture remittances” and “leverage development” while “relieving” an “overburdened” economy of “surplus labor” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0094582X13492126">Gammage, 2006</xref>: 75, 76, 93) obscures the underlying reality that economic elites seek to legitimize the seizure of portions of citizens’ private income, differentiated from ordinary income in that it happens to flow across national borders, and that the maximization of such seizures is justified as a matter of economic and development policy when in fact it supports elite interests at the expense of Salvadorans wanting a life for themselves and their families in El Salvador. Even critical scholars such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0094582X13492126">Robinson (2003</xref>: 203–204) fall into the trap of employing such language and risk normalizing such processes through an emphasis on the systemic logic of global or transnational capitalism. Such distortions prevail with regard to the recent dollarization of the national economy as well.</p>

<title>Dollarization Behind their Backs</title>
<p>In the 1990s, the Salvadoran state, now reflecting the ruling class’s growing interests in the financial sector, saw the expansion of migrant remittances as an opportunity to aggressively liberalize the economy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0094582X13492126">Segovia, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0094582X13492126">Wood and Segovia, 1995</xref>: 2081). By the late 1990s remittances reached record levels (and today are valued at close to US$3 billion annually). While previously cast in a positive light, the volume of remittances aggravated currency inflation and El Salvador’s trade deficit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0094582X13492126">Towers and Borzutzky, 2004</xref>). In November of 2000, in the midst of earthquakes that killed dozens of people and interrupted mass protests, the Flores (Alianza Republicana Nacionalista [Nationalist Republican Alliance—ARENA]) administration adopted the U.S. dollar as the national currency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0094582X13492126">Towers and Borzutzky, 2004</xref>). The financial and manufacturing sectors, represented by the Asociación Nacional de la Empresa Privada en El Salvador (National Association of Private Entrepreneurs—ANEP), whose interests were defended by the Flores administration, argued that dollarization would control inflation, lower interest rates, promote foreign investment, and diminish transaction costs in international trade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0094582X13492126">Towers and Borzutzky, 2004</xref>: 29).</p>
<p>Yet, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0094582X13492126">Towers and Borzutzky (2004)</xref> demonstrate, the costs of dollarization outweighed the benefits. Inflation was already under control, the United States was already a favored trading partner, and loans were available only to El Salvador’s wealthiest citizens. Adopting the dollar also meant adopting or simply being subject to U.S. monetary policy, thus eliminating an important domestic mechanism of economic control, including the ability to promote exports through currency devaluation and to adjust the circulation of money in times of crisis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0094582X13492126">Towers and Borzutzky, 2004</xref>). Further, the state would lose the money it made minting its own currency and have to buy currency from the United States.</p>
<p>Why, then, would the state implement such policies? Dollarization buffered the banking sector against “the risk that its payments would increase from possible [currency] devaluation decided by the political circles” (<italic>Proceso</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0094582X13492126">2002</xref>: 8, quoted in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0094582X13492126">Towers and Borzutzky, 2004</xref>: 34). By successfully dollarizing the economy, the Flores administration effectively guaranteed that— regardless of who controlled the government—economic policy would favor the financial sector. Since dollarization ultimately eliminated the state’s ability to promote trade through domestic monetary practices, the argument that dollarization was necessary to close the trade deficit seems like a guise. Through dollarization, the viability of export trade policy was risked to benefit the increasingly transnational financial sector (what we call the new “finance aristocracy”); the advantages of being able to control exchange rates were traded for short-term gains in capital markets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0094582X13492126">Towers and Borzutzky, 2004</xref>). In addition, dollarization allowed Salvadoran banks to “acquire U.S. dollars at comparatively low interest rates and loan them to the rest of Central America”; from 2000 to 2006, these banks increased their loans to nonresidents by 540 percent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0094582X13492126">Madrid, 2009</xref>: 201).</p>
<p>By contrast, for the 45.5 percent of Salvadorans living under the official poverty line in El Salvador (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0094582X13492126">Segovia, 2005</xref>: 52), the adoption of the U.S. dollar often means inflation in the cost of goods, especially in the informal, unregulated sector where most of the economically active population works and consumes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0094582X13492126">Gammage, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0094582X13492126">Towers and Borzutzky, 2004</xref>: 32). Whereas in the formal market price regulations exist to limit rounding up when prices in colones are translated into dollars, in the informal market there are no such regulations. Thus, “in the informal market, where the poor operate, . . . vendors have often set prices in dollars much higher than what they were charging in colones. . . . Even when the conversion is done correctly and the prices in dollars are set at the next cent, the poor often buy in very small quantities, creating a greater inflationary effect” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0094582X13492126">Towers and Borzutzky, 2004</xref>: 48).</p>
<p>For the many Salvadorans who are living on US$5 or less per day, even a few cents can make a great difference. Both Yucuaiquenses and Masahueños overwhelmingly argued that dollars diminished their spending power while the prices of privatized utilities, services, and imported consumer goods were rising (from 33 to 221 percent since 1998) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0094582X13492126">Medrano, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0094582X13492126">Towers and Borzutzky, 2004</xref>: 32). In only one case did an informant put a positive spin on dollarization, and this exception illustrates the general idea. As a member of one of Masahuat’s oldest landowning (and therefore wealthier) families, this informant credited dollarization with reducing interests on loans that he used to develop his transportation and retail businesses. Such credit, however, is unavailable to the vast majority of Masahueños. According to Florencia, “It’s very difficult in El Salvador now because we have the dollar—we buy in dollars but we don’t earn in dollars [costs of goods are rounded up while wages are rounded down]. Life is very expensive.”</p>

<title>Maquilas and So-Called Free-Trade Agreements</title>
<p>Maquilas, touted as a panacea for Salvadoran unemployment, have failed to deliver. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0094582X13492126">Madrid (2009</xref>: 190, 198), although CAFTA was supposed to “bestow new economic opportunities for Central America through free trade” and maquila-based production, it has had “devastating effects on El Salvador’s productive structure.” Proponents of the agreement argued that it would help develop and protect local manufacturing by providing enhanced access to North American markets. However, rather than stimulating local industry and agriculture through liberalized trade, the real thrust of the agreement was to provide a “‘bill of rights’ for the protection of transnational capital” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0094582X13492126">Madrid, 2009</xref>: 198; cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0094582X13492126">Moreno, 2004</xref>). It preserved asymmetries in production between the United States and El Salvador with the result that U.S. farmers could export more goods with fewer restrictions while most Salvadoran farmers were put out of business and domestic manufacturing remained insignificant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0094582X13492126">Madrid, 2009</xref>). More importantly, CAFTA created “new opportunities for transnational companies to acquire local ones” and to do so more securely. In this sense, CAFTA hastened the subordination of local interests to transnational ones (paraphrasing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0094582X13492126">Segovia, 2005</xref>: 82).</p>
<p>In the years leading up to CAFTA’s ratification in 2004, El Salvador privatized banking, energy, telecommunications, and transportation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0094582X13492126">Segovia, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0094582X13492126">2005</xref>). Shortly thereafter, Salvadoran elites sold interests in these sectors to foreign capital (the United States accounting for roughly 67 percent of foreign direct investment in El Salvador). Simultaneously, these Salvadoran elites (including the Palomo Meza, Meza Ayau, Baldocchi-Duenas, Kriete, Bahaia, Cristiani, De Sola, Quiroz, and Siman families) bought or expanded interests in the financial and commerce sectors of other Central American countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0094582X13492126">Segovia, 2005</xref>: 62–70). By facilitating foreign investment in finance and service sectors throughout the region, CAFTA effectively weakened national industry, globalized the productive apparatus, subverted the power of the state, and shifted the locus of economic power from national to transnational interests and actors (paraphrasing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0094582X13492126">Segovia, 2005</xref>: 81–82).</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, “CAFTA enthusiasm was strongest in the internationalized segments of the business sector” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0094582X13492126">Spalding, 2007</xref>: 89). Though the Frente Farabundo Martí para la Liberación Nacional (Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front—FMLN), which opposed CAFTA, held a plurality of legislative seats, the combined parties allied under ARENA leadership were sufficient to cancel out the FMLN’s opposition (95). Other organizations that sought to slow the process to allow more time to research the trade agreement’s likely effects were either ignored or excluded as the Flores administration, suspicious of nongovernmental organizations, limited participation to business and private-sector associations. The most vociferous CAFTA opponents thus worked outside the official channels, seeing these as hopelessly biased and/or co-opted. Foro Mesoamericano, a transnational activist network, opted for civil disobedience to obstruct cross-border trade and protest the social and environmental destruction that neoliberal policies, including CAFTA, unleashed (95–101). In a dramatic move, Foro occupied the Salvadoran legislative assembly in an effort to stop fast-track ratification of the agreement but instead inadvertently hastened it: “Reportedly fearing an imminent anti-CAFTA mass mobilization . . ., [legislative leaders] introduced CAFTA to the agenda at 3:00 A.M. and had it approved before the closing of the session eight hours later” (101). Nevertheless, public opinion polls within El Salvador (summarized in Spalding’s Table 4) show a clear shift in people’s assessment of free-trade agreements, with the proportion seeing them as helping to combat poverty steadily shrinking (from 43 percent in 2003 to 24.5 percent in 2006) while the proportion seeing them as generating more poverty steadily increased (from 28 percent to 50 percent). As Spalding surmises, “This reversal of support levels between 2003 and 2006 suggests that the medium-term impact of oppositional forces may be more significant than the short-term impact” (104).</p>
<p>Ultimately, CAFTA has reduced tariffs on imported food staples and failed to provide equivalent jobs in industry. Tariff reductions under CAFTA threatened an estimated 646,500 jobs in agriculture while providing a maximum of approximately 134,000 in assembly manufacturing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0094582X13492126">Madrid, 2009</xref>: 192; cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0094582X13492126">Equipo Maíz, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0094582X13492126">Anner, 2011</xref>). Although precise figures on maquila employment are unavailable, maquila employment (more than 80 percent women) represents less than 10 percent of total employment in El Salvador and provides at best the minimum wage, covering only 88 percent of the basic food basket (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0094582X13492126">Anner, 2011</xref>: 29; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0094582X13492126">DIGESTYC, 2012</xref>: xxxi; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0094582X13492126">Madrid, 2009</xref>: 205). Total employment in the maquilas is thus remarkably small given the immense rhetorical weight given to this sector. In addition, working conditions are extremely exploitative and oppressive, wages abysmal, and opportunities for labor organizing severely limited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0094582X13492126">Almeida, 2008</xref>: 183–184), though not nonexistent (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0094582X13492126">Anner, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0094582X13492126">Armbruster-Sandoval, 2005</xref>). Finally, the broader linkages to the rest of the economy that might stimulate more general economic development are also typically lacking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0094582X13492126">Robinson, 2003</xref>: 300–301).</p>
<p>In Masahuat and Yucuaiquín, there was no maquila sector, but in the latter community some people did work in a Spanish tuna cannery. The company bused workers to its facility in a far eastern port; however, the wages were so low that many Yucuaiquenses felt that the commute was not worth the effort. Those who persisted eventually lost their jobs when the company departed. According to Orlando,<disp-quote>
<p>There were about 40 people working in a factory that wasn’t local—it was from Spain. But . . . the factory has closed and its personnel were fired because there were some international trade agreements and the government made some modifications that called into question part of the contract. [The company] said that it was going to leave. . . . It fired 35 people from here. . . . It fired people from everywhere. So now they are without work. And the majority are single mothers. They have nothing. . . . Now, a few people have gone to work in textile or clothing factories, but not here; rather, in San Salvador. Here there is nothing. Here there is nothing. . . . Those who stay here, there is no place to work. So, we have a crisis here. It is a crisis.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Although residents of these two towns have not organized to protest these conditions (perhaps because these sites themselves are relatively disconnected from the “new” El Salvador), they view their migration—in part—as a response to them. Thus the alienating, highly exploitative and oppressive conditions of what little work is available, in conjunction with the declining viability of agriculture, are so extreme that they lead many Salvadorans to “voluntarily” alienate themselves from home, family, community, and country via migration in search of a “better life.”</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0094582X13492126" sec-type="discussion|conclusions">
<title>Discussion and Conclusion</title>
<p>A vicious cycle has now emerged in which the ruling class is capitalizing on the alienation of its own people and their primary responses to that alienation—migration and the remittances it generates. The interests and sustaining economic relationships of both rich and poor are thus increasingly oriented abroad. At the same time, while class relations have largely broken down, the country certainly has not become anything approximating a classless society. Instead, interclass relations today span national borders, and inequality within the country may in some ways be greater than before the class-based civil war. El Salvador thus exhibits a clear but disconnected class hierarchy.</p>
<p>In the absence of direct class relations (that is, of stable and sufficient labor markets and wage relations that would durably connect workers and capitalists), possibilities for class struggle are muted because the domestic class situation has become fragmented and diffuse. This observation is particularly troubling in the wake of what, in many ways, was a class-based civil war and the partial victory that the considerable expansion of democracy through the peace accords entailed. However, to be included in political society while simultaneously and structurally cut off from economic society renders such inclusion meaningless—another form of alienation and reason to leave.</p>
<p>Although maquilas play a central rhetorical role in justifying the implementation of trade rules that supposedly foster greater industrialization in El Salvador, they in fact support the very finance and investment interests that diminish a domestic employment base and class relations. Similarly, dollarization, purportedly a strategy to promote domestic development, enables the ruling class to attract foreign investment and secure loans through which it can further liberalize the economy at the expense of domestic productive and export capacity, and employment. This undermines the basis on which Salvadoran workers can organize against the ruling class, which is now increasingly transnational and amorphous (as are the migrant workers themselves). More fundamentally, it amounts to the alienation of most Salvadorans from the basic conditions of life itself, from the realization of the “first premise of history” and thus of “making history” within El Salvador, which they still view as their home.</p>
<p>Even though labor organizing has declined in El Salvador, what success it has had seems to depend increasingly on transnational activism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0094582X13492126">Anner, 2011</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0094582X13492126">Almeida’s (2008</xref>:174–208) account of popular resistance to neoliberal attempts at privatizing health care (1999–2003) in El Salvador indicates, broad-based coalitions with transnational linkages have enjoyed some success. However, that the only successful effort to generate widespread resistance to neoliberal reforms in El Salvador has focused on health care is consistent with our emphasis on the conditions of life as the most fundamental form of alienation. In contrast to more directly class-based employment relations, health is an issue that affects everyone. The privatization of health care would affect the nation as a whole, thus offering a more favorable ground for nationwide mobilization and action. Yet even here class aspects emerged in slogans such as “Health care is a right, not a commodity” and “Either pay or die” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0094582X13492126">Almeida, 2008</xref>:196, 200).</p>
<p>The “organization of organizations” that emerged to defeat the privatization of health care is instructive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0094582X13492126">Almeida, 2008</xref>). Whereas Salvadorans have recently organized by sector to protest particular aspects of restructuring, including state-sector labor unions and associations mobilizing against the privatization of telecommunications in the mid-1990s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0094582X13492126">Almeida, 2008</xref>: 185), our analysis of the combined forces of alienation suggests that more “organizations of organizations” will be needed to challenge the transnationalization of local and national production and to restore to Salvadorans the ability to live and make their own history. Since most Salvadorans lack the ability to effectively strike—there are few jobs in which a walkout would have any effect on the new transnational finance aristocracy—and consumer boycotts that might affect consumption and services throughout the region are difficult to coordinate, we believe that the greatest hope rests in making more transparent the many ways in which the Salvadoran elites benefit from the alienation of their own people. As in the case of health care privatization and the aftermath of CAFTA, the more transparent the interests and actions of the elites and the more evident the connections among the forces of alienation (dollarization, liberalization, and migration), the more likely Salvadorans may be to organize their organizations and realize a new and more humane reality.</p>

<p>Had the FMLN obtained state power shortly after the war, some of these changes might have been blocked or overturned. However, economic restructuring was already well under way by the time of the peace accords of 1992, and over time successive policy changes have become increasingly intertwined both with each other and with the broader political economy of the region and the world, making them much more difficult to undo.</p>
