<abstract>
<p>This paper analyses the effect of water on the durability of hot asphalt mixtures made with recycled aggregates from construction and demolition debris. Indirect tensile stress tests were carried out to evaluate stripping behaviour. The mixtures tested were fabricated with 0, 20, 40 and 60% recycled aggregates. Two types of natural aggregates were used: schist and calcite dolomite. An increase in the percentage of recycled aggregates was found to produce a decrease in the tensile stress ratio of the hot asphalt mixtures. To study this phenomenon, two and three factor analyses of variance (ANOVA) were performed with indirect tensile stress being used as the dependent variable. The factors studied were the percentage of recycled aggregates (0, 20, 40 and 60%), the moisture state (dry, wet) and the type of natural aggregate (schist, calcite). On the basis of the ANOVA results, it was found that the most important factor affecting resistance was the moisture state (dry, wet) of the specimens. The percentage of recycled aggregate also affected indirect tensile stress, especially in the dry state. The type of natural aggregate did not have a significant effect on indirect tensile stress. The hot asphalt mixture specimens made with different percentages of recycled aggregates from construction and demolition debris and of natural quarry aggregates showed poor stripping behaviour. This stripping behaviour can be related to both the poor adhesion of the recycled aggregates and the high absorption of the mortar of cement adhered to them.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Waste has become one of the most serious environmental problems plaguing modern societies, particularly those that are more advanced and industrialized. This increasingly difficult situation has been aggravated by the sheer volume of waste that is generated and the close relationship between income levels and quality of life and the amount of waste produced.</p>
<p>Spain produces approximately 13 million tons of construction and demolition waste materials (C&amp;D waste) annually, less than 5% of which are reused or recycled, while the European Union recycles or reuses an average total of 28% of the C&amp;D waste it generates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0734242X10375747">Symonds et al., 1999</xref>). Most of these waste materials are disposed of in landfills, causing a negative environmental impact. In view of this situation, in 2001 the Spanish National Construction and Demolition Waste Plan 2001–2006 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0734242X10375747">Ministerio de Medio Ambiente, 2001</xref>) was passed, with one of its main objectives being to recycle or reuse 60% of the C&amp;D waste by 2006. To date, this goal has not been achieved. In 2008 the new Spanish National Construction and Demolition Waste Plan 2008–2015 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0734242X10375747">Ministerio de Medio Ambiente, 2008</xref>) was passed and it targets the recycling or reuse of 55% of C&amp;D waste by the year 2015. To achieve this ambitious objective it has become necessary to define more processes to recycle C&amp;D waste. Given that flexible road pavements consume huge amounts of aggregates, from an environmental standpoint it would be of interest to consider the possibility of using C&amp;D waste aggregates in the construction of flexible road pavements.</p>
<p>Although much research has focused on the use of recycled aggregates (RA) from C&amp;D waste as unbound granular materials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0734242X10375747">Bennert et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0734242X10375747">Poon &amp; Chan, 2006</xref>) and as materials treated with hydraulic conglomerates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0734242X10375747">Hansen, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0734242X10375747">Cross et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0734242X10375747">Rahshir and Barai, 2006</xref>) only a limited number of technical experiments have dealt with the use of this type of waste material in hot mix asphalt (HMA).</p>
<p>In this sense, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0734242X10375747">Shen and Du (2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0734242X10375747">2005)</xref>, HMA containing RA exhibited satisfactory mechanical behaviour and the stripping impact was also considered satisfactory. In keeping with these authors, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0734242X10375747">Aljassar and Al-Fadala (2005)</xref> reported that HMA produced using aggregates from demolition waste met all the requirements of the Kuwait specifications. On the other hand, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0734242X10375747">Paranavithana and Mohajerani (2006)</xref> observed that HMA made with RA presented mechanical results comparable with those of conventional mixtures. Nevertheless, when they evaluated stripping behaviour, a 34% loss of stress in mixtures with RA was observed. According to these authors, this poor behaviour was due to high water absorption and the easy separation of the mortar adhered to the recycled concrete aggregates. In keeping with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0734242X10375747">Wong et al. (2007)</xref> the mechanical behaviour of mixtures containing RA achieved better performance than conventional mixtures. However, no test of any kind was carried out to evaluate stripping.</p>
<p>Finally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0734242X10375747">Pérez et al. (2007)</xref> revealed that HMA made with RA offer a greater resistance to permanent deformation than mixtures that contain only natural aggregates (NA). They observed that in HMA produced with RA, stiffness was higher and a deterioration of the fatigue law was produced. Additionally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0734242X10375747">Pérez et al. (2009)</xref> designed pavement sections for flexible pavements bearing medium or low volumes of traffic with a service life comparable to that of conventional materials. Unfortunately, HMA containing RA had a considerably higher stripping potential.</p>
<p>Given that these different authors do not share the same opinion as to the stripping potential of C&amp;D waste in asphalt mixes, the aim of the present research work was to evaluate the impact of construction and demolition waste aggregates on stripping of HMA. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) model was applied to obtain results with statistical significance.</p>

<p>The basic materials were characterized in accordance with the Spanish technical standards NLT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0734242X10375747">Ministerio de Obras Públicas y Transportes, 2002</xref>) (Tests for Roads Materials) from the Spanish Road Study Centre and the UNE-EN standards from the Spanish Association for Standardization and Certification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0734242X10375747">Asociación Española de Normalización y Certificación, 2001</xref>).

<title>Natural aggregates</title>
<p>Two kinds of natural aggregates were used. The first natural aggregate (NA) was schist supplied by a quarry in fractions of 0–6, 6–12 and 12–25 mm. The rock was composed of quartz (35%), albite (30%), mica (20%) and chlorite (15%). This aggregate complied with the Spanish specifications (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0734242X10375747">Table 1</xref>): that is, the flakiness index was less than 35%; all the particles were fractured; the sand equivalent was greater than 50% and the Los Angeles fragmentation coefficient was under 30%. The bulk specific gravity was between 2.76 and 2.68. The water absorption coefficient ranged from 0.12% (fraction 12–25) to 0.21% (fraction 6–12). The second NA used was calcite dolomite supplied by a quarry in fractions of 0–6, 6–12 and 12–25 mm. The rock was composed of calcite (40%), dolomite (40%) and quartz (20%). This calcite dolomite aggregate complied with the Spanish specifications (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0734242X10375747">Table 1</xref>). The bulk specific gravity was between 2.88 and 2.82. The water absorption coefficient ranged from 0.55% (fraction 12–25) to 0.82% (fraction 6–12).</p>

<sec id="section5-0734242X10375747">
<title>Recycled aggregates</title>
<p>The recycling of materials from C&amp;D waste to be used as a recycled aggregate in HMA entailed the following process: a selection of the appropriate materials at source, crushing at the C&amp;D waste plant, the removal of pollutants, sieving and classification of the aggregates and washing. In this sense, an RA production plant is very similar to an NA crushing plant. It is equipped with crushers, sieves, conveyor mechanisms, equipment for pollutant removal and electromagnets to separate the steel.</p>
<p>The C&amp;D waste plant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0734242X10375747">Figure 1(a)</xref>) produces an 0–40-mm fraction used as an unbound granular material (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0734242X10375747">Figure 1b</xref>) in pedestrian and cycling paths with the following composition in weight: concrete (72.5%); stone (21.5%); miscellaneous bituminous (4%), ceramic materials (1%), and some impurities such as clay, metals, wood, plastics, rubber and gypsum plaster (1%). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0734242X10375747">Figure 2</xref> shows the gradation curve of the RA provided by the C&amp;D waste plant. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0734242X10375747">Table 1</xref> indicates that the flakiness index and sand equivalent values meet the requirements stipulated in the Spanish specifications. All of the particles are fractured. The RA do not comply with the Los Angeles fragmentation coefficient specification (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0734242X10375747">Table 1</xref>). The bulk specific gravity was 2.63. The water absorption coefficient value of the RA was 6.1%, which was much higher than that of the NA due to the presence of cement mortar from the concrete which adhered to the RA. During the investigation, only coarse RA (&gt;4 mm) were used for HMA production. Prior to production, all ceramic materials, clay, metals, wood, plastic, rubber and gypsum plaster were eliminated by visual inspection.</p>

<p>A specific nomenclature system was used to record the mixtures. First a capital letter to indicate the type of NA: schist (S) or calcite (C); second a number referring to the RA percentage (0, 20, 40, 60%). Thus, for example S-20 indicates a mixture that used schist as NA and contained 20% RA.</p>
<p>All mixtures were designed with the Marshall method. This test was performed according to the Spanish NLT-159 standard (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0734242X10375747">Ministerio de Obras Públicas y Transportes, 1992</xref>). Five series of cylindrical samples compacted with 75 blows per side were made with different asphalt percentages. The average value of the following parameters was calculated for each percentage of asphalt: voids in mineral aggregate (VMA; (%); air voids in compacted mixture (Va; %); voids filled with asphalt (VFA; %); flow value (F; mm); stability (S; kN); and unit weight (UW; g cm<sup>−3</sup>).</p>
<p>Next, eight series consisting of six specimens each were designed in order to carry out the indirect stripping tensile test (ISTT). The specimens were produced with the optimum asphalt content (B<sub>o</sub>) selected from the Marshall test. The specimens were compacted with 50 blows per side using the Marshall test moulds and compactor. The trial temperature of the specimens was 15°C. The ISTT was used to measure the loss of cohesion produced by saturation and water acting on the HMA. In this case, the test was conducted in compliance with the European standard EN-12697-12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0734242X10375747">Asociación Española de Normalización y Certificación, 2004</xref>). The ISTT provides a ratio of the average stress of a conditioned set of three specimens submerged in water at 40°C for 3 days to the average stress of an unconditioned set of three specimens maintained in air at 20°C for 3 days (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula1-0734242X10375747">Equation (1)</xref>). Since the test is an indirect tensile test, the ratio is called a tensile stress ratio (TSR), and it is expressed as a percentage.</p>

<title>Analysis of variance analysis</title>
<p>The use of analysis of variance (ANOVA) models provides the researcher with a statistically based technique capable of producing meaningful models of the importance of the factors studied in an experiment. A three-way ANOVA analysis using Statgraphics (Statistical Graphics Corporation, Rockville, MD, USA) was selected to investigate factor effects and the interactions among them. The dependent variable used was the indirect tensile stress. The three factors were: moisture state (dry, wet), NA type (Schist, calcite dolomite), and the percentage of RA (0, 20, 40 and 60%). The moisture state and NA type are qualitative variables and the percentage of RA is a quantitative variable.</p>
<p>Two, two-way ANOVAs were later carried out depending on the moisture state. The purpose of this was to determine the effect of these factors on the ITS.</p>
<p>In ANOVA models, the effect of each factor is measured as a percentage of the total variance of the data. The effect of each individual factor is called the main effect. The effect of each pair of combined factors or of a trio of factors is called an interaction effect.</p>
<p>The sum of the main effects and the interaction effects would be 100 if the ANOVA model were to fully explain the sources of the variance of the data. Usually, however, the model is unable to relate all of the variances of the data to the effects of the factors. Therefore, the sum of the effects is less than 100 and the difference is called the residual value. This value expresses the percentage of the variance of the system that the model does not explain.</p>
<p>An effect is considered of statistical significance for a 95% confidence level if the <italic>p</italic>-value in the Fisher distribution is less than 0.05.</p>

<title>Production of mixtures in the laboratory</title>
<p>During the production of the mixtures, it was observed that the quartzites as well as the siliceous particles coming from the recycled material were covered with great difficulty. This is due, in part, to the chemical nature of these materials, but also to the fact that other particles originating from the concrete have mortar on their surface and, because of the high absorption capacity of the mortar, less effective binder is left to cover the recycled quartzite and siliceous aggregates. This is demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0734242X10375747">Figure 3</xref>: mixture S-0 has an appropriate colour and shine (Figure 3(a)), whereas mixture S-20, despite containing 1% more binder, exhibits coarse aggregate that was left uncovered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0734242X10375747">Figure 3(b)</xref>).</p>

<p>According to the results presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0734242X10375747">Table 3</xref>, compliance is achieved with the Spanish PG-3 requirements for HMA used as a base course material in low volume roads having heavy traffic category T3. Traffic category T3 refers to the following interval of annual average daily heavy traffic: 50 ≤ AADT<sub>H</sub> &lt; 200.</p>
<p>It can be seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0734242X10375747">Table 3</xref> that the specific gravity (G<sub>sb</sub>) of the aggregates diminishes upon the incorporation of the RA. This translates to a lower unit weight (UW) of the mixtures. This tendency is accentuated by the increase in air voids (Va) and in voids in the aggregate (VMA) upon the addition of greater percentages of RA, despite the simultaneous increase in binder content. That is to say, the compaction operation was less efficient in the mixes incorporating RA.</p>
<p>Considering the appearance of the mixtures during their production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0734242X10375747">Figure 3</xref>), these tendencies can be related to the high level of absorption of the cement mortar in the RA, which causes a higher binder demand. This results in the mixtures with RA being short on binder, despite containing more binder than the reference mixtures.</p>
<p>It would be advisable, when working in the laboratory with this type of recycled material, to give the mixture time to stand at a high temperature before being compacted. This would allow time for the absorption of the binder by the cement mortar, resulting in a higher binder content than what would be obtained without the standing time allotted to facilitate absorption.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0734242X10375747">Table 4</xref> shows that, in keeping with the increasing trend of the Marshall stability values, the increasing RA percentages increase the resistance of the bituminous mixture to tensile stress. However, upon increasing the RA content, the action of the water has a more severe impact; that is to say, the TSR is lower as the RA content increases.</p>
<p>This could be due to the air void content, which goes from 5 to 5.5% with the schist NA and from 5 to 7% with the calcite NA. It does not, however, appear that such drastic losses in TSR (from 88 to 60% with the schist NA and from 96 to 52% with the calcite NA) could be due solely to the increase in voids. It is more likely related to the lack of adhesion of the RA. As can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0734242X10375747">Figure 3</xref>, during production, adhesion was poor in the mixture with RA. Furthermore, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0734242X10375747">Figure 4</xref> shows that after immersion, the water managed to displace the binder of the RA and the breakage of the specimen occurred at the RA–bituminous mortar interface. By contrast, in the dry state specimen the breakage was produced, for the most part, by the bituminous mortar.</p>

However, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0734242X10375747">Figure 4(b)</xref> shows the lack of symmetry in a specimen that broke after immersion. A number of mineral particles of RA (red marks) appear just on the right. This demonstrates that the crack affected the RA–bituminous mortar interface rather than the mineral particles. Therefore, the decrease in the tensile stress ratio is due to the lack of adhesion of the RA–bituminous mortar and the high level of absorption of the cement mortar adhered to the RA.</p>

<p>In second-order interactions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5-0734242X10375747">Table 5</xref>), the interaction between RA% and the moisture state was significant (<italic>p</italic> = 0.000), accounting for 18.01% of the total variance. This is reflected by the opposite behaviour of the specimens in the dry versus the wet state for the different values of RA%. The resistance of the specimens in the dry state increases with RA%; whereas the resistance of the specimens in the wet state does not undergo any increase. The interaction between the RA% and NA type is also significant, although to a lesser extent (<italic>p</italic> = 0.009), since it is only able to explain 4.24% of the total variance. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0734242X10375747">Table 4</xref> shows the discrepancy between the behaviour of the specimens made with NA calcite (C) and those containing NA schist (S). The resistance of the specimens was consistently lower with NA calcite except for the 60% RA mixture where resistance was higher with NA schist. Lastly, there was no interaction between NA type and moisture state (<italic>p</italic> = 0.566 &gt; 0.05), as it only accounted for 0.10% of the total variance. It is interesting to note that the ITS of NA calcite and NA schist increasedin the same proportion when going from the wet state to the dry state.</p>
<p>On the basis of the ANOVA, it can be deduced that the most influential factor in specimen resistance is the moisture state. Moisture state is involved in 73.52% of the total variance. Therefore, the effect exerted by both RA% and NA type on resistance would seem to be different depending on the moisture state (dry or wet). For this reason, two separate ANOVAs for each moisture state were performed as follows.</p>

<p>From the table it is evident that for the wet moisture state, both the RA% (<italic>p</italic> = 0.125 &gt; 0.05) and NA type (<italic>p</italic> = 0.075 &gt; 0.05) were not significant as single factors. However, the double interaction between RA% and NA type has a significant effect on the resistance of the specimens in the wet state (<italic>p</italic> = 0.027 &lt; 0.05). In keeping with this, the RA% was found in 48.84% of the total variance.</p>
<p>In the dry state, the RA% main effect significantly influences (<italic>p</italic> = 0.105 &gt; 0.05) resistance, whereas the NA type main effect (0.105) does not have any significant impact. The double interaction is also significant, although to a lesser degree than in the wet state. Here the RA% was found in 78.08% of the total variance.</p>
<p>On the basis of the two-way ANOVAs, it was found that when specimens are in the wet state, the RA% does not significantly affect resistance. What does, however, affect it significantly is the interaction between RA% and NA type. In contrast, in the dry state, the RA% (as a single factor) has a significant effect on the ITS of the specimens. In keeping with this, when the RA% increases, the ITS of the specimens in the dry state also rises significantly. This, however, does not occur in the wet state, where resistance tends to diminish. Logically, the above demonstrates that an increase in RA% leads to a decrease in the TSR values of HMA specimens.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>It has been demonstrated that the RA content of the HMA translates to an increase in ITS in the dry state specimens and a drop in TSR. This behaviour upon exposure to water was due to the poor adhesion of the RA. To evaluate these results, it must be remembered that only coarse fraction RA was used, without any fine contaminants, and that all the particles of gypsum plaster and ceramic material were removed prior to the tests. Hence, the unsatisfactory adhesion was due to the coarse quartzite and the siliceous mineral particles.</p>
<p>Another circumstance able to accentuate the stripping of the mixtures is the high level of absorption of RA. The cement mortar adhered to them is porous and requires a greater binder demand. During the laboratory tests the mixture was compacted directly after mixing. Therefore the absorption was not complete and this might have contributed to a general weakness of the mixture when exposed to water.</p>
<p>Considering that the RA do not comply with the Los Angeles requirements and that the mixtures demonstrate very little resistance to the action of water, the Spanish specifications for asphalt mixtures are not met. Moreover, these specifications are not even met for the bituminous mixtures used in base layers of low volume roads.</p>
<p>With these results in mind, it is recommended that for further research on construction and demolition waste aggregates in HMA the following should be taken into account.</p>
<list id="list3-0734242X10375747" list-type="bullet">
<list-item><p>Fine fraction RA should not be utilized, as it contains significant amounts of cement mortar and impurities. Gypsum plaster and ceramic content should be eliminated from the coarse fraction of RA.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Laboratory tests for the design of the asphalt mixture should allow time for the asphalt mixture to settle at a high temperature to ensure the absorption of the binder by the cement mortar and concrete particles. In this way the design will take into account the effective binder after absorption.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Furthermore, the use of anti-stripping agents should be included in further investigations.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>The same recommendations apply to large-scale production. In particular, enough time should be allowed for the transport and laying-down of the asphalt mix in order to complete the absorption of the binder by the cement mortar in the recycled materials. In some cases, regulation heated hoppers might be necessary to increase the available time for the absorption of the binder by the mortar and the cement particles.</p>
