<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Since 2004, natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) has provided a novel surgical approach to the peritoneal cavity via an internal incision in the vagina, stomach, or colon and has allowed the successful performance of transvaginal appendectomy, transvaginal cholecystectomy, and transgastric peritoneoscopy procedures in humans.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1553350611421915">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1553350611421915"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1553350611421915">3</xref></sup> Since 2007, NOTES in the thoracic cavity has been used as a diagnostic and therapeutic procedure in animal models.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1553350611421915">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1553350611421915"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1553350611421915"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1553350611421915"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1553350611421915"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1553350611421915"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1553350611421915">10</xref></sup> Its increasing practice may lead to a new methodology in the evaluation and treatment of thoracic diseases.</p>
<p>Natural orifice surgery (NOS) is a technique by which surgeries are performed through a natural orifice such as the mouth, vagina, urethra, or anus. NOS has been shown to be safe and feasible in both human and animal models. Willingham et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1553350611421915">11</xref></sup> and Wilhelm et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1553350611421915">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1553350611421915"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1553350611421915"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1553350611421915">15</xref></sup> reported the rationale, anatomical considerations, surgical technique, and the prospective proof of concept of a novel transoral endoscopic surgery in the anterior neck region. They also described the safety and feasibility of transoral endoscopic resection of thyroid tumor in humans.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1553350611421915">16</xref></sup> More recently, Wilhelm and Benhidjeb<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1553350611421915">17</xref></sup> have reported the feasibility and safety of performing thymectomy via the transoral approach in live pig models. With regard to the transcervical endoscopic evaluations of thoracic cavity, Fowkes et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1553350611421915">18</xref></sup> have reported the successful use of video-assisted cervical thoracoscopy to diagnose the pleural disease in 15 patients. However, there are no published reports describing the safety and efficacy of using the transoral endoscopic approach in thoracic exploration and surgical lung biopsy. On the basis of the success in previous studies, we aim to investigate a novel approach to the thoracic cavity via a transoral incision using the endoscope via the homemade metal tube. Our main goal was to test the feasibility of using a transoral approach to the thoracic cavity to perform a surgical lung biopsy and evaluate the success of transoral endoscopic lung biopsy (TOLB) in an animal survival model.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1553350611421915" sec-type="methods">
<title>Method</title>
<p>The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee on Animal Research of the Chang Gung Memorial Hospital and received humane care in compliance with the OECD principles on good laboratory practice. To evaluate the feasibility of the transoral approach to the thoracic cavity in a living animal model, a total of 10 canines were evaluated after the performance of TOLB. The regions of surgical biopsy (right upper [cranial] lobe, n = 2; right middle lobe, n = 2; right lower [caudal] lobe, n = 2; left upper [cranial] lobe, n = 2; and left lower [caudal] lobe, n = 2) were predetermined before surgery.</p>
<p>The animals were anesthetized with ketamine (5 mg/kg) and xylazine HCl (5 mg/kg) by intramuscular injection. The animals were orally intubated (with the endotracheal tube located 2 cm below the vocal cord) and mechanically ventilated in volume control mode (tidal volume, 15 cm<sup>3</sup>/kg; respiratory rate, 12/min). Maintenance of anesthesia was achieved by 2% isoflurane and bolus application of xylazine HCl (5 mg/kg) throughout the procedure. All procedures were performed with the animal in the supine position.</p>
<p>After oral incision (over the left or right vestibular oris region), the thoracic cavity was approached using the blunt dissection technique. To conveniently approach the pleural cavity and expose a greater working space for TOLB, a left oral incision was used to access the right pleural cavity and a right oral incision was used to access the left pleural cavity. The working channel was created by inserting the metal tube through the vestibulum oris incision until it reached the mandibular periosteum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1553350611421915">Figures 1A</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1553350611421915">1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1553350611421915">2A</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1553350611421915">2D</xref>). The dissecting planes continued along the anterior surface of the trachea down to the suprasternal region. With the blunt end of the metal tube in an elevated position, the metal tube was advanced just behind the posterior border of the manubrium and anterior to the innominate venous trunk. Immediately before entering the thoracic cavity, the ventilator was turned off to reduce complications of lung injury or abrasion during mediastinotomy. The metal tube was then used to create a 1-cm incision in the upper anterior mediastinal pleura (about one fingerâs breadth from the posterior border of the sternum) to allow the passage of the endoscope for TOLB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1553350611421915">Figures 3A</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1553350611421915">3D</xref>).</p>

<p>The thoracic organ was evaluated endoscopically via the metal tube with a rigid bronchoscope (R. Wolf Company, Knittlingen, Germany) supplanted by 4.9-mm flexible bronchoscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). After determining the optimal lung region for surgical biopsy, the lung tissue was looped with an electrocautery loop passed adjacent to the bronchoscope (inside the metal tube). The endo-grasper (Olympus Endotherapy, Tokyo, Japan) was then introduced through the working port of the bronchoscope to grasp the biopsy region and facilitate the surgical lung biopsy with the electrocautery loop. After the lung was resected by using an electrocautery loop, the resected portion was retrieved with an endoscopic grasper, which was passed through the working channel of the endoscope. The resected margin was then reinforced with a homemade endoloop ligature (Ethicon, Somerville, NJ) to prevent air leakage. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1553350611421915">Figures 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-1553350611421915">4B</xref>; see video online at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://sri.sagepub.com">http://sri.sagepub.com</ext-link>) Following completion of the lung biopsy, we used manual positive pressure ventilation in conjunction with negative pressure suction to facilitate lung expansion following the surgery. The vestibular oral incision was closed with a running 3-0 Vicryl suture after complete lung expansion was confirmed using endoscopy. Operative outcomes, including operative time, success of TOLB, and intraoperative complications, were recorded.</p>

</fig>
<p>Normal diet was resumed 1 day after surgery. Cefamezine (20 mg/kg per day) was administered intramuscularly for 3 days. All animals were closely monitored for TOLB outcomes and signs of mediastinitis; rectal body temperature (normal range 38.5Â°C to 39.5Â°C), respiratory rate, oral intake, and daily performance were recorded. Blood samples were drawn for the measurement of white blood cell count (normal range 4.0 Ã 10<sup>3</sup> to 15.5 Ã10<sup>3</sup> cells/L) levels before the TOLB and 1, 2, 3, 7, and 14 days after surgery. The parameters were statistically analyzed with MannâWhitney <italic>U</italic> test, and <italic>P</italic> values less than .05 were considered significant. All data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism (version 4.0; GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA).</p>
<p>At 2 weeks, the animals were sacrificed using intravenous xylocaine (200 mg), and sternotomies were performed to evaluate TOLB outcomes, including the success and complications (infection, adhesion, bleeding, and injury of vital mediastinal and intrathoracic structures) of the surgical lung biopsy. The surgical lung biopsy regions were subsequently removed for pathological examination. All operative and necropsy findings were recorded using a digital video system.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>The mean procedure time was 132 minutes (range 130-190 minutes). Transoral access to the thoracic cavity and TOLB was successfully completed in 8 of 10 animals. In 2 animals, the lingular portion of the left upper lobe was misinterpreted as the left lower lobe. All the resection margins were successfully secured by 1-4 endoloop ligatures, and no air leakage occurred under positive pressure ventilation. Other than the presence of a very small amount of mediastinal oozing after the introduction of the metal tube into the thoracic cavity in one animal, no other major intraoperative complications were noted (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1553350611421915">Table 1</xref>).</p>

These include the transvesical, transesophageal, and transtracheal approaches.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1553350611421915">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1553350611421915"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1553350611421915"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1553350611421915"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1553350611421915">10</xref></sup> The transesophageal approach requires an incision over the esophageal wall and puts the mediastinum at risk for infection and mediastinitis. The use of a left pleural approach would be more challenging since the aorta is located over the lateral aspect of the esophagus and, therefore, additional study is needed. The major disadvantage of the transvesical approach is the limited exploration of the right side of the thoracic cavity because the liver blocks access to the diaphragmatic surface of the right pleural. One of the major problems with the use of the transtracheal approach is the development of tension pneumothorax, which requires the insertion of a chest tube for pleural drainage. In the present study, we describe a novel approach to the thoracic cavity using an oral incision. The surgical lung biopsy proved to be technically feasible in both lungs and could be performed without major complications via a homemade metal tube inserted through an oral incision and the use of a purely endoscopic technique.</p>
<p>The intraoral approach has been described as a practical platform for endoscopic excision of the submandibular gland. Recently, with the introduction of transoral endoscopic thyroid surgery by Wilhelm et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1553350611421915">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1553350611421915"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1553350611421915"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1553350611421915"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1553350611421915"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1553350611421915">17</xref></sup> which included the anatomical studies of the transoral endoscopic approach of the neck and mediastinum, feasibility studies of transoral thymectomy in a porcine model, and a prospective proof-of-concept study of transoral thyroidectomy in humans, the interest in transoral endoscopic surgery has been firmly established. On the basis of these previous findings, we extended the transoral approach (involving single vestibulum oris incision) to the entire thoracic cavity for thoracic exploration and surgical lung biopsy.</p>
<p>The greatest concern during the transoral approach to the thoracic cavity is the risk of mediastinal organ injury. To minimize the complications of vessel injury during the procedure, the homemade metal tube was engaged along the pretracheal plane down to the suprasternal notch region; the tube was then elevated in the direction of the posterior border of the sternum and advanced behind the manubrium of the sternum (actually, the route of metal tube was between the manubrium of sternum anteriorly and the innominate venous trunk posteriorly). For thoracic exploration, the blunt metal tube was advanced into the pleural cavity under apnea (collapse of the lung) to reduce the risk of lung injury. There was no evidence of mediastinitis during the 2 weeks after surgery. Furthermore, necropsy revealed no signs of vital organ or phrenic nerve damage. Our experience in the clinical use of ultrasound in the evaluation of pulmonary lesions, lung cancer staging, and vascular intervention also leads us to believe that TOLB can be performed safely under the guidance of endobronchial ultrasound in the near future.</p>
<p>Another major concern regarding the use of natural orifice approach in thoracic surgery is the potential complications of pneumothorax. In a survival study, von Delius et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1553350611421915">10</xref></sup> found that animals with intraoperative pneumothorax were associated with a higher rate of operative mortality. Similar results were also reported by Willingham et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1553350611421915">11</xref></sup> With regard to pneumothorax complications, although our preliminary success with the use of prophylaxis chest tube drainage in transtracheal thoracoscopy showed that it is a useful modality for improving perioperative safety and decreasing mortality, it required an incision through the skin for chest tube placement. In the present study, there was no evidence of potentially life-threatening pneumothorax complications. This is because no wound was created in the aerodigestive tract.</p>
<p>Incision leakage and infection are important complications after NOS. With regard to the management of the wound after NOS, several devices for wound closure have been reported, including fibrin glues, clips, and occluders.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1553350611421915">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1553350611421915"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1553350611421915"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1553350611421915">22</xref></sup> However, because of safety concerns and complications from these devices, they cannot be widely used until they are fully evaluated in preclinical large animal and human studies. To reduce the difficulty of wound management, we approached the thoracic cavity via an oral incision and closed the incision by using 2 layers of running 3-0 Vicryl sutures. With this technique, we successfully performed TOLB in 8 animals without additional incisions. Furthermore, there was no clinical evidence of mediastinal infection and no complications such as wound dehiscence, wound infection, or wound hematoma over the oral incision region. This study suggested the safety of using oral incisions as an entrance location for N0S thoracoscopic surgery.</p>
<p>With pneumoperitoneum, abdominal exploration can be done either by a laparoscopic or natural orifice approach. Hence, many researchers have attempted to evaluate the mediastinum and thoracic cavity by introducing air into the mediastinum and intrapleural space to compress the lung and facilitate thoracic lung exploration. However, studies have revealed that positive pleural pressure increases hemodynamic risks and cardiopulmonary complications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1553350611421915">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1553350611421915">11</xref></sup> In fact, manual ventilation accompanied by intermittent apnea allows for exploration of the thoracic cavity and has been widely used as a platform to provide thoracic surgery in patients who did not tolerate single lung ventilation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1553350611421915">23</xref></sup> On the basis of this belief, we performed NOTES thoracic surgery under intermittent apnea. Our results confirmed that intermittent apnea was feasible and safe for TOLB in all 10 animals.</p>
<p>Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery is the current modality of choice for the diagnosis and treatment of thoracic diseases, but it may be associated with chronic chest discomfort. The results of the present study lead us to believe that the transoral approach technique may have potential in performing minor thoracic procedures, including lung cancer staging, thoracic exploration in patients with pleural effusion, endoloop ligation of bullae in patients with pneumothorax, and pericardial window creation for patients with pericardial effusion. It may also permit rapid recovery after surgery. A large randomized animal study is necessary to further define the efficacy and safety of the transoral approach to the thoracic cavity.</p>
<p>The study has several limitations. First, the sample size in our study is small. Second, the potential use of TOLB is limited to diffuse lung disease or small peripheral lung lesions located only on the visceral pleura. TOLB for lung lesions located in the deeper regions of the lung parenchyma may not be feasible. Third, it is difficult to access the left lower lobe and diaphragmatic lung surface with the transoral approach because the patient is positioned supine. Fourth, only young and healthy animals without any underlying disease were studied. Future research is needed to evaluate hemodynamic variations during the procedure before transitioning the use of TOLB from animal studies to clinical use in human beings.</p>
<p>This study provides evidence that TOLB is possible in survival studies. In the following year, we will conduct randomized study in greater scale to compare the transoral approach to video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery for basic thoracic procedures such as pericardial window creation, surgical lung biopsies, dorsal sympathectomy and mediastinal lymph node samplings in terms of safety, efficacy, physiologic, and immunologic impact. Based on positive experience on this study, we also plan to carry out preclinical studies of tansoral approach on human subjects after getting approval from the institutional review board for simple thoracic procedures.</p>
