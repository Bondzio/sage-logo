<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Hypertension is considered a major risk factor for development and progression of cerebro- and cardiovascular disorders. The pathogenesis of hypertension is accompanied by endothelium dysfunction, increased peripheral vascular resistance, and excessive activation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS).</p>
<p>Resistant arteries are vessels with lumen diameters measuring &lt; 400 μm when relaxed, and they constitute the major site of generation of vascular resistance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1470320312470580">1</xref></sup> A significant role of increasing peripheral resistance has been proposed for resistant arteries in the pathogenesis of hypertension.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1470320312470580">2</xref></sup> Thus, in addition to the apparent blood-pressure lowering effects, which are similar between the different classes of drugs used in the treatment of high blood pressure, antihypertensive therapy should also be able to prevent and/or reverse functional changes of resistant arteries.</p>
<p>RAS is one of the key regulatory systems for the control of blood pressure and cardiovascular pathologies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1470320312470580">3</xref></sup> When misregulated, this system can facilitate the development of pathological processes and increase arterial blood pressure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1470320312470580">4</xref></sup> Tissue RAS serves organ-specific functions and acts independently of the plasma RAS. It has been speculated that the circulating endocrine RAS is responsible for acute reaction, while the tissue RAS seems to be involved in a more chronic response, such as secondary structural remodeling of the cardiovascular system.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1470320312470580">5</xref></sup> Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) occurring in hypertension is known to be an independent risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. RAS may contribute to the development of LVH and may be involved in the regression of LVH by antihypertensive drugs, with the cardiac tissue RAS playing the more important role in this progression.</p>
<p>β-adrenergic antagonists have been shown to exert a protective effect in patients with cardiovascular disease. Nebivolol, a third-generation beta-blocker, is effective in treating blood pressure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1470320312470580">6</xref></sup> Additionally, nebivolol exhibits a vasodilatory property that is related to its effect on nitric oxide (NO), an intrinsic vasodilator produced in vascular endothelium.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1470320312470580">7</xref></sup> Previous studies showed that nebivolol treatment enhanced relaxation in rat aorta,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1470320312470580">8</xref></sup> human penile arteries,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1470320312470580">9</xref></sup> and rat mesenteric artery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1470320312470580">10</xref></sup> The present study was designed to investigate the effects of nebivolol on the vascular response of resistant arteries (femoral artery and renal artery), cardiac hypertrophy, and circulating and left ventricle RAS in spontaneously hypertension rats (SHR).</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section7-1470320312470580">
<title>Animals</title>
<p>The study was conducted in 30 male SHR aged 3 months and 10 age-matched Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats. The rats were obtained from the Animal Center of the Institute of Science and Technology (Shanghai, China) and were housed in a standard experimental animal laboratory for two weeks prior to the start of the experiment. The rats were housed two or three per cage and maintained at 22–24°C with a 12-hour (h) light-dark cycle and free access to water. Animals received humane care in compliance with the <italic>Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals</italic> published by the United States National Institutes of Health (NIH publication 86-23, revised 1986).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1470320312470580">
<title>Experimental protocols</title>
<p>The rats were randomly divided into groups as follows: 1) SHR given nebivolol (SHR treated with nebivolol 8 mg/kg/day, intragastrically (i.g.) <italic>n</italic>=10); 2) SHR given atenolol (SHR treated with atenolol 80 mg/kg/day, i.g. <italic>n</italic>=10); 3) SHR control group (SHR treated with vehicle once daily, i.g. <italic>n</italic>=10); 4) WKY control group (WKY treated with vehicle once daily, i.g. <italic>n</italic>=10). The therapy continued for eight weeks. Systolic blood pressure was measured weekly in conscious rats by the tail-cuff method. Each systolic blood pressure was the mean of at least five consecutive recordings. At the end of the study, rats were placed in restraining cones and decapitated by guillotine. Blood was immediately drawn into a chilled tube containing enzyme inhibitors (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), Na<sub>2</sub>-edetic acid, dimercaprol, and oxine sulphate) and centrifuged (within one h) at 4°C at 2500 rpm for 10 minutes (min). This protease inhibitor prevented the in vitro production and degradation of angiotensin peptides. The supernatant plasma was stored at −20°C until assayed.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1470320312470580">
<title>Cardiac hypertrophy</title>
<p>The heart was removed immediately after decapitation and was stopped at diastole by intraventricular injection of 15% KCl. The heart was then excised and blotted to dryness. The ventricles were trimmed of atria and visible blood vessels. Ventricles were washed with ice-cold NaCl (0.9%) and separated. The left ventricular weight (LVW) and the ratio of LVW to body weight (LVW/BW) were obtained. After weighing, the left ventricle was sectioned transversely into two slices.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1470320312470580">
<title>Measurement of angiotensin II (Ang II)</title>
<p>One of the left ventricle slices was homogenized with 0.9% NaCl (10 ml/g) adding enzyme inhibitors (EDTA, Na<sub>2</sub>-edetic acid, dimercaprol, and oxine sulphate). The left ventricle tissue was then boiled for 15 min in 0.2 mol/l glacial acetic acid at the following ratio of tissue weight (g) to volume of glacial acetic acid (ml): 15:1. The homogenate of left ventricle tissue was centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 15 min at 4°C. Then the supernatant was shifted to chilled polyethylene tubes and stored at −70°C until assayed. Total protein in supernatant fluid was measured using the Coomassie brilliant blue method. Ang II concentrations in plasma and left ventricle were determined by using the Ang II <sup>125</sup>I radioimmunoassay kit. Samples of plasma and left ventricle were incubated with rabbit anti-Ang II antiserum and <sup>125</sup>I-radiolabeled Ang II at 4 °C for 24 h. Bound and free Ang II were separated by using a goat anti-rabbit immune separating agent followed by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 1 h at 25 °C. The supernatants were removed. Radioactive counting (cpm) in sediment was measured by using a computer-linked gamma counter (Type SIV-682, Shanghai) and calculated with a standard curve generated for each experiment. The sensitivity of the Ang II assay was with a confidence of variation less than 5%. For the Ang II assays, the specific binding was 78.952% and nonspecific binding was 2.8%.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1470320312470580">
<title>Measurement of plasma renin activity (PRA)</title>
<p>PRA was determined using the angiotensin I (Ang I) <sup>125</sup>I radioimmunoassay kit. It is a two-step protocol: the generation of Ang I and radioimmunoassay to quantitate the amount of Ang I generated. Plasmas were carried out in duplicate: One was kept at 37°C (incubated sample) and the other was kept at 4°C (unincubated sample). All samples were incubated for one h to allow the generation of Ang I by the endogenous renin and substrate reaction. Then plasmas were incubated with rabbit anti-Ang I antiserum and <sup>125</sup>I-radiolabeled Ang I at 4 °C for 24 h. Bound and free Ang I were separated by using a goat anti-rabbit immune separating agent followed by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 1 h at 25 °C. The supernatants were removed, and cpm in the sediment was measured by using a computer-linked gamma counter and calculated with a standard curve generated for each experiment. PRA = (Ang I in the incubated sample – Ang I in the unincubated sample)/hours of incubation. PRA was expressed as ng/ml/h of Ang I generated. The intraassay coefficient of variation for this assay was 4.6–10% and the interassay coefficient of variation was 5.6–7.6%.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1470320312470580">
<title>Measurement of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity</title>
<p>One of the left ventricle slices was diced and homogenized in the same ice-cold buffer. The homogenate was centrifuged at 3500 rpm at 4°C for 10 min, and the supernatant was stored at −70°C until assayed. ACE activity of plasma and left ventricle was based on the calculation of the rate of absorbance change at 340 nm during the hydrolysis of the substrate N-(3-(2-(furyl)acryloyl)-L-phenylalanylglycylglycine (FAPGG) to N-(3-(2-(furyl)acryloyl)-L-phenylalanine (FAP) and glycylglycine as previously reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1470320312470580">11</xref></sup> according to the manufacturer's instructions. ACE activity was estimated by adding 200 μl of the substrate solution to 10 μl of plasma or left ventricle supernatant. The reaction was monitored at 340 nm, taking readings up to 30 min at an interval of 5 min using an ultraviolet (UV) visible spectrophotometer.</p>

<title>Vascular response of resistance artery</title>
<p>The kidneys and hind limbs were excised and placed into a physiological saline solution (PSS) at 4°C of the following composition (mM): NaCl 144, KCl 5.8, Mg Cl<sub>2</sub> 1.2, CaCl<sub>2</sub> 2.5, glucose 11, Hepes 5, pH 7.4, continuously oxygenated with 95% O<sub>2</sub>/5% CO<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p>Adherent adipose and connective tissues were removed, and the femoral artery and renal artery (150–400 <italic>μ</italic>m internal diameter), 2 mm in length, were mounted in separate 5 ml tissue baths using 40 μm steel wire in a small-vessel myograph (Danish Myo Technology Model 610M) for tension recordings. The tissue baths were filled with PSS at 37°C and continuously gassed with 95% O<sub>2</sub>/5% CO<sub>2</sub> to maintain pH at 7.4. After an initial equilibration time of 30 min, the arteries were stretched stepwise to characterize the relationship between the vessel circumference and the passive wall tension. The vessel size was normalized by defining L<sub>100</sub> as the internal circumference that the vessel would have when relaxed and exposed to a transmural pressure of 100 mm Hg of mercury. The vessels were maintained at 0.9 × L<sub>100</sub> because this degree of stretch permits development of maximal active force.</p>
<p>The PSS was periodically changed and tension was reset during this period. After an equilibration period of 60 min, all vascular rings were exposed to KCl 80 mmol/l in order to check their functional integrity. After a washout period, cumulative concentration-response curves to KCl (20–120 mmol/l), endothelin-1 (ET-1, 10<sup>−11</sup>−10<sup>−8</sup>mol/l), Ang II (10<sup>−9</sup>−10<sup>−5</sup> mol/l) and noradrnealine (NA, 10<sup>−8</sup>−10<sup>−4</sup> mol/l) were obtained. After pre-contraction with phenylephrine (PE, 10<sup>−5</sup> mol/l) and at the steady state of maximal contraction, cumulative concentration-response curves were obtained for acetylcholine (ACh, 10<sup>−10</sup>−10<sup>−5</sup> mol/l) and sodium nitroprusside (SNP, 10<sup>−8</sup>−10<sup>−2</sup> mol/l). Each curve was obtained in different rings.</p>
</sec></sec>
<sec id="section14-1470320312470580">
<title>Drugs</title>
<p>The drugs used were NA, PE, ACh, ET-1, Ang II, and SNP (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). Stock solutions comprising 0.1 mol/l of the above drugs were made up in distilled water and stored at −20°C, and appropriate dilutions were made on the day of the experiments. Nebivolol hydrochloride was kindly supplied by the Menarini Laboratory (Menarini Ricerche SpA, Firenze, Italy).</p>
<sec id="section15-1470320312470580">
<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>Values were reported as mean ± SEM. The contractile responses to KCl, NA, ET-1 and Ang II were expressed as mN in the renal artery and femoral artery. The responses to ACh and SNP were given as relaxation percentages of PE contraction. Concentration-response curves were fitted to the logistic equation. Statistical calculations for significant differences between the different groups were performed with a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by the Bonferroni test, and ANOVA for repeated measures was used as appropriate. A <italic>p</italic> value of less than 0.05 was considered significant.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The results of this study demonstrated that increased blood pressure of SHR was associated with an increase in Ang II and ACE activity (in the absence of an increase in PRA), cardiac hypertrophy and endothelium dysfunction in resistant artery. Nebivolol 8 mg/kg daily, administered for eight weeks, gradually reduced the systolic pressure, ameliorated resistant arterial reactivity, and lessened cardiac hypertrophy and Ang II in plasma and the left ventricle.</p>
<p>In SHR, the progressive development of hypertension is associated with an increase in arteriolar tone in different vascular beds that reaches even the terminal arterioles. Abnormal resistant artery function in hypertension may increase peripheral resistance, owing to enhanced contraction and impaired endothelium-dependent relaxation. Enhanced vasoconstriction is often cited as a mechanism for increased vascular tone in hypertension and has been reported in human vessels.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1470320312470580">12</xref></sup> An impairment of endothelial function may also contribute to the reductions of ACh-induced vasodilatation in rat and human resistance arteries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1470320312470580">13</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1470320312470580"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1470320312470580">15</xref></sup> It has already been shown that a decrease of only 13% in arteriolar diameter is sufficient to produce an increase in systemic blood pressure of about 50 mmHg.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1470320312470580">16</xref></sup> The regression of endothelial function of resistant arteries is generally regarded as an important target of antihypertensive therapy.</p>
<p>β-adrenergic antagonists have been shown to exert a protective effect in patients with cardiovascular disease. The recently developed selective β<sub>1</sub>-blocker nebivolol is of great interest in the clinical setting because this compound is possibly more favorable in the treatment of patients with cardiovascular disease in comparison with other β-blockers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1470320312470580">17</xref></sup> A single oral dose of nebivolol, 5 mg/day, is indicated for the treatment of essential hypertension. In patients with hypertension and in various animal models of hypertension, the balance between relaxation and contraction is altered. So in our study a difference in contractile response to different contractors was observed in the resistant artery. ET-1 is one of the most potent vasoconstrictors described, and increased ET-1 activity of the artery has been suggested to be involved in the development of hypertension.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1470320312470580">18</xref></sup> Ang II is also a potent vasoconstrictor. Ang II stimulates the angiotensin II receptor type 1 (AT<sub>1</sub>) receptor, leading to an increase in vascular tones, and it plays a major role in the pathogenesis of hypertension.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1470320312470580">19</xref></sup> KCl and NA are two common contractors used. NA induces vasoconstriction by α<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic receptor, while KCl causes vasoconstriction through membrane depolarization. We chose KCl, NA, Ang II and ET-1 to test the contraction of resistant arteries. As was shown in our study, augmented vasoconstrictions were observed in response to KCl, NA, Ang II and ET-1 on the femoral and renal artery in SHR. Interestingly, the antihypertensive effect obtained with nebivolol treatment was accompanied by a decrease in the constrictor response to both agonists. SHR treated with nebivolol displayed markedly reducing contractile responses with respect to WKY rats. As Guerrero<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1470320312470580">8</xref></sup> showed, this beneficial vascular effect of nebivolol could be ascribed to a variety of factors, including adequate control of arterial pressure, an antioxidant effect, and a reduction in the secretion of ET-1. In this sense, atenolol, another β-antagonist, has been demonstrated to possess a beneficial effect on vascular reactivity.</p>
<p>We also investigated the effect of nebivolol on endothelial function in resistant arteries. An impairment of endothelial function is a common feature in hypertension. Impaired endothelium-dependent relaxation may also contribute to the reduction in ACh-induced vasodilatation in rat and human resistance arteries. The regression of endothelial function of resistant arteries is generally regarded as an important target of antihypertensive therapy. In our study we chose ACh and SNP to test endothelial function of resistant arteries. ACh induces endothelium-dependent relaxation while SNP induces non-endothelium-dependent relaxation. We found that in SHR-resistant arteries, Ach-induced relaxation was significantly lower compared with WKY, although there was no difference in SNP-induced relaxation. That was consistent with a previous study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1470320312470580">20</xref></sup> Nebivolol treatment improved Ach-induced relaxation in the resistant artery while atenolol had no effect. It has been speculated that impaired endothelium-dependent relaxation induced by ACh in SHR may result from decreased NO synthesis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1470320312470580">21</xref></sup> Nebivolol, a highly selective blocker of β<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic receptors, is the only beta-blocker known to induce vascular production of NO, the main endothelial vasodilator.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1470320312470580">22</xref></sup> Our previous study showed that nebivolol treatment significantly increased plasma NO and NO synthase (NOS) activity, and up-regulated endothelial NOS (eNOS) mRNA expression.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1470320312470580">23</xref></sup> The specific mechanism of nebivolol is particularly relevant in hypertension, where NO dysfunction occurs. Nebivolol may induce NO production via activation of β<sub>3</sub>-adrenergic receptors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1470320312470580">24</xref></sup> or an estrogen receptor,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1470320312470580">25</xref></sup> which has led to clinically significant improvements in hypertensive patients observed after treatment with this drug. Nebivolol combines vasorelaxing properties with protection against oxidative stress-induced vasoconstrictions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1470320312470580">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1470320312470580">27</xref></sup> Taken together, our results suggested that nebivolol, in contrast to atenolol, improved resistant arterial function. Such ancillary properties may impart important distinct hemodynamic effects and may therefore have a beneficial hemodynamic profile leading to peripheral vasodilatation.</p>
<p>It has been speculated that the circulating endocrine RAS is responsible for acute reaction, while the tissue RAS seems to be involved in a more chronic response, such as secondary structural remodeling of the cardiovascular system. In hypertension, the increase in cardiac mass is essentially considered to be an adaptation of the heart in response to this pathologic situation, in which myocardium must work harder and for a longer time than normal to supply the organism’s requirements and to decrease the tension in the walls of the ventricles. The cardiac RAS is often found activated in conditions of increased afterload or mechanical stress of myocytes. Functional consequences of an elevated Ang II level may be vasoconstriction of the coronary vasculature and a deterioration of diastolic function of the hypertrophied heart. Local formation of Ang II may also have proliferative effects on cardiac myocytes and connective tissue cells. Ang II may, thus, be an important factor causing development and progression of left ventricular hypertrophy by itself. As was shown in our study, there was a significantly greater increase in the LVW/BW ratio in SHR than in WKY. And the level of Ang II in the left ventricle was higher in SHR than in WKY. Treatment with nebivolol significantly decreased the cardiac hypertrophy index accompanied by a lower level of Ang II in the left ventricle.</p>
<p>At the same time, we observed the effect of nebivolol on PRA and plasma Ang II. The present study showed an increase in plasma Ang II in SHR, but there was no difference in PRA between SHR and WKY. It is well known that the SHR is a genetic model of hypertension that is characterized by increased peripheral resistance and normal PRA levels. The resultant increases in plasma Ang II exert powerful actions throughout the body through activation of AT<sub>1</sub> receptors. As was shown in our study, the contraction of resistant arteries to Ang II was enhanced more in SHR than in WKY. Exaggerated vascular responses to Ang II would in turn enhance pressor responses, and increased peripheral resistance, with the consequent sustained increase of blood pressure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1470320312470580">28</xref></sup> Our study demonstrated that, despite the presence of normal PRA, Ang II appears to play a leading role in pathogenesis of increased blood pressure.</p>
<p>Renin cleaves the decapeptide Ang I from the amino terminus of the hepatic glycoprotein angiotensinogen. ACE then removes two amino acids from the carboxyl terminus of Ang I to release Ang II. We found that ACE activity in the left ventricle and plasma was higher in SHR than in WKY. Elevated ACE activity antagonizes NO activity not only by increasing Ang II generation but also by decreasing concentrations of bradykinin. High ACE activity leads to vasoconstriction due to reduced NO levels and increased Ang II generation. The net acute effect results in contraction of vascular smooth muscle cells and an increase in blood pressure. Furthermore, when increased ACE activity is chronically sustained, a stimulation of growth, proliferation, and differentiation of the cardiac myocytes and vascular smooth muscle cells takes place. At the same time, a decrease in the anti-proliferative action by NO may be observed. But surprisingly we found that nebivolol had no influence on ACE activity in plasma or the left ventricle. Apparently there was some dissociation between the levels of decreasing Ang II and higher ACE activity. There was evidence that ACE was only partly responsible for Ang II formation because other enzymes were also able to produce Ang II.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1470320312470580">29</xref></sup> It has been ascertained that non-ACE pathways exist and function to generate about 40% of the total Ang II.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1470320312470580">30</xref></sup> In addition, inhibition of the breakdown of vasodilator bradykinin may be involved in the decreasing Ang II formation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1470320312470580">31</xref></sup> Apart from the direct vasoconstrictor effects of Ang II, there are important interactions between Ang II, oxygen radicals, and NO. Indeed, Ang II stimulates the generation of O<sub>2</sub><sup>−</sup> by increasing the expression of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAD(P)H) oxidase gene and increasing the activity of NAD(P)H oxidase.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1470320312470580">32</xref></sup> The vasoconstrictor effect of Ang II is enhanced in the absence of NO, and diminished during co-infusion of the antioxidant vitamin C.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1470320312470580">33</xref></sup> We also recognize that because nebivolol has other effects such as increasing NO and blocking the increase of oxidative stress, it cannot be ruled out that these factors may have contributed in part to the decrease in Ang II. Therefore further work is required to understand the nature of the mechanism by which nebivolol reduces Ang II.</p>
