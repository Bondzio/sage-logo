<abstract>
<p>This article departs from the concept of “double articulation” within domestication theory, which views media as both objects and texts. Unfortunately, its empirical application has been problematic because researchers tend to concentrate on the contextual, losing sight of specific meanings of objects and texts. Therefore, we subscribe to the concept of “triple articulation,” viewing the immediate sociospatial context of consumption as a specific articulation. Still, the practical relevance of this concept has been questioned. Therefore, we develop and test a methodology that explicitly incorporates this triple articulation in the field of convergent audiovisual media consumption. The results indicate that audiovisual media technologies are meaningfully articulated as objects, texts, and contexts. Moreover, the devised method, which allows the uncovering of articulation interactions, points out that each articulation is able to contribute independently to consumption meanings. Hence, the variation within objects, texts, and contexts raises questions about what we consider “television.”</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In recent years, the choices for consuming audiovisual content have increased steadily. Because of the digitization of audiovisual workflows, digital content is abundantly available through various channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1527476412439106">Gibs 2010</xref>). Likewise, the diversity in devices to play back this digital content has increased exponentially; it is no longer the sole prerogative of the television set. Different types of computers and mobile devices have entered the field as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1527476412439106">Tsekleves et al. 2009</xref>). Consequently, the number of spatial and social contexts that afford the consumption of audiovisual content is potentially increasing, for example, through mobile devices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1527476412439106">O’Hara et al. 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>Hence, the concept of “television” is becoming increasingly blurry as its constituent components are diversifying. More specifically, the question now arises how these components (content, device, and context) interact with each other in a converging media landscape. Therefore, we subscribe to the concept of “triple articulation” of media technologies, which is rooted within domestication theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1527476412439106">Hartmann 2006</xref>). It postulates that media consumption derives its meaning through the articulation of physical objects, the semantics of media texts, and the consumption’s contextual encapsulation. Even so, the practical relevance of the triple articulation concept is still subject to debate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1527476412439106">Hartmann 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1527476412439106">Livingstone 2007</xref>). In a strict sense, domestication scholars often stick to a double articulation, focusing on the articulation of objects and texts and how they are shaped with their broad context. Still, the latter notion has been problematic in its application because researchers tend to mainly concentrate on context while neglecting the meanings of object and media text per se.</p>
<p>In this article, we start off by introducing domestication theory to frame both concepts of double and triple articulation. Next, the focus shifts to the consequences of convergence for domestic users with regard to audiovisual media consumption and how this reinforces the need for a triple articulation approach. Finally, we devise and test a methodology to examine the hypothesis that audiovisual media consumption consists of three discernable articulations. More specifically, we investigate whether the articulation of sociospatial context, like object and text, contributes independently to the overall meaning that is ascribed to audiovisual media consumption. As such, we are able to verify the empirical ground for the concept of triple articulation, discuss its implications for television studies, and formulate recommendations concerning the adoption of this perspective in future research on audiovisual media consumption.</p>

<title>Domestication and Double Articulation</title>
<p>Domestication theory offers a framework that aims to understand the social construction of media technologies and their use in everyday life. This media-sociological theory complements media studies’ strong interest in the reception of media texts by emphasizing the importance of audience structures and routines as well as of the increasing variety in media objects since the late 1980s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1527476412439106">Dickinson et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1527476412439106">Haddon 2007</xref>). It strongly drives on the notion of consumption, which is considered a meaningful and defining factor in our domestic lives, allowing us to participate in a public world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1527476412439106">Silverstone and Haddon 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>In fact, the consumption process lies at the core of domestication. First of all, technologies are “commodified” by their producers. They are ascribed predefined meanings through marketing communication. Yet it is up to the potential domestic users to refute, accept, or alter these meanings. When a technology is accepted as meaningful, the artifact is introduced into the home. The latter should be interpreted as an important internal site of everyday life in which objects from the exterior pervade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1527476412439106">Bakardjieva 2005</xref>). When brought into the home, technological artifacts are transferred from public into private space. This pervasion is reflected through the process of “appropriation” in which technologies are objectified and given a comfortable physical and discursive space within the home. In addition, the technology’s practical applications are incorporated in already existing routines. All of this occurs in accordance with the household’s specific dominant cognitions, values, and aesthetics (i.e., the moral economy of the home; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1527476412439106">Silverstone et al.1992</xref>). Finally, domestic users advocate their personally associated meanings by displaying their use and communicating about it. In this process of “conversion,” the appropriated technologies reenter the public domain, thus closing the circle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1527476412439106">Silverstone and Haddon 1996</xref>).</p>
<p>As mentioned, the construction of media technologies is essentially a social process. One of the major merits of domestication is the formal acknowledgement of the dual origins of these meanings. First, media technologies are manifested as meaningful “objects” through their physicality, and second, they afford the consumption of intrinsically meaningful “media texts.” This duality is referred to as a “double articulation” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1527476412439106">Haddon and Silverstone 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1527476412439106">Silverstone et al. 1992</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1527476412439106">Silverstone and Haddon (1996)</xref> adapted the concept of double articulation from the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1527476412439106">Martinet (1969)</xref>, who conceptualized natural language as a structure that consists of two interdependent levels, namely phonemes (distinctive units of sound) and morphemes (units of meaning). As meaning cannot emerge until sounds are articulated, this first level is necessary in order to articulate the second. When this is translated to media consumption, media texts cannot be meaningful before they are articulated through technological objects. These objects are thus meaningful not only as commodities but also as conveyers of meaningful messages.</p>

<title>Toward a Triple Articulation</title>
<p>The attention to contextualization in everyday practices has brought about an ethnographic turn in reception studies. In this respect, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1527476412439106">Livingstone (2003)</xref> credits the notion of double articulation as it explicitly incorporates the material dimension of media consumption. However, she airs her frustration with the difficulties in combining both because they behave like communicating barrels: an increased attention to one causes a decline in the focus of the other. In a similar vein, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1527476412439106">Hartmann (2006)</xref> critiques the empirical practice of domestication researchers’ pursuit of elaborate contextualized accounts of media consumption, because they tend to neglect the specific articulations of objects and especially media texts. Hence, she proposes a conceptual shift toward a triple articulation, that is, a formal acknowledgement to consider media as objects, as texts, and also as symbolic environments or contexts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1527476412439106">Figure 1</xref>). Although this threefold conceptual distinction is not fundamentally questioned, there is still a debate on whether such a separation is actually useful (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1527476412439106">Livingstone 2007</xref>; Silverstone and Haddon 2006).</p>

</fig>
<p>Still, we believe there are good reasons to embrace the concept of triple articulation. However, first, the notion of media as a context needs to be refined. In this respect, the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1527476412439106">Hay (2001</xref>: 213) is most helpful. In his sociospatial account on the televisual, he argues that it is “not a closed (abstract) space . . . but is located within a social space of engagement, interaction and interdependence; of making, living in/through, adapting, and converting places. Social space therefore is where the televisual intersects with daily life, where it is constituted and reconstituted through various relations.” He argues that television, as an assemblage of practices, matters differently at different sociospatial sites that extend from households to nations. This implies various intertwined concepts of context, situated on multiple levels and ranging from wide to very narrow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1527476412439106">Figure 1</xref>). While the former refers to broad and slowly evolving historical and societal processes (e.g., the postwar transformations of the nuclear family), the latter boils down to its everyday sediments, which we tend to translate into the constantly changing immediate social and spatial environment we live in on a daily basis. We equate this environment with the concept of the home and its immediate surroundings. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1527476412439106">Ward (2006)</xref> refers to the home as a private and domestic sphere, a symbolic entity. This entity is constructed by the family, which she sees as a network of human relations within the home. It is a microeconomic entity in which (media) consumption takes place, matching its values and habitus. Nevertheless, we feel inclined to emphasize that incorporating context in media studies is not novel, although defining it on separate, nested levels is.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1527476412439106">
<title>The Value of a Triple Articulation</title>
<p>Our focus on the immediate, everyday social and spatial context is inspired by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1527476412439106">Hay’s (2001)</xref> assumption that variation in the sociospatial modes of media consumption engenders different meanings. We also take into account Hartmann’s observation that, although invaluable, the attention for contextual factors has blurred our understanding of the reception of media texts and the meaning of objects per se. Therefore, we argue that it is fruitful to translate the conceptual distinction between object, text, and context directly into our research designs. Moreover, this sentiment is even amplified by the converging media landscape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1527476412439106">Jenkins 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>In fact, when we look in hindsight at our audiovisual media consumption 10–20 years ago, we would notice that things have strongly evolved. Back then, we were basically limited to a television set that was most often located in the communal space, that is, the living room. Moreover, exclusively linear broadcasts were brought to us via analogue rooftop antennas and cable connections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1527476412439106">Noam 2010</xref>). Nowadays, the situation is fundamentally different. We notice how the shift toward digital workflows and digital content delivery has caused an increasing decline in the silo structures in which traditional media corporations used to operate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1527476412439106">Chon et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1527476412439106">Dwyer 2010</xref>). Simultaneously, we witness a tremendous diversity in devices: not only do we find television sets in all kinds of shapes and sizes, we are also able to consume content on various types of computers. Likewise, audiovisual content is brought to mobile phones, mobile gaming consoles, and mobile media players.</p>
<p>These occurrences are not without consequences. First, the multichannel delivery of content renders content choices virtually unlimited, tearing down past constraints of time and space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1527476412439106">Doyle 2010</xref>). Second, the widespread availability of mobile devices is increasingly detaching objects from specific contexts. Third, various consumer electronics are sufficiently affordable for a relatively broad range of consumers. Hence, it is not unlikely to find multiple television sets, computers, and mobile devices at different locations within a single household. This affects the dynamics of their use. For instance, a study on the spatial appropriation of multiple television sets led <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1527476412439106">Holloway and Green (2008</xref>: 57) to conclude that “television can be constructed as a site through which the dynamics of the household are communicated to its members. These are the dynamics of who lets whom use what for how long, and (these days) who lets whom use what where.” All of this links in with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1527476412439106">Bolter and Grusin’s (1999)</xref> concept of remediation in a sense that the increasing variation in the constituent parts of the televisiual has rendered its experience even more pervasive in multiple sociospatial sites of everyday life. An important matter seems to be the increasing detachment of objects and specific contexts brought about by the consequences of convergence. Therefore, in light of the original conception of double articulation, we would like to acknowledge the immediate sociospatial context as a distinctive articulation. By this, we mean that it is in a sense independent, yet intertwined, with the object articulation in allowing the semantics of the media text to be articulated as well.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1527476412439106" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methodology</title>
<p>The challenge now is to determine a way to translate the conceptual distinction in object, text, and context into an operational methodology. Unfortunately, previous research has failed to strike a proper balance because, along the way, the pith of the matter shifted in favor of context, rather than objects and texts. Therefore, in this research, we explored the use of a photo-elicited card-sorting methodology to formally structure domestic interviews (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1527476412439106">Figure 2</xref>). Before the interview, participants were invited to fill out a one-week diary listing the consumed audiovisual content, the devices that were used, and the sociospatial context in which that consumption took place. This prompted a reflection on one’s audiovisual consumption and offered a glimpse into daily viewing practices. During the interview, participants were first presented four sets of cards and were asked each time to rank them in order of importance. This evoked the meanings that are attributed to individual media objects, texts, and contexts. Second, fixed combinations of two articulations were offered while the remaining articulation consisted of a variety of options. The participants were then invited to indicate whether and how these options made a difference in the meaning they ascribe to their audiovisual media consumption. This allowed us to explore the hypothesis that each articulation component has at least the potential to contribute to the overall meaning of consumption.</p>

</fig>
<p>Still, we assume things are even more complicated because of the increasing number of objects that afford the consumption of the same texts and their dispersion over multiple sociospatial contexts. Therefore, we expand our hypothesis that people living in media-rich households experience even greater variation in the articulations of objects and even contexts caused by their increasing mutual detachment. In order to be able to identify a useful taxonomy of technologies used for audiovisual consumption, we draw on data from a representative survey performed in Flanders, the Dutch-speaking region of Belgium. This survey, gathering 1,212 responses, measured the penetration and use of various media technologies.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1527476412439106">1</xref></sup> The questions concerning audiovisual media consumption were filtered out and used to perform a latent class analysis, in order to find relevant patterns. From each detected class, a suitable number of typical cases were recruited. Hence, 24 participants, 13 females and 11 males aged 20 to 65, were included in the qualitative domestic study that was outlined previously.</p>
<p>The data obtained from the interviews were analyzed according to the principles of analytic induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1527476412439106">Patton 2002</xref>). This theory-based analysis approach involves a thorough analysis and cross-validation of the hypotheses on a broad variety of cases, actively pursuing the encounter of negative cases. Therefore, we first explored specific associations with the objects, texts, and contexts through and in which audiovisual media are consumed. Next, drawing on the second phase of the interview, we specifically looked for independent contributions of articulations to the meaning of consumption. Moreover, we actively sought contingencies with the derived object classes in order to research the hypothesis that people in media-rich households demonstrate more complex interplays of articulations, especially in the field of objects and contexts.</p>

<p>To obtain a fine-grained view on the diversity in object appropriation, we first performed a latent class analysis on the survey data. A common strategy to establish the appropriate number of classes is to iterate the analysis until a well-fitting model is obtained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1527476412439106">Vermunt and Magidson 2005</xref>).

<p>The analysis indicated the existence of two major classes, which we refer to as the “conservative mass” and “progressive mass.” The conservative mass (CM) is characterized by split chances of having either one or more television sets with a digital-interactive subscription. In addition, its members demonstrate high chances of social viewing. Still, the probabilities of mobile video and online video consumption appear to be among the lowest. On the contrary, the progressive mass (PM) is much more devoted to online video. Its members also have higher probabilities of having advanced mobile phones. Nonetheless, the PM too shows a marginal chance of consuming mobile video on a regular basis. With regard to television, members demonstrate the highest chances of having multiple sets, digital-interactive connections, and social viewing.</p>
<p>Besides these two mass groups, two very specific niches were identified. The first one is the “niche without a computer” (NC). Its members usually own a single television set with an analogue cable connection that is mostly used in solitude. They show very small chances to own a computer and appear to hardly consume any online video. Likewise, they have the lowest mobile phone adoption rates and show no interest in mobile video. The second niche is a very small one, “without a television” (NT). Yet its members have fairly high probabilities of owning a computer and an Internet connection that is often employed to consume online video.</p>
<p>Now that we have a grasp of the diffusion of various media objects, which are a prerequisite for texts to be articulated, we are able to recruit a sense-making set of participants for a qualitative, domestic phase. This will enable the analysis of the articulations of objects, texts, and contexts, and even more important how these articulations interact and make independent contributions to the overall meaning of consumption. In the latter case, we even expect broader variation in more media-rich classes.</p>

<p>After each sorting task, interviewees were asked to explain and elaborate on the order in which the cards were placed, how they relate to each other, and what meaning they hold.</p>
<sec id="section9-1527476412439106">
<title>Object</title>
<p>Regarding object associations, considerable variety is found between participants from different classes. Nonetheless, nearly all the interviewees addressed the greatest value to the television set, followed by computer, and then mobile devices. There exists a remarkable agreement on the television set: it offers the most pleasant experience because of its sound and image quality, usability, accessibility, and broad array of connectivity. The device has an inviting nature to use it in a relaxed, laid-back manner, using the remote control. Further, in various cases, the television set is often used as a “wallpaper” device that is habitually switched on to fill “empty space.”</p>
<p>The computer in turn yields different opinions. The PM members mainly described it as complementary to their television viewing: it affords them the freedom to intentionally consume the content they like. On the other hand, CM members noted the relatively small screen and the large variability in online video quality. Yet some argued about having difficulties with operating a computer and finding online audiovisual content. Nonetheless, those who belonged to the NT considered the computer to be their primary device. Moreover, they found it increasingly difficult to distinguish between computer and television. For example, Jonas (33, M; NT) explicitly states that when he switches off his Internet connection and connects his digital television antenna by means of a USB dongle, his laptop instantly turns into “his television” as soon as the broadcast stream is received.</p>
<p>Only few participants claimed to use mobile devices. Most of them lack a suitable device, emphasizing that they use their mobile phones only for calls and texting. Moreover, the majority considered mobile devices unsuitable to consume video. The screen is too small, and the device is unhandy. An exception is Carl (24, M; PM), who is a regular mobile video consumer. He also mentions the small screen of his iPod Touch and mobile phone, although considering it a logical consequence of a handheld device.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1527476412439106">
<title>Text</title>
<p>When asked about the preferences in media texts, individuals strongly diverge. The same types of texts are given fundamentally different meanings, and there is no apparent pattern in relation to the types of objects that are used to consume them. It is nonetheless clear that audiovisual text is given a prominent place in day-to-day media consumption. For example, the majority strongly incorporated the daily news as a means to stay connected with what is happening in the world and also as a moment of reflection about what is happening around them. Moreover, it was appointed a specific role as subject of conversation in which own beliefs and interpretations are vented. Others did not grant the news that kind of prominent place, because like Anne (47, F, CM), they find it boring and pointless.</p>
<p>Other prominent examples of diverging appreciations and constructions are found in fictional texts such as soaps, series, and films. For example, Richard (55, M; CM) gets agitated when he thinks of these formats. He detests soaps and series of what he considers their mind-numbing nature and long-windedness:<disp-quote>
<p>We [his wife and him] used to watch <italic>Thuis</italic> and <italic>Familie</italic> [Flemish soaps] when they first aired. But, I’m sorry, I can’t identify myself with it . . . it’s just not real life so I can’t watch it anymore. And it goes on and on, how long are those shows running now? Do they even know what they want? There’s no clear storyline; for me, there has to be a storyline with an introduction, a middle part and an end!</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Maria (30, F; PM), a mother of two who works full-time, has a completely different view on these soaps as she often reserves time to get immersed in them. She admits that they are “of lower quality,” but this allows her to skip an episode every once in a while and still keep up with the storyline. For her, these soaps carry meanings of a time-out, immersion, and having a moment for herself.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1527476412439106">
<title>Context</title>
<p>Participants agreed that the living room is the central space in family life. It is accessible for all members, and they unanimously described it as warm, cozy, and comfortable. It is most often used in the evening, to gather and relax after a busy day. Despite this association with sociability and shared experiences, there exists a certain degree of variation in the number of people that are possibly present. For instance, in the early evening, children, if any, are typically present until they go off to bed. From then on, one or both of the parents remain. Further, it is not unusual to be alone in the living room, for example, when one of the partners is at work or has a scheduled social activity, such as sports practice. Remarkably, every participant who owns at least one television set has it placed in the living room:</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Patrick (46, M; PM):</speaker>
<p>I have the best experience in the living room; it’s also the place where the best set is. Next, we have a heated veranda; there’s a set there too. I use it as a fallback, when the living room device is not available. If the second device would be in the bedroom, I would head up there.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Interviewer:</speaker>
<p>Why didn’t you place the second device in the bedroom?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Patrick:</speaker>
<p>Out of principle. A bedroom is for sleeping, not for watching television. Because . . . you would fall asleep while the set is on. You would also watch more television, instead of sleeping because you’re tired.</p>
</speech>
<p>However, not everyone shares Patrick’s opinion. Several interviewees currently have a set in the bedroom or claim to have had it in the past. We found two distinct associations with watching television in the bedroom. First, it is used to finish what was started in another space, just before going to sleep, and second, it could be interpreted as a space for dedicated, intimate quality time.</p>
<p>As mentioned in the Introduction, technological convergence has brought the possibility of audiovisual media consumption to mobile devices and therefore all kinds of spaces, although as shown in the latent class analysis, the adoption of mobile video consumption is remarkably low. Many interviewees do not hide their reluctance toward video consumption in public: the space is unsuitable, the devices are unhandy, and other people are constantly watching you. Carl (24, M; PM) does not agree. He commutes along the same route for over an hour a day and considers watching a series on a mobile device as a pleasant and meaningful pastime.</p>
<p>In general, this demonstrates that participants who have a dynamic view of the meanings of their everyday sociospatial contexts are more open toward the appropriation of that space for audiovisual consumption. They are less constrained to exercise the practice within the standard setting of the living room. Moreover, these people are more inclined to allow additional objects into these spaces.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1527476412439106">
<title>Articulations’ Independent Contributions</title>
<p>In the second part of the interview, combinations of card types were presented. Each time, a fixed set of two articulations was given. The third and pending articulation consisted of at least two options. For example, the participants were shown “news” (text), “living room,” and “partner” (sociospatial context). The pending articulation (object) could, for instance, be made up by “television” versus “computer.” The interviewer then used a dichotomous lead-in question to inquire if this induced any difference in the overall viewing experience. Next, additional probing questions were asked to encourage elaboration on the factors underlying this potential difference. The proposed situations were either a priori drawn from the participants’ diaries or made up ad hoc, based on responses earlier in the interview.</p>
<p>The analysis revealed only one negative case in which it seemed impossible to trace back independent articulation contributions. John (64, M; NC) has a television set in the living room and owns no mobile devices, nor does his computer have an Internet connection. He watches television either alone or together with his wife. Still, the texts he consumes are strongly related to his social context: he watches sports on his own, films and drama series together with his wife. He claims it makes no difference, for example, when he watches the news alone or with company. Consequently, in the case of John, we were unable to detect any independent articulation contributions. In all other cases, we were able to identify at least one independent articulation contribution.</p>
<sec id="section13-1527476412439106">
<title>Variations in object articulations</title>
<p>With regard to independent contributions of objects, several instances are found within the data. For example, Betty (34, F; CM) explains how she used to follow the serial drama <italic>Prison Break</italic> on television. Because of circumstances, she missed a few episodes that were later handed to her in a digital file format by a friend. She watched them by herself on her computer located in the very same living room. Still, she was not very fond of the experience it delivered, mainly because of the smaller screen and the uncomfortable position. On the other hand, we also met Lisa (29, F; PM). In her small apartment, she placed the television and computer nearly next to each other. As such, she is able to watch films from her couch on both devices, something she does with considerable regularity. Still, she prefers her television to her computer.</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Interviewer:</speaker>
<p>How could you explain that?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Lisa:</speaker>
<p>I think, it’s because . . . you know, I work in the software industry. I’m used to working with a computer day in, day out. I think I associate the computer with work, with being busy. [ . . . ] If I would be a nurse, or something similar, I would perhaps look at it as more of a multimedia entertainment device, equal to television.</p>
</speech>
<p>Nonetheless, the use of a computer does have some key advantages. Sports enthusiast Patrick (46, M; PM) claims that despite his preference for the television set, he does not really care that much about the device when it comes to sports. The most important thing is the ability to watch whatever he wants. For instance, he uses <italic>YouTube</italic> to search for obscure and even user-generated footage of rally competitions. For him, the freedom associated with a computer to find and watch specific content are most important. This benefit is also often mentioned in the context of news consumption. In contrast to regular news broadcasts, the Internet offers the possibility to select specific news items, according to interest.</p>
<p>Carl (24, M; PM) often uses a laptop or a mobile device in public to watch series. His choice of device depends on several factors: for short distances, he favors his iPod Touch because of its portability. His mobile phone, which he considers a “back-up device,” comes in second place because of its smaller screen. Yet when he travels long distance, he tends to use his laptop because of its nicer screen and also because it affords other activities.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-1527476412439106">
<title>Variations in spatial context articulations</title>
<p>Several interviewees with similar devices in different spatial contexts recognize the influence of this difference on their viewing experience. One of the most recurring examples is the contrast between a television in the living room and the bedroom. The case of Catherine (31, F; PM) is exemplary in this matter. She and her partner consider the living room as a central place in family life. It is the space where their children play, where they use their computer and watch their television. Consequently, when they sit together to enjoy a drama series, the living room is their most preferred space. Nonetheless, they do have a second set in the bedroom that they mainly use to finish the last bit of what they were watching. In some cases, one of them does not even finish the whole episode.</p>
<speech>
<speaker>Catherine:</speaker>
<p>Sometimes, it’s my husband who says: “I need to get up early tomorrow, I’m going to sleep.” When he then dozes off, I turn off the volume and use the subtitles.</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Interviewer:</speaker>
<p>Does that affect your experience?</p>
</speech>
<speech>
<speaker>Catherine:</speaker>
<p>It sure does; it’s less fun. But, you can’t have it all. You need to choose between sitting here in the cold [the living room where the heating is then already turned off] and go upstairs to the bedroom to look at the ending. For us, viewing in the bedroom is just supplementary. Also, you’re already lying down because otherwise it’s too cold. That too distorts the experience, especially when the sound is turned off. Well basically, we just do it to know how the story ends.</p>
</speech>
<p>At Annabelle’s home (55, F; CM), most of the family activity takes place in the kitchen. She describes it as a bright, open, and industrious space where she and her husband do most of their household chores, have their meals, use the computer, and listen to or watch a small television that is hanging in a corner. While preparing and having their evening dinner, they maintain the habit of watching the same programs. When they finish doing the dishes, they usually shut down the kitchen set and head up to the living room to continue watching during the evening on their large flat-screen set. Annabelle explains this demarcation by drawing on the different meanings she ascribes to these spaces. The kitchen is strongly related to daytime activity and haphazard viewing. On the contrary, the living room is associated with a more relaxing and dedicated experience—a means to close off a busy day.</p>
<p>Linda (23, F; NT) tells a similar story. During the week, she shares an apartment with her boyfriend, where she does not have a television set. However, on weekends, she habitually rejoins her family. Throughout these constant shifts in context, she carries her laptop to consume various types of audiovisual content, among which are usually news clips. In her apartment, she uniquely uses the living room for several reasons. First, she experiences consistent problems with the wireless Internet connection, which often obliges her to use a network cable that limits her range. Second, it is the only heated room in the apartment, rendering it the most agreeable one. During weekends, she most often stays in the kitchen, which she refers to as the center of familial activity. Moreover, she enjoys cooking and occupies herself with watching news clips while she waits. In contrast, she considers the living room over there to be cheerless and unpleasant.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-1527476412439106">
<title>Variations in social context articulations</title>
<p>Not only does spatial context make up part of the meaning of audiovisual consumption, social context does as well. When we ask Lisa (29, F, PM) whether she prefers to watch films on her television set in the living room either by herself or in the company of others, she said she prefers to watch alone. In that case, she is able to independently choose whatever film she likes. Additionally, she can lie down on her sofa while not having to worry whether she would fall asleep. Still, she hints that if she were in a relationship, things would have been completely different.</p>
<p>Like many participants who are in a relationship or even have families, Robert (65, M; CM) confirms the valuable habit of watching together with his wife. For example, when they are watching the news, they usually converse and share opinions about what was announced, something he would be unable to do if he were alone. This is confirmed by Yvette (F; NC), a 60-year-old widow, who states that watching the news alone differs from watching it with her sister because of the constant conversation occurring simultaneously. Further, Johan (43, M; PM) claims that he would rarely watch certain shows programs on his own. Yet when his wife and children are watching, he considers it a family activity and usually joins in.</p>
<p>We find another example of the significance of shared experiences with Maria (30, F; PM). Although she sometimes zaps through channels, ending up watching fragments of children’s series, it does not really mean anything to her. This completely changes when she is with her son, a three-year-old toddler:<disp-quote>
<p>I love to watch together with my son. Those are really cozy moments, each single one of them. It’s when . . . I can have him on my lap. You know, he has reached an age at which he considers himself a big boy. He doesn’t like to be cuddled that much anymore. But in the evening, when he’s having his bottle and Ketnet is on [the public service broadcaster’s children’s channel], it’s often the perfect occasion to pull him close once more, and that’s something I really enjoy. It’s the context that matters, not really television itself.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-1527476412439106">
<title>Variations in text articulations</title>
<p>In addition, for media texts, we found independent influences on the overall experience of consumption. For instance, Sophia (25, F; CM) shares an apartment with her boyfriend. Both of them have demanding jobs and busy lives. Hence, they find it very important to spend time together. Sophia is very keen on watching television side by side and talking in the meanwhile. When she is however not that interested in what her boyfriend is watching (e.g., sports), her attention tends to slide to the laptop that is usually on the coffee table. Likewise, her boyfriend checks his e-mail when Sophia watches something that is beyond his interest. As such, they are able to enjoy each other’s presence, despite their occasionally shifting attention.</p>
<p>Like Sophia, Betty (34, F; CM) does not like to watch alone. In fact, it is her least preferred choice. She is quite firm in stating that she most enjoys watching the television set in the living room, together with her husband and children. In spite of this, there is one important exception: her beloved soap opera <italic>Thuis</italic>:<disp-quote>
<p><italic>Thuis</italic> is the only thing I enjoy more when I can watch it on my own. My husband really doesn’t like that soap. When he’s around, he’s constantly commenting, so I enjoy it much more when he’s not around. The same goes for the children; they comment on it as well! Sometimes, I only understand the half of it, because of their interrupting. . . . Yes, I know, it’s a bit contradictory [. . .] it’s different for <italic>Thuis</italic>, because . . . because of what I told you.</p>
</disp-quote></p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we devised and tested a methodology that helps overcome the difficulties experienced in previous research. The domestic interviews, structured around a number of card-sorting tasks, equally addressed object, text, and sociospatial context. This allowed an illumination of the dynamics that lie at the heart of meaningful media consumption. Despite a single negative case, we found an abundance of everyday-life examples of how each articulation has at least the potential of contributing to the overall meaning of consumption. However, these diverging patterns are not equally dispersed among object classes. According to our prior assumption, people who live in more media-rich homes demonstrate a larger variety in the constituent factors of their consumption. Multiple television sets and computers are present in various (social) spaces, while mobile devices are transferred from context to context. As a result, the possible range of articulation interactions increases significantly. This is an important finding. If the consequences of convergence continue to trickle down and audiovisual texts are increasingly remediated, this will likely increase the complexity in the interplay between its basic elements and complicate our understanding of media consumption. Hence, a methodology that is sufficiently sensitive for these issues seems to be a prerequisite.</p>
<p>In the end, we need to acknowledge that audiovisual media consumption practices are steadily evolving toward a tipping point. This slow but steady change induces a different view on the research object. As we have argued, it is not necessarily all about television anymore. In fact, we recommend a certain caution concerning the current understanding of the concept “television.” Do we mean an object? If so, exactly what kind of object would that be? Otherwise, television could point to professional audiovisual content that is distributed by broadcasters. However, how do you define professional, and what kind of delivery channels do we consider? Finally, there is also the factor of sociospatial context. Should we hold on to the television as a shared, living room experience? On the contrary, we propose an abstraction that overarches our findings driven by the application of the triple articulation concept. We firmly believe that future research, rather than holding on to a concept that soon might be hopelessly outdated, should instead tap into the broader experience of “viewing moving images.” As such, it is detached from specific a priori manifestations of object, text, and sociospatial context.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In conclusion, our research engages in the debate concerning the value of triple articulation by demonstrating a way to translate it from the conceptual level into the empirical. It shows that media consumption is a complex interplay of three increasingly varying factors that require equal attention. As such, it also sheds light on the everyday consequences and applications of today’s media convergence.</p>
<p>This study indicates several future research venues because it is easily adaptable in different situations. For example, we especially encourage research designs that combine a much deeper focus on specific media texts (e.g., news or fiction) and how the semantics of these texts interact with object and sociospatial meanings. Because of the scale of the present study, we were constrained to a more genre-based analysis, instead of focusing on the inherent complexity of individual media texts as usually addressed in the wide body of reception studies generated in the previous decades.</p>
<p>Yet most important, with the outlined approach, it is possible to investigate how object meanings might change in conjunction with different types of texts in different contexts. We firmly believe that this kind of research, encapsulated in a strong interest in the ecology of the everyday, has far-reaching potential. Hence, in the same vein, this study also points to the need to engage in deepening research on objects, texts, and sociospatial contexts itself and legitimates research that focuses on how these individual elements are manifested as factors in the formation and exercise of media habits and everyday routines.</p>
