<p>We would like to thank Jack Goldstone and Bert Useem for their thoughtful comment on our article in <italic>Sociological Theory</italic>. As they say, there are many things about which we agree. In the interest of debate, we focus on those issues that we think require clarification and others on which we may have genuine differences of opinion.</p>
<p>Creating something as general as a theory of fields is a daunting task. Goldstone and Useem rightly point out that such a theory has to be less sensitive to the particular ongoing struggles of a particular field and offer more generic propositions. This is a useful exercise because it clarifies what is general about field structure and dynamics, which, we contend, can help us make sense of the distinctive history of any given field. We are comfortable arguing that, for all their differences, democratic politics, a financial market, a division within a firm, and a cultural arena within a given society adhere to common field dynamics. We intend this as a bold claim that offers analysts of these arenas of action a common language and set of concepts and dynamic principles to focus on in understanding the idiosyncratic features of their field of interest.</p>
<p>Let us be clear: We readily concede that fields exhibit enormous variation on a host of dimensions, including the substance of what is going on, their relative size and geographic spread, the normative understandings and rules that govern interaction, and the strength and extent of their ties to other fields. Without denying this rich variety or its importance in understanding the unique history of any given field, we contend that the basic structure of a field and the general dynamics that shape its emergence and development over time involve very general principles of social organization that do not vary greatly across contexts. So, the specific cultural features of a democratic political field in contemporary America may contain different goals, rules and positions than the field of Florentine bankers in the fifteenth century. But our claim is that the underlying social structure of these fields can be characterized in the same general terms.</p>
<p>From the very beginning, accounting for stability and change in fields was central to our theoretical aims. Goldstone and Useem take issue with this aspect of our theory, but we wonder if this is not more a misunderstanding than a true disagreement between us. We say that because we do not recognize our theory of stability and change in the description of this aspect of our work offered by Goldstone and Useem. We see our account of stability and change in fields as much more nuanced than the characterization they offer. In their emphasis on “taken for granted” routines and reproduction, most institutional accounts imply that fields are generally stable and only experience significant change as a function of “exogenous shocks.” We see most “episodes of contention” in fields as set in motion by pressures or shocks that develop external to the field in question. But we also recognize that significant change can on occasion develop endogenously, through tipping-point or threshold processes. However, we also stress the constancy of incremental change as part of routine field dynamics. That is, whatever stability fields exhibit should be seen as an accomplishment involving constant jockeying, adjustments, and lots of incremental changes, rather than as nonproblematic social reproductions based on taken-for-granted routines and institutional logics.</p>
<p>The potential for innovative social change, however, is most fully realized in the establishment of a new field. The emergence of new social space offers actors an entirely new canvas on which to fashion a meso level order. We view this as a crescive social process in the sense that once groups perceive an opportunity to occupy and create a new space, many of them may emerge either de novo or from nearby social space to essentially join the rush to found something new. Sociologists of social movements are not the only ones attracted to these moments of emergence. Indeed, sociologists in organizational theory, economic sociology, and political sociology are interested in these dramatic moments, in which everything is in flux and new orders can emerge. Having tried here to summarize our complicated view of field stability and change, we wonder whether Goldstone and Useem would still take issue with this aspect of our theory.</p>
<p>We turn now to the three issues that appear to represent significant points of disagreement between us and Goldstone and Useem. These issues concern (1) the role of macro institutional processes within fields, (2) the influence of values and identities in shaping strategic action in fields, and (3) the amenability of some of our propositions to empirical test. We take each issue in turn.</p>
<p>It is not entirely clear to us what Goldstone and Useem mean by “institutional processes.” That institutions such as law, language, and gender roles powerfully affect fields is beyond question. We would, however, quickly add that how these institutions affect fields depends on the way incumbents and challengers interpret and deploy these institutional “resources” in the service of the specific strategic action projects they undertake. If these institutional features do become important, it is because actors are using them to create social positions, advance claims on what is at stake, and leverage their resources to achieve desired outcomes.</p>
<p>In raising this issue, Goldstone and Useem appear to be arguing that our theory either precludes or at the very least does not adequately acknowledge the powerful influence that macro structures exert over field architecture and dynamics. We think their view on this issue is based on a misreading of our argument. Indeed, although most work on the topic focuses on this or that field, and the idiosyncratic factors that shaped its development, we spend a great deal of time theorizing the vast latticework of other fields on which any given field is nominally dependent. The point is that fields are powerfully affected, in our view, by the ties they forge to other fields. A good many of these other fields would seem to represent exactly the kind of macro processes to which Goldstone and Useem are referring. So, for example, we fully expect states to powerfully affect the fate of most fields within their jurisdictional reach. They do so, however, not through some disembodied “macro” state process but through interaction between specific state and nonstate fields.</p>
<p>Indeed, the whole point of highlighting the Russian-doll quality of much of social life is to suggest that fields are embedded in extensive relations with other fields. It is in this network of relationships that field prospects rise and fall. For us, it is the “rolling turbulence” that comes from this embedding of any given field in a broader environment of fields that shapes the former’s prospects for stability and change. This emphasis on change pressures from proximate fields would seem to be perfectly congruent with Goldstone and Useem’s stress on the importance of macro structures/processes.</p>
<p>It would seem that Goldstone and Useem have missed the larger systematic perspective we have tried to sketch, instead seeing our theory as only being about a particular field and not about the embedding of that field in a vastly greater system of fields. This is not at all what we intended. Most sociological studies of fields begin with a particular field. But if one moves away from a concern with only one field, one could use our field theory to study the relationship between massive numbers of fields. Our framework offers a simple theoretical device to do this by implying that larger sets of fields contain hierarchical or cooperative relations to each other and together build larger institutional orders. This follows from the Russian-doll metaphor, in which fields are situated within fields. We note that hardly any empirical work has been done in sociology to try to theorize this broader field environment and the ways in which it shapes the prospects for stability, crisis, and survival in any given field.</p>
<p>We turn now to the second issue noted above. Goldstone and Useem criticize us for largely ignoring the influence of values and identities in our theory of action. We think this is an altogether fair criticism, at least when applied to the article in <italic>Sociological Theory</italic>. Space constraints forced us to downplay or eliminate several important aspects of our theory from the article. In our forthcoming book, <italic>A Theory of Fields</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0735275112437170">Fligstein and McAdam forthcoming</xref>), however, we spend an entire chapter explicating a distinctive micro foundation to ground the account of collective strategic action that is central to our theory. Collective identity and shared meanings are central to the “existential function of the social” that we see as both motivating and enabling strategic action and, indeed, all of social life. We have no idea how Goldstone and Useem will react to the micro foundation on offer in the book. What we can say with certainty, however, is that in our full theory, we assign great importance to the role of shared meanings, identities, and values in shaping collective action.</p>
<p>Finally, Goldstone and Useem claim that substantial parts of our theory are not testable. They are actually making two claims if one reads their discussion closely. First, they claim that because they can think of cases that do not fit a given proposition, the proposition must not be true. In our view, however, this conclusion is not warranted. We would never claim that our propositions are true in all cases. To assess the validity of those propositions will require more than noting cases that do not fit the hypothesis. Instead, one would need to test the proposition on a sample of representative cases of field dynamics. Should such a test show that most or even a large minority of cases do not fit the proposition, we will be the first to concede the point. Indeed, we included a dozen or so propositions in the article to encourage just this kind of systematic test of the theory.</p>
<p>The second claim they make is that many of our propositions are too vague to test because they include qualifiers such as “more connected.” We fail to see, however, how propositions of this sort would not permit systematic test. One would simply need to sample a set of fields, examine the extent of their social connections to other fields, and see if the number of those connections is a predictor of their stability. We would, of course, welcome any specific suggestions for how any of our propositions could be specified more precisely, but on the face of it, the hypothesis that fields with more links to other fields are more stable seems readily testable to us.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether Goldstone and Useem find our responses convincing, we are greatly encouraged by the exchange. We are heartened that they seem to accept many of the features of our approach. Whatever differences exist mean that there is an exciting opportunity for sociologists in many subfields to begin a conversation with one another. We look forward to empirical work generated by our view and that of others.</p>
