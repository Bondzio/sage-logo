<abstract>
<p>The tourism sector in developing regions that are highly integrated into international markets has noticeable effects on the growth of the informal economy. For women vendors on the beach and the marina of Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, where the economy revolves around tourism and real estate, hawking souvenirs is an opportunity for empowerment and income, but it can also lead to their exploitation and self-exploitation. While women may suffer discrimination within the tourism sector, ambulant vending contributes to the reduction of poverty and may give women a greater say in their households and their communities. Nonetheless these women are marginalized by their low incomes and lack of social security, their lack of access to the education that might lead to formal-sector employment, their residential segregation, and, for some, the racism directed at indigenous people.</p>
<p>El sector de turismo en regiones en vías de desarrollo que se encuentre altamente integrado con los mercados internacionales, tiene efectos en el crecimiento de la economía informal. Para las mujeres vendedoras ambulantes en las playas de Cabo San Lucas, México, en donde la economía se concentra en el turismo y bienes raíces, la venta de recuerdos puede proveer una oportunidad para capacitarse y ganar ingresos, pero también puede llevar a su explotación y auto explotación. Mientras las mujeres pueden sufrir a causa de la discriminación en el sector turístico, la venta ambulante puede reducir la pobreza y darles a las mujeres mayor voz en el hogar y la comunidad. Pese esto, las mujeres se encuentran marginadas por su bajo ingreso y falta de seguro social, su falta de acceso a la educación que puede conducir al empleo en el sector formal, su segregación residencial, y, para algunas, el racismo en contra de los indígenas.</p>

<p>Tourism has become a dynamic economic sector on the world level. It has been viewed favorably as a development strategy because of the employment opportunities it generates, its attraction of foreign investment and earnings, and its potential for the promotion of intersectoral linkages. Nonetheless, it is undeniable that the tourism sector has negative impacts, such as the controlling presence of multinational corporations, the lack of local control over the earnings generated, the generation of unskilled (rather than skilled) employment opportunities, the dependence on external markets, and undesirable environmental effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0094582X12454562">Tisdell, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0094582X12454562">Wilson, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>In Baja California Sur both positive and negative effects can be seen in recent social and economic tendencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0094582X12454562">Angeles and Gámez, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0094582X12454562">Gámez and Angeles, 2004</xref>). Among the most obvious are the pressures on scarce resources such as water in a semiarid region and the high price of land due to hotel and golf course development and foreigners’ pursuit of first or second residences in Mexico. Tourism has nonetheless created possibilities for employment in both the formal and the informal economy—possibilities that are often gendered in nature. In this paper we look at the situation of women beach and marina vendors in Cabo San Lucas. In the following pages we consider the relationship between gender and informal income earning, the nature of tourism in Cabo San Lucas, and, finally, the characteristics of these women vendors with a view to understanding how their work affects their lives.</p>
<sec id="section1-0094582X12454562">
<title>Gender, Employment, and Tourism</title>
<p>A number of employment opportunities have opened up for women in the tourism industry. In the formal economy, there is work in hotels as receptionists and housekeepers. In the informal economy, beach and street vendors abound. Women tend to earn less than men in both economies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0094582X12454562"><italic>Mujeres Hoy</italic>, 2005</xref>). In either formal or informal jobs, women may be single or married and contribute to the income of the households to which they belong.</p>
<p>According to the International Labor Organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0094582X12454562">ILO, 2002</xref>: 12), the informal economy, understood as encompassing unregistered economic activities not of a criminal character, is an important source of income for women. A central characteristic of the informal economy is that those employed in it have no social security or other benefits; in other words, they receive no “social wage.” Close to 60 percent of the women in developing countries work in the informal economy. In Mexico, 55 percent of employed women work in the informal economy, as do 58 percent of women in Latin America as a whole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0094582X12454562">ILO, 2002</xref>: 21). Notably, more and more scholars are distinguishing between the subjectively positive aspects of informal self-employment and the subjectively and objectively negative aspects of being informalized wage laborers (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0094582X12454562">Perry et al., 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The expansion of informal employment is related to the dynamics of the capitalist world system. Globalization, partly characterized by greater worldwide economic integration, has stimulated employment creation. Much of this employment, however, is characterized by degraded working conditions such as subcontracting, piece work, and part-time and temporary work and the absence of medical or other social welfare provisions. Flexibilization of production and of the labor market has contributed to the “informalization” of work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0094582X12454562">ILO, 2002</xref>: 21). Furthermore, neoliberal and structural adjustment policies have led to an increase in the global reserve army of labor as more peasants become proletarianized and as the old middle classes are leveled downward, many of their members surviving by engaging in informal income-generating activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0094582X12454562">Robinson, 2008</xref>). Notably, both neo-Marxist and neoliberal approaches to understanding the informal economy attribute its growth to massive rural-to-urban migration.</p>
<p>A United Nations study of the relationship between gender and tourism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0094582X12454562">UNED-UK, 1997</xref>) using a sample of 83 countries found that women composed 46 percent of this sector. This percentage was higher than in the labor market in general, in which 34 to 40 percent of workers were women. In the countries where tourism was consolidated and of great importance, the participation of women in the tourism industry reached 50 percent. These data show the importance of the tourism industry for women’s labor force participation (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0094582X12454562">Williams, 2002</xref>)</p>
<p>In the search for employment, migration often becomes necessary. Migration streams flow from less favored zones to those more favored in terms of sources of work, amount of earnings, educational opportunities, and other indices of development. Often the goals of migration remain unmet because of racial and social discrimination and human rights and labor-code violations, especially in the cases of indigenous people, women, and minors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0094582X12454562">Durán, 1997</xref>). Women may migrate to better their own economic and social situations as individuals or as heads of household and not just as part of a family migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0094582X12454562"><italic>Mujeres Hoy</italic>, 2005</xref>; for case studies in Cancún, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0094582X12454562">Greene 2001</xref>). The significance of this is that women may gain greater autonomy and independence, throwing off patriarchal constraints, as well as benefiting the members of their networks whom they aid in their communities of origin. Yet women’s migration has a downside, given their inequality: they may be subjected to mental or physical violence, gender discrimination in education, unequal employment opportunities, lower wages, and overrepresentation in the informal economy.</p>

<title>The Development of Tourism in Los Cabos</title>
<p>The 1980s were marked by the predominance of tourism activity in Los Cabos, one of five <italic>municipios</italic> (municipalities) in the state of Baja California Sur. By 1990 Los Cabos received 50 percent of visitors to the state, and by 2008 this had increased to 73 percent of the 1.6 million tourists arriving in that year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0094582X12454562">Gámez and Ganster, n.d.</xref>). Tourism has become overwhelmingly important for the state’s economy: in 2008 it accounted for 23.7 percent of businesses, 29.2 percent of the employed, 21.8 percent of wages, and 32.2 percent of aggregated value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0094582X12454562">Gámez, Angeles, and Ivanova, 2007</xref>). This tourism is concentrated in the south of the peninsula, especially in the municipio of Los Cabos and, to a lesser extent, the municipio of La Paz and primarily in the beach areas.</p>
<p>The development of tourism in Los Cabos has been accompanied by an unprecedented migration to the peninsula. The population of Los Cabos grew from 10,000 in 1970 to almost 170,000 in 2005 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0094582X12454562">INEGI, 2007</xref>) and represents almost 40 percent of the state’s population. From being a cluster of small agricultural, livestock, and fishing communities, the municipio (especially along the 33-kilometer tourist corridor stretching from and encompassing San José del Cabo and Cabo San Lucas) has come to contain more than 14,000 hotel rooms, is dotted by exclusive golf courses visited by more than a million tourists each year, and has become the center of greatest population growth in the state. In Mexico as a whole, only Cancún has shown greater population growth.</p>
<p>In sum, Los Cabos has been a dynamic growth center with abundant wealth, where 85 percent of the population receive more than twice the minimum wage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0094582X12454562">Angeles, Gámez, and Ganster, n.d.</xref>). Whereas more than half of Mexico’s population has not finished primary school, only 10.7 percent in Cabo San Lucas and 15.7 percent in San José del Cabo have not done so. Yet it is sprinkled with pockets of poverty. For example, Los Cabos has a higher percentage of houses with dirt floors (11 percent) than the capital city of La Paz (5 percent), and 22.5 percent of the population has no running water (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0094582X12454562">Angeles, Gámez, and Ganster, n.d.</xref>). <italic>Colonias</italic> (low-income neighborhoods) like Lomas del Sol show a high degree of marginalization in the midst of an abundance of hotels and luxurious, usually foreign-owned, second residences. The majority of the 27,000 residents of Lomas del Sol work in some aspect of the tourism business. Guerrero, Oaxaca, the state of Mexico, and Chiapas send the greatest number of migrants to the municipio, and migrants are employed in construction, gardening, cleaning, maintenance, and other such work.</p>
<p>The vulnerability of Los Cabos to tourist demand becomes apparent in times of economic recession. Because of the economic crisis in the United States and rumors about swine flu, tourism to the municipio declined. In November 2009 the state government acknowledged that the crisis had meant the loss of more than 18,000 jobs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0094582X12454562"><italic>Noticabos</italic>, 2009</xref>). It is still unknown how this has impacted the quality of life, but anecdotal evidence suggests that for the first time in decades many people are returning to their communities of origin, where their denser and more diffuse social networks are being tapped to help them through the crisis.</p>
<p>The lack of sensitivity to the issue of declining formal-sector employment is notable. For example, the municipality has recently restricted the number of vendor’s licenses that are issued for activities on the beaches. On Medano Beach alone, permits to vend have been reduced from the original 1,500 authorized by the government to 698 under pressure from the Asociación de Colonos del Médano (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0094582X12454562">Gómez, 2010</xref>), made up of established businesspeople. Few vendors can now hope to get a new license.</p>

<title>Women Vendors in Cabo San Lucas</title>
<p>For two weeks in January 2010, during the height of the tourist season in Los Cabos, Micaela Gozalishvili and Ekaterine Ramírez, under the auspices of the Universidad Autónoma de Baja California Sur and Tamar Diana Wilson, interviewed 30 vendors: 13 on the marina in the center of Cabo San Lucas and 17 on Medano Beach. One of the interviewers estimates that there were about 40 women vendors on the beach (where they were outnumbered 3 to 2 by men) and about 20 women vendors on the marina (where they were outnumbered 7 to 3 by men). The preponderance of men seems unusual, since, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0094582X12454562">Castorena Davis (2006</xref>: 205), in 2000 only 1.41 percent of the state’s male labor force was occupied in ambulant vending, compared with 3.09 percent of the female labor force. The greater presence of men as marina and beach vendors in Cabo San Lucas can be explained by their greater numbers in the workforce: in 2004 there were 138,568 males but only 68,667 women in the state’s economically active population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0094582X12454562">Castorena Davis, 2006</xref>: 192, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0094582X12454562">Table 2</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section4-0094582X12454562">
<title>Basic Characteristics</title>
<p>The women vendors interviewed (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0094582X12454562">Table 1</xref>) sold, variously, Cuban cigars, necklaces of semiprecious stones, pearls, and shells, sunglasses, skirts or sundresses made from imported Indonesian cloth, T-shirts with a Cabo San Lucas logo, ceramic flutes shaped like turtles and lizards, ceramic plates and figurines, onyx statuettes, woven palm-leaf handbags and sombreros, cloth or crocheted handbags, cans of soda, and simple homemade snacks. Some braided hair besides vending their wares.</p>

<p>Eight of them were less than 20 years old, with the three youngest being 15. Fourteen were between 20 and 29, eight between 30 and 40, one in her 40s, and two in their 50s, the elder being 58. Twelve were single (including one single mother), 14 were married, 2 were living in free unions, 1 was separated, and 1 was a widow. More than half (18) were from Guerrero and the rest came from the state of Mexico, Oaxaca, Baja California Sur (La Paz), Chiapas, Mexico City, Jalisco (Puerto Vallarta), Michoacán, Puebla, and Queretaro. The woman from La Paz and the woman from Puerto Vallarta both had parents born in Guerrero. Half of the women (15) spoke an indigenous language as well as Spanish, and most confessed to speaking a little English. Twelve women, 11 of them born in Guerrero and 1 in Puebla, spoke Nahuatl. The two women from Oaxaca spoke Zapotec, and the young woman from Queretaro spoke Otomí. The majority (23) had relatives who were also vendors.</p>
<p>Seventeen of the vendors had been in Cabo San Lucas for more than 5 years: 10 of these were from Guerrero. Ten vendors had been there for more than 10 years, and half of these were from Guerrero. The longest stays were 19, 15, and 14 years. Thirteen vendors had been in Cabo San Lucas for 5 years or less, and 9 of these were from Guerrero. Twenty-eight of the vendors either had known someone on arrival or had been accompanied by a parent or parents (8), a spouse (3), a sibling (1), or a friend from their community of origin (1).</p>
<p>There are clusters of vendors in the relatively new colonia El Caribe (11), established by invasion in 2002, in Lomas del Sol (5), a colonia once known for its garbage pickers (<italic>pepenadores</italic>), and in Mesa Colorada (5), established by invasion in 2001. Of the vendors in El Caribe, 4 lived in rented housing, 5 owned lots there, 1 lived on her brother’s lot, and 1 lived on her parents’ lot. Seven were from Guerrero, 2 from the state of Mexico, and 1 each from Chiapas and Puebla. Of the 5 vendors who lived in Lomas del Sol, 3 owned lots, 1 lived on her parents’ lot, and 1 lived on a brother’s lot. Two were from Guerrero and 1 each from Jalisco, Michoacan, and Queretaro. Of the 5 vendors who lived in Mesa Colorada, 4 were from Guerrero and 1 from the state of Mexico. Two vendors lived in Los Cactus (a land invasion), 2 in Tierra y Libertad (another land invasion), 2 in Los Cangrejos, 2 in Arenal, and 1 in Cabo Fierro. All of these colonias can be labeled squatter settlements, and houses may be made of anything from cardboard to unpainted cement blocks.</p>
<p>Ten of the vendors, of whom 7 were from Guerrero, had licenses. Except for one who had bought her license from someone else for 450 pesos, each paid 1,200 pesos annually for a license. While one woman had applied for a license and been told that there were none available, the high annual cost probably dissuaded others from applying for one. Twenty-three women had been vendors for more than 1 year, 16 for more than 5 years, and 10 for more than 10 years. A 58-year-old woman from the state of Mexico claimed to have been an ambulant vendor all her life. Four women from Guerrero had been vendors for 10 years, and 3 of them had licenses. A 22-year-old woman from the state of Mexico had been a vendor since the age of 10, as had a 29-year-old woman from Puebla. A 36-year-old woman from Oaxaca had been a vendor for 15 years and a 50-year-old woman from Michoacan for 13 years. Seven women ranging in age from 15 to 38 had been vendors for less than a year.</p>
<p>Only four of the women worked for commissions, ranging from 10 percent for a box of Cuban cigars (<italic>puros</italic>) —with the 18-year-old vendor from Mexico City earning 500 pesos (US$42) on a good day— to 50 percent for statuettes and chewing gum sold by a 23-year-old from Guerrero and 50 percent for sombreros sold by a vendor from Guerrero who earned US$30 on a good day. Another 15-year-old girl from Guerrero earned 15 percent commission for selling necklaces and on a good day earned US$5–10. The highest earner of all the vendors was an 18-year-old from Guerrero who said that she worked for 30–40 percent commission and earned US$80 on a good day from selling necklaces. She was the only one of the commission sellers to have a vendor’s license and had brothers and sisters who were vendors in both Cancún and Cabo San Lucas. The commission sellers worked, in the main, for the owners of small stores, who multiplied their sales by providing wares to the vendors.</p>
<p>Interviews revealed that both family social capital and education affected earnings. Of the four vendors who earned only 100 pesos on a good day, two had no family members who were vendors, and the other two had not finished primary school (<italic>primaria</italic>). Of the seven vendors who earned 600 pesos or more on a good day (300 pesos being the average daily wage of a semiskilled construction worker, day laborer, or domestic servant) all but one had completed at least primary school and two had had some high school (<italic>preparatoria</italic>) education, and all had relatives who were also vendors. Shared experiences of family members who were vendors may have taught them how to generate a higher income.</p>
<p>Fifteen of the vendors complained about having to work in the sun and 7 about abuse by the police or tax collectors, but 21 said that they enjoyed their work. Of these 11 mentioned that they liked vending because they could set their own hours. Flexibility of working hours is very important to women who have child care responsibilities, and these responsibilities are often what motivate them to engage in informal income-generating activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0094582X12454562">Cunningham, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0094582X12454562">González de la Rocha, 1994</xref>). Seven said that vending was the only work they could find and enabled them to have their own money. The responses of many of the women suggest that informal self-employment is positively embraced, a finding that has been elaborated on in the literature on the informal economy (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0094582X12454562">De Soto, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0094582X12454562">Perry et al., 2007</xref>, see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0094582X12454562">Wilson, n.d.</xref>). Nonetheless, the income generated from beach vending was often essential to household survival. This was especially true for a 26-year-old widow with four children, all under the age of 10 years, and for a 20-year-old woman with two small children whose husband had abandoned her. Their income was the only income for their households. Married women’s earnings were often essential to their nuclear households’ economy, and single women living with their parents often contributed their earnings, in whole or in part, to the parental households.</p>

<title>Schooling and Aspirations</title>
<p>Of the 30 vendors, 3 had had no schooling, 12 had completed three to six years of primary school, 13 had had at least some junior high school (<italic>secundaria</italic>), and two had had some high school education (<italic>preparatoria</italic>) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0094582X12454562">Table 2</xref>). The high educational level of the vendors was a surprising finding and may reflect the unavailability of other work. The women with no schooling were all from Guerrero and spoke Nahuatl as well as Spanish and a little English, and all had relatives who are vendors. Two of them said that they would like to learn to read and write and eventually work in a beauty shop or as a receptionist in a hotel. A 50-year-old woman from Michoacán who had finished only three years of primary school said that she would have liked to be a public accountant but would accept a job cleaning rooms in a hotel. Four young women said that they would like to study English and become secretaries or hotel receptionists. Several who had at least a junior high school education said that they would like to be teachers. A 23-year-old woman from Guerrero who had completed junior high school said that she would like to work as a wholesaler (<italic>mayorista</italic>). One young woman had reached the fourth semester of high school and wanted to be an executive assistant. A 20-year-old vendor from Queretaro who had been visiting Los Cabos off and on for seven years to finance her schooling was still in high school and hoped to go on to be a teacher but meanwhile would like to work in a restaurant.</p>

<p>The high aspirations of these vendors are notable, as is the gap between what the women would like to have studied and the jobs they would take if not vending. Although educational opportunities were expanded under President Ernesto Zedillo (1994–2000), many families remained unable to afford the cost of sending all of their children to school. Prior to the Zedillo presidency, less than half of the population (46.5 percent) 15 years or older had completed junior high school or more, and educational facilities were simply unavailable in many of the rural regions from which some of the vendors come. By 2010, 58.1 percent of the Mexican population had completed junior high school or more, and this was true for 57.1 percent of women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0094582X12454562">INEGI, 2010</xref>). Both the number of vendors who liked their work because of its flexible hours and the large number whose aspirations for further education would elevate their relatively marginalized status lend credence to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0094582X12454562">Josephine Smart’s (1990</xref>: 271) conclusion from her study of street peddlers in Hong Kong: “It is not unemployment which drives most people into street hawking; rather it is a case of active resistance to proletarianization by people whose aspiration for socioeconomic mobility is restricted by their marginal position in society.” They also support <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0094582X12454562">De Soto’s (1989)</xref> argument that the informally (or semi-informally) self-employed should be empowered rather than criminalized.</p>

<title>Profiles</title>
<p>A young woman we call Paula (all names of the vendors have been changed), is aged 22, comes from the state of Mexico, and is married and has two children, a daughter age 3 and a son 11 months old. Her parents are also from the state of Mexico, and her mother is a vendor; her father currently works in construction. Paula has seven siblings (four brothers and three sisters), all older than she is. One sister is an ambulant vendor in Mexico City, and another sister is an ambulant vendor in Nayarit. One sister and one brother are vendors in El Caribe, the colonia where Paula lives in Cabo San Lucas. One aunt is a vendor on the marina, as is Paula. Paula came to Cabos San Lucas 10 years ago with her family; they joined cousins of hers, and more cousins have arrived since then. Paula has also worked as a vendor in Hermosillo, Sonora, in Chihuahua, and in her home state of Mexico, beginning at the age of 10. She works the five days on which cruise ships arrive, selling sombreros that she buys; she earns US$30 on a good day, nothing on a bad day. She has applied for a license but has been told that none are available. She likes the fact that she can work the hours she wishes but complains about police and tax collector harassment. She says that the police sometimes take the vendors in and impose a fine of 300–500 pesos and the tax collectors confiscate all the merchandise. Having finished primary school, she would like to study to be a secretary and find part-time work so that she can spend time with her son and daughter. Her husband works in construction, an occupation that has gone into decline since the economic recession began, and she has previously held jobs in a hotel and in a clothing store. She lives on her own lot in El Caribe.</p>
<p>Lupe is 50 years old and comes from Michoacán. She is married and has five children ranging in age from 15 to 28. All of her six siblings (a brother and five sisters) are younger than she is. Her husband came to Los Cabos first and then brought her 15 years ago. She has worked at least 13 years as a vendor and does so on the beach every day, selling T-shirts imprinted with the logo “Los Cabos.” She receives about 25 pesos for each T-shirt she sells and earns 300–400 pesos on a good day and nothing on a bad day. Her husband and a brother-in-law are also vendors on the beach and also sell T-shirts, which all three buy from a retailer (<italic>comerciante</italic>). One of her sons is also a vendor. She likes vending because she can work the hours she wishes but complains about being in the sun, especially in the summer. She has a vendor’s license. She finished three years of primary school and would like to have studied to be a public accountant. If she were not a vendor, she would seek work as a maid (<italic>recamarista</italic>) in a hotel. She has never done any work for money other than vending. She has her own house in Lomas del Sol.</p>
<p>Julia is a 28-year-old married woman from Guerrero who speaks Nahuatl as well as Spanish and a little English. She has four children ranging in ages from 4 months to 12 years. Julia has never attended school but would like to learn to read and write and work in a beauty shop (<italic>estética</italic>). All four of her brothers and three sisters are vendors in Cabo San Lucas. She arrived in Cabo San Lucas only two months ago but has been a vendor for 20 years, previously in Puerto Peñasco, Sonora. Relatives of her husband were in Cabo San Lucas when they arrived, and her siblings have joined her here since then. She sells sunglasses on the beach, earning 20 pesos for each pair and going home with 200 pesos on a good day. She also braids hair. She works every day but has no license. Julia likes the fact that she can set her own hours but complains about working in the sun. She has worked only as a vendor. Her husband makes plaster jugs. She rents a house in El Caribe.</p>
<p>Isabel is a 25-year-old married vendor from Guerrero who speaks Nahuatl as well as Spanish and a little English. She has two children, aged 2 and 4. Her five sisters all work as vendors in Cabo San Lucas. Her father brought the family to Los Cabos 15 years ago, and she has been a vendor for 10 years. She sells bean necklaces on the beach, earning about 20 pesos for each one and receiving 300 pesos on a good day and 50 pesos or nothing on a bad day. She has a vendor’s license and also belongs to a union. (A number of Mexican unions maintain patron-client relationships with the vendors, helping them to get vendor’s licenses in exchange for their political support.) Her husband is also a vendor. She has finished primary school and would like to study English. Her preferred job would be taking care of children, including her own. Isabel enjoys working by the sea but finds working under the sun the most difficult thing about her job. She complains that sometimes she sells very little. She lives in a house she and her husband are building in El Caribe.</p>
<p>Amalia, a 38-year-old married woman with one son, aged 15, is from Oaxaca. She speaks Zapotec as well as Spanish and has graduated from junior high school. She has been in Cabo San Lucas almost five years. Her husband joined a cousin of his there and then returned to Oaxaca to bring her back with him. Her husband used to be a vendor but now works in the linen service in a hotel. Amalia once worked in a hotel as a cook and has been working as a vendor for only a year. She sells flutes in the shape of animals and earns about 100 pesos on a good day. She enjoys being a vendor, finding no problems with it. Amalia works on the marina without a license on the days on which the cruise ships arrive. She would like to learn computer skills. She feels little contentment in Cabo because she is so far away from her family. She and her husband have a lot in Cabo Fierro.</p>
<p>Elena is a single 20-year-old vendor from Queretaro who speaks Otomí as well as Spanish and a little English. She is the youngest of eight siblings. Two of her sisters and one of her brothers are vendors in Cabo San Lucas. She has only been there a week this time and will stay for less than a month but has come and gone—joining her siblings each time—for the past seven years. Elena sells dolls that she herself makes on the marina, earning about 15 pesos each and receiving 600 pesos on a good day and 100 pesos and nothing on a bad day. She is financing her high school education with the money she earns. She has worked previously as a cook’s helper in a restaurant in her hometown in Queretaro and would like to work in a restaurant as a cook. She wants to continue her studies, however, and is interested in teaching as a career. Elena does not especially like vending, because the police harass her, but she says that it is a way to earn money quickly. She lives with her sisters in Lomas del Sol.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>The role of the informal economy in economic development is subject to debate in the literature. On the one hand, informal sector workers are perceived as emerging entrepreneurs whose economic activities, if not restrained, would be beneficial to their families and to the economy as a whole (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0094582X12454562">De Soto, 1989</xref>). On the other hand, the informal economy is seen as a kind of holding tank for the reserve army of labor created by capitalist development (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0094582X12454562">Portes and Walton, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0094582X12454562">Robinson, 2008</xref>). Although there is evidence sustaining both of these approaches, one cannot ignore the social, economic, and personal costs of engaging in some informal income-generating activities.</p>
<p>The women vendors who were interviewed were generally happy with their work. All but one, however, reported that they earned nothing on bad days—a situation that would not be found in formal employment—and they lack the social-security provisions that are attached to formal-sector jobs. Thus they are marginalized in terms of their overall earnings and their lack of a social wage. They are also marginalized in terms of their educational aspirations. All but four expressed an interest in further education, and, given the economic crisis in Mexico, there is little possibility that most will be able to achieve this or, in its absence, obtain formal employment. The women are also marginalized by their residential segregation: all live in squatter settlements that are marked by extreme poverty (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0094582X12454562">Wilson, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0094582X12454562">n.d.</xref>). Their work satisfaction comes down to two main factors: (1) freedom to set their own hours (to avoid factory-like discipline and to be able to care for their children, some of whom come with them to the beach or marina) and (2) access to some earnings.</p>
<p>Almost all of the vendors had migrated to Los Cabos from another state; the only vendor from Baja California Sur was born to parents who had migrated to La Paz from Guerrero. Fifteen, all from other states, speak an indigenous language and may be marginalized by the racism directed at indigenous people. Migration is the overwhelming cause of the rapid population growth in the municipio, and most migrants have been pulled in the hope of employment in the burgeoning tourist industry. Although many would like to work in the formal sector of this industry, the opportunities there are limited. The great majority of these women, although expressing positive feelings about their work, would like to find alternative jobs in the formal sector. With the economic recession that is correlated with a decline in tourist numbers, formal employment opportunities in Mexican tourist centers are drying up. Interviews of male vendors conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0094582X12454562">Wilson (n.d.)</xref> show that some of them had previously worked in construction or as hotel employees.</p>
<p>Women may suffer discrimination in the tourism sector, but being able to earn some income may make them better able to combat traditional expectations under a patriarchal gender regime and help them to attain greater power within the family and within the society. Almost all of the women we interviewed wanted more education, which they seemed to equate with greater success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0094582X12454562">Wilson, n.d.</xref>). More education might enable them to take a greater part in economic development efforts, whether in tourism centers or in their communities of origin. Nongovernmental organizations, the private sector, and governmental agencies could help them to acquire the skills that might lead either to their employment in the formal economy or to better outcomes from their self-employment by, for example, providing instruction in English to enable them to interact more effectively with the primarily English-speaking tourists, encouraging the development of buying cooperatives, and providing credit. The expansion of child care facilities would be useful for women with small children who have no relatives to help them; the existing day care center for children of poor working mothers can take in only about 200 children at a time.</p>
