<sec id="section1-0363546512443807">
<title>Background:</title>
<p>Nonoperative treatment for humeral medial epicondylar fragmentation in baseball players, involving prohibition and limitation of throwing, has been reported to give good results. However, in some cases, such nonoperative treatment fails to yield an acceptable outcome.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0363546512443807">
<title>Hypothesis:</title>
<p>In nonoperative treatment for patients with medial epicondylar fragmentation, achievement of bone union of the fragmentation provides better clinical outcomes compared with those of patients with delayed bone union or nonunion.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0363546512443807">
<title>Study Design:</title>
<p>Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0363546512443807">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>Fifty-five young baseball players with medial epicondylar fragmentation before epiphyseal closure, aged between 9 and 13 years (mean, 11.0 years), participated in this study. They belonged to baseball teams in a youth league and underwent nonoperative treatment involving prohibition of throwing for an average of 2.0 months and subsequent limitation of throwing for an average of 1.8 months. We investigated whether achievement of bone union of the fragmentation was associated with better clinical outcomes.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0363546512443807">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>Bone union was achieved in 40 (73%) of 55 participants at 6 months after initial presentation, 31 (76%) of 41 participants at 1 year, and 32 (94%) of 34 participants at 2 years. Elbow pain was present in 7 participants (17%) at 1 year after initial presentation and in 6 participants (18%) at 2 years. At 1 year after initial presentation, statistical analysis showed that most participants with elbow pain had significant fragmentation (<italic>P</italic> = .0055). At 2 years after initial presentation, there was no significant relationship between elbow pain and medial epicondylar fragmentation (<italic>P</italic> = .32). Statistical analysis also showed that, at both 6 months and 1 year after initial presentation, bone union was significantly delayed in most participants who had not accepted nonoperative treatment and consequently resumed throwing vigorously before bone union.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0363546512443807">
<title>Conclusion:</title>
<p>At 1 year after initial presentation, bone union of the medial epicondylar fragmentation was correlated with a decreased prevalence of elbow pain. At 6 months and 1 year after initial presentation, delayed bone union of the medial epicondylar fragmentation was associated with resumption of throwing at maximum strength before bone union had occurred.</p>

<body>
<p>Elbow injuries including medial epicondylar fragmentation are common throwing injuries in athletes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546512443807">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546512443807">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546512443807">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546512443807">7</xref></sup> In young baseball players with medial epicondylar fragmentation before epiphyseal closure, nonoperative treatment involving prohibition and limitation of throwing has been reported to give good results.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546512443807">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546512443807">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546512443807">8</xref></sup> However, some reports have indicated that displacement of fragments larger than 4 mm leads to delayed bone union,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546512443807">8</xref></sup> for which surgery is sometimes indicated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546512443807">12</xref></sup> Thus, the optimum type of treatment for medial epicondylar fragmentation has remained unclear.</p>
<p>There have been few studies of the long-term outcome of medial epicondylar fragmentation after nonoperative treatment. Kawano et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546512443807">5</xref></sup> reported the outcome for 19 patients who had radiographic abnormalities of the medial epicondyle, with an average follow-up period of 50 months. They found that bone union was achieved in 17 of the patients, although the frequency of elbow pain was not addressed. Matsuura et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546512443807">8</xref></sup> reported the outcome for 20 patients who had radiographic abnormalities of the medial epicondyle, with an average follow-up period of 45 months. They found that bone union was achieved in 18 of the patients and that elbow pain was present in 5 of those 18, whereas both patients with nonunion had elbow pain.</p>
<p>The aim of the present study was to investigate the outcome of medial epicondylar fragmentation before epiphyseal closure in young baseball players undergoing nonoperative treatment and to investigate whether achievement of bone union of the fragmentation provides better clinical outcomes.</p>
<sec id="section7-0363546512443807" sec-type="materials|methods">
<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<p>Institutional review board approval was obtained, and informed consent was obtained from the parents of the participants. The study participants were 59 young baseball players who had diagnosed medial epicondylar fragmentation before epiphyseal closure at elbow examinations performed in the fall after the end of the baseball season. They were all followed for more than 6 months after presentation. Among these 59 players, 4 were excluded because of complications, including osteochondritis dissecans of the capitellum in 2, delayed closure of the olecranon growth plate in 1, and ulnar neuritis in 1, leaving 55 players for retrospective review from 2001 to 2008. They all belonged to teams in a youth baseball league and ranged in age from 10 to 13 years (mean, 11.2 years). The duration of their active participation in baseball ranged from 0.2 to 4.5 years (mean, 2.4 years). The number of participants who had played as a pitcher in the games was 23. The remaining 32 participants had not played as a pitcher. The period from onset of symptoms to initial presentation ranged from 0 to 24 months (mean, 7 months).</p>
<p>Anteroposterior radiographs of the elbow when flexed at 45° were obtained to investigate the size of the fragment and the gap between the fragment and the bony humerus. As described in Muramoto’s report,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546512443807">9</xref></sup> we investigated the bone age of the medial epicondyle based on its anteroposterior radiographic appearance. This is based on a 7-point scoring system for the ossification centers of the medial epicondyle, ranging from 0 (no appearance of apophysis) to 7 (complete epiphyseal closure).</p>
<p>All participants underwent nonoperative treatment involving prohibition and limitation of throwing in principle until bone union had been achieved. All other baseball activities, such as running, batting, and fielding (except throwing), were allowed. All participants were also advised to throw on the noninjured side. Throwing was prohibited until elbow pain and tenderness of the medial epicondyle disappeared, and the participants were then gradually permitted to perform limited throwing. In brief, when limited throwing was resumed, we advised all participants to throw over distances between first base and second base to throw at about 30% of maximum strength and then to increase the distance and strength of throwing gradually. After bone union had been achieved, we allowed the participants to throw over distances between first base and third base and at maximum strength. We considered bone union to have been achieved when the following 3 conditions were met: (1) appearance of definite continuity between the fragment and the medial epicondyle by radiography or ultrasonography, (2) no tenderness of the medial epicondyle, and (3) a negative result on the moving valgus stress test.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0363546512443807">10</xref></sup> Sixteen participants had thrown on the noninjured side. Forty-two participants had accepted our advice regarding prohibition and limitation of throwing (acceptance of the treatment), whereas 13 had not accepted our advice (nonacceptance of the treatment). The mean duration of throwing prohibition was 2.0 months (range, 0-6 months), and that of subsequent limitation of throwing was 1.8 months (range, 0-6 months). The mean duration of throwing at maximum strength was 3.8 months (range, 1-8 months). The mean observation period was 35 months (range, 6-92 months).</p>
<p>Elbow re-examination was performed in 55 participants (100%) at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 months after initial presentation. Elbow re-examination was also performed in 41 participants (75%) at 1 year after initial presentation and in 34 (62%) at 2 years. All these participants had continued to play baseball from initial presentation to the elbow re-examination. In the re-examination at 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years after initial presentation, we examined elbow pain and throwing ability and performed physical examinations including tenderness of the medial epicondyle and the moving valgus stress test. We also performed ultrasonography or radiography to assess the condition of the medial epicondylar fragmentation. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0363546512443807">Figures 1</xref> to 3, the findings were classified into 3 groups: no fragmentation group (bone union), recurrence group (recurrence after bone union), and delayed union group (delayed bone union or nonunion). In addition, we investigated elbow injuries other than medial epicondylar fragmentation.</p>

<p>Among 25 participants who had been observed for more than 3 years after initial presentation, 23 (92%) had answered our questionnaire. Of these 23 participants, 18 had continued to play baseball, and the remaining 5 had changed from baseball to another sport because of a change in their sports preference. For the 18 participants who had continued to play baseball for more than 3 years after initial presentation, the mean observation period was 62 months (range, 36-92 months). We investigated these participants’ elbow pain, difficulty in throwing because of elbow pain, and difficulty in pitching performance, including vigorous pitching, long-distance throwing (distance between home base and outfield), and pitching control. We also investigated these participants’ self-evaluation of their elbow condition during the prior season using a visual analog scale (best elbow condition, 100 points; worst, 0 point).</p>
<p>At 6 months after initial presentation, we investigated factors contributing to delayed union. As the candidates for the factors, the period between the onset of symptoms and initial presentation, playing position, size of the fragment, gap between the fragment and the bony humerus, bone age, the period until resumption of throwing at maximum strength, throwing on the noninjured side, and treatment compliance were investigated.</p>
<p>At both 1 and 2 years after initial presentation, we investigated the relationship between elbow pain and medial epicondylar fragmentation, the relationship between the period until resumption of throwing at maximum strength and medial epicondylar fragmentation, and the relationship between treatment compliance and medial epicondylar fragmentation. We also investigated the relationship between the outcome at elbow re-examination at 2 years and symptoms beyond 3 years after initial presentation.</p>

<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>In investigating the factors associated with delayed union or nonunion of the medial epicondylar fragmentation at 6 months after initial presentation, statistical analysis of the data was carried out using the Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test and Fisher exact test. Differences at <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05 were considered to be significant.

<title>Results</title>
<p>Anteroposterior radiographs of the elbow when flexed at 45° showed that the mean size of the fragment was 4.2 mm (range, 1.0-9.4 mm). In the anteroposterior radiographs, the mean gap between the fragment and the bony humerus was 1.3 mm (range, 0.5-3 mm) and was less than 1 mm in 42 participants and more than 1 mm in 13. The bone age score for the medial epicondyle ranged from 3 to 6 points (mean, 4.3 points).</p>
<p>Among the 55 participants who underwent elbow re-examination at 6 months after initial presentation, 9 (16%) had elbow pain during throwing (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0363546512443807">Table 1</xref>). With regard to throwing ability, 51 (93%) participants had thrown at maximum strength, and 4 (7%) had thrown with limitation. The results of assessment of fragmentation showed no fragmentation in 40 participants (73%) and delayed union in 15 (27%). No elbow injuries other than medial epicondylar fragmentation were found.</p>

With regard to throwing ability, 26 (76%) participants had thrown at maximum strength, and 8 (24%) had thrown with limitation. The results of assessment of fragmentation showed no fragmentation in 32 participants (94%), recurrence in 0 (0%), and delayed union in 2 (6%). Elbow injuries other than medial epicondylar fragmentation included suspected medial collateral ligament injury in 2 participants, ulnar neuritis in 2, and osteochondritis dissecans of the capitellum in 1. Among 6 participants with elbow pain, 1 (17%) had elbow pain caused by the fragmentation, and 5 (83%) had elbow pain caused by elbow injuries other than fragmentation.</p>
<p>In the 18 participants who had continued to play baseball for more than 3 years after initial presentation, the symptoms included elbow pain in 4 (22%) and impaired pitching performance in 6 (33%). The latter 6 participants included difficulty with vigorous pitching in 1 (6%), difficulty with long-distance throwing (distance between home base and outfield) in 3 (17%), and difficulty with pitching control in 2 (11%). Self-evaluation score of the participants’ elbow condition during the prior season using a visual analog scale was an average of 92 ± 11 points.</p>

<title>Investigation of Factors Contributing to Delayed Union at 6 Months After Initial Presentation</title>
<p>At 6 months after initial presentation, bone union had been achieved in 40 (73%) of the 55 participants. We compared the possible factors contributing to delayed union or nonunion between the 40 participants with bone union at 6 months and the 15 participants without bone union. This revealed no differences between the participants with and without bone union with regard to the period between the onset of symptoms and initial presentation, playing position, size of the fragment, the gap between the fragment and the bony humerus, bone age, the period until resumption of throwing at maximum strength, and throwing on the noninjured side (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0363546512443807">Table 2</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In the present study, bone union was achieved at 6 months after initial presentation in 40 (73%) of 55 participants who underwent nonoperative treatment involving prohibition of throwing for an average of 2.0 months and subsequent limitation of throwing for an average of 1.8 months. In most of the participants who had not accepted this nonoperative treatment and consequently resumed throwing vigorously before bone union had occurred, bone union was significantly delayed at 6 months. These results suggested that delayed bone union was correlated with resumption of vigorous throwing before bone union.</p>
<p>In the present study, bone union was achieved in 76% of the participants at 1 year after initial presentation, and medial epicondylar fragmentation was found to be present in 5 (71%) of the 7 participants with elbow pain. Significantly, statistical analysis showed that most participants with elbow pain had fragmentation at 1 year after initial presentation. These results suggested that elbow pain was associated with fragmentation at 1 year after initial presentation. This indicates that bone union of the medial epicondylar fragmentation is associated with a decreased prevalence of elbow pain.</p>
<p>In the present study, bone union was also achieved in 94% of the participants at 2 years after initial presentation. At 2 years after initial presentation, medial epicondylar fragmentation was found to be present in 1 (17%) of the 6 participants with elbow pain. There was no significant relationship between elbow pain and medial epicondylar fragmentation at 2 years after initial presentation. These results suggested that, at 2 years after initial presentation, bone union of the medial epicondylar fragmentation may not be associated with a decreased prevalence of elbow pain.</p>
<p>At 1 year after initial presentation, among 7 participants with elbow pain, 5 (71%) had elbow pain caused by the fragmentation, and 2 (29%) had elbow pain caused by elbow injuries other than fragmentation. At 2 years after initial presentation, among 6 participants with elbow pain, 1 (17%) had elbow pain caused by the fragmentation, and 5 (83%) had elbow pain caused by elbow injuries other than fragmentation. Thus, at 1 year after initial presentation, most participants with elbow pain had fragmentation, whereas at 2 years, most participants with elbow pain had elbow injuries other than fragmentation. Numbers of participants who had no elbow pain without bony union were 5 (50%) of the 10 participants with fragmentation at 1 year after initial presentation and 1 (50%) of the 2 participants with fragmentation at 2 years.</p>
<p>With regard to the relationship between the period until resumption of throwing at maximum strength and medial epicondylar fragmentation, there was no relationship between the period until resumption of throwing at maximum strength earlier than 4 months after initial presentation and bone union within 1 year and 2 years. With regard to the relationship between treatment compliance and medial epicondylar fragmentation, at 1 year after initial presentation, bone union was significantly delayed in most participants who had not accepted nonoperative treatment and consequently resumed throwing vigorously before bone union. These results suggest that resumption of throwing at maximum strength before bone union has occurred may lead to delayed bone union or nonunion of the fragmentation at 1 year after initial presentation. On the other hand, at 2 years after initial presentation, there was a slight relationship between treatment compliance and medial epicondylar fragmentation, although no statistical significance could be obtained in this study. Further study will be needed to investigate the 2-year follow-up outcome of nonoperative treatment for medial epicondylar fragmentation.</p>
<p>At more than 3 years after initial presentation, among 13 participants who had shown no fragmentation at 2 years, 15% had elbow pain, and 38% had impaired pitching performance. Self-evaluation score of the participants’ elbow condition at more than 3 years after initial presentation was an average of 91 points for those with no fragmentation at 2 years after initial presentation, 97 points for those with delayed union at 2 years, and 90 points for those who had elbow injuries other than fragmentation at 2 years. These results suggest that, at more than 3 years after initial presentation, elbow injuries other than fragmentation are more likely to be present than fragmentation, resulting in a lower self-evaluation score.</p>
<p>This study had some limitations. The number of participants for whom observation was not possible was 14 (25%) at 1 year, 21 (38%) at 2 years, and 15 (27%) at more than 3 years after initial presentation. The participants for whom observation was not possible may affect the rate of elbow pain, bone union, acceptance of treatment, and so on. All cases of fragmentation were detected at elbow examinations performed in the fall once a year after the end of the baseball season. In participants who had been observed for more than 3 years, the cause of elbow pain was not always clear. In previous studies, nonoperative treatment involving rehabilitation aimed at improvement of tightness of the scapulothoracic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546512443807">11</xref></sup> or core and lower extremity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546512443807">4</xref></sup> has been recommended. This investigation did not address the use of this type of nonoperative treatment. Further investigation of the results of nonoperative treatment will be needed to compare simple prohibition and limitation of throwing recommended by us with prohibition and limitation supplemented with rehabilitation.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Fifty-five young baseball players with medial epicondylar fragmentation underwent nonoperative treatment involving prohibition of throwing for an average of 2.0 months and subsequent limitation of throwing for an average of 1.8 months. Elbow pain was present in 17% at 1 year after initial presentation, 18% at 2 years, and 22% at more than 3 years. Bone union was achieved in 73% at 6 months after initial presentation, 76% at 1 year, and 94% at 2 years. At 1 year after initial presentation, bone union of the medial epicondylar fragmentation was associated with a decreased prevalence of elbow pain. At 6 months and 1 year after initial presentation, delayed bone union of the medial epicondylar fragmentation was associated with resumption of throwing at maximum strength before bone union had occurred.</p>
