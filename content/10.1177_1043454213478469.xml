<abstract>
<p>This study examined psychological distress levels, their differences across groups based on sociodemographic and medical variables, and risk factors for significant distress in adolescent and young adult childhood cancer survivors in Korea. Participants consisted of 223 Korean survivors of childhood cancer between 15 and 39 years of age. Psychological distress was measured using the Brief Symptom Inventory–18. A series of <italic>t</italic> tests, binomial proportion tests, analysis of variance, and univariable and multivariable logistic regressions were used. One fifth of the participants were classified as psychologically distressed. Significant levels of psychological distress were associated with age, economic status, and time since diagnosis. The results indicate a greater need for monitoring and follow-up care related to psychological health in childhood cancer survivors. Outreach and collaboration with health care professionals to increase mental health referrals could provide opportunities to address the needs of childhood cancer survivors in terms of their psychological well-being.</p>

<body>
<p>The 5-year survival rate for childhood cancer has exceeded 80% in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1043454213478469">Howlader et al., 2011</xref>). Although childhood cancer survival rates in other nations are slightly lower than in the United States, the number of survivors of childhood cancer has increased around the world. Korea is one of the countries where survival rates have been rapidly increasing, moving from 63% to 76% in the past decade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1043454213478469">Korea Central Cancer Registry, 2011</xref>). As these cancer survivors begin to participate fully in the community, addressing the various aspects of cancer survivorship and ensuring the survivor’s quality of life become significant issues beyond improving medical care and survival rates in cancer patients.</p>
<p>When these childhood cancer survivors become adolescents and young adults (AYA) and make the transition from childhood to adulthood, they are likely to face unique challenges resulting from their cancer history. For example, AYA survivors reported a wide range of physical late effects that emerged long after childhood cancer treatment ended in both the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1043454213478469">Berg, Neufeld, Harvey, Downes, &amp; Hayashi, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1043454213478469">Dieluweit et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1043454213478469">Stein, Syrjala, &amp; Andrykowski, 2008</xref>) and Korea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1043454213478469">Han et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Psychological distress is a significant issue for survivors of childhood cancer while managing the challenges they face in every part of their lives during their survivorship. According to the studies conducted in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1043454213478469">Brown, Madan-Swain, &amp; Lambert, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1043454213478469">Hobbie et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1043454213478469">Hudson et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1043454213478469">Rourke, Hobbie, Schwartz, &amp; Kazak, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1043454213478469">Wiener et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1043454213478469">Zebrack et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1043454213478469">Zeltzer et al., 2008</xref>), approximately 10% to 20% of survivors consistently reported psychological difficulties. There are increasingly empirical findings of factors associated with psychological distress in childhood cancer survivors. Previous research has shown that sociodemographic characteristics—such as gender, educational level, income attainment, marital status, and employment—and medical characteristics—such as cancer type, age at diagnosis, medical treatment, and exposure to intensive chemotherapy—are associated with psychological distress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1043454213478469">Kazak et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1043454213478469">Langeveld, Grootenhuis, Voûte, de Haan, &amp; van den Bos, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1043454213478469">Zebrack et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1043454213478469">Zebrack et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1043454213478469">Zeltzer et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1043454213478469">Zeltzer et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The bulk of research on psychological outcomes among childhood cancer survivors has been conducted in the United States, with little attention paid to diverse ethnic groups. To date, only a handful of studies have been conducted in Asia (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1043454213478469">Chou &amp; Hunter, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1043454213478469">Ozono et al., 2010</xref>), making it difficult to generalize the findings to cross-national groups of survivors. Only by studying different groups can we better understand the psychological well-being of cancer survivors in diverse contexts and make current knowledge applicable to those in other countries. This research is expected to help in understanding the growing numbers of survivors of childhood cancer in Korea and to expand the body of literature on the quality of life of childhood cancer survivors by examining the psychological health of long-term survivors in unstudied groups.</p>
<p>The current study has three aims: (1) to examine overall prevalence of psychological distress among AYA survivors of childhood cancer in Korea, (2) to examine differences in the levels of psychological distress based on sociodemographic and medical characteristics, and (3) to identify correlates of the presence of significant levels of psychological distress.</p>

<title>Participants</title>
<p>Participants eligible for the current study were cancer survivors who were diagnosed before the age of 19 years, were between 15 and 39 years old at the time of the study, and had completed cancer treatment. The sample for the current study consisted of 223 childhood cancer survivors. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1043454213478469">Table 1</xref> shows their sociodemographic and medical information. The proportion of male (59%) and female (41%) participants were similar, and their ages ranged from 15 to 38 years (mean [<italic>M</italic>] = 21.92 years, standard deviation [SD] = 4.69). Most of the participants had never been married (97.3%), had less than a college degree (67.6%), were not in the workforce (82.4%), and had a stable economic status (71.4%). Many of the respondents (63.2%) reported having a religious affiliation. Although more than half of the respondents lived in metropolitan areas (58.1%), adequate representations of midsized city or rural areas (41.9%) were obtained. The most prominent type of cancer in the study was hematological cancer (71.7%), followed by solid or soft tissue tumors (14.6%) and central nervous system (CNS) or brain tumors (13.7%). Thirty-one survivors (14.2%) reported experiencing a cancer recurrence. The age at diagnosis ranged from 0 to 18 years (<italic>M</italic> = 9.91 years, SD = 4.39), and the time since diagnosis ranged from 2 to 29 years (<italic>M</italic> = 11.99 years, SD = 5.91).</p>

<title>Procedures</title>
<p>Participants were recruited in Korea through study announcements on the websites of advocacy foundations and support groups for cancer survivors and parents between June 2010 and November 2010. Approximately 120 cancer survivors contacted the researchers after seeing the study announcements, and potential participants were asked to inform any friends who were eligible for the study. This snowball sampling method was chosen as the best strategy because cancer survivors in Korea are stigmatized and hard to reach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1043454213478469">Spreen, 1992</xref>). A detailed information sheet and a 15-minute structured questionnaire were distributed to the potential participants via mail or e-mail. Participants were given a written information sheet; written consent was not required. A total of 227 self-administered surveys were obtained and 98% (n = 223) were included in this study (2 respondents did not meet the study inclusion criteria, and 2 respondents did not complete the survey and were excluded from the analysis). The study was approved by the institutional review board (IRB) of University of Southern California. Each participant received a bookstore gift certificate, valued at approximately $5, for his or her participation in the study.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1043454213478469">
<title>Measures</title>
<p>The English version of the questionnaire was first translated into Korean and then translated back into English by a bilingual–bicultural translator with an excellent knowledge of Korean and English. The translated Korean questionnaire was reviewed by a Korean elementary school language teacher to ensure that the adolescent participants understood the questions. Minor discrepancies involving word choice were thoroughly discussed among the researchers and appropriately amended.</p>
<sec id="section5-1043454213478469">
<title>Psychological distress</title>
<p>Psychological distress was assessed with the Brief Symptom Inventory–18 (BSI-18), an instrument designed to screen for somatization, depression, and anxiety in medical and community populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1043454213478469">Derogatis, 2000</xref>). Respondents were asked about the degree to which they felt bothered by each symptom (ie, somatization, depression, and anxiety) during the previous 7 days. Responses for each item were scored on a 5-point Likert-type scale, ranging from 0 (<italic>never</italic>) to 4 (<italic>extremely</italic>). According to the BSI-18 manual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1043454213478469">Derogatis, 2000</xref>), missing items should be imputed using the average score of the nonmissing items and rounded to the nearest integer. The raw score of 18 items was summed for the Global Severity Index (GSI) for a total range of 0 to 72, with higher scores indicating higher levels of psychological distress. The GSI scores were then transformed to <italic>T</italic> scores (<italic>M</italic> = 50, SD = 10) by gender-specific community norms, and respondents were classified as having significant psychological distress if their <italic>T</italic> scores were equal to or greater than a score of 63 (90th percentile; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1043454213478469">Derogatis, 2000</xref>). Cronbach’s α’ s for our data were as follows: somatization, α = .70; depression, α = .78; anxiety, α = .78; and GSI, α = .89.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-1043454213478469">
<title>Sociodemographic and medical variables</title>
<p>Participants reported their sociodemographic information, which included age, gender, marital status, education, employment, residential area, economic status, and religion; and medical information, including type of cancer at diagnosis, cancer recurrence, age at diagnosis, and time since diagnosis. Adolescent participants were able to discuss diagnostic information with their parents to obtain the most accurate information.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1043454213478469">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>This study used 3 steps in the analyses. First, one-sample <italic>t</italic> tests and binomial proportion tests were performed to compare survivors’ average GSI <italic>T</italic> scores with the mean <italic>T</italic> score of 50 and to compare the proportion of the survivor’s reporting significant levels of psychological distress with the expected proportion of 10% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1043454213478469">Derogatis, 2000</xref>) on the basis of the US community norms (aim 1). Second, a series of analysis of variance tests were conducted to compare mean differences in GSI and the 3 domains of distress symptoms (ie, somatization, depression, and anxiety) with sociodemographic and medical characteristics (aim 2). All of the sociodemographic variables (age, gender, marital status, education, employment, residential area, economic status, and religion) and medical variables (diagnosed cancer type, cancer recurrence, age at diagnosis, and time since diagnosis) were included as categorical variables in the analyses because previous studies suggest that such factors may play a role in the experience of psychological distress. Marital status was not included in the analyses because of its low variability in our sample (ie, more than 97% of respondents had never married). For the analyses, age measured in years was categorized into 3 groups (adolescents aged 15-18 years, emerging adults aged 19-25 years, and young adults aged 26-39 years) based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1043454213478469">Erikson’s (1968)</xref> developmental stage of adolescence and young adulthood and the unique developmental stage of emerging adulthood proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1043454213478469">Arnett (2004)</xref>. Although in the United States, emerging adults are generally referred to as those between 18 and 25 years of age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1043454213478469">Arnett, 2004</xref>), it was defined as 19 to 25 years of age in this study based on Korea’s educational system and related policies. Residential area was measured as 3 categories: metropolitan area, midsized city, and small city. Economic status was self-rated for 4 categories and dichotomized into stable (“not wealthy but stable” and “wealthy”) and unstable (“inadequate funds for basic goods” and “adequate funds for basic goods but inadequate for comfortable living”) circumstances. Religion was measured as 5 categories (eg, no religion, Protestant, Buddhist, Catholic, and other) and dichotomized into having religion and no religion. Bonferroni ad hoc comparisons were tested as follow-up analyses. Third, univariable and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed using presence or absence of significant levels of psychological distress (dichotomized variable based on GSI <italic>T</italic> score ≥ 63) as the dependent variable to identify its correlates (aim 3). The multivariate model included only the covariates that were significant at the bivariate level. Statistical significance was evaluated at α = .05. All data were analyzed using SPSS version 16.0 for Windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL).</p>

<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1043454213478469">Table 2</xref>, levels of psychological distress differed depending on the time since diagnosis. Survivors who were diagnosed more than 20 years earlier reported significantly higher levels of psychological distress across all the subscales than those who were diagnosed 10 to 14 years earlier. Those diagnosed with cancer more than 20 years ago also reported higher scores in somatization than those diagnosed 15 to 19 years earlier and higher levels of depression than those who were diagnosed fewer than 10 years earlier.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1043454213478469">Table 3</xref> shows correlates of psychological distress by univariable and multivariable logistic regression. Univariable logistic regression indicated that age and economic status were significant correlates of psychological distress. Emerging adults (odds ratio = 3.79; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.26-11.40), young adults (odds ratio = 6.50; 95% CI = 1.95-21.63), and those with an unstable economic status (odds ratio = 2.36; 95% CI = 1.20-4.66) were more likely to be psychologically distressed than adolescents and those with a stable economic status. There was no association between psychological distress and gender, education, employment, residential area, or religion. Multivariate logistic regression confirmed an increased risk of experiencing psychological distress among childhood cancer survivors with an unstable economic status when controlling for age and time since diagnosis (odds ratio = 2.58; 95% CI = 1.20-5.54).</p>

<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1043454213478469">Table 3</xref>, there was a significant association between psychological distress and time since diagnosis. Survivors diagnosed more than 20 years earlier (odds ratio = 4.25; 95% CI = 1.66-10.9) were at a higher risk of being distressed than those diagnosed fewer than 10 years earlier. The distress prevalence rate varied from 50% of those diagnosed more than 20 years earlier to 8.1% of those diagnosed 10 to 14 years earlier. Cancer type, age at diagnosis, and recurrence were not related to psychological distress. Although cancer type was not a statistically significant correlate, survivors diagnosed with CNS or brain tumors tended to be less distressed than those diagnosed with other types of cancers. The prevalence of psychological distress was 31.2% for solid or soft tissue tumors, 21.7% for hematological cancer, and 6.7% for CNS or brain tumors. Multivariate logistic regression confirmed an increased risk of being psychologically distressed for survivors diagnosed more than 20 years earlier compared with survivors diagnosed fewer than 10 years earlier when controlling for age and economic status (odds ratio = 3.67; 95% CI = 1.05 -12.88).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, one fifth of the survivors (20.6%) reported significant levels of psychological distress. The study found higher proportions of both male and female Korean survivors classified as psychologically distressed (18.5% of male and 23.9% of female) compared with the US norm population. A higher prevalence of psychological distress among Korean childhood cancer survivors may be related to higher general rates of distress symptoms in Korea relative to the United States. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1043454213478469">Cho, Nam, and Suh (1998)</xref> found higher rates of depressive symptoms in a nationwide sample of Korean adults than in most studies describing US populations. Sociocultural factors, such as intense competition for limited resources in Korean society, may partially explain the higher rates of psychological distress among AYA cancer survivors in Korea. For example, the enrollment rate in higher education among Koreans is one of the highest in the world, and the education system is hierarchically structured (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1043454213478469">Kim &amp; Lee, 2006</xref>). Such an environment may lead to Korean AYA stress caused by educational competition. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1043454213478469">Park, Heo, Subramanian, Kawachi, and Oh (2012)</xref> found that low academic achievement was associated with the experience of depression among Korean adolescents. Considering the reported difficulties among childhood cancer survivors in school attendance, reentry, and peer relationships during and after treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1043454213478469">Kim &amp; Yi, 2012</xref>), Korean AYA survivors are likely to face double the challenges in achieving expected levels of education. Additionally, Korean cancer survivors may experience specific stressors such as discrimination at school and work because of misconceptions about fatality associated with cancer and that cancer survivors will have low energy and poor work performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1043454213478469">Kim &amp; Yi, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1043454213478469">Park, Park, Kim, Lee, &amp; Hahm, 2010</xref>). A lack of educational programs about cancer and limited survivorship care services in Korea for survivors and their families may add to the challenges faced by Korean cancer survivors.</p>
<p>Psychological distress in the sample of Korean survivors seems to vary based on their age, gender, economic status, and time since diagnosis. Consistent with previous investigations of cancer survivor populations, sociodemographic characteristics, such as older age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1043454213478469">Michel, Rebholz, von der Weid, Bergstraesser, &amp; Kuehni, 2010</xref>) and lower household incomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1043454213478469">Zebrack et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1043454213478469">Zeltzer et al., 2009</xref>), were associated with psychological distress. Our study measured perceived economic status of the participants’ households instead of their objective individual economic achievements. This was because of the sample characteristic of many participants being adolescents and emerging adults who have yet to enter the workforce. Also, Korean AYAs tend to live at home with, and continue to receive financial support from, their parents until they are married. Therefore, household economic statuses may be an important factor influencing their psychological distress. Future studies could examine how economic status affects quality of life during survivorship.</p>
<p>Some findings were inconsistent with existing knowledge. Unlike other studies conducted in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1043454213478469">Kaiser, Hartoonian, &amp; Owen, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1043454213478469">Zebrack et al., 2002</xref>) and Europe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1043454213478469">Michel et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1043454213478469">Wenninger et al., 2012</xref>), longer time since diagnosis was found to be a risk factor for psychological distress. This result was similar to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1043454213478469">Recklitis, Lockwood, Rothwell, and Diller’s (2006)</xref> study that found that suicidality was positively associated with younger age at diagnosis and longer time since diagnosis in adult survivors of childhood cancer. This may reflect possible physical and psychological effects that emerge long after treatment ends, subsequently affecting levels of psychological distress. The significance of time since diagnosis may also result from the strong association between psychological distress and age. Because of the confounding effects of current age and time since diagnosis, it is challenging to disentangle their individual effects. Future studies need to examine their separate impact on distress so that high-risk groups for psychosocial distress can be identified.</p>
<p>Other sociodemographic characteristics, such as marital status, education level, and employment status, were found to be associated with distress in other studies of childhood cancer survivors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1043454213478469">Zeltzer et al., 2009</xref>); this was not the case with our sample. These variables were less applicable in the current study because a significant portion of the participants were unmarried, still in school, and had yet to enter the workforce. Also, in contrast to other studies where gender (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1043454213478469">Michel et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1043454213478469">Wenninger et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1043454213478469">Zebrack et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1043454213478469">Zeltzer et al., 2009</xref>), age at diagnosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1043454213478469">Kazak et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1043454213478469">Michel et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1043454213478469">Turner-Sack, Menna, &amp; Setchell, 2012</xref>), and recurrence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1043454213478469">Elkin, Phipps, Mulhern, &amp; Fairclough, 1997</xref>) were found to be correlates for psychological distress, no such association was found among Korean cancer survivors in this study. Furthermore, cancer type was not statistically significant as a correlate of psychological distress for our participants, which is not consistent with other research findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1043454213478469">Kaiser et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1043454213478469">Schultz et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1043454213478469">Zebrack et al., 2007</xref>). However, in interpreting this finding, caution is warranted because our study is limited by the small number of survivors diagnosed with CNS or brain tumors and soft or solid tissue tumors. Future studies are required to continue to explore the impact of cancer type and treatment intensity on psychological distress.</p>
<p>Developing a greater understanding of risk factors for psychological distress can help explain different levels of distress in cancer survivors and inform community-based prevention strategies and interventions that address those risk factors. Our findings indicate a greater need for monitoring and follow-up care related to psychological health during and after treatment for childhood cancer. In general, it is difficult to provide cancer survivors with follow-up care and referrals for psychosocial services because they are hard to reach once cancer treatment ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1043454213478469">Gurney et al., 2009</xref>). Given that less than 20% of adult survivors of childhood cancer receive follow-up care in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1043454213478469">Oeffinger et al., 2004</xref>), it is important that cancer treatment plans address aftercare needs for both primary care and mental health specialty care. The Korean Childhood Cancer Survivor Study has recently been established, and a long-term follow-up system has begun to develop in Korea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1043454213478469">Park et al., 2007</xref>). In Korea, in particular, there is a lack of psychological counseling and related services for cancer patients and survivors, despite great service needs in this population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1043454213478469">Kim &amp; Yi, 2012</xref>). AYA childhood cancer survivors in Korea report a wide range of psychological distress, including academic difficulties, worries about marriage and fertility issues, fear about cancer recurrence, and public stigma toward cancer survivors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1043454213478469">Kim &amp; Yi, 2012</xref>). Suicide rates were higher in cancer patients than those <italic>observed</italic> in the Korean <italic>general population</italic>, and young adult cancer patients were the most likely to die by suicide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1043454213478469">Ahn et al., 2010</xref>). Outreach and collaboration with health care professionals to increase mental health referrals could provide opportunities to address this growing need for psychological support among AYA cancer survivors.</p>
<p>There are several limitations to this study that should be considered when interpreting these findings. First, this study sample may be biased because it only represents voluntary participants. Also, we have used a convenience sample of survivors, and participating survivors may not be representative of all childhood cancer survivors in Korea. To minimize possible selection bias, this study used the sample of AYA childhood cancer survivors who had undergone treatment at multiple medical institutions. Given that this is a hard-to-reach and stigmatized population, the sample size in the study was relatively large. However, the findings should be interpreted cautiously because the sample size for the psychologically distressed survivors was small (n = 46). Future studies using larger sample sizes are needed to address the psychological distress of Korean AYA cancer survivors and make the findings more generalizable to that population. Second, this study used US norms for the BSI-18 because of a lack of Korean norms. Although the BSI-18 measure has been used with Korean and Korean American cancer survivors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1043454213478469">Lim &amp; Zebrack, 2008</xref>), the generalizability of US norms to the Korean population is not known. Future studies could address this limitation by comparing the distress levels of cancer survivors with matched control groups.</p>
<p>Despite the limitations, this study makes a unique contribution to the existing literature by examining psychological distress among childhood cancer survivors in an understudied group. This not only advances the knowledge base about Korean cancer survivors but also informs the development of universal interventions for Korean American and other diverse cultural groups.</p>
