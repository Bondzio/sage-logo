<abstract>
<p>In addition to typical career development and vocational programs in general education, providing school-based programs that are directly linked to employment and career development for youth with learning and emotional and behavioral disabilities is a legally mandated service in special education. Several broad research-based strategies are common to successful career development, vocational, and transition education programs: implementing career assessments, providing extracurricular and early work experiences, developing social capital, and providing opportunities for students’ self-determination. Tips and resources for each of these strategies are provided.</p>

<p>Career development for adolescents with learning disabilities (LD) and emotional and behavioral disabilities (EBD) often takes a backseat to immediate concerns about staying in school and out of trouble. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1053451212443129">IDEA, 2004</xref>) requires transition planning to be a results-oriented process. With this legal mandate in mind, educators and counselors must help adolescents keep their “eyes on the prize” and consider and take steps toward long-range career goals for students. Most careers require postsecondary training and education and therefore require educators, adolescents, and their families to consider employment and education in tandem while engaging in transition planning. Similarly, transition education must foster adolescents’ understanding of the connections between school and work by making explicit the ties among high school academics, college, apprenticeships, internships, other training opportunities, work experiences, and their future career goals.</p>
<p>Legislation such as the reauthorized Perkins Act (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1053451212443129">Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Technical Education Improvement Act, 2006</xref>) outlined mandates for school-based programs that systematically provide U.S. public school students, including those with disabilities, formal education that is directly linked to employment and career development. In this article, the focus is instead on broad characteristics or elements of career development for adolescents with EBD and LD that should be infused into adolescents’ experiences in and out of school. Specifically, the foci are on assessment, extracurricular and work experiences, social capital, and self-determination, all of which include research-supported practices that teachers can use to improve the career development opportunities of adolescents with EBD and LD.</p>
<sec id="section1-1053451212443129">
<title>Career Assessment</title>
<p>Information on career assessment and employment planning for youth with disabilities has historically been scarce and inconsistent when compared to youth without disabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1053451212443129">Morningstar, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1053451212443129">Rojewski, 2002</xref>). Over the past decade attention to meaningful assessment tools and processes for students with disabilities has increased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1053451212443129">Miller, Lombard, &amp; Corbey, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1053451212443129">Rojewski, 2002</xref>). The emphasis on transition assessment is, in part, a response to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1053451212443129">IDEA 2004</xref> mandates that require schools to provide youth with age appropriate assessments and that such assessments inform transition goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1053451212443129">Walker, Kortering, Fowler, &amp; Rowe, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Career assessments are vital to youths’ development and postsecondary success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1053451212443129">Walker et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1053451212443129">Wehmeyer, Palmer, Soukup, Garner, &amp; Lawrence, 2007</xref>). Assessment is an ongoing process rather than a one-time activity. As youth accrue experience, they learn more about their preferences, strengths, and needs, and as a result their visions of the future come into sharper focus. In addition to the types of standardized assessments that are useful in helping determine academic strengths and needs that point to postsecondary education goals, both formal and informal assessments are vital to career development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1053451212443129">Rojewski, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1053451212443129">Sitlington &amp; Clark, 2007</xref>). Formal assessments in career development assessment are typically standardized and have associated fees for administration. Unlike curriculum-based measurement tools, formal assessments are used to understand a scope of attitudes and skills associated with a particular topic such as employment or decision making. See <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1053451212443129">Table 1</xref> for sample standardized assessment tools in career development.</p>

<p>Informal assessments are one of the simplest, most powerful ways to gather student data while expending relatively few resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1053451212443129">Sitlington, Nuebert, Begun, Lombard, &amp; Leconte, 2007</xref>). Informal assessment strategies are individualized, so they can be administered to students performing at different levels and with varied interests. These strategies are readily available because they require few, if any, special materials or forms. Examples of informal career assessments include interviews, observations, anecdotal records, inventories, and curriculum-based assessment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1053451212443129">Walker et al., 2010</xref>). Teachers can create tailored student interviews and questionnaires, conduct direct observations, administer interest inventories, and complete environmental analyses. Interviewing allows for the direct involvement of the student and affords teachers an intimate understanding of students’ needs and aspirations on an individual basis. Observing a student at a job site or completing a work-related task analysis affords a firsthand and situational understanding of a student’s capacity to undertake the responsibilities associated with a particular job. Analyzing the work environment involves exploring the job site and work environment of interest to a student and comparing the results to the student’s preferences, strengths, and needs to determine the degree to which these match (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1053451212443129">Sitlington et al., 2007</xref>)</p>
<p>Career development assessments will be successful only if the procedures used are appropriate and meaningful for students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1053451212443129">Miller et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1053451212443129">Rojewski, 2002</xref>). To achieve success, teachers should familiarize themselves with the different types of assessment tools, explore what each affords, and evaluate the appropriateness of each assessment tool for individual students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1053451212443129">Walker et al., 2010</xref>). Sitlington et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1053451212443129">2007</xref>, p. 75) suggested that teachers consider the following questions when determining the appropriateness of an assessment tool or procedure:</p>
<list id="list1-1053451212443129" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>What do I already know about this student that would be helpful in developing postsecondary outcomes?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>What information do I need to know about this individual to determine postsecondary goals?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>What methods will provide this information?</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>How will the assessment data be collected and used in the individualized education program (IEP) process?</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>As with academic assessments, the goal of career assessment is to increase teachers’ knowledge of their students’ present levels of performance and their ideas and attitudes about transitioning to adulthood. Even more important, assessments afford students with disabilities a clear understanding of themselves including their strengths, preferences, interests, and needs.</p>

<sec id="section2-1053451212443129">
<title>Authentic Experiences</title>
<p>How many times have adults heard young people complaining that they are bored or that they would like to have a job or join an activity but they do not know how to get involved? Helping adolescents to become involved in extracurricular and early work experiences may be one of the most valuable connections that teachers and other adults can help facilitate. Naturally, teachers focus on classrooms and academic progress as it is an essential precursor to successful postsecondary transition. A vision toward career development as a window into adolescents’ futures, however, requires balancing academic work with a diverse set of opportunities and experiences that allow adolescents with disabilities to explore a variety of settings and skills.</p>
<p>Benefits of this exploration include adolescents’ self-exploration and self-reflection (e.g., likes, strengths, interests) and reflection about the responsibilities associated with succeeding and failing and learning from those experiences while the stakes are fairly low and guidance from teachers is readily available. After school and summer vacation are two periods of time where youth with disabilities and their typical peers are most likely to explore these opportunities. In the summer of 2006 (i.e., most recent data available), nearly 67% of youth were employed during the summer months (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1053451212443129">U.S. Department of Labor, 2006</xref>). Unfortunately, youth with disabilities, and particularly youth with EBD, do not benefit from these experiences to the greatest extent possible (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1053451212443129">Figure 1</xref> for an illustration of the types of extracurricular participation and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1053451212443129">Figure 2</xref> for their trends in paid work). Teachers need to make a concerted effort to facilitate them.</p>

<p>Early work experiences are key to postschool employment and to career development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1053451212443129">Test et al., 2009</xref>). Programs that incorporate paid employment during the academic calendar year have shown marked gains in postschool employment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1053451212443129">Benz, Lindstrom, &amp; Yovanoff, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1053451212443129">Malloy, Drake, Abate, &amp; Cormier, 2010</xref>). Summer employment has also been identified as an opportune time to implement these experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1053451212443129">Carter, Trainor, Ditchman, &amp; Owens, 2011</xref>). But the evidence also underscores the important roles that teachers play in helping adolescents find and maintain employment, which is particularly crucial for adolescents who experience disability-related difficulties establishing positive relationships with authority figures such as their bosses and peer coworkers. In fact, many field-tested programs have included supports in the form of transition teachers, special educators, or vocational counselors who check in with students with EBD or LD to ensure their integration into the workplace.</p>
<p>Such supports may be more difficult to fund or staff during summer months when teachers are less likely to work; however, from the perspectives of both teachers and adolescents, much of the planning for such experiences can occur before summer begins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1053451212443129">Trainor, Carter, Owens, &amp; Swedeen, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1053451212443129">Trainor, Carter, Swedeen, Cole, &amp; Smith, in press</xref>). Because annual IEP meetings (no later than age 16) for adolescents with disabilities must include assessment-based decision making with attention to employment outcomes, the IEP is a natural place for special educators to implement some of the aforementioned career assessment tools and to focus short-term goals on increasing exploratory involvement through such means as membership in extracurricular clubs, participation in volunteer and service work, and/or paid employment. See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1053451212443129">Figure 3</xref> for a sample IEP incorporating extracurricular and early work experiences into short- and long-term career development goals.</p>

<p>Increasing early work experiences bolsters adolescents’ connections to people, many of whom are employed in the local community and are acquainted with job openings, and employers who are amenable to hiring young people, including those with disabilities. The next section focuses on the importance of augmenting an adolescents’ social capital.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1053451212443129">
<title>Social Capital</title>
<p>Many people can look back to their early employment experiences and remember answering a help-wanted advertisement in the newspaper or online and recall never hearing back from the employer. Many can also identify several jobs and even career-changing work experiences that they have had in which knowing the right person got them hired. The importance of connections to people in the development of a career path should not be underestimated. People with disabilities often have small social networks with high redundancy, as most people in their networks know each other. This kind of network may be good in some cases. However, it is problematic when it comes to finding jobs because everyone in the network has access to the same information and resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1053451212443129">Condeluci, Ledbetter, Ortman, Fromknecht, &amp; DeFries, 2008</xref>). Service providers can play an important role in strengthening and diversifying the connections between adolescents with disabilities through authentic engagement in work and community.</p>
<p>Networks of interpersonal connections, be they acquaintances, family friends, or teachers and other school staff, are conceptualized as social capital because these connections have value. Such connections can be used as a type of currency to secure job shadowing, internships, interviews, and ongoing mentorship that promotes adolescents’ opportunities for employment and career development. Along with this capital, of course, comes mutual responsibility or engagement. For example, if a lawyer were to create an internship for a neighbor’s son or daughter, the neighbor might expect to return the favor through a similar in-kind benefit that extends from the relationship.</p>
<p>Social capital has the potential to transform transition planning and career development; however, the concept is complex and can be tethered to one’s socioeconomic background, gender, race/ethnicity, disability, citizenship status, and other sociodemographic characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1053451212443129">Trainor, 2008</xref>). For example, adolescents who receive instruction in noninclusive settings designed to serve those with severe behavior problems likely have fewer opportunities to connect with their typical peers, teachers, or other school staff. Similarly, an adolescent with EBD or LD may be included in the general education classroom but may have specific social skill difficulties such as problems accepting compliments and criticism, leading to troubled relationships with adults who provide corrective feedback and encouragement. Troubled relationships may limit the potential value of social capital if mistrust or worry about appropriate behavior emerges.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1053451212443129">Trainor et al. (in press)</xref> found that even when adolescents with disabilities were well connected to adults and peers in their immediate communities, their networks of connections were not dense and did not extend across communities, potentially hindering career development. Although relying on service providers to develop an adolescent’s social networks can be problematic, focusing on a transition plan that at its core provides early work experiences, encourages and organizes interests and hobbies through group membership, and increases goals for civic engagement exponentially strengthens and diversifies the connections adolescents with disabilities have within their communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1053451212443129">Dyda, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Social capital is also group or community oriented, extending beyond an individual’s connectedness. For example, transition specialists and employers may be only loosely connected to one another, failing to realize each has something the other needs. Employers may be willing to partner with schools, and in some cases have resources designated for this purpose, but remain largely unfamiliar with disability issues, potentially hindering these connections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1053451212443129">Carter et al., 2009</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1053451212443129">Carter et al. (2011)</xref> demonstrated, transition planning that focuses, in part, on strengthening connections between employers and adolescents increased summer employment.</p>
<p>Teachers have many opportunities to support adolescents’ development of social capital by strengthening personal connections between and among peers, parents, employers, and other community members. One research-based strategy is the use of mentorship programs for increasing employment skills and career development. Peer mentorship is an effective way to increase appropriate social skills in the workplace (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1053451212443129">Westerlund, Granucci, Gamache, &amp; Clark, 2006</xref>) and young adults with disabilities identify mentors as key people in their postsecondary education and career success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1053451212443129">Leake, Burgstahler, &amp; Izzo, 2011</xref>). Work and career mentors are people with expertise in areas such as personal interest and goal development, job coaching or problem solving, resume building, applying for jobs, interviewing skills, small business development, and networking. The following are characteristics of effective mentor programs, adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1053451212443129">Butterworth, Gandolfo, Revell, and Inge (2007)</xref>:</p>
<list id="list2-1053451212443129" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Longevity: Mentors and mentees need time to get to know one another and invest in their relationship. Teachers should consider a mentoring program that spans at least one or more academic years.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Communicative: Communication skills that include providing honest feedback, handling conflicts and differences of opinions, and active listening are essential to mentoring programs. Teachers should support both mentors and mentees in the development of these essential skills.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Action oriented: Plans are important, but mentors and mentees should take measurable steps toward the goals they identify. Teachers can provide planning prompts and advice to orient the pairs toward action.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Although building social capital, gaining experience, and assessment are all essential components in career development, the final focus here is on adolescents’ self-determination. In the following section, self-determination is examined as an overarching umbrella, the development of which affects all aspects of an adolescent’s transition into the first steps along a career path.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1053451212443129">
<title>Self-Determination</title>
<p>Many adolescents with LD and EBD aspire to secure a job after graduation, whether temporary while in school or on a more long-term basis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1053451212443129">Trainor et al., in press</xref>). To secure employment during the recent U.S. recession, adolescents with LD and EBD faced great challenges that required persistent goal setting, self-reflection, and realignment of goals as necessary. One of the most critical elements of early career development and transition planning is for teachers to provide opportunities for adolescents with LD and EBD to cultivate self-determination. This is key because adolescents with LD and EBD may be more likely to face barriers related to disability or to others’ perceptions of people with disabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1053451212443129">Carter, Lane, Pierson, &amp; Glaeser, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1053451212443129">Carter, Trainor, Ditchman, Swedeen, &amp; Owens, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Self-determination includes developing a knowledge of one’s strengths and needs, disability-related challenges and supports, and then using this knowledge to set goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1053451212443129">Field &amp; Hoffman, 1996</xref>). Increasing adolescents’ self-determination specific to career development includes providing opportunities for them (a) to talk to adults about their career trajectories and requisite skills of employment, (b) to identify jobs and careers of interest, and (c) to experience working in positions that are well suited to their interests and strengths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1053451212443129">Trainor et al., in press</xref>). Failing to secure employment can be confusing and demoralizing for adolescents with LD and EBD. However, increased self-determination provides the tools for them to reevaluate rejection and to understand why a job opportunity did not come through, how to address such limitations, and how to set new goals by exploring other job options that might better match their strengths and interests. Practicing self-determination is context dependent, so it is imperative that such opportunities are embedded in real-life situations such as early work experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1053451212443129">Carter et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Self-determined adolescents with LD and EBD are much more likely to secure employment after high school than youth with LD and EBD who are not equipped with self-determination skills (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1053451212443129">Wehmeyer &amp; Schwartz, 1997</xref>). In addition, adolescents with LD and EBD may be more likely to fulfill their job obligations adeptly because they are able to apply the kind of self-awareness (e.g., identifying what is required, what it takes to get things done, and what resources the youth has or does not have to accomplish required task) and self-advocacy (e.g., advocating for the resources and accommodations needed) that self-determination affords. Explicit instruction of self-determination, coupled with opportunities to practice being self-determined, is critical to career development.</p>

<title>Targeting Career Development</title>
<p>Although career development is an essential component of transition planning and education, it is sometimes approached incidentally or only in passing. At the same time, teachers are accustomed to including some of the essential elements of career development in the course of transition planning and education. A concerted effort that routinizes career development through assessment, authentic experiences, social capital, and self-determination has the potential to help build a strong foundation on which their careers can develop for years to come. Providing career development through systematic transitioning planning and education may be one of the most important contributions teachers can make in the lives of youth with LD and EBD.</p>
<p>Adolescents’ career development paths are more like loops than straight lines. Although assessment of students’ preferences, strengths, and needs is a good place to start, it is an ongoing process and must be a stop on the path that is frequently revisited. Similarly, the exploration of authentic employment and extracurricular experiences involves multiple opportunities and settings to identify settings that are good fits with students’ personal characteristics. Exploring authentic employment and other types of community engagement also affords multiple and dense networks of interconnected people who can help guide adolescents’ career development. Finally, providing the opportunity for adolescents with LD and EBD to cultivate self-determination will facilitate the self-awareness and self-exploration essential to other career development approaches and strategies.</p>
