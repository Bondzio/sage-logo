<p>Cherrie Moraga is probably best known for the collection that she edited entitled <italic>This Bridge Called My Back: Writings by Radical Women of Color.</italic> Her co-editor on that edition, Gloria Anzaldua, is remembered in the present collection, as are many of the questions and concerns that were first raised in <italic>This Bridge Called My Back</italic>, first published in 1981. This comment could be taken to make the implicit suggestion that Cherrie Moraga is returning to ‘old’ themes and taking the reader no further than they might have come in 1981. I am not sure that all authors would remark with confidence that their works are ‘landmark texts’ (p. 210) but there is certainly a strong case for placing <italic>This Bridge</italic> at the forefront of work that challenged the absence of the gendered politics of colour in feminism. Thus the achievements of 1981 were considerable and important and do make it inevitable that we at least consider the question of repetition.</p>
<p>Having said this, what seems to me most powerful about <italic>A Xicana Codex</italic> is precisely some of its repetition. Since this might be a statement somewhat out of step with many academic expectations I would defend my case in two ways. First, I am impressed by Moraga’s refusal to fall into the trap of the progress/miserabilist binaries of accounts of our recent times. These binaries are not of course exclusive to feminism (although Clare Hemmings has written an important account of these narratives in the context of feminism in <italic>Why Stories Matter</italic>) but they are often to be found in feminist histories both of the self and of the social world. Moraga refuses this binary and instead, while fully recognising the passing of time, reaffirms an important lesson about the continuing inequalities of class and race in the United States. Should she have wished to extend her narrative outside America (which I use here in her sense of a continent rather than a country) she would have found much that is similar.</p>
<p>For this reason, and for the lens that Morago brings to bear on the tragic individual consequences of the social differences that continue to deform the politics of both the United States and the rest of the world, <italic>A Xicana Codex</italic> has considerable interest. The second strength of the collection is related: the recognition of the way in which racial prejudice and discrimination can emerge in different forms and their relationship to both the absence and the presence of power. At the heart of the understanding of racism in this collection is the clarity with which the author demonstrates that while racism discriminates against the subjects of its hostility and exclusion it also empowers those who discriminate, if not by the explicit use of power then as much by the implicit fact of the way in which inclusion in the more powerful group carries with it access to the means and the expectation of power.</p>
<p>Of the various sections of <italic>A Xicana Codex</italic> I found the most impressive to be Section Four, entitled ‘The Price of Beans’. There are powerful essays about the election of Obama and the 40th anniversary of Ethnic Studies that are political in the very best sense: they recognise both the complexity of the collective and the centrality of the individual. In the chapter ‘This benighted nation we name home’ there is an agenda for a politics that might previously have been labelled ‘socialist’. Although the issue of what Marxists would define as ‘the ownership of the means of production’ is not spelt out, there is a clear and uncompromising recognition here that the power corporations in the United States have acquired has negative and damaging implications for individual lives. So too, Moraga suggests, does too much absorption in the academy, although she does not spell out as much as she might the means (and the reasons) through which the academy can sap energy and creativity.</p>
<p>Throughout the recent (and not so recent) past there has always been a justification for examining exactly what has changed in the world in which we live. Yet it is something that we are often unwilling to do: many people are only too happy simply to mourn the past and base their (usually, although not always, reactionary) politics on fantasies of recovery of a mythical past. There are points in Moraga’s collection where she might interrogate rather more the aspects of the past, and past cultures that she wishes to regain. (In the case of Britain, for example, there are aspects of our past that I would have no wish to recover.) But overall this collection has a vitality and a concern for human equality that does remind us of the positive reasons for politics.</p>
