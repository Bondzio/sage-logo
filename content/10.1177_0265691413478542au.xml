<p>Handbooks are invariably less handy than their name suggests, but even by the standards of the Oxford Handbook series this is a particularly weighty tome (three and a half pounds, to be exact). At nearly 880 pages, it is significantly longer than <italic>The Oxford Handbook of the History of Medicine</italic> (696 pages) or even <italic>The Oxford Handbook of World History</italic> (625 pages). A stark photograph of Hans Haacke’s ‘Germania’ installation at the 1993 Venice Biennale, with its shattered floor and echoes of Hitler’s megalomaniacal plans for Berlin, provides a suitably monumental cover illustration. The book is split into five parts, the first of which (‘History’) contains broader thematic chapters, while the subsequent four each focus on a specific chronological period: 1760–1860; 1860–1945; 1945–1989; and 1990–present. The chronology does not impose a rigid straitjacket, however, and many of the contributors opt for different start and end points for their individual chapters: Ritchie Robertson’s survey of ‘German Literature and Thought’ runs from 1810 to 1880, for instance, while a chapter on ‘Mobility, Migration, and Nation’ by Sebastian Conrad and Philipp Ther sets 1880 and 1948 as its parameters. This willingness to depart from the familiar political markers makes good sense for cultural, social and economic topics and can be seen as one of the volume’s principal strengths.</p>
<p>Arguably more important, however, is the way in which Walser Smith encourages his contributors to place developments in the German lands in a wider global context, emphasizing the significance of transnational forces wherever possible. ‘This approach does not preclude showing how German history differed from other national histories’, he argues, ‘but it allows us to see these differences in a more complex and international field’ (1). An international or transnational focus might be expected in chapters such as Jonathan Sperber’s study of ‘The Atlantic Revolutions in the German Lands, 1776–1849’ or Andrew Zimmerman’s ‘Race and World Politics: Germany in the Age of Imperialism, 1878–1914’, but here it provides a thread which runs through the entire volume, allowing the dust jacket to claim with some justification that it ‘places German history in a denser transnational context than any other general history of Germany’. Thus Ute Planert argues the Seven Years’ War was the ‘first world war’, noting that ‘from a British perspective the war in North America was, in fact, won in Silesia’ (95). As Franz Leander Fillafer and Jürgen Osterhammel put it in a later chapter, it was during this conflict that Europeans first ‘recognized that the different parts of the world were interwoven and interconnected to an unprecedented degree’ (123). Subsequent contributors point to the ‘interwoven and interconnected’ nature of the modern world to help explain many key episodes in German history. James Brophy, for example, suggests that ‘when Silesian linen weavers starved in 1844, the larger explanation involved a world-wide shift to cotton, English mechanized spinning and weaving, [as well as] the slow response of German merchant capitalists to consumer taste’ (177). Indeed, even those chapters which do not have a specifically transnational focus nevertheless have a strong comparative dimension. Adam Tooze’s ‘The German National Economy in an Era of Crisis and War, 1917–1945’ is a case in point. ‘If we compare the Third Reich to the United States, where FDR was mounting a similarly energetic interventionist effort’, he writes, ‘we find there too an “alphabet soup” of competing agencies’ (413).</p>
<p>As one would expect from a series which aspires to ‘define the discipline’, the overall standard of the essays is very high, with most contributors succeeding in synthesizing large bodies of scholarship succinctly and accessibly. There are inevitably some minor quibbles: Goebbels appears in the text as both Josef and Joseph, but is not listed in the index; the publisher Eugen Diederichs is referred to as Diedrichs on several occasions (464–5); the economist Hjalmar Schacht loses the ‘l’ (412); the Bavarian CSU is misleadingly described as the ‘Christian Socialist [sic!] Union’ (618 and index); and, inexplicably, William Hagen’s otherwise excellent chapter is entitled ‘The Three Horseman [sic] of The Holocaust’, when the triumvirate of ‘Anti-Semitism, East European Empire [and] Aryan Folk Community’ should surely require the plural form. These irritations notwithstanding, this collection will prove a valuable reference work for academics, students, and many others with an interest in modern German history. Its approach is neatly summed up by Lutz Koepnick in his contribution on ‘Culture in the Shadow of Trauma’: just as the Holocaust, with its universal effects and echoes, cannot be confined to German history books alone, so the history of German culture in the wake of the Holocaust needs to be conceptualized ‘as an intersection of various inter-, trans-, and post-national voices, visions, and itineraries’ (726). The <italic>Oxford Handbook</italic> provides just such an intersection.</p>
