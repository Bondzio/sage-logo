<title>Background:</title>
<p>Observational research methods are important for understanding people’s actions, roles and behaviour. However, these techniques are underused generally in healthcare research, including research in the palliative care field.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0269216311432897">
<title>Aim:</title>
<p>The aim in this paper is to place qualitative observational data collection methods in their methodological context and provide an overview of issues to consider when using observation as a method of data collection. This paper discusses practical considerations when conducting palliative care research using observation.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0269216311432897">
<title>Findings:</title>
<p>Observational data collection methods span research paradigms, and qualitative approaches contribute by their focus on ‘natural’ settings which allow the explanation of social processes and phenomena. In particular, they can facilitate understanding of what people do and how these can alter in response to situations and over time, especially where people find their own practice difficult to articulate. Observational studies can be challenging to carry out: we focus on the potentially problematic areas of sampling, consent and ethics, data collection and recording, data management and analysis.</p>

<title>Conclusion:</title>
<p>Qualitative observational data collection methods can contribute to theoretical and conceptual development and the explanation of social processes in palliative care. In particular this contribution to understanding care structures and processes should improve understanding of patients’ experiences of their care journey and thus impact on care outcomes.</p>

<p>Observation as a qualitative data collection technique is widely used in many research fields, particularly anthropology where the ethnographic observational tradition is strong.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269216311432897">1</xref></sup> In palliative care research it is less common – for example, a review of qualitative research in palliative care showed it to be used in only a fifth of studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0269216311432897">2</xref></sup> In our own field of primary palliative care, our recent review of the district nurse’s role in palliative care provision revealed that observation is rarely used as a data collection method, even where the questions posed might indicate its suitability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269216311432897">3</xref></sup></p>
<p>Observational research techniques have advantages over other qualitative data collection methods when the focus of research is on understanding actions, roles and behaviour. Interviews are commonly used to facilitate discussion about healthcare and the experience of health or illness, but they are limited when the aims of the research include understanding structures and processes that underpin health or healthcare. Put simply, an interview allows someone to say what they do; an observation allows you to see directly what someone does.</p>
<p>In this paper we draw on our experiences in past<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269216311432897">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0269216311432897"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0269216311432897">6</xref></sup> and current studies using observational methods, from others’ research, and from experiences shared during a workshop we facilitated on the use of observational methods (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pccongress.org.uk/speakers/Innovative_research_methods.pdf">www.pccongress.org.uk/speakers/Innovative_research_methods.pdf</ext-link>). We begin by setting the method of observation in its methodological context, then address the main focus of the paper – the possibilities and practical considerations of employing observation as a method for data collection.</p>
<sec id="section5-0269216311432897">
<title>Observation: Methodology and method</title>
<p>Observational data collection methods span research paradigms, from structured observations that count instances of events, to highly unstructured participant observation. It is argued that ‘questions of method should be secondary to questions of paradigm, which can be defined as the belief system or world view that guides the investigation, not only in choices of method but in ontologically and epistemologically fundamental ways’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269216311432897">7</xref></sup> Paradigms that tend to favour qualitative methods frequently describe actions in context, and draw from philosophical traditions that believe in the social and cultural meanings of actions and how they are shaped by the interpretation and construction of stimuli and situations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269216311432897">1</xref></sup> Observation as a methodology clearly contributes to these understandings, as it can be employed in ‘natural’ settings, rather than those set up for research purposes such as interviews.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269216311432897">1</xref></sup> The contribution of observation to such paradigms can lie in explaining social processes and phenomena, often through developing typologies. Much observational research has drawn from the ethnographic research tradition. Classic examples in palliative care that have done much to move knowledge forwards in this field include the typology of dying ‘awareness contexts’ developed through observational data, and which clearly shows the methodological contribution of observation to the development of theory,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0269216311432897">8</xref></sup> and work examining emotional labour in the hospice setting.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269216311432897">9</xref></sup></p>
<p>Our aim in this paper is primarily to explore the practical considerations of the use of observation as a method rather than a methodology. Texts are suggested here for readers who wish to explore the methodological context of observation further, including exploring the history and role of ethnographic research in palliative care.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269216311432897">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0269216311432897">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0269216311432897">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269216311432897"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269216311432897"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0269216311432897"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269216311432897"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269216311432897"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0269216311432897">16</xref></sup></p>

<title>When might you use observational methods?</title>
<p>Observational methods are useful for understanding what people do – their roles, actions and behaviour – and how these can alter in response to situations and over time. We have used observation to explore aspects of healthcare that practitioners find difficult to articulate. For example, we found that, when interviewed, district nurses struggled to describe their role in providing early support visits to palliative care patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269216311432897">17</xref></sup> When observed, however, skills and actions that had not been described were revealed,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0269216311432897">4</xref></sup> which had not been shown by other interview-based studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0269216311432897">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0269216311432897">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>Other examples of recent observation studies in palliative care (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0269216311432897">Table 1</xref>) include exploring care of the dying in home, hospital and hospice settings,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269216311432897">18</xref></sup> examining administration and understanding of chemotherapy from patient and physician perspectives,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0269216311432897">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0269216311432897">20</xref></sup> and examination of symptom discussions in oncology outpatient consultations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0269216311432897">21</xref></sup> These studies focus on structures and processes, examining behaviours such as talk and action in consultations, provision of nursing care, and the role of family carers. Whilst interviews can be used to ascertain the interpretation of ‘actors’ in the field, observation can be critical to elucidating people’s behaviour and provides information not obtained by other methods.</p>

<p>Observation, conducted with due care and attention can be particularly useful in working with those who might be excluded from studies due to perceived research burden (i.e. those who are dying), communication issues (i.e. hearing impairment, dementia), issues of age or maturity (the very young and the very old), and where issues of social desirability may affect responses (i.e. drug use, sex workers).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0269216311432897">1</xref></sup> However, observation is not just a technique for difficult situations, but is useful in uncovering the taken-for-granted work of health professionals.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0269216311432897">
<title>What roles can be taken by the observer?</title>
<p>An important consideration is where to place oneself on the continuum of observer to participant, and why. The complete participant’s true identity and purpose are not known to those observed, whilst the complete observer role removes the researcher from social interaction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269216311432897">14</xref></sup> Researchers are rarely at either end of this continuum, and their role often changes as the research progresses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269216311432897">15</xref></sup> Issues to consider include the observer’s own professional role, the possibilities for influencing behaviour and changing the dynamic of the situation, and the practicalities of how to observe and record observations. Researchers also need to consider what they bring to the encounter as insiders or outsiders.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0269216311432897">12</xref></sup></p>
<p>Strengths and weaknesses of different observational roles need to be considered in terms of being part of someone’s world, maintaining role, bias, and privacy and consent. Traditionally, anthropologists immersed themselves in the world of ‘outsiders’, often for prolonged periods.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0269216311432897">22</xref></sup> This participant role reflects a belief that ‘deep familiarity’ is required to obtain the best data, achieved by getting emotionally, physically and socially close to the people being studied.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0269216311432897">23</xref></sup> It is difficult to fully participate in some worlds, for example those of lone or elite workers,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269216311432897">15</xref></sup> and perhaps because of this, healthcare researchers frequently examine the familiar, as insiders.</p>
<p>Both positions have different advantages and are dynamic. For example, an outsider may move towards an insider perspective as participation in the setting develops. This increasing familiarity with a setting can affect how the observer ‘sees’ and interprets what is happening. Proponents of insider observation argue that they have a privileged understanding of the situation, are less likely to misinterpret behaviours, can uncover valuable meanings, and easily gain trust and cooperation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0269216311432897">24</xref></sup> However, physical, mental and analytical fatigue may also be a consequence of prolonged insider participation.</p>
<p>Participatory roles may create difficulties with maintaining the role of researcher. There is effort required in maintaining the ‘pretence’ of a participatory role,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0269216311432897">14</xref></sup> whilst also ensuring the researcher role is adequately addressed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0269216311432897">25</xref></sup> Subjectivity and bias are also potential weaknesses. Some argue that the position of complete observer is free from most of the potential bias that can arise from too close an affiliation with research subjects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0269216311432897">24</xref></sup> Increasing participation in a situation can increase the risks of subjectivity and bias, along with the drawback of being familiar with much of what is seen. However, subjectivity, or the use of self, is integral to the process of fieldwork and the construction of ethnographic accounts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0269216311432897">25</xref></sup> It is critical that an appropriate balance is found between an appropriate use of self, and subjectivity, using a reflexive approach to make processes visible. Roles are also increasingly constrained by the requirements of research ethics committees or other governance requirements, where the needs of informed consent procedures take precedence over a desired participatory role.</p>

<title>Practical considerations in observation</title>
<sec id="section9-0269216311432897">
<title>Planning an observational study</title>
<p>Careful preparation can maximize the opportunities offered by observation. Research gatekeepers (i.e. funders, research ethics and governance committees, participants) might infrequently encounter proposals using observational methods, and therefore have particular concerns. Observation may be perceived as more intrusive and threatening to participants than other forms of data collection. As a result, research ‘gatekeeping’ may be exacerbated in observational studies. Establishing personal legitimacy and credibility with gatekeepers and potential participants is likely to involve discussions about academic credentials, clinical background and the ‘personal front’ of demeanour and attire. Clinicians in particular may be perceived as ‘insiders’, knowledgeable and competent in clinical practice and contexts, which may either facilitate access or trigger concerns in those observed about judgement of their expertise.</p>

<title>Sampling issues</title>
<p>Crucial sampling decisions include which sites, events, and persons are to be observed over what time period and how ‘bounded’ observations are likely to be. For example, in our own studies we had to decide whether to observe a district nurse during particular patient visits or throughout a shift. These decisions alter issues of consent, especially where the boundaries of the observation and its setting are less clear, and where unanticipated participants, such as patients’ relatives, may be present. Addressing these consent issues in an ethical fashion is likely to be critical to the success of the study, and is discussed now in more detail.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0269216311432897">
<title>Consent issues</title>
<p>Consent issues can be complex in observation studies, and frequently central to the strict ethical and governance contexts within which research is conducted. Practical and ethical decisions need to be made about whether and how to obtain written or verbal consent from participants. This can vary depending on how bounded the setting is, whether participants are central or peripheral to the objectives of the observation and whether their participation is anticipated. Written consent prior to the observation from all participants might be considered to be the ‘gold standard’ and setting up a study in a way which facilitates this is likely to aid research approvals. Such advance written consent is more likely in a bounded setting (for example a clinic, or home) where only anticipated people are likely to be present. However many ‘classic’ observational studies in palliative care settings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0269216311432897">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0269216311432897">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0269216311432897">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0269216311432897">27</xref></sup> occurred in less bounded settings, such as wards or hospices, with participants whose presence could not be anticipated in advance, some of whom were peripheral to the objectives of the observation. Obtaining permission to conduct such studies now might be challenging, but appears possible, with recent examples of permission granted when the focus of the observation is the professional rather than the patient,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0269216311432897">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0269216311432897">29</xref></sup> and in less bounded settings.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0269216311432897">30</xref></sup> Weigl et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0269216311432897">29</xref></sup> discuss their obligations to preserve patient confidentiality and follow ethical principles, even where advance permission to observe patients, such as in the emergency room, had not been given. However, there are also accounts where obtaining ethics committee approval to conduct observation has been more challenging. An example is working with psychiatric patients, where concerns were expressed about their vulnerability and potential inability to give full informed consent. Ongoing discussions with the research ethics committee did facilitate a way forward with the research. There are key points about the difficulties of requiring individual informed consent when using a participatory method that is essentially collective,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0269216311432897">31</xref></sup> and about observation enabling participation of those who may have been excluded from other forms of data collection such as interviews.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0269216311432897">26</xref></sup></p>
<p>There are also temporal issues to consider. Obtaining consent well in advance of the observation may give the opportunity to discuss the study in more detail. In other circumstances consent may be obtained at the start of the observation episode for pragmatic reasons, or to minimize the time burden on observer and observed. The intent should be to avoid changing the nature of the observation itself. Ongoing consent has to be considered when multiple observations are planned, or during lengthy periods of observation. People must be able to leave, request that the observer leave, or withdraw from the study.</p>

<title>Conducting an observational study</title>
<p>Although a theoretical choice of a more participative role may be made, participation may not always be practical (for example with lone or elite workers)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0269216311432897">15</xref></sup> or valued. On the other hand observational roles may also move towards participation as the researcher becomes trusted and accepted.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0269216311432897">32</xref></sup> Many believe that an observer will always be considered part of the world they study, always having an effect on the phenomena being studied, whether or not they are drawn into participation. Examples from our own non-participant research include being invited to contribute to a clinical discussion about care and to participate in providing nursing care. It is important to consider how to respond to such situations, and how the response may affect the observational data. See <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="boxed-text2-0269216311432897">Box 2</xref> for further practical considerations.</p>

<list-item><p>Consider what might be best or appropriate for the setting under study and the observer skill set.

</list>
</boxed-text>
<p>There is a balance to be struck between sitting or standing out of the line of sight of participants to reduce influencing the ‘normal’ situation, and being able to observe. Where observers sit or stand will impact on what is seen and from whose perspective – for example, observing more body language from one participant than another. This may be unavoidable, but needs to be considered in analysis. Equally, sitting very obviously ‘out of sight’ may make the observer more conspicuous, may raise suspicion and could make observation itself difficult. Examining a setting in advance may be preferable, but not possible, especially when observation incorporates moving with a practitioner through a number of settings, or in private settings such as the home.</p>
<p>Consideration needs to be given to when data collection starts and finishes. This may be affected by formal consent (i.e. observation only possible when this is obtained from all participants), timing (i.e. whether to observe for a set period of time or a ‘unit of care’ such as a particular intervention), and fatigue (observer fatigue vs. blending into the setting).</p>
<p>Methods of recording observational data vary, and are driven by the research question and purpose of the observation. Common methods include audio-recording of speech data during the observation, making unstructured field notes (recording, for example, movement, body language, and initial interpretation of actions), and using a structured observation pro-forma (for example, a check box when a particular action is observed). Video recording is also possible, but requires a more structured observational format, such as an outpatient appointment, and can feel more intrusive. Audio recording can be unobtrusive, and can mean that observational effort can be concentrated on non-speech data.</p>
<p>A concern for many observational researchers, which featured strongly in the observation workshop, is the potential for observing poor or inappropriate care. There is an obvious duty of care to intervene if abuse is witnessed or care which could be immediately dangerous. A more complex situation is the observer’s role where care might be considered sub-standard but not immediately dangerous. Researchers have reported intervening to meet a patient’s clinical needs,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0269216311432897">18</xref></sup> but more complex situations demand consideration about what might be regarded as ‘reasonable’ care by both those observed and the observer. Observers with and without clinical backgrounds are likely to differ in whether and how they identify poor care. It must be remembered that the observer also has a duty of care – to do no harm, to ensure privacy and avoid distress.</p>

<title>After observational data have been collected</title>
<p>Data management is an important issue in observational research, when there may be audio or video recordings to be integrated with observation notes, activity data and personal reflections. These can rapidly proliferate over hours of observation. Decisions are required about whether to keep data separate or integrated, and whether to use a CAQDAS software tool or similar to organize the data.</p>
<p>Member-checking, presenting data to participants to check for accuracy, can be difficult with field notes which may already have a layer of interpretation. Analytical decisions also need to be made if observational data are to be integrated with other data such as interviews – for example, whether they are to be coded together or separately. Reporting data can also be difficult, where anonymity is difficult to preserve in situations with small sample sizes, recognizable settings and the use of lengthy excerpts and descriptions. It is difficult to do observational data justice in a research report or article, and alternative methods of dissemination and report may be required.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Qualitative observational data collection methods have great potential to contribute to evidence and understanding in the field of palliative care. Observational methods contribute to theoretical and conceptual development in the field, and help to explain social processes and phenomena in a way which can contribute to clinical practice. For example, an understanding of how people enact roles and behave in particular situations is important if care quality is to be improved. Understanding, and subsequently changing, care processes in response to such understanding should improve patients’ experiences of their care journey and hopefully improve outcomes. Observational research methods can make a significant contribution to understanding care structures and processes. Practitioners can find that data from direct observation are powerful and meaningful to them in a way that indirect data such as opinions voiced in an interview may not be. Observation appears to be an infrequent method of data collection at the moment, possibly because it can be challenging and time-consuming. However, we believe that the benefits to patients of such an approach make overcoming these challenges worthwhile.</p>
