<p>This article develops an analytical model of how and why the political-economic context affects employers’ preferences in using collective agreements to finance and regulate pension schemes. It argues that these preferences are influenced by three domains, the labour market and industrial relations system, public policies and the financial market. The study compares and contrasts three Nordic countries, and reveals how these three mechanisms have generated distinctive trajectories of employer preferences.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Private occupational pension schemes (OPS) can function as an alternative and supplement to state-run schemes. In explaining their establishment and development, recent literature shows three limitations. First, it provides rather generalized and, very often, monocausal explanations. Factors conditioning occupational pension schemes are located in the dynamics of industrial relations (collective bargaining, union structure and politics) or internal employer politics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0959680112474882">Øverbye, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0959680112474882">Swenson, 2002</xref>); in the financial market and firms’ capital requirements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0959680112474882">Brooks, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0959680112474882">Estévez-Abe, 2001</xref>); in the labour market needs of firms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0959680112474882">Bridgen and Meyer, 2005</xref>); in the strengths of the left and the strategies of political parties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0959680112474882">Kangas and Palme, 1996</xref>: 219); <italic>or</italic> in state policies and government fiscal retrenchment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0959680112474882">Myles and Pierson, 2001</xref>). Few studies presume multicausality and combine these various explanations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0959680112474882">Kangas and Palme, 1989</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0959680112474882">1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0959680112474882">Nordheim Nielsen, 1986</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0959680112474882">1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0959680112474882">Øverbye, 1996</xref>). Second, nearly all the studies focus on company-based occupational pension schemes run by individual firms, and largely ignore collective occupational pension schemes (COPS) which are regulated through sectoral or intersectoral collective agreements. Since occupational pensions are increasingly incorporated into collective agreements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0959680112474882">Ebbinghaus, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0959680112474882">Trampusch, 2007</xref>), a perspective which includes COPS is needed. The third characteristic of current research is that few studies analyse the formation of employers’ preferences in more detail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0959680112474882">Bridgen and Meyer, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0959680112474882">Swenson, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>This article develops an analytical model of employers’ preferences in private sector COPS and applies it to three Nordic countries. It shows that employers have different preferences for COPS, for different reasons. The analysis is distinctive in three respects. First, it focuses on employers’ preference formation because employer involvement in these schemes is a necessary condition for their development. Following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0959680112474882">Hall (2005</xref>: 131), preference formation is understood as ‘the processes by which social actors decide what they want and what to pursue’. Second, instead of juxtaposing public and private schemes, it concentrates on collective occupational schemes and thus on the dynamics of employers’ collective action. Third, it takes multicausality as given and goes a step further by investigating the causal mechanisms – defined as ‘the underlying social processes which connect inputs and outcomes’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0959680112474882">Falleti and Lynch, 2009</xref>: 1161) – of employers’ preference formation. In particular, it seeks a deeper understanding of <italic>how</italic> and <italic>why</italic> employers’ preferences are affected by the broader political-economic context.</p>
<p>This study follows historical-institutionalist reasoning on the endogeneity of preference formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0959680112474882">Hall, 2005</xref>: 129–134; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0959680112474882">Woll, 2005</xref>: 6): it assumes that employers’ preferences regarding COPS are not exogenously given but are defined in response to employers’ interaction with other actors and conditioned by institutional structures. This ontological perspective fits with the method of contrast of contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0959680112474882">Skocpol and Somers, 1980</xref>: 181), seeking to reveal the historical limits of generalized accounts of employer preference formation by offering a more contextualized analytical frame. In so doing, the analysis takes recent findings on the preferences and strategies of employers regarding occupational pensions as a heuristic device for addressing similar questions in different countries. It contrasts the cases with each other to ‘contextualize’ and to reveal trajectories of preference formation, with the aim not of generating ‘causal generalizations across cases’ but of presenting ‘particular features of individual cases’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0959680112474882">Skocpol and Somers, 1980</xref>: 190).</p>
<p>Sweden, Denmark and Norway offer a sharp contrast in employers’ behaviour, a contrast necessary to satisfy the case selection demands of the ‘contrast of contexts’ method. COPS episodes in these three countries exhibit three trajectories: Swedish employers are <italic>promoters</italic>, Danish employers <italic>vacillators</italic> and Norwegian employers <italic>adversaries</italic>. Whereas employers in Sweden are proactively engaged in building up these schemes, in Denmark they were sceptical to begin with but are now supportive. In contrast to these ‘<italic>catching-up</italic> pension fund countries’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0959680112474882">Ebbinghaus and Wiß, 2011</xref>: 359), employers in Norway are opposed to concluding agreements on pensions, while the trade unions favour COPS and have achieved some partial success with their demands. It should be noted that, following this historical-institutionalist and contextualized approach, the present analysis adopts a diachronic perspective. The time frame comprises periods in which employers decided in favour, or against, COPS. For Sweden, this was the period between 1960 and 1973, when employers established national COPS first for white-collar workers and subsequently for blue-collar workers; for Denmark, the analysis focuses on the period between the 1980s and 1990s, when sectoral labour market pensions were founded; for Norway, the period from 2001 to the present, when unions unsuccessfully demanded COPS.</p>
<p>The data used stem from a two-year cross-national research project on collectively negotiated benefits in 10 West European countries.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0959680112474882">1</xref></sup> Within this project, data on social benefits (among them COPS) were collected from two different sources. First, we collected data from secondary literature (including studies of the public-private mix, which document the development of social benefits and actors’ policy positions), primary documents available in English and EIRO reports on collective bargaining developments in the respective countries; because of space constraints, this article also draws heavily on the country reports of the research project (quoted here as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0959680112474882">Trampusch et al., 2010</xref>). Second, data were obtained from elite and expert interviews. For this study on COPS, seven interviews were conducted between 2009 and 2011 with national experts and representatives of labour market organizations with detailed experience of COPS. The main aim was to validate or amend the findings on employers’ positions which we derived from the secondary literature and documentation. At the request of our interview partners, the interviews are only cited in the text in anonymized form.</p>
<p>The next section summarizes the theoretical and analytical framework, presenting the historical-institutionalist perspective on preference formation and discussing conditions and processes that affect employers’ preferences in bargaining over occupational pensions. Subsequent sections describe the country cases and follow the same structure: a brief summary of the development and structural features of COPS, followed by contextualized narratives of employers’ preferences and strategies. The main structuring principle of these historical-analytical narratives is not the strict differentiation between different probable causal factors but the case-sensitive reconstruction of causal mechanisms. Finally, the main findings are summarized.</p>

<title>Employers and collectively negotiated pensions: A historical institutionalist and contextualized approach</title>
<p>Strategies, decisions and choices depend on actors’ preferences among the options and types of action they have at their disposal; hence understanding (collective) actors’ preference formation is a key issue for social science. Two main approaches can be distinguished. Neo-institutionalist and public choice literature adopts a deductive approach, treating preferences as exogenous to the decisions taken (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0959680112474882">Wildawsky, 1987</xref>: 4); historical institutionalists (as well as constructivists) tend to be inductivists, treating preferences and their formation as endogenous and hence affected by actors’ social interactions and the institutional conditions of decision-making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0959680112474882">Hall, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0959680112474882">Hall and Taylor, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0959680112474882">Immergut, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0959680112474882">Woll, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>What does it mean for our study of employers’ preferences when we assume endogeneity of preferences and therefore follow a contextualized research perspective? First of all, such an approach is valuable because, for employers, COPS mean giving up ‘the tradition of unilateral control of occupational pension schemes’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0959680112474882">Hyman and Schuller, 1984</xref>: 291); from their perspective, the establishment of COPS is always a political decision and not a purely economic one. The collective status of COPS makes occupational pensions a general benefit, hence they lose their character as fringe benefits designed to increase workers’ loyalty to the firm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0959680112474882">Nordheim Nielsen, 1986</xref>: 32). Second, endogeneity means that employers with the same basic interests in collective bargaining, namely market and managerial control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0959680112474882">Flanders, 1974</xref>: 355–356; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0959680112474882">Sisson, 1987</xref>: 5), may have different preferences towards COPS. Consequently, in order to specify the causal mechanisms of employers’ preference formation, we first have to identify the probable, multiple conditions affecting their preferences with respect to COPS.</p>
<p>As indicated in the introduction, in comparative research there are few studies which explicitly theorize employers’ involvement with COPS. Four strands of literature are of crucial importance for the present study. First, there is that on the <italic>public-private mix</italic>, which analyses linkages between public and occupational pensions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0959680112474882">Rein and Turner, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0959680112474882">Shalev, 1996</xref>). Here, it is argued that employers’ pension preferences depend on the development and structure of public pension schemes. Second, there is the literature on <italic>industrial relations</italic>, which argues that employers’ positions on pensions are decisively influenced by the internal politics of employers’ associations, the consensus and conflict dynamics of collective bargaining, the demands and policies of trade unions, and coalition-building with political parties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0959680112474882">Bridgen and Meyer, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0959680112474882">Ebbinghaus, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0959680112474882">Hyman and Schuller, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0959680112474882">Iversen, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0959680112474882">Swenson, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0959680112474882">Swenson and Pontusson, 2000</xref>). The third strand is the <italic>varieties of capitalism</italic> approach, which assumes institutional complementarities and interdependencies between different political economic spheres and maintains that the financial market system affects firms’ strategies towards pensions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0959680112474882">Estévez-Abe, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0959680112474882">Pontusson, 1992</xref>). The fourth comprises studies which use <italic>survey data and statistics</italic> to analyse firms’ decisions on OPS, examining such aspects as company size, tax deductibility, labour turnover and tenure, along with individual wage negotiations, skill needs and the degree of unionization (for an overview of which, see: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0959680112474882">Bridgen and Meyer, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0959680112474882">Hernæs et al., 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Of the few studies which explicitly analyse employers’ preferences in <italic>collectively negotiated</italic> schemes, the works of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0959680112474882">Nordheim Nielsen (1996)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0959680112474882">Kangas and Palme (1996)</xref> deserve special attention because they explicitly take a contextualized view of employers’ activities, analysing their behaviour simultaneously in different arenas (the welfare state, industrial relations and financial market systems). Also of interest is the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0959680112474882">Øverbye (1996</xref>: 173), who argues that the variation in COPS in Nordic countries results from differences in trade union structure.</p>
<p>Confronted with this state of the art, it becomes clear that employers’ preferences towards private or collective pensions are affected by numerous factors. As a result, what might best be described as a ‘too-many-variables problem’ exists. Or, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0959680112474882">Esping-Andersen (1996</xref>: 330) writes, ‘it is easy to become trapped in a causal labyrinth’ if one analyses private pension schemes. However, the present analysis argues that these factors can be grouped into three main ‘context domains’ which are linked to particular mechanisms that explain the causes of employers’ preference formation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0959680112474882">2</xref></sup> The first is the <italic>labour market</italic> and the <italic>industrial relations system</italic>, where employers may use COPS as an instrument of labour management in their internal politics or in their relationship with trade unions (mechanism of class-political and organizational politics). The second covers <italic>public policies</italic>, because employers may react to public pension policies or be susceptible to public subsidies (mechanism of substitution and complementarity). The third is the <italic>financial market</italic>, where employers may use COPS in their financing and investment policies and may be strongly affected by other entrepreneurs, notably the vested interests of the capital market industry (mechanism of investment politics). <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0959680112474882">Table 1</xref> summarizes the various causal factors discussed in the literature and groups them into the three domains and the three main causal mechanisms.</p>

<p>The following accounts preserve the historical specificity of each case while addressing the same questions for each, namely whether employers’ preferences are affected by the three mechanisms of class-political and organizational politics, substitution and complementarity and investment politics. The three studies thus seek to open the black box of how and why employers’ preferences are endogenous and affected by the three main context domains. Thus the historical sequences and peculiarities of the cases are respected and preserved. The contextualized comparison of the three countries serves to analyse which mechanisms were present and to highlight how they generated the three trajectories of employers’ preferences towards COPS (as promoters, vacillators or adversaries).</p>

<title>Sweden: Employers as promoters</title>
<p>Of the Nordic countries, Sweden has the longest tradition of COPS; there are national collectively negotiated systems for white-collar workers (<italic>Industrins och handelns tilläggspension</italic>, ITP, established in 1960) and for blue-collar workers (<italic>Särskild tilläggspension</italic>, STP, 1973), both defined benefit schemes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0959680112474882">Trampusch et al., 2010</xref>, SWE: 4). These schemes benefit from generous tax deductions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0959680112474882">Lindquist and Wadensjö, 2011</xref>: 256) and cover around 90 percent of all employees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0959680112474882">Berg, 2004</xref>: 5). While COPS provides only 10 to 15 percent of the pension income of lower-paid retirees, for the higher-paid it can be as high as 50 or 60 percent (interview SWE 1). The COPS are governed by the social partners, and companies have three ways of funding pension benefits: pension funds, pension insurance and book reserves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0959680112474882">Trampusch et al., 2010</xref>, SWE: 6). Whereas the ITP scheme was initiated by the unions, the STP scheme was an employer initiative (interview SWE 1).</p>
<p>Swedish employers pushed for COPS: remarkably, even in the face of resistance from the blue-collar unions, which in crucial phases of the Swedish welfare state, in particular in the 1950s and 1960s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0959680112474882">Øverbye, 1996</xref>: 163–167), prioritized public provision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0959680112474882">Heclo, 1975</xref>: 233–234; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0959680112474882">Kangas and Palme, 1989</xref>: 13; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0959680112474882">Korpi, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0959680112474882">Swenson, 2002</xref>: 304). But today, blue-collar unions also strongly favour COPS, which they now view as a source of membership recruitment and a barrier against the expansion of company-based schemes, which endanger workers’ loyalty to unions (interview SWE 1). It is important to note that, before the establishment of national COPS, certain large firms provided company-based occupational schemes not only for white-collar but also for blue-collar workers, as surveys of the Swedish Employers’ Association (<italic>Svenska Arbetsgivareföreningen</italic>, SAF) from the 1950s indicate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0959680112474882">Wadensjö, 1997</xref>: 282–285). The first pension fund for private employees was established in 1916, and such funds became particularly widespread for white-collar workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0959680112474882">Kangas and Palme, 1996</xref>: 217); the establishment of COPS meant that employers transferred these schemes into the central bargaining arena.</p>
<p>How was the proactive involvement of employers affected by the three mechanisms of class-political and organizational politics, substitution and complementarity and investment politics? First of all, from the outset their support for COPS was prompted by their (equally, but not exclusively, class-politically motivated) dissatisfaction with the public pension system. For example, in 1952 a special SAF subcommittee recommended a clear preference for COPS over a public pension scheme because a state-funded system harmed the private capital market and private savings deposits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0959680112474882">Heclo, 1975</xref>: 235). Fearing pension fund socialism controlled by unions and social democrats, employers, together with the conservatives and liberals, already favoured collectively negotiated pensions in the 1940s and 1950s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0959680112474882">Heclo, 1975</xref>: 233–235; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0959680112474882">Kangas and Palme, 1996</xref>: 217–218). However, the demand by the blue-collar union confederation, the LO, for a public scheme succeeded; but the public pension scheme (<italic>Allmän tilläggspension</italic>, ATP) won only a one-vote majority in parliament when it was established in 1959 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0959680112474882">Lindquist and Wadensjö, 2011</xref>: 247). Employers did not abandon the campaign and, in the 1970s, began concluding separate agreements on pensions; indeed the ATP system actually stimulated employers to negotiate collective agreements on pensions and to develop the STP and ITP schemes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0959680112474882">Kangas and Palme, 1996</xref>: 238). This historical record indicates that the mechanisms of class-political politics and of complementarity and substitution (with regard to public schemes) were at work.</p>
<p>In Sweden, not only public policies and class politics but also wage bargaining and union structure have decisively influenced employers in their position on COPS. It is also important to note that Swedish union density has been higher than in Denmark and, even more so, than in Norway. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0959680112474882">Kangas and Palme (1989</xref>: 47–48), one of the main reasons that employers supported COPS in the 1970s and 1980s was their interest in limiting competition between firms and in facilitating labour mobility (interview SWE 1). Eventually, because of inflation and high taxes, the room for wage increases was restricted, and employers preferred to pay pensions instead of wage increases. Employers’ interest in wage control also led to the centralized bargaining system which, according to the seminal study of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0959680112474882">Swenson (2002)</xref> on Swedish welfare capitalism, also explains employers’ strong preference for centralized and solidaristic welfare schemes instead of company-based solutions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0959680112474882">3</xref></sup> Extending Swenson’s argument, the decentralization of the Swedish bargaining system in the 1980s may have discouraged employer support for public benefits while, at the same time, encouraging the employers to negotiate with unions on pensions (in order to inhibit wage increases). Likewise, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0959680112474882">Iversen (1996</xref>: 423–424) contends that the change to a more decentralized and flexible bargaining system in Sweden (and Denmark) has strengthened the role of sectoral associations in collective bargaining. Although one of our interviewees also confirmed that the decentralization of the Swedish bargaining system prompted the development of COPS (interview SWE 1), they were introduced in 1960 and 1973, before the ‘first breakthrough for employers advocates’ of decentralization, which was in 1983 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0959680112474882">Swenson and Pontusson, 2000</xref>: 82).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0959680112474882">4</xref></sup> Last but not least, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0959680112474882">Øverbye (1996</xref>: 163) highlights that the structure of Swedish trade unions was also conducive to employer involvement in developing COPS: because white-collar and blue-collar unions have their own organizations, employers can conclude collective agreements on pensions separately for these two types of workers. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0959680112474882">Øverbye (1998</xref>: 178) argues that ‘this division of labour enabled’ the unions and the employers ‘to set up the ITP scheme back in 1959 without having to include blue-collar workers in the deal’.</p>
<p>What about our third context domain, the financial market? There is evidence that investment politics were also of importance. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0959680112474882">Kangas and Palme (1989</xref>: 47–48), one reason employers supported COPS in the 1980s was their interest in using the funded pension assets for investment. As the system expanded, COPS funds in 1984, for example, corresponded to 49 percent of the ATP funds, as against only 24 percent in 1978 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0959680112474882">Kangas and Palme, 1989</xref>: 48).</p>
<p>We can sum up the developments in Sweden as follows: unlike in Denmark and Norway, as will be argued below, employers agreed to COPS at a relatively early stage. Furthermore, the processes by which their preferences were affected were at work in all three context domains. Taking the secondary literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0959680112474882">Kangas and Palme, 1989</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0959680112474882">1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0959680112474882">Nordheim Nielsen, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0959680112474882">Øverbye, 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0959680112474882">1998</xref>) and the interviews as a useful yardstick, it seems reasonable to argue that all three mechanisms were decisive, with employers opting for COPS, first because they used these as an instrument of labour management in their internal politics or in their relationship with trade unions, second, because they reacted to public pension policies and third, because they used COPS for investments.</p>

<title>Denmark: Employers as vacillators</title>
<p>In Denmark also, COPS are today widespread, well developed and supported by employers, covering 90 percent of all employees in the private sector and 100 percent in the public sector. Labour market pensions or AMP (<italic>Arbejdsmarkedspensionerne</italic>) were established through sectoral collective bargaining in 1989 in the public sector and 1991 in the private, as defined contribution schemes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0959680112474882">Trampusch et al., 2010</xref>, DK: 2, 11). The first private sector agreement was in metalworking in 1991, and in 1993 (an employer contribution of 0.9 percent of wages was specified; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0959680112474882">Kangas et al., 2006</xref>: 32). Today, pensions form part of nearly all collective agreements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0959680112474882">Andersen, 2011</xref>: 197), and recently the employers’ confederation <italic>Dansk Arbejdsgiverforening</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0959680112474882">DA, 2009</xref>) reported that 9 to 10 percent of wages are now invested in the AMP. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0959680112474882">Kangas et al. (2006</xref>: 32), the AMP have even ‘crowded out national pensions’. There are also tax subsidies, and the funds and insurance companies invest globally, having become increasingly professionalized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0959680112474882">Andersen, 2011</xref>: 202–204).</p>
<p>As in Sweden, company-based OPS historically preceded COPS in Denmark: particularly in the public sector, they were already included in collective agreements in the 1960s and 1970s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0959680112474882">Andersen, 2011</xref>: 191–192; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0959680112474882">Nordheim Nielsen, 1996</xref>: 244–245; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0959680112474882">Green-Pedersen and Lindbom, 2006</xref>: 252). However, this development was hindered by legal regulations, which prescribed that pension entitlements are transferable across employments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0959680112474882">Nordheim Nielsen, 1996</xref>: 244). Nevertheless, the percentage of wage earners with OPS increased from 20 in the mid-1960s to around 35 in the mid-1980s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0959680112474882">Green-Pedersen and Lindbom, 2006</xref>: 253).</p>
<p>Analysis of the period between the 1980s and 1990s reveals that the Danish trajectory contrasts sharply with the Swedish in three respects. First, historically, in the formative phase of COPS, employers were quite reluctant and sceptical about these schemes; they became more interested and involved only when the collective bargaining system entered a period of decentralization and flexibility in wage bargaining, when COPS were linked to wage restraint and the defined contribution principle was introduced. This was also highlighted by one of our interviewees (interview DK 1). Second, the initial introduction of COPS was more the result of government fiscal policies, which sought to balance the public budget (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0959680112474882">Due and Madsen, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0959680112474882">Kangas et al., 2006</xref>: 32–33), than a strategic employer demand. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0959680112474882">Kangas et al. (2006</xref>: 33) highlight the significant dependence of labour market pensions on ‘the acute fiscal crisis and ad-hoc solutions’. Third, there is no evidence that the formation of employers’ preferences was linked to firms’ investment policies (interview DK 1). The general insight that can be drawn by comparing Denmark and Sweden is that employers are creative actors and, depending on the dynamic of collective bargaining, may change their preferences and switch from reluctance to support. In Denmark, the processes by which employers decided in favour of COPS were clearly affected by the industrial relations system and the labour market, whereas the domains of public policies and financial markets were unimportant in shaping employers’ preferences (though as noted, they did facilitate the establishment of COPS as such).</p>
<p>In Denmark the idea of COPS was initially opposed not only by employers but also by some trade union members and leaders. In the 1970s and 1980s, the manual workers’ confederation LO sought to achieve pension reform in the political arena rather than through collective bargaining, but this proved impossible. LO then launched an initiative in 1985 to introduce labour market pensions, statutory for all members and run by a pension fund under the control of the trade unions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0959680112474882">Due and Madsen, 2007</xref>: 2). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0959680112474882">Nordheim Nielsen (1996</xref>: 242), this proposal was also an attempt to satisfy different objectives (capital formation, social policy and wage restraint) through one institution. Neither the centre-right government nor employers were in favour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0959680112474882">Nordheim Nielsen, 1996</xref>: 251). Employers feared ‘economic democracy through the backdoor’ and ‘resistance among employers therefore ran high’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0959680112474882">Due and Madsen, 2007</xref>: 2). On the other hand, the government was keen on a compromise that would create supportive framework legislation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0959680112474882">Nordheim Nielsen, 1986</xref>: 4–5); and in December 1987 the government and LO signed a joint declaration. LO agreed to accept competition-enhancing wage policy, while the government agreed to support the establishment of AMP, including the implementation of the necessary statutory instruments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0959680112474882">Due and Madsen, 2007</xref>: 3). Reasons for government support were that the COPS proposed were in line with the objectives of increasing private savings and fighting the balance-of-payments deficit, and because LO offered wage restraint in return (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0959680112474882">Green-Pedersen, 2007</xref>: 480–484; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0959680112474882">Green-Pedersen and Lindbom, 2006</xref>: 253). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0959680112474882">Andersen (2011</xref>: 189–193) contends that the introduction of COPS was first of all triggered by a deficit crisis and that finance ministers were already demanding the inclusion of pensions in collective agreements in the mid-1980s. In 1989, the ‘government accelerated the process’ by incorporating labour market pensions into the agreements in the public sector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0959680112474882">Andersen, 2011</xref>: 190).</p>
<p>It is interesting to note that, after offering strong initial resistance, the employers changed their position. This U-turn was mainly conditioned by the decentralization of collective bargaining, as this process went hand in hand with the aspiration of sectoral associations to strengthen their position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0959680112474882">Due and Madsen, 2007</xref>: 5). One of our interviewees insisted that the employers would not have agreed to COPS without this decentralization of the bargaining system (interview DK 1). In addition, around 1990 Danish employers sought to strengthen their organizations and ‘had an interest in setting their new position’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0959680112474882">Due and Madsen, 2007</xref>: 5). The defined contribution principle also played a supporting role, as employers only needed to pay contributions, not guarantee benefits (interview DK 1). Employers also succeeded in having the pensions implemented as company-based models, enabling firms, in collaboration with the unions, to decide on investment policies for the funds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0959680112474882">Due and Madsen, 2007</xref>: 6). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0959680112474882">Kangas et al. (2006</xref>: 32) contend that ‘this compromise made it possible for the employers to support the new pension arrangement because they would now be able to influence the investments made by the funds’. Finally, the support of employers for the current system is also conditioned by the fact that the COPS are linked to wage restraint (interview DK 1).</p>
<p>To sum up, the Danish record reveals that, under certain conditions, reluctant employers may become supporters of COPS. In Denmark, it was the dynamic of decentralized wage bargaining that prompted employers to alter their position. Again, the historical record confirms that politics matter and that employers’ decisions on COPS have to be analysed against the background of the specific historical and political-economic context. In contrast to Sweden, it was only and mainly the mechanism of class-political and organizational politics which affected employers’ preferences with regard to COPS. The historical record does not confirm that processes of substitution and complementarity or investment politics were major influences on employers’ preference formation, although later changes give employers a voice in the funds’ investment policies.</p>

<sec id="section5-0959680112474882">
<title>Norway: Employers as adversaries</title>
<p>In Norway, COPS as such have not been established, and recent attempts by unions to create them have met strong opposition from employers. This means that, of the three countries studied, Norway has the lowest level of employer support for COPS. The Norwegian trajectory is marked by two striking features. First, in the 1960s the unions were proactive supporters of negotiated pension schemes as a way to recruit members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0959680112474882">Hippe and Pedersen, 1996</xref>: 197), and obtained the so-called FTP (<italic>Felles tariffestet pensjonsordning</italic>) schemes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0959680112474882">Hippe and Pedersen, 1996</xref>: 197–198). These covered about two-thirds of private sector employees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0959680112474882">Pedersen, 2000</xref>: 9) but were abolished in 1967 when the public scheme (<italic>Folketrygdfondet</italic>) was introduced. Since 2001 the unions have again insisted on bringing the pension issue onto the bargaining table. Second, employers strongly oppose such collectively negotiated pension schemes and prefer company-based solutions. In short, the puzzle for the Norwegian case is why the employers are averse to transforming OPS into collective schemes?</p>
<p>As in Sweden and Denmark, in Norway there is a tradition of OPS created unilaterally by employers. In the private sector – until the schemes became mandatory in 2006 – these were in most cases provided by large and medium-sized employers, and were most common in the financial, manufacturing and transport sectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0959680112474882">Nergaard, 2004b</xref>). Contrary to government expectations, these company-based schemes were not crowded out by the introduction of the statutory pension scheme in the 1960s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0959680112474882">Hippe and Pedersen, 1996</xref>: 191, 200). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0959680112474882">Pedersen (2000</xref>: 9) contends that OPS ‘have their roots in strong historical traditions’ and have also benefited from tax concessions since the 1920s. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0959680112474882">Øverbye (1996</xref>: 173) reports that 59 percent of white-collar employees and 24 percent of blue-collar were covered by COPS in 1988. Over a decade later, approximately one third of all employees in the private sector were covered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0959680112474882">Nergaard, 2004d</xref>). The steady growth of OPS is not simply explained by favourable tax policies but also by cuts in the public provision in the 1990s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0959680112474882">Hippe and Pedersen, 1996</xref>: 2000). In the past decade, public support for OPS has been reinforced: since 2001 employers have received favourable tax treatment for defined contribution schemes (rather than, as formerly, for defined-benefit plans only). In 2006, it became mandatory for companies to establish OPS that satisfied certain minimum requirements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0959680112474882">Trampusch et al., 2010</xref>, NOR: 1). This rule is the result of failed negotiations on COPS in the 2004 bargaining round for the manufacturing sector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0959680112474882">Nergaard, 2004c</xref>). The government responded to a joint letter from employers and unions in which they called for OPS to be made mandatory (interview NOR 2); employers saw this as a means to prevent those firms providing OPS from suffering a competitive disadvantage (interview NOR 2).</p>
<p>The few minor regulations that now govern industrial agreements on pensions are all the result of union involvement. Since 2001, LO has regularly prioritized occupational pensions as part of wage and collective bargaining in the manufacturing and construction sectors, but employers have strongly resisted incorporating OPS into sectoral agreements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0959680112474882">Trampusch et al., 2010</xref>, NOR). Only voluntary rules relating to OPS have been introduced into the industrial agreements of offshore engineering and shipbuilding, building and construction, and the media sectors (interview NOR 2; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0959680112474882">Lismoen, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0959680112474882">Nergaard, 2001</xref>). According to the latest LO action programme, OPS are underdeveloped because they contribute only ‘5 percentage points to the pension benefits paid out over the life time’; LO complains that employers are cutting funding for OPS and demands ‘a broad, collective occupational pensions scheme’ in order to ensure sufficient income for pensioners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0959680112474882">LO, 2009</xref>: 22).</p>
<p>The reasons for the employers’ opposition are the fear of ‘competitive imbalance between companies with and without collective agreements’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0959680112474882">Nergaard, 2004a</xref>), the opposition of small firms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0959680112474882">Nergaard, 2001</xref>), the potential negative consequences for vulnerable industries in the private sector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0959680112474882">Trampusch et al., 2010</xref>, NOR: 9), the fear of losing control and autonomy over pension arrangements to unions (interview NOR 2), and the structure of Norwegian trade unions, where both blue and white-collar workers are organized in one union. Consequently, employers prefer company-based schemes because, unlike COPS, they can be better adjusted to the special needs of individual firms and help to prevent different systems from operating in a single company (interview NOR 1). In the 2002 sectoral bargaining round, the employers’ confederation, NHO (<italic>Næringslivets Hovedorganisasjon</italic>), instructed its member associations to be strict in this regard, and employers agreed to wage increases simply to prevent pensions being added to the sectoral bargaining agenda (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0959680112474882">Lismoen, 2002</xref>). In an important strategy paper, the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0959680112474882">NHO (2003</xref>: 18) contended that ‘occupational pensions are a matter to be decided by the individual company, and are not part of wage agreements’.</p>
<p>The NHO prefers OPS managed by individual firms to COPS, and supports small and medium-sized firms in building up company-based pensions (interview NOR 1). In the 2003 strategy paper, it pointed out that it was working on a defined-contribution scheme that ‘will be offered to the NHO member companies’ and that it had successfully introduced more flexible rules into the OPS. From this it follows that the NHO seeks to use occupational pensions as an organizational resource and selective incentive within its own association. The main cause it uses occupational pensions as a means of organization-building is that there is no special association for small and medium-sized firms in Norway, and the NHO, which is dominated by large firms, has to consider the interests of smaller firms as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0959680112474882">Nergaard, 2010</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0959680112474882">Bowman (1998</xref>: 310) highlights that ‘managing the tension between small and large employers’ is in fact ‘one of the principle problems’ of the organization.</p>
<p>Despite their sceptical attitude towards COPS, in 1988 Norwegian employers were willing to approve collectively negotiated early retirement schemes covering most of the private sector (<italic>Avtalefestet pensjon</italic>, AFP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0959680112474882">Nergaard, 2008</xref>: 3; interview NOR 1); these was introduced as part of an incomes policy compromise, and employers agreed because they were seeking wage restraint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0959680112474882">Trampusch et al., 2010</xref>, NOR-ER: 1). They are important for our analysis because they have been increasingly transformed into pension schemes (interviews NOR 1, NOR 2), particularly in order to compensate for the cuts in public pension benefits implemented by the last pension reform, in effect since January 2011 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0959680112474882">Nergaard, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0959680112474882">2008</xref>). According to one of our interviewees (interview NOR 1), AFP has thus changed into a life-long pension scheme supplementing the <italic>Folketrygdfondet</italic> and on average now covers a quarter of employees’ pension income. In 2000, some 18 percent of the Norwegian population between the ages of 62 and 67 collected AFP pensions, 75 to 80 percent of whom enjoyed full pension rights (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0959680112474882">Lismoen, 2001</xref>). This process has been strongly supported by the employers (interview NOR 1), in all likelihood because one third of the costs of the early retirement schemes are paid by the state. Paradoxically, the agreements on early retirement were introduced during a phase which <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0959680112474882">Dølvik and Stokland (1992</xref>: 155) call the ‘revival of centralized corporatism’ – a fact that contradicts Swenson’s decentralization argument.</p>
<p>Contrasting the Norwegian trajectory with Sweden and Denmark, we can conclude that whether or not the mechanism of class-political and organizational politics conditions employers’ preference formation is strongly affected by the structure of the trade unions. Where blue and white-collar workers are organized in one union, employers may prefer company-based OPS to COPS. From this it follows that it is not in the automatic interest of employers to use COPS as an instrument in their relationship with trade unions: they may also prefer company-based pension schemes. From recent NHO statements it becomes clear that the latter uses occupational pensions as a selective incentive for small and medium-sized firms and favours this organizational form over collectively negotiated schemes. It thus uses occupational pensions as an instrument in the internal politics of its association and does not intend to use these schemes as an instrument in its relationship with trade unions or in wage bargaining.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>From the perspective of historical institutionalism, the statement that preferences are not exogenously fixed but endogenous to specific conditions of decision-making is not a truism but an important research challenge. With regard to COPS, such a perspective means that employers with the same basic interests in collective bargaining may have different preferences, albeit for different reasons. Accordingly, this study has respected the historical peculiarities of employers’ decisions on COPS. It does not provide a causal analysis of their development but a deeper understanding of the causal mechanisms responsible for employers’ preference formation. In short, it seeks to assess how employers arrive at their preferences regarding COPS.</p>
<p>Our three countries offer a sharp contrast in employers’ preference formation towards COPS. In order to highlight how employers’ preferences have been constructed, the present article has used previous comparative research into employers’ involvement in OPS as a frame of reference. In particular, the objective has not been to test an historical explanation but rather to offer a deeper understanding of <italic>how</italic> and <italic>why</italic> employers’ preferences regarding COPS crucially depend on the political-economic institutional context within which their activities are embedded. On the basis of existing literature, the study has identified three context domains – industrial relations and the labour market, public policies and the financial market – connected to three specific causal mechanisms of preference formation, whereby employers may decide in favour of COPS because they use these as an instrument of labour management in their internal company organization or in their relationship with trade unions, because they react to public pension policies or because they use COPS for investments.</p>
<p>What are the main findings and broader lessons of our contextualized comparison? First, our study has shown that for the Swedish trajectory of employers as promoters of COPS all three mechanisms have been decisive, whereas for the Danish trajectory of employers as vacillators and the Norwegian trajectory of employers as adversaries, it was clearly the mechanism of class-political and organizational politics that affected the employers’ preference formation process. Second, contrary to our theoretical expectations, the dynamics of financial systems appear to be of lesser importance. Third, it seems reasonable to argue that there is no linear relationship between the degree of centralization of collective bargaining systems and employers’ welfare scheme preferences. Whereas the Swedish employers already supported COPS in times of relatively centralized bargaining, the Danes only became supportive when the collective bargaining system was decentralized. As in Sweden, the Norwegian experience of the early retirement schemes (which have recently been changed into pension benefits) also shows that centralized bargaining did not discourage employers from showing an interest in collectively negotiated social benefits. Finally, the divergent trajectories of employers’ preferences regarding COPS lead to the general insight that the functioning of causal mechanisms itself depends on context. The mechanism of class-political and organizational politics may result in employers as promoters (Sweden), vacillators (Denmark) or adversaries (Norway) in relation to COPS. This result confirms the finding of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0959680112474882">Faletti and Lynch (2009</xref>: 1143, 1147), who argue that, although mechanisms are portable concepts, their functioning and contribution to a particular outcome depend on the particular institutional or temporal context of decision-making.</p>
