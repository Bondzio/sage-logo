<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Substance abuse treatment is an expanding industry in the United States, with a total expenditure reported at $22 billion in 2005, representing an annual growth rate of 4.8% from 1986 to 2005 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0193841X12450164">Mark et al. 2011</xref>). The vast majority (81%) of the industry is financed by federal, state, and local governments (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration [SAMHSA] 2003). Some of the most difficult decisions that state governments face are which substance abuse treatment programs to fund and where to set service reimbursement rates. In principle, only programs that meet some minimum set of performance standards should be funded, and reimbursement rates should be linked to the economic (opportunity) cost of service provision,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0193841X12450164">1</xref></sup> clinical outcomes, and economic benefits. In reality, performance standards are hard to define and enforce, and reimbursement rates are often based on crude approximations of operating costs or outdated formulas based solely on capacity estimates.</p>
<p>Little guidance exists on how service reimbursement rates should be calculated for treatment programs, especially given differences in performance, client characteristics, setting, location, and resource costs. Even among programs within the same modality, there are considerable differences in range and intensity of services provided, types of clients served, and location of the program. These factors contribute to the legitimate variation in treatment costs and make it challenging to calculate standardized reimbursement rates. One potential reimbursement strategy is to use mean program cost per client. Yet, even focusing on modality-specific costs ignores the diversity of treatment programs currently operating in the United States. A potential consequence of failing to recognize and adjust for these factors is reduced access to treatment for persons with multiple disabilities (e.g., severe mental illness, pregnant women and/or those with children, criminal justice referrals, HIV-infected; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0193841X12450164">Cartwright 2008b</xref>). Similarly, the lack of periodic rate adjustments to reflect increases in operating costs could cause the elimination of services to the most difficult-to-treat clients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0193841X12450164">Hser et al. 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>As an alternative to mean cost per patient, the Center for Substance Abuse Treatment recently developed a set of modality-specific substance abuse treatment âcost bandsâ that policy makers could use to guide rate-setting decisions (SAMHSA 2004). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0193841X12450164">French, Popovici, and Tapsell (2008)</xref> updated the original cost bands using more recent and comprehensive data from multiyear/multiprogram cost studies based on the Drug Abuse Treatment Cost Analysis Program (DATCAP). While cost bands are preferable to point estimates such as mean cost, numerous limitations are present here as well, such as extremely wide ranges, the inability to adjust for case mix, little guidance on how to reimburse outside the range, and the absence of structural and inflationary adjustments over time as treatment services and resource costs change.</p>
<p>Given the pressing need for current, rigorous, and state-specific economic cost information to assist policy makers with their funding decisions, the University of Miami partnered with the Department of Children and Families (DCF) within the Florida state government to determine the economic cost of publicly funded substance abuse treatment in Florida. This initiative is the first statewide assessment of treatment costs and by far the largest administration of the DATCAP in a single study. A key aim of this investigation is to estimate modality-specific costs for both a typical week and an average episode of treatment. To meet these objectives, we compiled and analyzed data from 175 publicly funded substance abuse treatment programs that completed the Brief DATCAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0193841X12450164">French et al. 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0193841X12450164">Bradley, French, and Rachal 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0193841X12450164">French and McGeary 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0193841X12450164">French et al. 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0193841X12450164">Roebuck, French, and McLellan, 2003</xref>; www.DATCAP.com).</p>
<p>In the following section, we further discuss the Brief DATCAP instrument and the method for calculating economic costs and describe program recruitment, data collection, and other key measures. Then, we present results of the data analyses as well as outlier adjustments. Finally, we highlight the strengths and limitations of the research, discuss policy implications, and make recommendations for future studies.</p>

<title>Brief DATCAP</title>
<p>The Brief DATCAP is a program-level data collection instrument designed to estimate the costs of substance abuse treatment programs based on standard economic principles. It can be used in a variety of treatment settings including adult- and adolescent-specific treatment, hospital-based treatment, and criminal justice settings. The DATCAP was the first standardized approach to collect resource-use data and estimate the economic costs of substance abuse treatment for individual programs and clients. The instrument has undergone several transformations since the early 1990s to improve clarity, coverage, respondent burden, electronic entry, and precision. For previous versions and improvements on the DATCAP, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0193841X12450164">French et al. (1997)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0193841X12450164">French and McGeary (1997)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0193841X12450164">Dunlap and French (1998)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0193841X12450164">French, SalomÃ©, and Carney (2002b)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0193841X12450164">French et al.

(2003b)</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0193841X12450164">Zavala et al. (2005)</xref>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0193841X12450164">Roebuck, French, and McLellan (2003)</xref> published the first summary article of all DATCAP studies to date, which amounted to 85 substance abuse treatment programs across 9 modalities. A second summary article, which included 25 additional programs, was published a few years later (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0193841X12450164">French, Popovici, and Tapsell 2008</xref>). The current edition of the Brief DATCAP instrument can be found at www.DATCAP.com.</p>
<p>The DATCAP is designed to collect and organize detailed information on resources used in service delivery and their associated opportunity cost. Resource categories include personnel, supplies and materials, contracted services, buildings and facilities, equipment, and miscellaneous items. The instrument also collects information on client case flows such as the total number of admissions, average daily census, and average length of stay. The DATCAP estimates are standardized, based on established economic cost methods, and incorporate both direct program costs and the opportunity cost (i.e., economic value) of donated and subsidized resources. Data are collected directly from program officials with the assistance of a researcher trained to administer the DATCAP. An instruction manual is also provided to program personnel along with the actual data collection instrument. Total annual economic cost is based on data reported for the six resource categories. Estimates for average (per client) weekly and episode costs are calculated using average daily census, average length of stay in treatment, and total annual cost.</p>
<p>Following conventional practice in the literature, we categorized the 175 participating programs into the following modalities: methadone maintenance, adult outpatient, adolescent outpatient, intensive outpatient (i.e., day treatment), adult residential, adolescent residential, and detoxification. All of the financial information was collected in 2010 and pertains to the 2009 calendar year or to the 2008â2009 fiscal year.</p>
<p>After assembling the data, we calculated means, medians, standard deviations, and interquartile ranges (i.e., values corresponding to 25th and 75th percentiles of the distribution) for annual, weekly, and episode costs for each treatment modality. The interquartile range is not reported for methadone maintenance due to the very small sample size for this modality.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0193841X12450164">
<title>Program Selection and Recruitment</title>
<p>The study was initiated in February 2010. The research team consisted of nine individuals with specialized training in health economics and health services research. The first stage of the project involved four overlapping phases: (1) program selection, (2) program recruitment, (3) data collection, and (4) final review. Participating treatment agencies progressed through the stages at different times, depending on management engagement, staff availability, recordkeeping practices, and other factors.</p>
<sec id="section5-0193841X12450164">
<title>Program selection</title>
<p>The target population included all licensed substance abuse treatment providers in Florida that received any amount of public funding. Because the initial inclusion criteria had few restrictions, the census of agencies comprised organizations that were no longer operating as well as those that were not necessarily delivering standard models of substance abuse treatment. Such programs self-reported their mission as outreach, intervention, halfway house, drop-in center, aftercare, and other miscellaneous services. Thus, for the core analysis, we excluded any provider that could not definitively be classified as methadone maintenance, adult outpatient, adolescent outpatient, intensive outpatient, adult residential, adolescent residential, or detoxification. The final census amounted to 84 eligible agencies, which included providers from each of the six geographical regions delineated by DCF: Northwest, Northeast, Central, Suncoast, Southeast, and Southern Florida (see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0193841X12450164">Appendix A</xref>). The vast majority of programs (97%) are private not-for-profit providers, all but three programs operate in the community, and the mean (median) number of admissions during the analysis year was 380 (152) clients.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0193841X12450164">
<title>Program recruitment</title>
<p>The recruitment phase was a multistep process that included mailings, phone calls, and e-mails. Recruitment packages containing an introductory letter, contact information, and copies of data collection instruments were mailed to key agency representatives. The Research Coordinator for each region also contacted the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) or top program administrator at each of these agencies to personally introduce the study, establish rapport, answer questions, and suggest a plan for data collection. In cases where it proved especially difficult to reach the CEO or other high-level administrators, the recruitment process was extended to include site visits, wherein Research Coordinators would meet personally with agency representatives to discuss the study and secure their commitment to participate.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-0193841X12450164">
<title>Data collection and final review</title>
<p>The data collection phase overlapped with the recruitment phase of the study. Site visits were conducted with numerous agencies to enhance communication and to outline procedures for data collection. During the site visits, Research Coordinators reviewed the data collection instruments with agency representatives, addressed any questions or concerns, and developed a customized time line for submission of all data. The source materials that agency staff typically used to complete the DATCAP included audit and annual reports, payroll ledgers, invoices, counselor and other clinical records, equipment purchases, rental agreements, vender contracts, real estate listings, and insurance reimbursements. Agencies varied considerably in availability and quality of source materials. Ongoing communication via follow-up phone calls and e-mails was continued at least once a week to answer questions and assist agency personnel in completing the study instruments. After preliminary data submission, members of the study team worked with agency personnel to complete missing information, clarify resource utilization, estimate the value of donated or subsidized resources, and finalize cost estimation.</p>
<p>The research team met on a weekly basis to review survey responses and to discuss any questions or challenges encountered during the data collection phase. Each Brief DATCAP was reviewed by at least two members of the research team to ensure that data were consistent and included all pertinent information. Upon completion of the final review, agencies were sent a Results Report summarizing total costs for each program, cost per resource category, and various other cost statistics (i.e., annual program cost, annual cost per client, weekly cost per client, and average cost per treatment episode). Agencies were asked to review the Results Report and sign a DATCAP Agreement Form stating that they approved the numbers presented in the report. Once the DATCAP Agreement Form was signed and returned, program identifiers were removed from the files and data were aggregated into the main analysis database.</p>
<p>The program recruitment, data collection, and final review phases were lengthy and involved for some programs, but relatively short and straightforward for others. Depending on program size, availability of data, and other factors, project personnel invested 5â25 hr per program to collect and finalize the cost data. On average (i.e., per program), it took about 15 person hr over a period of 3 weeks to obtain a completed DATCAP. These estimates can be used by future studies to guide resource requirements and timelines, but like the cost estimates themselves, expect considerable variation in effort across programs.</p>

<sec id="section8-0193841X12450164">
<title>Response Rates by Region and Modality</title>
<p>The study targeted all substance abuse treatment programs in the state of Florida that received any amount of public funding in 2010. A total of 247 programs (84 agencies) met this criterion, and 175 programs (58 agencies) agreed to participate in the study, resulting in a response rate of 71%.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0193841X12450164">2</xref></sup> The majority of nonparticipating programs had few clients and a small staff. Participation rates were uneven across regions, ranging from 40% in the Southeast to 89% in the Southern region. This variation was partly due to differences in the organization of substance abuse treatment across regions. For example, agencies located in the Southern and Suncoast regions are led by regional provider coalitions that assisted in recruiting efforts. The response rate for the Northwest region was also high, as a few large agencies with multiple programs participated in the study. Overall, the Central region had the most programs participating (40 programs or 23% of all programs) in the study. The vast majority of participants (97%) were community-based not-for-profit providers. Program size, as measured by total annual admissions, ranged from 3 to 3,627 clients, with a mean (median) of 380 (152) clients.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0193841X12450164">Table 1</xref> reports modality-specific response rates. Adolescent outpatient programs were the most likely to participate (82%), while intensive outpatient programs had the lowest response rate (56%). Adult outpatient is the modality with the highest number of participating programs (60) and methadone maintenance has the fewest (3).</p>

</table-wrap>
<p>The results indicate sizable variations in weekly and episode costs across modalities, which can be explained by the substantial differences in types of populations served, therapeutic approach, range and intensity of services provided, types of substance abuse problems addressed, and location of the treatment programs. For example, the average weekly cost per client for methadone maintenance ($90) is considerably below that for adult outpatient ($360) and intensive outpatient ($443). Given its short duration and high intensity, detoxification has the highest weekly cost per client ($2,158), which is nearly double that for adult residential ($1,130).</p>
<p>The ordering across modalities changes somewhat when comparing the average cost per treatment episode. With an average length of stay of 92 weeks, methadone maintenance now has a higher average episode cost ($8,624) than detoxification ($2,303). Most detoxification programs retain clients for about 1 week, implying that the average weekly cost per client ($2,158) is nearly identical to the cost per client for an average treatment episode. Adult outpatient programs have the highest average episode cost ($27,359), followed closely by adolescent residential programs ($24,328).</p>
<p>Most of the standard deviations presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0193841X12450164">Table 2</xref> are greater than the corresponding mean values, indicating that the distributions are wide and outliers are likely. Thus, as an alternative measure of central tendency, we also report median values for each variable. The median values are almost always smaller than the mean values, which demonstrate that most of the distributions have extreme outliers at the upper tail. For example, the mean weekly cost per client among the adolescent outpatient programs is about twice the median value ($364 vs. $178) and the mean cost per client for an average treatment episode is almost 3.5 times as large ($8,784 vs. $2,528). Similar order-of-magnitude findings emerge for adult outpatient and, to a lesser extent, intensive outpatient.</p>

<title>Outlier Analysis and Modality-Specific Interquartile Ranges</title>
<p>For a variety of reasons (e.g., extreme values for average length of stay or average daily census, economies of scale associated with relatively large programs, and excess capacity), a few of the program-specific estimates for weekly and episode costs fall considerably above or below the mean values for a particular modality. These outliers can significantly influence the mean cost values and the corresponding confidence intervals. To address this issue, we first âwinsorizedâ the distributions by replacing observations that were in the upper and lower 10% of annual, weekly, and episode costs for each modality with the next closest value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0193841X12450164">Cox 1998</xref>). After performing this adjustment, we recalculated all of the estimates reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0193841X12450164">Table 2.</xref> Most of the mean weekly and episode cost estimates show little or no change, with a few notable exceptions (full results available on request). The average weekly cost estimate for adolescent outpatient declines by $100. Average episode cost decreases by $15,000 for intensive outpatient and $8,000 for adult outpatient. After winsorizing the modality-specific cost estimates, adolescent residential now has the highest average episode cost (over $20,000), followed by adult outpatient ($19,174), and adult residential ($17,594).</p>
<p>In addition to mean and median values, we calculated interquartile ranges for each treatment modality. Cost ranges allow policy makers to see the variability in cost estimates and are useful in setting reimbursement rates (SAMHSA 2004). It should be emphasized, however, that all measures of central tendency can be very noisy, especially when sample sizes are relatively small. We calculated interquartile ranges for annual, weekly, and episode costs for all modalities except methadone maintenance (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0193841X12450164">Table 3</xref>). Some modalities have fairly tight distributions, while others have highly variable cost estimates. For example, the interquartile range for the average weekly cost for adult residential is numerically wide ($516â$1,444) relative to adolescent outpatient ($88â$351). The interquartile ranges for average episode cost show more variability, with intensive outpatient programs having the widest range ($2,064â$13,788) and detoxification programs the narrowest range ($1,134â$2,093).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The substance abuse treatment industry, funding agencies, and other stakeholders are faced with a paucity of standardized cost information when deciding which programs and services to support. Rather than conducting a large national study of a sample of substance abuse treatment programs, statewide studies are more feasible and generalizable, and less costly. The present research was initiated in early 2010 with the overarching objective to estimate the economic costs of publicly funded substance abuse treatment in the state of Florida. Data collection progressed throughout 2010 culminating in a final statewide sample of 175 distinct substance abuse treatment programs (71% response rate among all programs receiving public funding).</p>
<p>In many respects, Florida is an ideal setting for such a study. It is the fourth most populous state in the United States and the 22nd largest geographically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0193841X12450164">McGovern 2007</xref>). Several large cities and metropolitan areas are scattered around pockets of rural sections. Racial and ethnic diversity abound, particularly in the southeastern part of the state. Age and income distributions are also highly variable. With 593 licensed substance abuse treatment facilities serving 49,002 clients on March 31, 2010 (SAMHSA 2010), Florida has a similar profile of programs and clients to those in Texas, Illinois, and Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>The mean and median cost estimates that are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0193841X12450164">Table 2</xref> display predictable ordering across modalities. Weekly costs are highest among detoxification programs and lowest among methadone maintenance programs. Episode costs are highest among adult outpatient programs and lowest among detoxification programs. Across all programs, total annual accounting cost is about 95% of total annual economic cost, ranging from 33% to 100% for specific programs. Most of the differences between accounting and economic cost consists of donated materials, equipment, and supplies, and volunteer labor. In addition, a few agencies own their buildings and do not have to pay rent or a mortgage.</p>
<p>The current study includes modalities not previously examined by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0193841X12450164">French, Popovici, and Tapsell (2008)</xref> (e.g., adolescent residential and detoxification). When comparing modalities that were reported in previous studies, however, the current cost estimates have greater variability and higher mean values.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0193841X12450164">3</xref></sup> Differences in interquartile ranges for weekly cost estimates are highest for adult residential programs and lowest for adolescent outpatient programs. Our estimates are also generally higher for mean episode costs across modalities. For example, adult residential programs have a mean episode cost that is over $400 higher in the present study compared to previous estimates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0193841X12450164">French, Popovici, and Tapsell 2008</xref>). Because instrumentation, data collection approach, and cost estimation methods were identical in both studies, these cost differences are somewhat unexpected. Perhaps, treatment services have become more comprehensive and expensive over time, but confirming this possibility is beyond the scope of the present article.</p>
<p>Despite the novelty and value of this information, we must caution against using only cost estimates to structure reimbursement rates, as cost estimates alone are not intended for use as efficiency measures. Programs that are operating efficiently may fall significantly above or below modality-specific mean cost estimates due to variations in services provided, clients served, program location, and other factors. Conversely, an inefficient program may have treatment costs near the mean values, for example, due to lower resource costs in their area of operation. A separate set of performance or evaluation measures should be used in addition to these cost estimates when undertaking a full economic evaluation of substance abuse treatment programs. Space constraints do not permit us to fully elaborate on the methods used for more advanced approaches, such as cost-effectiveness analysis, cost-utility analysis, and benefitâcost analysis. These techniques have been presented and discussed in a number of recent articles in the substance abuse literature (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0193841X12450164">Cartwright 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0193841X12450164">French and Drummond 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0193841X12450164">Zavala et al. 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0193841X12450164">Cartwright 2008a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0193841X12450164">2008b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0193841X12450164">Popovici and French, in press</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section13-0193841X12450164">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>Despite a respectable 71% response rate, 26 agencies, corresponding to 72 programs, refused to participate. This raw number of refusals is somewhat surprising as nearly all agencies commented that a statewide cost study is both important and timely. Reasons for not participating varied, but frequently reflected a lack of qualified personnel and a limited amount of time to take on external projects. Nevertheless, several nonparticipants expressed a general reluctance to collaborate and disinterest in the cost study. To ensure the highest response rate possible, the investigative team invested considerable time and effort into maximizing participation during the recruitment phase of the study, which lasted approximately 6 months. We vigorously employed all methods of communication and engagement, including postal mailings, e-mails, phone calls, and personal visits. Moreover, at least one member of the investigative team was available to answer questions during normal working hours and this frequently extended into nights and weekends.</p>
<p>Although the study is unique in terms of instrumentation and coverage, there are still limitations associated with the cost estimates per se. One limitation pertains to the cost per treatment episode. As mentioned previously, large variation exists in the average length of stay within most treatment modalities. In addition, there is no consensus in the clinical literature on the appropriate length of treatment episodes for all types of clientsâepisode length is highly variable based on individual client needs and program characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0193841X12450164">Hser et al. 1997</xref>). For example, among adult residential treatment programs in our sample, average length of stay (which constitutes one episode of treatment) ranges from 3 to 80 weeks. These variations make comparisons of episode costs across programs tenuous. Although variations in the intensity, range of treatment services offered, patients served, and location of the program also result in differences in weekly costs, we believe that the weekly cost estimates are more stable and reliable as a unit of comparison than the episode cost estimates.</p>
<p>A challenge related to cost estimates as a tool for reimbursement decisions is the lack of comprehensive data on program and client characteristics. For example, special populations, like patients with multiple cooccurring conditions (e.g., clients with substance abuse as well as mental disorders) can be very expensive to treat. On the other hand, a program that primarily treats functional patients who have stable support systems and are still employed may generate actual costs that fall well below the mean estimates. Thus, we cannot conclusively determine at this point whether programs with higher operating costs provide better or more effective treatment. Indeed, the higher costs may be more reflective of the services needed to address populations with greater problem severity, and thus poorer prognoses for improvement. Future research should explore which client, programmatic, governmental, and geographical factors contribute most to variation in weekly and episode costs.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Substance use and abuse present unique threats to public health and safety. Government agencies must balance needs for prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation by defining and prioritizing the most prudent investments among competing programs and interventions. In the face of unprecedented local, state, and federal budget crises, economic studies serve an important role in evaluating the financial impact of substance abuse services. The growth of managed behavioral health care, along with the reality of shrinking health care budgets, have reinforced the importance of conducting economic studies of substance abuse treatment and prevention programs. Understanding the economic costs of these programs can serve as the foundation for conducting broader economic evaluations, such as cost-effectiveness and benefitâcost analyses.</p>
<p>Since most of the administration and financing of substance abuse treatment is handled at the state level, the lack of rigorous substance abuse treatment cost data presents a critical handicap to state policy makers that struggle to identify funding priorities, set reasonable service reimbursement rates, and conduct more advanced program evaluations. To begin addressing the need for more current and representative economic information on substance abuse treatment programs, we conducted a rigorous cost analysis of substance abuse treatment throughout the state of Florida. This study represents a significant contribution to the treatment evaluation literature. We present a set of economic cost estimates derived through a standardized, peer-reviewed, and widely tested instrument. These data, however, pertain to only one state, so we encourage states, federal agencies, and interested stakeholders to initiate similar studies in other jurisdictions. A large database of substance abuse treatment costs can be used to develop, among other things, a defensible set of modality-specific cost estimates that can be adjusted for program and client characteristics and outcomes, and updated periodically to reflect current resource costs and trends. We hope that this article serves as a motivator and guide for individual states and other interested stakeholders to undertake such a study of substance abuse treatment costs in the near future.</p>

<p>Economic or opportunity costs do not always equate to the accounting costs of a treatment program. Opportunity costs include the value of unpaid resources, such as the estimated market value of donated buildings or voluntary labor. The âopportunity costâ of a resource is the value of the next best alternative forgone when this resource is used by the program.</p>

<p>With a well-defined sampling frame, it would be possible and preferable to incorporate probability weights into the calculations. However, the substance abuse treatment industry in Florida is highly dynamic and fluid with providers entering and exiting the industry at a much greater rate than in most other industries. Thus, our reported response rate is an approximation because it was very difficult to distinguish nonresponders from ineligibles.</p>
