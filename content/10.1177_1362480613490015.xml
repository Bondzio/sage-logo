<p>Roughly 30 years have elapsed since the ‘rediscovery’ of the relevance of neighborhood characteristics for the study of spatial variation in the distribution of crime and victimization. Although the early ‘second generation’ work reconceptualized the traditional social disorganization model in terms of the capacity of a community’s relational networks to exercise formal and informal control, subsequent studies have called some aspects of that reformulation into question and have led to important refinements of others. Unfortunately, despite several superb summaries of these developments (such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1362480613490015">Kubrin and Weitzer, 2003</xref>), we have been missing a contemporary equivalent of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1362480613490015">Shaw and McKay’s (1942)</xref> classic <italic>Juvenile Delinquency and Urban Areas</italic> that not only parsimoniously integrates relevant criminological and social science research, but also substantially extends our understanding of the genesis of these relationships in a manner that can serve as an inspiration for decades to come. Our wait has ended with the appearance of Robert Sampson’s <italic>Great American City</italic>.</p>
<p>The basic goals of <italic>Great American City</italic> are straightforward: (1) the development of a ‘general theoretical approach to the study of neighborhood effects and the contemporary American city’ (Parts I and II, especially Chapter 3) and (2) the use of that contextual methodology to demonstrate that, contrary to the arguments of many scholars of urban life, neighborhood effects are real, enduring, and cannot be simply reduced to the individual choices of the ‘types of people’ who live in those communities (Parts III, IV, and V). As such, <italic>Great American City</italic> is a response to two 21st-century variants of the historically recurring ‘loss of community’ arguments (such as those presented by Tonnies in the 19th century and Wirth in the 20th): (a) due to the rise of globalization, the internet, social media, and so forth, the geographically defined neighborhood no longer is relevant to social life. Community has been supplanted by placelessnes; (b) individuals make locational choices and sort themselves non-randomly by place. From this perspective, what appear to be neighborhood effects actually represent community variations in the composition of the residents that can be accounted for by ‘selection bias’.</p>
<p>Although <italic>Great American City</italic> amply demonstrates Sampson’s deep appreciation for the contributions of the ecological tradition of Park, Burgess, and their students (he refers to Zorbaugh’s <italic>Gold Coast and the Slum</italic> many times), this is anything but a return to an ‘urban villager’ perspective with its idealized depiction of neighborhood life. Rather, an almost complete reformulation of urban sociology was needed to effectively counter Wirth’s ‘urbanism as a way of life’ thesis, and that is what Sampson has attempted here, building in general on the insights of his prior body of research as well as that of William J. Wilson, and in particular on some of the themes he introduced in his 2001 Sutherland Address to the American Society of Criminology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1362480613490015">Sampson, 2002</xref>). The result is a masterpiece.</p>
<p><italic>Great American City</italic> is long and dense, and it is impossible to do full justice to its many insights in the course of a book review. However, four key themes are worth emphasizing. First, the spatial distribution of neighborhood inequality, particularly in terms of concentrated disadvantage and racial segregation, has persisted in Chicago for decades. That is, neighborhoods structurally reproduce themselves over time despite the influx and outflow of residents. Sampson refers to this process as the stability of change.</p>
<p>Second, concentrated disadvantage and racial segregation have important effects on the neighborhood life experienced by local residents, especially as they shape perceptions of disorder, legal cynicism, collective efficacy, and neighborhood stigmatization (Part III). These perceptions also reproduce themselves over time despite residential turnover, thereby representing a cultural counterpart to structural dynamics. Third, the traditional analytic treatment of neighborhoods as independent units of analysis is misguided, for the internal structures and dynamics of local communities are significantly shaped by the larger spatial aggregations in which they are embedded and with which they may have interlocking relationships (Part IV). Fourth, and perhaps most importantly, meaningful neighborhood effects continue to exist despite the rise of placelessness and represent far more than simple selection bias (discussed throughout the book).</p>
<p>Actually, the earlier comparison to Shaw and McKay’s work is a bit unfair to Sampson because, while firmly grounded in the urban sociological literature of its time, <italic>Juvenile Delinquency and Urban Areas</italic> was explicitly framed as a criminological contribution. That definitely is not the case here; note, for example, that Sampson’s title contains no variant of the word ‘crime’. Rather, although crime certainly is one of the major foci of the book, his intended scope is far more ambitious:<disp-quote>
<p>This book … is more about everything, or at least almost everything social about the city … (I give) priority to the spatial nature and larger social ordering of the (neighborhood-based) phenomena themselves rather than a prior commitment to the hypotheses of a single discipline or theory.</p>
<attrib>(p. 22)</attrib>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Although I consider Sampson to be one of the few real ‘Renaissance people’ in our field, I typically react to such grandiose claims with more than a little skepticism; I have to admit that I winced when I read that statement. Nevertheless, the topical range and the multidisciplinary bodies of literature from which he draws are nothing short of astonishing. It will be up to future studies to identify the spatial social phenomenon for which Sampson’s framework would be irrelevant.</p>
<p>Three non-substantive strengths of <italic>Great American City</italic> should be noted. First, although I characterized this book as dense, I definitely do not mean to suggest that it is stylistically problematic. Rather, I am referring to the fact that so much information is provided that it needs to be read slowly and carefully. Otherwise, the reader may miss such gems as: ‘Literally thousands of neighborhoods nationwide transitioned from white to black, but in the entire U.S., out of some sixty-five thousands tracts, only about ten went from over 60 percent black to substantially (60 percent or more) percent white’ (p. 109). In fact, although most of Sampson’s publications have been analytically complex and statistically sophisticated, this well-crafted presentation is completely accessible to anyone who can read a map or understand the implications of a graph. Second, reading <italic>Great American City</italic> can be a truly interactive experience. The book opens with Sampson taking the reader on a walking tour of parts of Chicago, describing what can be seen at various stops along the way. Since he provides the actual addresses or intersections throughout the journey, it is a simple matter to virtually recreate this walk with Google Earth Street View. Similar explorations can be made of the various neighborhoods to which he refers throughout the book. Finally, although Sampson utilizes a variety of criminologically unusual datasets to support his arguments (such as those from the Moving to Opportunity experiment, the national Panel Study of Income Dynamics, and the Chicago Key Informant Network Study), much of the evidence is drawn from the well-known Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods. An entire chapter (4) devoted to the history of this undertaking provides a rare and captivating behind the scenes look at how ‘big time research’ really works. It is absolutely fascinating in its own right.</p>
<p>I know that some readers will not share my enthusiasm for the book. Most importantly, some will argue that Sampson has not yet convincingly addressed the selection bias issue, especially in Chapter 12; in fact, an economist raised this concern during an Author Meets Critics session during the 2012 ASC meetings. I disagree, but such disciplinary differences run deep. In addition, some readers will be dismayed that this is yet another study of Chicago. Sampson quotes Malcolm Klein as stating that Chicago is ‘just weird’ (p. 108), and many others have expressed similar sentiments. Sampson addresses this issue at length in Chapters 4 and 5, and provides supporting evidence from other cities whenever possible. But the fact remains that this still is Chicago-based research and some will have a problem with that. I would simply encourage those people to check out the book prices at the beginning of this review, especially in light of the number of pages. Those are not misprints. <italic>Great American City</italic> definitely is one of the best bang-for-the-buck values in recent years. It is worth the very small investment to own this <italic>magnum opus</italic> regardless of the research site.</p>
