<italic>The Journal of School Nursing</italic> (<italic>JOSN</italic>) and SAGE Publications present two writing awards to promote publishing that contributes to school nursing practice and to recognize excellence in writing. The Executive Editor of <italic>The Journal</italic> and the Editorial Advisory Board selected recipients. Papers published in the February through December issues of 2011 were considered for the award.</p>
<p>Each recipient received $500 awarded by SAGE. NASN (National Association of School Nurses) provides frees registration to the NASN Annual Meeting in San Francisco at which time recipients will receive a certificate from <italic>The</italic> <italic>Journal of School Nursing </italic>recognizing their achievement. The Executive Editor and the Editorial Advisory Board recommended that the monetary award be used to defray the expenses incurred to attend the Annual Meeting of the National Association of School Nurses June 23–26, 2012. Acceptance in peer-reviewed journals represents recognition for excellence; however writing awards offer additional recognition and allow us to introduce the authors as the real world people they are.</p>

<title>The <italic>JOSN-</italic>SAGE First Publication Award</title>
<p>The <italic>JOSN-</italic>SAGE First Publication Award recognizes writing excellence of a first-time school nurse author. The selected manuscript is judged on the basis of its contribution to thought and or practice in school nursing and the form and writing clarity of the submission.</p>

<title>The <italic>JOSN</italic>-SAGE Scholarly Writing Award</title>
<p>The <italic>JOSN</italic>-SAGE Scholarly Writing Award recognizes excellence in writing and contributions to school nursing. The winning manuscript contributes to School Nursing by providing research results, evidence for practice or policy development or a major review of research literature that significantly influences school health policy, improves school nursing practice, or contributes to school health administration and collaboration.</p>
<p> Suzan J. Song, MD, MPH, is the winner of The <italic>JOSN-</italic>SAGE Scholarly Writing Award for her manuscript entitled <italic>Asian Student Depression in American High Schools: Differences in Risk Factors </italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1059840512446448">Song, Ziegler, Arsenault, Fried, &amp; Hacker, 2011</xref>). Dr. Song is a child and adolescent psychiatrist. Her education in cultural awareness began as a daughter of Korean immigrants. After formal studies in college (BS dual major: Biology and Epistemology across Cultures and a French focus at the University of Michigan), she lived in a Zulu village of KwaZulu/Natal, South Africa during the peak of the HIV/AIDS period in 2000. Impressed by the sociocultural, political, and economic effects on health, she then pursued diverse training in medicine (MD from the University of Chicago Pritzker School of Medicine), public health and policy (MPH from the Harvard School of Public Health), adult psychiatry training (Harvard Longwood), child/adolescent psychiatry (Stanford), family therapy and parent–infant psychotherapy training for traumatized families (University of California San Francisco). Currently, she is pursuing research, as a postdoctoral fellow at the Stanford/Sierra Pacific Veterans’ Affairs Mental Illness Research, Education, and Clinical Care program, with current grants on the intergenerational effects of violence on child mental health.</p>

<p>Advocating on behalf of the Asian and Asian American community, she worked on behalf of domestically abused Asian immigrant women in New York, via a George Soros Community Health Fellowship. Understanding the close intersection of mental health, violence, and policy, she also served as a White House Asian Pacific Islander American fellow. With attention to the diverse and unique needs of Asian Americans, Dr. Song continues advocacy work through clinical practice as the medical director and child/adolescent and adult psychiatrist for Asian Americans for Community Involvement, a nonprofit community mental health service. The clinic also has a Center for Survivors of Torture, which serves diverse community health needs for refugees and individuals seeking asylum, many of whom are from Asian countries.</p>
<p>Dr. Song’s interest in psychiatric nursing and Asian communities began with her mother, who immigrated from South Korea to America in 1970 and trained as an advanced practice nurse in psychiatry. Currently, Dr. Song’s home base is in the Bay Area of California, as well as working part-time in Africa. She enjoys hiking, rock climbing, and yoga, in addition to supporting local community projects at home and afar.]</p>
