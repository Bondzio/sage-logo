<title>Introduction</title>
<p>A study from 2008 indicates that chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma, together, are the third leading cause of death in the United States. Symptoms associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (chronic bronchitis and emphysema) include increasing difficulty filling and emptying the lungs, wheezing, coughing, and breathlessness.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-2156587213478174">1</xref>
</sup> The prevalence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease varies regarding method of diagnosis, populations tested, and age-group analyzed, but it has been estimated at 37% in the United States. The burden associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease includes loss of work, hospitalization, decline in quality of life, and death.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-2156587213478174">2</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Asthma is similar to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in that it is a chronic respiratory disease, but airway obstruction is temporarily reversible with treatment. More than half of all asthma-related deaths occur among adults 65 years and older<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2156587213478174">3</xref>
</sup> and it is estimated that more than 20 million people in the United States suffer from asthma.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2156587213478174">4</xref>
</sup> Moreover, the health care burden associated with asthma, in the United States, was estimated at $20.7 billion in 2010.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-2156587213478174">5</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Pulmonary rehabilitation programs, which include exercise training, are considered the most effective form of chronic respiratory disease management, but only 1% of people with moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease have access to these programs. Furthermore, there is an overlap of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease mortality in older adults, resulting in difficulties when treating these diseases separately.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-2156587213478174">3</xref>
</sup> This has led some health practitioners to explore alternative therapies that can treat both conditions. Because tai chi is easy to learn, requires no exercise equipment, and can improve pulmonary capacity, it may be an effective alternative to the more expensive management programs currently popular.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2156587213478174">6</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Tai chi is a traditional healing therapy that originated in China, but has since gained popularity in the United States. Many studies have analyzed the efficacy of tai chi for depression, low back pain, osteoarthritis, and heart disease, but limited data are available for respiratory conditions, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-2156587213478174">7</xref>
</sup> Considering tai chi incorporates slow movements focusing on strength and balance it could be a possible alternative to improve the quality of life of elderly adults suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2156587213478174">6</xref>
</sup> Additionally, studies have shown that both asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease sufferers are turning to complementary and alternative medicine approaches to mitigate symptoms.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-2156587213478174">4</xref>
</sup> Because of this trend, there is a need for researchers to analyze the effectiveness of such treatments.</p>
<p>Research questions addressed in this study include the following: Is tai chi efficacious as an alternative therapy for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and/or asthma and is there sufficient data available to draw conclusions regarding the efficacy of tai chi as a therapy/alleviator of symptoms associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma?</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-2156587213478174" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>A systematic review of the literature of tai chi as an alternative or complementary therapy for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and/or asthma was the method used in this study. To be included in this review the study must have (<italic>a</italic>) been published in the English language, (<italic>b</italic>) been reported between the period January 2008 and July 2012 (past 5 years), (<italic>c</italic>) included tai chi or any form of modified tai chi as a therapy in an intervention, (<italic>d</italic>) used any quantitative study design, and (<italic>e</italic>) measured chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and/or asthma as an outcome. Exclusion criteria included studies that did not (<italic>a</italic>) implement a quantitative design, (<italic>b</italic>) sample subjects diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and/or asthma, and (<italic>c</italic>) index in any of the following databases—CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature), Medline, or Alt Health Watch.</p>
<p>Because very few studies were identified using tai chi as an alternative therapy for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and/or asthma, a study that used Health Qigong, a complementary alternative system of medicine approach similar to tai chi was included here.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2156587213478174">8</xref>
</sup> Additionally, studies that implemented variations of tai chi, including tai chi qigong,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2156587213478174">9</xref>
</sup> and tai chi chuan,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2156587213478174">10</xref>
</sup> were also included. One study was published in 2 different journals, both have been included here.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2156587213478174">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2156587213478174">11</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Three phases of review were used to find studies meeting the previously defined criteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-2156587213478174">Figure 1</xref>). Medline, Alt Health Watch, and CINAHL database searches were enlisted to complete phase I. Boolean terms used to identify studies meeting the criteria included tai chi AND COPD OR chronic obstructive pulmonary disease OR tai chi AND asthma.</p>

</fig>
<p>Using the above terms, 30 articles were returned as follows: from Medline—chronic obstructive pulmonary disease n = 4, asthma n = 3; from Alt Health Watch—chronic obstructive pulmonary disease n = 2, asthma n = 7; and from CINAHL—chronic obstructive pulmonary disease n = 4, asthma n = 10. Phase II included preliminary distillation of the articles by eliminating duplicates (n = 2) and review/discussion articles (n = 22). Phase III consisted of a manuscript review of the remaining articles (n = 6). Of these articles, 2 were on the same intervention. As a result, 5 articles from 6 studies were used to review tai chi as an effective treatment for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma.</p>

<p>For 2 of the studies examined, the significant differences in baseline measurements were found. The study listed in 2 journals, measuring tai chi in children suffering from asthma, gender was significantly different among groups, as only one female was randomized to the experimental group (<italic>P</italic> = .021). As a result, gender was identified as a covariate.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2156587213478174">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2156587213478174">11</xref>
</sup> Additionally, this study reported that those randomized to the tai chi group experienced exacerbation rates significantly higher than those of the control group in the weeks prior to the intervention.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2156587213478174">11</xref>
</sup> For another study, measuring chronic obstructive pulmonary disease among older adults, those randomized to the tai chi group initially reported statistically significant higher levels of activity, higher scores on the Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire, and worse quality-of-life scores. This study did not report adjustments for these baseline differences, making it difficult to interpret results effectively. Interestingly, this study reported no significant differences at the end of the study between the tai chi group versus the control group regarding shortness of breath, depression, and self-efficacy, although significant improvements among the tai chi group versus control were reported for Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire scores.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2156587213478174">12</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Modality dosage varied among the 5 studies, although all study durations were 3 months. One study that did not encourage at-home training provided 3 times weekly of 40-minute instructional sessions, but reported favorable outcomes for tai chi chuan group versus control; forced vital capacity, forced expiratory volume, peak expiratory flow, and symptom scores (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001).<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2156587213478174">10</xref>
</sup> The remaining 5 studies encouraged at-home practice on the days they did not meet, providing DVDs, booklets, and other audiovisual materials for instruction. The intervention dosage for these varied from 60 minutes of tai chi twice weekly with 60 minutes at-home practice every day,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2156587213478174">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2156587213478174">11</xref>
</sup> to four 45-minute sessions weekly with at least 4 days of at-home practice for 12 to 15 minutes,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2156587213478174">8</xref>
</sup> 50-minute twice weekly sessions with at-home practice the 5 remaining days,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2156587213478174">6</xref>
</sup> and finally, 1-hour class twice weekly of tai chi encouraging at-home training 3 days a week.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2156587213478174">12</xref>
</sup> Although the studies provided journals to log at-home practice, it was impossible to assess, definitively, the amount and quality of at-home practice that subjects performed. Additionally, since the outcomes associated with the intervention were most favorable, it cannot be yet determined whether at-home practice is necessary to improve the effects of tai chi on asthma- and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease–related symptoms.</p>
<p>Confounding factors such as comorbidities with heart disease, exacerbated chronic obstructive pulmonary disease events, and musculoskeletal disease that may limit a patient’s ability to perform tai chi were taken in to account in several of the studies. Chan et al<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2156587213478174">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2156587213478174">11</xref>
</sup> listed heart disease, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus as coexisting diseases, but did not find the number of participants, in any of the 3 intervention groups, to be statistically significant. Three of the studies excluded subjects who had an exacerbated chronic obstructive pulmonary disease incident within the past 4 weeks, those with heart disease or other comorbidities.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-2156587213478174">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2156587213478174">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2156587213478174">12</xref>
</sup> Only one study did not address comorbidities and possible confounding factors, making it difficult to determine the efficacy of such an intervention.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2156587213478174">10</xref>
</sup> Future studies must address such variables to determine the relevance of such an intervention in the clinical setting.</p>
<p>Weaknesses associated with the studies reviewed include intervention duration, quality of instruction, attrition rates, and generalizability. One study noted that an intervention duration of 3 months may not allow enough time for the benefits of tai chi to be fully realized, noting that a study, using tai chi, showed psychosocial health improvements of elderly subjects suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease became substantial after a period of 6 months.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2156587213478174">11</xref>
</sup> Additionally, 2 of the 5 studies were performed in China, where tai chi and similar mind–body therapies have been practiced for centuries and overall acceptance for the practice is high.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2156587213478174">8</xref>
</sup> It is important to note that tai chi is gaining popularity in the Western world, making the likelihood of its acceptance, and therefore, generalizability, more favorable.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2156587213478174">8</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Another potential weakness is that no study offered any type of quality assessment tool of the instructors. Terms such as “qualified instructor”<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2156587213478174">11</xref>
</sup> and “trained therapist”<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2156587213478174">8</xref>
</sup> were used, but no credentials were listed. One study did not mention the use of expert instructors, making it difficult to determine the quality and/or presence of such instruction.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2156587213478174">10</xref>
</sup> Instructional classes can also be costly and inconvenient for participants as they must travel to receive the intervention, adding to the problem of attrition. Considering the types of tai chi varied among the studies, along with varying instructors, could make it difficult to determine the comparability of the studies. It can be said, though, that mind–body therapies, which reinforce meditative states, focus on breathing, and use light movements are similar through all studies.</p>
<p>Finally, attrition rates and sample size issues can affect the efficacy of any study. The study performed by Ng et al<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2156587213478174">8</xref>
</sup> reported 27.5% and 30% attrition rates for female and male subjects, respectively. Although attrition was quite high, the study was well above the sample size calculation (α = .05) of n = 38 with 80 participants total, making the dropout rate within the acceptable range.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2156587213478174">8</xref>
</sup> Hospitalization, increased dyspnea (loss of breath), and death were listed as possible reasons for the 23.3% attrition rate found among another study.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2156587213478174">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2156587213478174">11</xref>
</sup> Unfortunately, a sample size calculation was not performed for this study and dropout rate acceptability was not indicated.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2156587213478174">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2156587213478174">11</xref>
</sup> To overcome high attrition rates, it is suggested that the range of ages for interventions for patients suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and/or asthma be extended to those in their 60s as this population tends to be less frail than the elderly groups seen here.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2156587213478174">8</xref>
</sup>
</p>
<p>Sample size calculations were not mentioned in 2 of the studies.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2156587213478174">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2156587213478174">12</xref>
</sup> Interestingly, both these studies enlisted few participants divided evenly among the experimental and control groups. For the study by Yeh et al,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-2156587213478174">12</xref>
</sup> only 10 subjects suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were randomized, as this was identified as a pilot study. The intervention implementing a tai chi program for asthmatic children used a sample size of 30 subjects.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-2156587213478174">10</xref>
</sup> Although the sample sizes were small for both studies, the result was a 0% attrition rate.</p>
<p>Although there were weakness indicated above, it is important to reemphasize that all studies used randomized control design. Additionally, some researchers have suggested that the social support found in a tai chi program versus none in a control could be a driving factor of improvements, not necessarily the tai chi practice itself. A third group of exercise was added to the study of Chan et al<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-2156587213478174">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2156587213478174">11</xref>
</sup>; results indicated that the improvements in forced vital capacity (<italic>P</italic> = .02), forced expiratory volume (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001), and the 6-minute walk test (<italic>P</italic> &lt; .001) were significant for the tai chi group compared with both the control and exercise groups. Although this study did not measure social support, it does suggest that more studies need to be performed to understand the role of social support in tai chi practice for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma.</p>
<p>As mentioned previously, researchers have indicated that 6 months may be needed to assess the efficacy of tai chi. Although no studies used a 6-month intervention, one study did perform a 6-month follow-up of 80 elderly adults suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Results showed significant improvements of Health Qigong subjects versus control subjects at the 6-month follow-up; the 6-minute walk test (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.00), the Monitored Functional Task Evaluation (an activity of daily living for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients, <italic>P</italic> = .02); and 36-Item Short Form Health Survey: General Health (a generic quality of life scale; <italic>P</italic> = .04). It should be noted that only 23 subjects reported practicing Health Qigong at least once a week by themselves up to the 6-month follow-up.<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-2156587213478174">8</xref>
</sup> The study does indicate that the mind–body therapy intervention was efficacious, even when subjects’ adherence was not carefully monitored, suggesting that this type of therapy may be an effective alternative to usual care.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>It is estimated that 80 million people worldwide suffer from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease each year,<sup>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-2156587213478174">11</xref>
</sup> unfortunately, data regarding effective treatments other than pulmonary rehabilitation, are lacking. Only 6 studies could be found that met the inclusion criteria for this review, illustrating the need for more studies of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma sufferers using tai chi and other mind–body therapies to alleviate symptoms. Although the studies presented here were randomized control design, many did not address the vital role of social support as a confounding factor or sample size and dropout rate acceptability. The findings are promising as each study reported improvements among tai chi subjects with regard to pulmonary capacity, quality of life, and/or exercise capacity, but questions regarding the sustainability of tai chi practice, the long-term benefits of such a therapy, and the cost/inconvenience to participants, make it difficult to determine the viability of this therapy.</p>
