<abstract>
<p>This article introduces a new vortex gripper with a diversion body. Vortex gripper, as a pneumatic non-contact handling device, can generate lifting force to hold a workpiece without any contact. In order to predict the characteristics of this new vortex gripper, including pressure distribution on the upper surface of the workpiece, lifting force, supporting stiffness, and flowrate, a computational fluid dynamics study has been carried out. In the vortex cup, air swirling flow is a complex turbulent one; so Reynolds stress model (RSM) was used to describe internal air swirling flow. In addition, an experiment was carried out to study the characteristics of the vortex gripper. When compared with the experimental results, the reliability of numerical simulation results by RSM was verified. The vortex gripper with a diversion body could generate greater lifting force when compared with those designed by Xin <italic>et al</italic>. with the same air consumption. Therefore, the efficiency of the vortex gripper is improved.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0954406211423585" sec-type="intro"><title>1 INTRODUCTION</title>
<p>With the development of the semiconductor industry, the production of wafers is increased, and the requirements of product performance and quality have become higher as well. Traditionally, a workpiece is brought into contact with a handling device in order to be picked up and moved. The surface of wafers is often accompanied by scratch and contamination. Hence, contact handling often leads to defective products [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954406211423585">1</xref></bold>]. Obviously, the traditional handling method cannot meet the demands of higher product quality. Therefore, in order to avoid the contact between handling devices and workpieces, non-contact handling equipment involving magnetic, electrostatic, near-field, and pneumatic levitation entered people's lives [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0954406211423585">2</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954406211423585">3</xref></bold>]. Pneumatic levitation approaches use air flow to generate a lifting force to hold workpieces. Air flow is magnet-free and generates little heat, so that pneumatic approaches can be applied to any material. There are two kinds of pneumatic non-contact handling methods: Bernoulli levitation [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954406211423585">4</xref></bold>] and vortex levitation. Vortex levitation requires less air supply flowrate in generating the same lifting force [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954406211423585">5</xref></bold>]; therefore, it has better prospects than the other method.</p>
<p>Vortex gripper, proposed by Xin <italic>et al</italic>. [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954406211423585">5</xref></bold>], is a pneumatic non-contact handling device. It can generate lifting force to hold a workpiece without any contact. The pressure air is blown through tangential nozzle into vortex cup and then spins along the wall of vortex cup. Swirling air has a high velocity. The velocity in the vortex cup is higher than that at the gas film gap. Based on Bernoulli principle, the negative pressure is generated at the centre of the gripper, which causes the lifting effect. The pressure on the upper surface of a workpiece is larger than that on the lower surface, so that the workpiece is picked up. Meanwhile, pressurized air is discharged into atmosphere from the gas film gap between the skirt and the workpiece. Since the pressurized air is supplied continuously, the workpiece will keep levitating with a certain gap.</p>
<p>In this article, based on the vortex gripper designed by Xin <italic>et al</italic>. [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954406211423585">6</xref></bold>], a diversion body is added to the centre of the vortex cup, so that the mechanical capacity of the vortex gripper is improved. The turbulent model of Reynolds stress model (RSM) is used to simulate the vortex gripper. The characteristics of the vortex gripper, including pressure distribution, lifting force, supporting stiffness, and flowrate, are predicted. Comparing the simulation results with the experimental results, the availability of simulation is verified. When comparing the characteristics of the new vortex gripper with that of Xin's, it is found that the new vortex gripper could generate greater lifting force and repulsive force in the same air supply conditions. Thus, the conclusion could be drawn that the vortex gripper described in this article has a better lifting ability to handle the workpiece.</p></sec>

Based on the vortex gripper designed in reference [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954406211423585">6</xref></bold>], a diversion body is added to the centre of the vortex cup. It consists of four parts: a vortex chamber, a tangential nozzle, a diversion body, and an annular flat skirt around the vortex cup. Blue arrows indicate the direction of air flow.

<sec id="sec3-0954406211423585"><title>3 NUMERICAL METHODS</title>
<p>In this section, numerical simulation was used to predict the characteristics of the vortex gripper with a diversion body. It has only one tangential nozzle, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954406211423585">Fig. 1</xref>. Such an arrangement of nozzle would undoubtedly lead to a structural asymmetry of the vortex gripper; so a three-dimensional (3D) numerical simulation model was used. According to reference [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0954406211423585">7</xref></bold>], RSM was able to achieve a realistic simulation of swirling flow by considering anisotropy. Therefore, this model was used to compute and predict the flow characteristics, pressure distribution, and lifting or holding force.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954406211423585">Figure 2</xref> shows the 3D geometrical model after meshing. It consists of tangential nozzle, vortex cup, diversion body, and gas film gap between the skirt and the workpiece. Air of a certain level of pressure is blown into vortex cup through the tangential nozzle and discharged into the atmosphere through the gas film gap.
<fig id="fig2-0954406211423585" position="float"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Geometrical model of vortex gripper</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954406211423585-fig2.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>Considering that the overall grids would lead to poor grid quality, block division technology was used for meshing the 3D geometrical model. The part of vortex cup was meshed by tetrahedral grids and the part of gas film gap was meshed by hexahedral grids.</p>
<p>The skewness of the cells was checked and found to be less than 0.82. The quality of the grids is an important factor influencing the reliability of simulation; so it is necessary to analyze the independence of the grids. The influence of grid resolution on simulation results has been analyzed. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954406211423585">Figure 3(a)</xref> shows the radial pressure distribution on the upper surface of workpiece. The radial pressure distribution is calculated by five simulation models with different grid resolutions. With the increase of the grid numbers, the simulation results tend to converge to the adaptive mesh solution.

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954406211423585">Figure 3(b)</xref> shows the lifting force for different meshes. With the increase of the grid numbers, the simulation results also tend to convergence to the adaptive mesh solution. Comparing the number of cells <italic>N</italic><sub>5</sub> with the adapted mesh solution, the relative error of lifting force is seen to be less than 0.46 per cent. It is noted that grid numbers increase to <italic>N</italic><sub>4</sub> and <italic>N</italic><sub>5</sub>, but there is little change in lifting force. That is to say that the increased number of grids has little influence on the lifting force. It is thought that the finest mesh with <italic>N</italic><sub>5</sub> is taken to be adequate to produce grid independent results.</p></sec>

<p>The pressure inlet, <italic>P</italic>, is used as the inlet boundary condition. The air flow at the gap outlet is rather complicated; hence, it is very difficult to define the outlet boundary condition, and the outlet boundary condition cannot be set at the gap outlet directly. On this condition, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954406211423585">Fig. 4</xref> shows that a large computing domain around the vortex gripper is used to configure the outlet boundary condition.

<p>The governing equations were solved using the finite volume method, and the steady segregated implicit scheme solver was used to numerically solve these equations for the asymmetry geometry case. The QUICK difference scheme was adopted for the convection and diffusion terms, and the SIMPLE algorithm was employed to handle the coupling between the continuity equation and the momentum equations. The pressure of pressure inlet was 0.1âMPaâand the pressure of pressure outlet 0. Air was the single fluid material and its density was modelled with 1.225âkg/m<sup>3</sup>.

<sec id="sec9-0954406211423585"><title>4.1 Experimental procedure</title>
<p>This section introduces experimental method, including experimental apparatus and procedure. The experimental work is mainly concerned with measuring pressure distribution on the upper surface of the workpiece and lifting force.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954406211423585">Figure 5</xref> shows a sketch of the experimental apparatus. The vortex gripper can be kept parallel to the pressure mesa using the level-adjusting device which includes a round plate, a screw rod used to connect the load cell and the vortex gripper, and three fine thread bolts. The following steps can be used. Place the vortex gripper on the pressure mesa and then set down three fine thread bolts, making sure that their tips touch the top of the gripper. Revolve fine thread bolt to change the distance between the round plate and the top of the gripper for keeping the vortex gripper and pressure mesa parallel. The load cell is fixed on the translation stages. The vertical position between the gripper and the pressure mesa is adjusted by translation stages whose displacement can be read through a feeding bolt with a resolution of 0.002âmm. By this means, the gap between the gripper and the pressure mesa becomes adjustable and measurable. Load cell with a measuring range of 1âkgâand a resolution of 0.001âN is used to measure lifting force or repulsion. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954406211423585">Figure 5(b)</xref> shows the pressure mesa which has 11 small holes used to measure the pressure. The diameter of the holes is 0.5âmm<bold>.</bold> At the other end of the holes, 11 pressure sensors are connected to the pressure tap through the internal perforation for collecting the pressure signal. Pressure range of the pressure sensor with a resultant error of 0.05 per cent is â10â¼10âkPa. The diameter of angle turntable with a resolution of 1Â° is 68âmm. It is used to measure the different radial pressure distributions of the vortex gripper.
<fig id="fig5-0954406211423585" position="float"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><p>Experimental apparatus</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954406211423585-fig5.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The following measurement procedure was used. The initial gas film gap between the vortex gripper and the pressure mesa was set. After stabilizing the air flow in a given pressure, the pressure sensor and load cell readings were recorded. Turning off the air, the distance of the gas film gap was changed and the above steps were repeated. Each condition was measured in several groups to obtain more accurate results.</p>
<p>This experimental apparatus has the following advantages. Pressure and lifting force could be measured at the same time. There are 11 small successive holes on the upper surface of pressure mesa, and pressure sensors could measure the radial pressure distribution simultaneously.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec10-0954406211423585"><title>4.2 Results and discussions</title>
<p>In this section, the validity of simulation was verified by comparing the simulation and experimental results. The four parts, including pressure distribution, lifting force, supporting stiffness, and flowrate characteristics, were studied, respectively.</p>
<sec id="sec11-0954406211423585"><title>4.2.1 Pressure distribution</title>
<p>The radial pressure measured at AâOâB direction is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954406211423585">Fig. 1</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0954406211423585">Fig. 6</xref> shows the radial pressure distribution at the different gap thicknesses for the case in which the pressure inlet <italic>P</italic> is 0.1âMPa. In the figure, the experimental and simulation results follow the same trend. The angle of pressure distribution shape is perfectly duplicated by RSM. The simulation results are slightly smaller than the experimental ones. The pressure in the vortex cup is obviously lower than that at the gas film gap. If the thickness of the gas film gap is less than 0.3âmm, the pressure at the gas film gap is higher than atmospheric pressure; if it is larger than 0.3âmm, they are almost the same. It is shown that the negative pressure increases as the gas film gap becomes larger. However, the negative pressure will decrease after it reaches a maximum as the gas film gap becomes bigger and bigger. In addition, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0954406211423585">Fig. 6</xref> shows that the pressure curve significantly deviates from the central axis. This deviation is caused by vortex gripper with only one tangential nozzle.
<fig id="fig6-0954406211423585" position="float"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption><p>Pressure distribution at AâOâB direction</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954406211423585-fig6.tif"/></fig></p></sec>
<sec id="sec12-0954406211423585"><title>4.2.2 Lifting force</title>
<p>The lifting force values obtained from experimental and numerical simulation are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954406211423585">Fig. 7(a)</xref>. This curve is used to determine the gripper performance with respect to the weight of the object to be grasped. Now, assume that a 0.3âN workpiece whose weight is less than maximum lifting force is held by vortex gripper. In the figure, the experimental results are divided into four parts: A, B, C, and D. Part A shows that the vortex gripper generates repulsion. When the workpiece gets closer to the vortex gripper, the greater repulsion will be generated. This can avoid the collision between the workpiece and the vortex gripper. However, parts B, C, and D show that it generates lifting force. With the increase of the gap's thickness, lifting force increases first and then decreases after it reaches a maximum.
<fig id="fig7-0954406211423585" position="float"><label>Fig. 7</label><caption><p>Lifting force and supporting stiffness (<italic>P</italic>â=â0.1âMPa)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954406211423585-fig7.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>There is a stable grasping zone with the gap <italic>h</italic> ranging among A, B, and C, and an unfeasible grasping zone D where the force is not sufficient to grasp the workpiece. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954406211423585">Fig. 7(a)</xref>, the line of the workpiece intersects the curve at two equilibrium points: P1 and P2. P1 is a stable point and P2 is not. When the workpiece is still in P1, the gas film gap decreases; its weight is larger than the lifting force so as to return to P1. When the workpiece is between P1 and P2, its weight is smaller than the lifting force, so as to draw it back to P1. If the gas film gap is just over P2, the lifting force is lower than the workpiece weight and the grasping is not accomplished.</p>
<p>Overall, the experimental results are greater than the numerical simulation results. The maximum error (12.25 per cent) occurs when the thickness of the gap is 0.1âmm. The error of the other position is less than 8 per cent, which is acceptable in the industrial design. This also proves the effectiveness of the RSM model.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec13-0954406211423585"><title>4.2.3 Supporting stiffness</title>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954406211423585">Figure 7(b)</xref> shows the curve of supporting stiffness. The equation is given as follows
<disp-formula id="disp-formula13-0954406211423585"><label>(13)</label><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954406211423585-eq13.tif"/></disp-formula>
where <italic>l</italic> expresses the supporting stiffness of gas film, <italic>F</italic> the lifting force, and <italic>h</italic> the thickness of gas film gap. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954406211423585">Figure 7(a)</xref> shows that lifting force is almost zero in the place of 0.15âmm. When the thickness of gas film gap is less than 0.15âmm, vortex gripper generates repulsive force, and then the closer workpiece gets to it, and bigger repulsion is generated. From 0.15 to 1.5âmm, it generates lifting force. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954406211423585">Figure 7(b)</xref> shows that the broken line divides the curve into two parts in the place of 0.15âmm. When the thickness of gas film gap is less than 0.15âmm, the curve has great slope. The closer the working piece gets to the vortex gripper, the greater the supporting stiffness is. The repulsion is substantial to push the workpiece away from the vortex gripper, and thus the collision between the workpiece and the vortex gripper is avoided. When the thickness of gas film gap is more than 0.15âmm, supporting stiffness increases as the gap is enlarged. However, the supporting stiffness will decrease slowly after it reaches a maximum as the gap becomes bigger and bigger. This reflects the lifting ability of the vortex gripper.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec14-0954406211423585"><title>4.2.4 Supply flowrate</title>
<p>The flowrate is measured in the pressure inlet as 0.1âMPa. The flowrate characteristics are mainly affected by the gas film gap when the thickness of the gap is very small. The nozzle will govern the flowrate characteristics when the thickness of the gap exceeds a certain extent. However, the flowrate characteristics are not influenced by the gas film gap. When the pressure inlet is 0.1âMPaâand the nozzle governs the flowrate characteristics, the flowrate of two vortex grippers is about 20.8âÃâ10<sup>â5</sup>âm<sup>3</sup>/s (ANR). There is no obvious difference between the experimental and simulation results. It also proves the reliability of simulation results.</p></sec></sec></sec>
<sec id="sec15-0954406211423585"><title>5 COMPARISON BETWEEN XIN'S AND NEW VORTEX GRIPPERS</title>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0954406211423585">Figure 8</xref> shows the Xin's vortex gripper [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954406211423585">6</xref></bold>] and the new one that is proposed in this article. The sketch of the new vortex gripper, including a vortex chamber, a tangential nozzle, and an annular flat skirt, is the same as that of the vortex gripper given in the reference [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954406211423585">6</xref></bold>]. A diversion body is added to the vortex cup centre of the new vortex gripper. After analysis and comparison, the difference between two vortex grippers was found out.
<fig id="fig8-0954406211423585" position="float"><label>Fig. 8</label><caption><p>The sketch of Xin's and new vortex gripper</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954406211423585-fig8.tif"/></fig></p>
<sec id="sec16-0954406211423585"><title>5.1 Pressure distribution</title>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0954406211423585">Figure 9</xref> shows the radial pressure distribution on the upper surface of the workpiece. The two curves follow the same trend. In the part of the skirt, the pressure is almost the same. Due to the influence of the diversion body, the two vortex grippersâ pressures in the vortex cup show obvious difference. It is under the bottom of the diversion body in the position of â0.25 to 0.25 (â1â&lt;â<italic>r</italic>/<italic>R</italic><sub>1</sub>â&lt;â1). The pressure generated by the new vortex gripper is obviously lower than that of Xin's. The diversion body plays an important role in blocking air into the bottom of it, so that air flow velocity under the diversion body is reduced, and the pressure is also reduced. Between the diversion body side and the wall of the vortex cup, the pressure is higher than that of Xin's. The diversion body plays a role in accelerating the air flow velocity. The flow area in the vortex cup is reduced due to the diversion body, so that the air flow velocity is raised in the same pressure inlet condition, and the bigger negative pressure can be gained.
<fig id="fig9-0954406211423585" position="float"><label>Fig. 9</label><caption><p>Pressure distribution on the upper surface of the workpiece</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954406211423585-fig9.tif"/></fig></p></sec>
<sec id="sec17-0954406211423585"><title>5.2 Lifting force and supporting stiffness</title>
<p>The lifting force is calculated as the surface integral of the gauge pressure acting on the upper surface of the workpiece. As the area of the workpiece's surface is a constant, the lifting force is decided by the pressure distribution. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0954406211423585">Figure 10(a)</xref> shows the lifting force of Xin's [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954406211423585">6</xref></bold>] and the new vortex gripper. Xin's vortex gripper will generate repulsive force when the thickness of the gas film gap is less than 0.12âmmâand lifting force when it is larger than 0.12âmm. While the new vortex gripper will generate repulsive force when the gas film gap is less than 0.15âmm, it will generate lifting force when it is larger than 0.15âmm. When the thickness of the gas film gap is 0.1âmm, the new vortex gripper's repulsion is 2.5 times larger than that of Xin's. When the workpiece gets closer to the cup than 0.15âmm, the larger repulsion is generated to pull the workpiece away. It can better avoid the collision between the workpiece and the vortex gripper. The new vortex gripper's maximum lifting force is 0.12âN larger than that of Xin's, and the lifting force increases by 25 per cent. In the same pressure inlet, the new vortex gripper improves the lifting efficiency. Now, assume that a 0.3âN workpiece is held by two vortex grippers. The broken line intersects the lifting force curve generated by the new vortex gripper at two points A and B where the weight is equal to lifting force, and intersects the curve generated by that of Xin's at points C and D. It is noted that the stable grasping zone of new vortex gripper is larger than that of Xin's. It is of benefit to the stability of levitation.
<fig id="fig10-0954406211423585" position="float"><label>Fig. 10</label><caption><p>Lifting force and supporting stiffness (<italic>P</italic>â=â0.1âMPa)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954406211423585-fig10.tif"/></fig></p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0954406211423585">Figure 10(b)</xref> shows the supporting stiffness derived from two vortex grippers. Supporting stiffness is the ratio of lifting force and the thickness of gas film gap, and the lifting force is calculated as the surface integral of the gauge pressure, so that supporting stiffness is essentially determined by pressure distribution. Overall, the new vortex gripper's supporting stiffness is greater than that of Xin's. When the thickness of Xin's is less than 0.12âmmâor the thickness of new vortex gripper is less than 0.15âmm, supporting stiffness resists the workpiece near to the vortex gripper.</p>
<p>When the thickness of the gas film gap is 0.1âmm, the supporting stiffness of new vortex gripper is 2.5 times larger than that of Xin's, so that the new vortex gripper has a better ability to resist the workpiece near to the vortex gripper. In the region of lifting force generated, the supporting stiffness increases when the gas film gap is enlarged. However, the supporting stiffness will decrease slowly after it reaches a maximum. The maximum value of the new one increases by 19 per cent. It is known that the new vortex gripper has a better lifting ability to hold the workpiece.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec18-0954406211423585"><title>5.3 Supply flowrate</title>
<p>The two vortex grippers have the same flowrate characteristics. When the pressure inlet is 0.1âMPaâand the nozzle governs the flowrate characteristics, the flowrate of the two vortex grippers is about 20.8âÃâ10<sup>â5</sup>âm<sup>3</sup>/s (ANR). The flowrate characteristics of the new vortex gripper are not affected by the diversion body. It is thought that the error is generated in the process of nozzle manufacture.</p></sec></sec>
