<abstract>
<p>In Africa the majority of solid waste data is for big cities. Small and rural towns are generally neglected and waste data from these areas are often unavailable, which makes planning a proper solid waste management difficult. This paper presents the results from two waste characterization projects conducted in Kétao, a rural town in Togo during the rainy season and the dry season in 2010. The seasonal variation has a significant impact on the waste stream. The household waste generation rate was estimated at 0.22 kg person<sup>−1</sup> day<sup>−1</sup> in the dry season and 0.42 in the rainy season. Likewise, the waste moisture content was 4% in the dry season while it was 33–63% in the rainy season. The waste consisted mainly of soil and dirt characterized as ‘other’ (41%), vegetables and putrescibles (38%) and plastic (11%). In addition to these fractions, considerable amounts of material are either recycled or reused locally and do not enter the waste stream. The study suggests that additional recycling is not feasible, but further examination of the degradability of the organic fraction is needed in order to assess whether the residual waste should be composed or landfilled.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Togo is a West African country with an estimated population of 6.8 million in 2010. With a per capita income of US$ 437 in 2009, Togo is one of the poorest countries in the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0734242X12442741">The World Bank, 2010</xref>). The majority of the population lives in rural Togo where no form of proper solid waste management is present.</p>
<p>In the rural town of Kétao, degraded organic waste was formerly collected by the farmers to use as a soil amendment, but due to the presence of plastic bags in the waste this is no longer the case. As a result, piles of waste obstruct the roads, hamper the aesthetic appearance of the town and are a potential threat to public health and the environment. Waste is often openly burned resulting in emissions of toxic fumes. Moreover, domestic animals have died by eating plastic bags, and children are often cut by sharp items when playing around the waste piles.</p>
<p>Introduction of a proper waste management in Kétao could reduce the impact of the solid waste on public health and environment and improve the aesthetic appearance of the town (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0734242X12442741">Christensen, 2011</xref>). Thus, the objective of this study was to provide data on type, quantity and composition of the solid waste for planning of a suitable waste management system in Kétao in Togo. The data presented could be of relevance for many rural towns in western Africa.</p>

<title>The study area</title>
<p>Kétao is a rural town in northern Togo with an estimated population of 20 000. It is located about 400 km north-east of the capital Lomé. A big market is held on Wednesdays and attracts around 50 000 people.</p>
<p>The climate is tropical semi-arid. The dry season, November to early April, is characterized by an extremely low humidity caused by the Harmattan wind, while the rainy season, late April to October, is the season for crop production.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0734242X12442741">
<title>Waste characterization</title>
<p>The waste characterization was conducted twice, in January and in July-August 2010 representing the dry season and the rainy season, respectively. Each waste characterization was conducted over an eleven-day period. This sampling period was relatively short. However, it allowed for two samplings of the market waste and likewise covered both rainy and dry days during the wet season. A number of houses, institutions, small businesses, the bus station and the market were selected for the project (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0734242X12442741">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<p>A total of 48 houses were selected. The 48 houses are located in the market neighbourhood. This area is characterized by a very mixed composition of residents regarding income, religion and ethnicity. The selected houses were next to each other to prevent houses in-between using the waste bins. Further, the location of the participants’ houses eased the waste collection and transport to the sorting area. The institutions consisted of offices and schools. However, the schools were only included in the study in January due to summer school holiday in July–August. The small businesses comprised of shops, bars and restaurants.</p>
<p>Waste bins were handed out to the participants one day before the waste collection started and the waste was collected every second day by door-to-door collection. The waste was loaded from the waste bin into a small bowl bag to be weighed and then transported in a handcart to the sorting area. The market waste was only collected on Thursday mornings by a group of 15 women hired to sweep the entire market place.</p>
<p>The waste was sorted the same day as the collection took place into nine material fractions as described in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0734242X12442741">Table 2</xref>. The waste was checked for magnetic metal using a magnet. Large pieces of plastic and pieces of broken glass and twigs were removed. Other large pieces of textile, cardboard, paper, batteries, for example, were sorted out. The remaining waste consisting of soil, dust, dirt and small pieces of charcoal was categorized as ‘other’. Each material fraction was weighed after the sorting.</p>

<p>The moisture content of the waste was determined using two different methods depending on the season. In the January dry season, the waste was dried by spreading it on a tarpaulin in the sun for 4 to 5 h until constant weight. In the rainy season the waste was dried in a microwave oven. A similar method has been used for drying soils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0734242X12442741">Chung and Ho, 2006</xref>).</p>

<p>The household waste generation rate was estimated at 0.22 kg capita<sup>−1</sup> day<sup>−1</sup> in the dry season and 0.42 kg capita<sup>−1</sup> day<sup>−1</sup> in the rainy season. The annual waste generation rate was calculated based on the weight of wet waste taking into consideration the influence of the seasonal variation on the waste stream. The results of the January study was assumed to be representative of the dry season (estimated to approximately 152 days year<sup>−1</sup>) and the study in July–August was representative of the rainy season (estimated to approximately 213 days year<sup>−1</sup>). The annual waste generation rate (WGR) was calculated as follow:</p>

<p>The total waste generated per year in Kétao was estimated at 2646 tonnes. The households generate 93% of the total waste, commerce about 5% and the market generates only 2%.</p>
<p>The moisture content of the waste was estimated to 4% in the dry season, which is extremely low in comparison with the estimated average moisture content during the wet season of 42%. In the wet season the moisture content varied significantly among the material fractions – between 33 and 63%. As a consequence of the large difference in moisture content between seasons the waste generation rate based on dry matter content was almost the same in the two seasons.</p>
<p>The annual waste composition, namely the percentage of each waste fraction, was calculated as:</p>

<p>The waste (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0734242X12442741">Figure 1</xref>) consisted predominantly of soil, dirt and sand characterized as ‘other’ (41%) followed by vegetables and putrescibles (38%).

<p>Some waste fractions were not found in the waste stream. This can be explained by the recycling and reuse of waste in the informal sector. For example, aluminium cans are recycled to produce kitchenware. Iron materials and old rubber shoes are collected and sold to small traders who subsequently sell them to retailers in Lomé. Moreover, the beer brewery (Brasserie du Benin) reuses beer bottles. The deposit fee on these bottles is as high as the cost of the beer. Therefore, beer bottles are always returned to the shops. Plastic bottles and unbroken glasses are reused as containers of juice, water, oil and other liquids sold in the local market. Tyre inner tubes are transformed into small containers to fetch water.</p>

<title>Waste generation rate and moisture content</title>
<p>The season affects the waste generation rate in Kétao significantly. The increased weight of the waste in the rainy season can – besides the higher moisture content – be explained by the presence of maize cobs and husks, peanut shells and vegetable stalks in the waste stream. Similarly, the highest quantity of waste was generated in the rainy season in Oyo, Nigeria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0734242X12442741">Afon and Okewole, 2007</xref>). However, the average household waste generation rate estimated for Kétao at 0.34 kg capita<sup>−1</sup> day<sup>−1</sup> is in the lower end of the estimated waste generation rates in other African cities ranging from 0.33 to 0.62 kg capita<sup>−1</sup> day<sup>−1</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0734242X12442741">Asase et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0734242X12442741">Kaseva and Moirana, 2010</xref>). Furthermore, if the soil and dirt content could be avoided, the waste generation rate would be even lower −0.18 kg capita<sup>−1</sup> day<sup>−1</sup>. The relatively low waste generation rate in Kétao could be explained by the fact that Kétao is a rural town with lower purchasing power than urban areas. Even though the organic material constitutes the highest proportion of the waste stream in low income areas, a population with a low purchasing power may generate less organic waste in comparison with middle and high income groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0734242X12442741">Berstein, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>The large seasonal variation in the waste moisture content in Kétao (4% for the dry season and 33-66% in the rainy season) can partly be explained by the fact that the waste was not disposed of directly in waste bins and was exposed to drying in the sun or rainfalls before collection. The waste moisture content in the wet season is comparable to the 55 % reported for Accra, Ghana (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0734242X12442741">Etuah-Jackson et al., 2001</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0734242X12442741">
<title>Waste composition</title>
<p>The waste consisted predominantly of material fractions characterized as ‘other’ (41%). The explanation for this is the unpaved backyards which are swept twice a day. The swept up trash collected contains a substantial amount of soil and dirt. The soil content in the waste stream in Kétao (41%) is similar to 40% observed in Lomé, Togo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0734242X12442741">Kessler and Helbig, 2001</xref>), but higher than 22% in Kumasi, Ghana (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0734242X12442741">Asase et al., 2009</xref>). In contrast, several studies conducted in Africa did not observe or mention soil in the waste stream (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0734242X12442741">Afon and Okewole, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0734242X12442741">Asase et al., 2009</xref>). The contribution of vegetables and putrescibles in Kétao (38 %) is lower than the estimated average contribution of organic matter at about 40–85% in low income countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0734242X12442741">Cointreau, 2006</xref>). The possible explanation can be a high content of soil and a high reutilization of food leftovers in Kétao as feed to livestock.</p>

<title>Implications for a future waste management system</title>
<p>The quantification of the solid waste in Kétao, Togo, showed a fairly low waste generation on an annual basis, about 2650 tonnes year<sup>−1</sup> or approximately 0.34 kg capita<sup>−1</sup> year<sup>−1</sup>. The low quantity of waste and the low income level of this rural town suggest that a simple and robust waste management system must be developed.</p>
<p>The detailed waste characterization showed that ‘soil and dirt’ and ‘organic waste’ dominated the waste composition (80% of all the waste). Hardly any recyclable items were found in the waste. The quality of the plastics and paper in the waste stream was poor and the quantity was not sufficient for setting up a profitable recycling scheme. The organic matter fraction is estimated to 1000 tonnes annually, but a major part seems to be slowly degradable items such as corn cobs, husks and peanut shells, which are not easily composted. So before suggesting any source separation of organic matter, which would be a major change of the traditional habit of the population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0734242X12442741">Bernstein, 2004</xref>), the compostability of the organic fractions should be assessed.</p>
<p>Introduction of proper waste bins in the households, which would reduce the need for sweeping the floors and yards for waste, would likely reduce the soil content of the waste. However, this is not likely a fraction that warrants significant environmental concern.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>The survey found that the household waste generation rate for Kétao is 0.22 kg capita<sup>−1</sup> day<sup>−1</sup> in the dry season and 0.42 kg capita<sup>−1</sup> day<sup>−1</sup> in the rainy season. However, the significant difference in moisture content between seasons leads to almost the same dry matter waste generation rate in the two seasons. The waste mainly consisted of vegetables and putrescibles (38%) and ‘other’ (41%), which is a mixture of soil, sand and leaves. Despite the high percentage of organic matter in the waste stream, further studies are needed to define appropriate organic materials that can be used for composting in Kétao. Thus, an organized waste collection with a proper dumpsite/landfill is suggested as the backbone of any waste management system for Kétao.</p>
