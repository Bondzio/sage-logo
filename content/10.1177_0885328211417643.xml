<abstract>
<p>The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of beta-tricalcium phosphate (β-TCP) particles in combination with acellular dermal matrix (ADM) allograft in gingival recession. Experimental gingival recession defects were created in beagle dogs and randomly assigned to one of the following groups: ADM, ADM + β-TCP, or coronally positioned flap (CPF; control). Tissues were histologically examined at 4, 8, or 16 weeks following treatment. A greater thickness of gingiva was observed at the sites treated in both the ADM + β-TCP and ADM groups than in the CPF group. The ADM + β-TCP group showed a statistically significant increase in both new bone and cementum formations compared to the ADM group. The results suggest that the combination of β-TCP and ADM is more effective in promoting new bone and cementum formations than ADM graft alone.</p>

<p>Successful coverage of exposed roots for esthetic reasons used to be the main objective of a number of mucogingival procedures. Now, however, functional considerations are also central in the therapeutic decision process. Various surgical techniques are available for the treatment of gingival recession, including free gingival graft, double papilla flap, coronally positioned flap (CPF), subepithelial connective tissue graft, and guided tissue regeneration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0885328211417643">1</xref></sup> Tissue flaps, with or without auto- or allografts, are used to treat gingival recession and obtain root coverage offer a high-level predictability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0885328211417643">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0885328211417643"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0885328211417643"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0885328211417643"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0885328211417643">7</xref></sup> However, while such autografts bring about excellent outcomes, they can often cause discomfort to the patient and require a secondary harvest site, which may lead to postoperative complications while yielding only a limited quantity of donor tissue.</p>
<p>Acellular dermal matrix (ADM) allograft is obtained from human donor skin tissue in which the epidermis and all the cells of the dermis have been removed through a proprietary free-drying process in which safeguards against viral disease transmission are also stringently applied. This results in a collagen biomaterial in which its components of types IV and VII of collagen, elastin, and laminin are undamaged within the residual dermal matrix.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0885328211417643">8</xref></sup> ADM allografts are widely used as a substitute for autograft tissue in reconstructive surgery in burn patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0885328211417643">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0885328211417643">10</xref></sup> Because they offer a solution to all the disadvantages of autogenous donor grafts described above, they are used in dentistry to treat alveolar ridge deformities,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0885328211417643">11</xref></sup> in root coverage procedures,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0885328211417643">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0885328211417643"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0885328211417643">14</xref></sup> and as a substitute for connective donor tissue to increase the width of keratinized tissue around teeth and implants.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0885328211417643">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0885328211417643"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0885328211417643">17</xref></sup> The advantages of using an ADM allograft in place of subepithelial connective tissue graft are: (1) the availability of an unlimited quantity of graft material, (2) reduction in time required for surgical procedures, (3) reduction in complaints regarding esthetically unsatisfactory outcomes, and (4) reduction in risk of postoperative complications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0885328211417643">12</xref></sup> However, the drawback of using an ADM graft is that, while it results in root coverage, it does not significantly enhance the formation of new cementum or bone.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0885328211417643">18</xref></sup> It has been demonstrated that the treatment of gingival recession using ADM grafts results in healing characterized by long junctional epithelium between the root surface and covering tissue in animals.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0885328211417643">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0885328211417643">20</xref></sup> However, an important aim of treatment for recession-type defects is functional restoration by periodontal regeneration, as well as the complete coverage of sites of gingival recession.</p>
<p>Beta-tricalcium phosphate (β-TCP) is a biocompatible material<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0885328211417643">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0885328211417643"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0885328211417643">23</xref></sup> that serves as a space-maker or scaffold for ingrowth.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0885328211417643">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0885328211417643"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0885328211417643">26</xref></sup> It yielded the most promising results for biodegradation in a comparative histomorphometric study of different biomaterials using miniature pigs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0885328211417643">27</xref></sup> Ogose et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0885328211417643">28</xref></sup> reported that this material showed clear osteoconductivity and was absorbed through a cell-mediated process in an early phase after implantation in rat femoral condyle. Ogose et al. also showed that it exhibited clear osteoconductivity and bioabsorbability after implantation into human bone.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0885328211417643">29</xref></sup> Recombinant human platelet-derived growth factor-BB (rhPDGF-BB) (GEM21S, BioMimetic Therapeutics, Franklin, TN, USA) combined with β-TCP (an alloplastic bioceramic carrier) is now available for use as regenerative material in periodontal defects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0885328211417643">30</xref></sup> With this product, the β-TCP physically fills the periodontal defect and, acting as a scaffold, prevents soft tissue from collapsing into the defect. It also performs satisfactorily as a carrier for rhPDGF-BB.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0885328211417643">30</xref></sup> However, the mechanism underlying root coverage with the use of β-TCP in combination with an ADM graft remains to be clarified.</p>
<p>The purpose of this study was to clarify the effect of the adjunctive use of β-TCP with an ADM graft, primarily in root coverage.</p>

<sec id="sec3-0885328211417643"><title>Preparation of experimental defects</title>
<p>Twenty-four young, healthy, male beagle dogs were used in this study. The experimental protocol was approved by the institutional ethical committee for experimental animal use (No. 222204) and surgical procedures were performed in accordance with the Guidelines for the Treatment of Experimental Animals at Tokyo Dental College. In order to minimize pain and distress, surgical procedures were performed under local infiltration anesthesia (2% xylocaine, 1:80,000 adrenaline). Gingival recession defects (6 × 5 mm<sup>2</sup>: vertical × horizontal) were surgically created bilaterally in the maxillary canines. A metallic strip of matrix was placed at the site of each defect. This strip of matrix was left in place for 12 weeks.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-0885328211417643"><title>Root coverage surgery</title>
<p>Two weeks after removal of the strip (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0885328211417643">Figure 1(a)</xref>), full thickness flaps were raised and root surfaces scaled and planed. A coronal notch at the cemento-enamel junction (CEJ) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0885328211417643">Figure 1(b)-(i)</xref>) and an apical notch was placed at the obtained defect (bone level) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0885328211417643">Figure 1(b)-(ii)</xref>). The defects in each animal were randomly assigned to one of the following groups (five sites in each group): (1) ADM group, (2) ADM + β-TCP group, or (3) CPF (control) group.

<p>In ADM group, the exposed root surface was treated with an ADM (AlloDerm, Life Cell Corp., Branchburg, NJ, USA) graft aseptically rehydrated in sterile saline according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The ADM allograft, also of an average thickness of 1 mm, was prepared following the manufacturer’s guidelines and trimmed to a shape and size designed to cover the root surface and surrounding bone. The basement membrane side was placed facing the flap and the connective tissue side adjacent to the bone and tooth. The coronal lateral borders of the ADM grafts were sutured to the lingual gingival tissues with the sutures crossing over the top of the graft (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0885328211417643">Figure 1(d)</xref>). Following the stabilization of the grafts, the reflected gingival flaps were coronally advanced to fully cover the grafts and sutured.</p>
<p>In ADM + β-TCP group, the β-TCP used was whitish in color with macropore size 100–400 µm, diameter 0.5–1.5 mm, and porosity 75% (Osferion, Olympus Terumo Biomaterials Corp., Tokyo, Japan). The ADM graft covered the β-TCP particles and surrounding bone with the β-TCP particles completely filling the defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0885328211417643">Figure 1(c)</xref>). Finally, the flaps were replaced and coronally positioned and sutured with e-PTFE sutures.</p>
<p>In control CPF group, defects were treated by the same procedure as in the ADM but without the use of the ADM graft.</p>
<p>The animals were humanely killed with an intravenously administered overdose of sodium pentobarbital (Somnopentyl, Kyoritsu Seiyaku, Tokyo, Japan) at 4, 8, or 16 weeks after treatment. The grafts and surrounding tissues were removed and fixed in 10% formalin. Samples were decalcified with 10% ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA; Wako, Tokyo, Japan) for 5 months and then dehydrated in ethanol, embedded in paraffin, and serially sectioned to 5 µm in thickness in a mesiodistal orientation. The sections were cut inabuccal-lingual plane and then stained with hematoxylin-eosin, and Azan–Mallory’s and Verhoeff’s solutions. Serial sections were also stained by modified tetrachrom method.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0885328211417643">31</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="sec5-0885328211417643"><title>Morphometric analysis</title>
<p>Five sections from each root were used for microscopic examination and histometric assessment at ×40 magnification. The following features (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0885328211417643">Figure 2</xref>) were quantitatively assessed: apical notch to bone crest (new bone), apical notch to most coronal portion of the newly formed cementum (new cementum), horizontal measurement-coronal notch (CEJ) to external gingival surface (gingival thickness), coronal notch (CEJ) to apical border of junctional epithelium (epithelium), and apical notch to coronal notch (defect height).

<p>Verhoeff’s stain revealed the presence of elastin fibers in both the ADM and ADM + β-TCP groups. A greater quantity of elastin fibers was observed in ADM than in the overlying connective tissue of the mucosa.

<p>At 4 weeks, no new bone or cementum formation was observed in either the ADM + β-TCP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0885328211417643">Figure 4(a)</xref>) or ADM groups. In the ADM + β-TCP group, the root surface was filled with newly formed connective tissue composed of numerous macrophages and capillaries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0885328211417643">Figure 4(b)</xref>). Most of the implanted β-TCP particles were surrounded by numerous macrophages and capillaries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0885328211417643">Figure 4(b)</xref>). A few multinucleated cells adhered to the β-TCP particles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0885328211417643">Figure 4(b)</xref>). Long junctional epithelium was found apically along the root surface in the ADM group. Connective tissue attachment began at the apical end of the notch. Vascularization was observed in the ADM graft in both groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0885328211417643">Figure 4(c)</xref>). The capillaries in the ADM were thinner in both groups compared to in the connective tissue of the flap. The borders between the ADM and the gingival connective tissue were very distinct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0885328211417643">Figure 4(e)</xref>), and at this time point, the ADM exhibited two different characteristics. The surface in the contact with the flap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0885328211417643">Figure 4(f)</xref>) exhibited thick collagen fibers arranged in a well-defined pattern of distinct bundles with a dark blue color. On the surface facing the tooth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0885328211417643">Figure 4(e)</xref>), the ADM presented a mesh-like structure consisting of thick and dispersed fibers with a less organized aspect. The connective tissue surrounding the graft was blue, with a normal appearance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0885328211417643">Figure 4(e)</xref>). The ADM in both groups presented zones of dense collagen fibers with more distinct bundles than that in the adjacent connective tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0885328211417643">Figure 4(f)</xref>). Fine elastic fibers were observed scattered throughout the reticular and papillary layers of the graft (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0885328211417643">Figure 4(d)</xref>).</p>
<p>At 8 weeks, the ADM + β-TCP group showed a greater area of new bone and cementum formation than the ADM group, and the dentin surface exhibited a thin layer of cementum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0885328211417643">Figure 5(a)</xref>). Newly formed bone was detected around the β-TCP particles; osteoblasts had deposited a layer of blue-stained osteoid tissue on the surface of the β-TCP particles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0885328211417643">Figure 5(b)</xref>). A layer of newly formed cementum extended from the apical notch of the root surface to the coronal portion. A greater continuity of connective tissue and ADM was observed at 8 weeks of healing than at 4 weeks of healing. The vessels of various calibers were detected penetrating into the total extent of the ADM, regardless of whether the ADM was in contact with connective tissue or periosteum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0885328211417643">Figure 5(c)</xref>). Collagen fibers oriented in the ADM direction indicated incorporation of the ADM and the adjacent connective tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0885328211417643">Figure 5(d)</xref>).

<p>At 16 weeks, β-TCP particles in the ADM + β-TCP group were surrounded within the bone tissue and newly formed bone, which had originated from the base of the defects. The width of the newly formed bone was thicker and the area of β-TCP particles smaller (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0885328211417643">Figure 6(a)</xref>). New bone and cementum formations were observed in the coronal portion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0885328211417643">Figure 6(b)</xref>). A well-organized periodontal ligament space was observed between the teeth and newly formed bone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0885328211417643">Figure 6(b)</xref>). In the ADM group, epithelial downgrowth had also occurred from the coronal portion to the apical portion of the root surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0885328211417643">Figure 6(c)</xref>). New cementum was observed in the apical portion of the root surface. In the ADM in both groups, the connective tissue presented a normal, well-vascularized aspect throughout the specimen, with few collagen fibers in a disorganized distribution remaining in the ADM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0885328211417643">Figure 6(d)</xref>). The ADM and connective tissue seemed to be integrated into a single highly vascularized structure, representing almost complete incorporation of the ADM. The mucosa overlying the ADM graft, with its loosely arranged collagen, also showed loosely arranged elastin.

<p>One important outcome with the surgical procedure used in this study was the change observed in the thickness of the tissue, from a thin marginal tissue, indicating risk of gingival recession, to a thick gingival margin. When ADM graft materials were placed in the defects (6.3 mm), similar gingival thicknesses were obtained in both the ADM + β-TCP (1.61 ± 0.1 mm) and ADM (1.64 ± 0.1 mm) groups. In the CPF (control) group, however, the increase in tissue thickness was not significant. Gingival thickness in the ADM group was similar to that reported in an earlier study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0885328211417643">19</xref></sup> This suggests that ADM grafting is effective in increasing the thickness of gingival marginal tissue.</p>
<p>A low level of cemental deposition was observed in both the ADM and CPF groups (1.12 ± 0.1 and 4.34 ± 0.1 mm, respectively), and only a small amount of new bone formation was noted in most of the teeth in the two groups (−0.58 ± 0.1 and 0.81 ± 0.1 mm in the ADM and CPF groups, respectively). Other studies reported no significant difference between the ADM alone and CPF groups.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0885328211417643">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0885328211417643">32</xref></sup> The graft material failed to create a space sufficient for regeneration. In this study, buccal alveolar bone was generally thin (or resorbed) and the space between the flap and root surface minimal, because the graft did not contribute to the creation of a significant space for regeneration.</p>
<p>These factors, plus the short observation period, are considered to explain the low levels of cemental deposition and new bone formation observed in the ADM and CPF groups. However, the primary objective in the treatment of recession-type defects is not only complete coverage, but also the attachment of new cementum to the denuded root surface and functional restoration accompanied by new bone formation.</p>
<p>The most important finding in this study was that the ADM + β-TCP group clearly enhanced new cementum and bone formations without ankylosis or epithelial downgrowth. This combination yielded an increase in new bone and cementum to 2.85 ± 0.6 and 6.09 ± 0.3 mm, respectively, compared to −0.58 ± 0.1 and 1.12 ± 0.1 mm, respectively, in the ADM group. In this study, β-TCP particles induced the development of a favorable vascular network without markedly inhibiting bone growth or affecting the normal remodeling process. Thus, the ADM + β-TCP group may have been responsible for the enhancement of attachment of osteoblasts observed at 4 weeks after implantation. Histological analysis demonstrated that many residual β-TCP particles were distributed from the apical to the coronal portion of the defects, and that they developed small surface erosions and, less frequently, cracks. As reported by other studies,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0885328211417643">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0885328211417643">34</xref></sup> signs of bone formation were observed on the external surfaces of and inside the particles in areas that were away from the bone walls. It is observed that β-TCP particles were interspersed in newly formed lamellar bone at 8 weeks after implantation, confirming the osteoconductive properties of β-TCP, which were demonstrated in previous studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0885328211417643">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0885328211417643">34</xref></sup> This suggests that the spaces created between the β-TCP particles promoted angiogenesis and favored osteoconduction. Moreover, these interparticulate spaces are considered to have provided microporosity and favored resorption of the β-TCP particles, including bone formation by osteoclast-like cells and osteoblasts. These observations suggest that the combination of ADM grafts and β-TCP particles promoted new cementum and bone formations.</p>
<p>The ADM allograft is a human collagen material that offers the potential of acting as a scaffold that can be incorporated into the native collagen.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0885328211417643">9</xref></sup> Initial vessel infiltration into the ADM from canine connective tissue was observed at 4 weeks after implantation. This finding was in agreement with the results reported by Livesey et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0885328211417643">35</xref></sup> Even considering the differences in healing dynamics and patterns between rats and dogs, blood vessel infiltration was verified to be a characteristic commonly observed in the initial process of graft incorporation with the host tissue. We demonstrated that blood vessel penetration was similar in areas facing the root surface. This suggests that the initial phase of integration of the graft material into the host tissues is characterized by intense vascular proliferation. During the first 4 weeks, despite infiltration of blood vessels and collagen fibers from the connective tissues into the material, the ADM allograft was not completely incorporated into the host tissues. Staining with Verhoeff’s solution revealed an abundance of elastin in the connective tissue. Elastin fibers were found in the ADM allograft, but not in gingival mucosa. This suggests that this distinct difference in the organization of elastin and collagen fibers allowed differentiation of the graft from overlying mucosal tissues. At 8 weeks, the fibers of the ADM allograft were more organized, probably due to more intense cell penetration, especially that of fibroblasts from the flap, which are responsible for collagen fiber extrusion and subsequent deposition throughout the ADM structure. This was a finding very different from that obtained at 4 weeks. In this study, it was impossible to distinguish ADM allograft from connective tissue at 16 weeks. Although ADM allograft was almost completely incorporated at this point, a few remaining elastin fibers were noted in the graft. This suggests that the ADM allograft incorporation process follows a relatively similar healing pattern, beginning with initial blood vessel and collagen fiber infiltration into the graft material and continuing with gradual intensification until total incorporation into the adjacent tissues.</p>
<p>In conclusion, β-TCP in combination with ADM graft promoted greater formation of new cementum and bone than ADM alone. This suggests that β-TCP in combination with an ADM graft enhances periodontal regeneration, which is important for the long-term stability of the gingival margin. This hypothesis remains to be verified by additional long-term human studies.</p>
