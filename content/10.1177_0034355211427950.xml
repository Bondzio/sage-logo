<abstract>
<p>Vocational rehabilitation (VR) professionals are critical partners in the transition process for students with disabilities; therefore, they are required to develop transition service delivery proficiencies. VR professional perceptions of transition competencies are seldom examined due to the perception that transition falls mainly on school-based professionals. In this study, VR professionals from three states were surveyed on their perceptions regarding transition competencies. Specifically, seven transition domain areas (i.e., <italic>Providing Career Planning and Counseling, Providing Career Preparation Experiences, Facilitating Allocation of Resources, Promoting Access and Opportunity for Student Success, Conducting Program Improvement Activities, Building and Maintaining Collaborative Partnerships</italic>, and <italic>Promoting Nonprofessional Supports and Relationships</italic>) were examined and reported across importance, preparedness, and frequency. Results showed that importance rankings were rated very high overall across all competencies (µ = 3.42). Preparedness was the next highest overall rating (µ = 2.77), and frequency in performing transition competencies was the lowest (µ = 2.55). Paired <italic>t</italic> tests also showed a significant difference between each of the pairs of ratings. In addition, the findings indicated that although all domains were identified as very important, respondents did not indicate they were as prepared or participated as frequently in these transition activities. Individual domain rankings and rationale as well as implications for practice are also discussed.</p>

<body>
<p>The number of students with disabilities requesting transition services from vocational rehabilitation (VR) professionals has been consistently increasing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0034355211427950">Everson &amp; Moon, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0034355211427950">Hayward &amp; Schmidt-Davis, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0034355211427950">Lamb, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0034355211427950">Lugas, Timmons, &amp; Smith, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0034355211427950">Oertle &amp; Trach, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0034355211427950">Plotner, 2009</xref>). With this increase, VR professionals have been required to continue to develop proficiencies to evolve with the everchanging field of rehabilitation and special education service delivery. Consequently, services and programs used in transition service delivery have been disputed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0034355211427950">Noonan, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0034355211427950">Oertle &amp; Trach, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0034355211427950">Sitlington, Clark, &amp; Kolstoe, 2000</xref>). There continues to be a considerably significant discrepancy between students with disabilities and their peers in many postsecondary areas, such as employment, postsecondary education, and community participation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0034355211427950">Cameto, Levine, &amp; Wagner, 2004</xref>). It is critical that VR professionals have insight into the myriad of transition competencies to enhance the quality of services provided to maximize the outcomes of those transition-age individuals they serve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0034355211427950">Kamens, Dolyniuk, &amp; Dinardo, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0034355211427950">Kohler, 1996</xref>). Albeit the importance of VR participation in transition services is well documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0034355211427950">Ethridge, Rodger, &amp; Fabian, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0034355211427950">Oertle &amp; Trach, 2007</xref>), many issues confound VR involvement. The purpose of this study was to examine VR professionals’ perceptions of the importance and frequency of certain transition competencies and how prepared these professionals feel in performing these activities in their current position.</p>
<p>The role of transition professionals (VR and school system) requires an understanding of the various aspects involved in the transition process, which must focus specifically on the student (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0034355211427950">Plotner, Shogren, &amp; Strauser, 2011</xref>). To date, to what extent VR professionals use transition competencies and whether they have the proper training to perform such activities is unknown. This problem is further confounded by the lack of an invitation to transition planning meetings for many counselors who may later be requested to provide transition services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0034355211427950">Agran, Cain, &amp; Cavin, 2002</xref>). Previous research suggests that schools and transition service practitioners such as VR counselors may have been unsuccessful in part because school professionals have not understood the VR system. Conversely, VR professionals may not have understood the needs of students in transition. Furthermore, procedures to support collaboration between VR and public school have been questionable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0034355211427950">Benz, Johnson, Mikkelsen, &amp; Lindstrom, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0034355211427950">Oertle &amp; Trach, 2007</xref>). It is essential that all transition professionals develop the necessary attitudes, knowledge, skills, and abilities necessary to prepare students with disabilities to successfully transition to the adult world. The special education literature is replete with studies that discuss transition services; however, there is limited empirical research on transition-related competencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0034355211427950">deFur &amp; Taymans, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0034355211427950">Knott &amp; Asselin, 1999</xref>), especially those specific to VR professionals. Similarly, there is a vast amount of transition competencies that are needed to ensure successful outcomes for transition-age youth with disabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0034355211427950">Benitez, Morningstar, &amp; Frey, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0034355211427950">deFur &amp; Taymans, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0034355211427950">Kohler, 1999</xref>). An understanding of the competencies that VR views as important as well as what competencies they are performing need to be examined and might increase relationships between VR and public schools. In addition, the current study contributes to the literature an insight of what current VR professionals perceive in regard to transition practices. The following research questions were used to guide this study:</p>

<sec id="section2-0034355211427950">
<title>Instrument Construction</title>
<p>Using special education and VR sources, a comprehensive review of the transition-focused literature (including existing transition survey instruments) was conducted to obtain the original pool of items. A total of 106 transition-specific competency/activity statements were gathered. The research team reviewed the pool of items to identify any overlapping or duplicate items. In addition, the survey was refined through two more processes: content reviewers and pilot testing. Five individuals with at least 4 years of transition experiences served as the content reviewers. Each of the content reviewers had a master’s degree in rehabilitation counseling. The content reviewers provided feedback on (a) adequacy of overall coverage, (b) distinctiveness of each item, (c) clarity of each item, and (d) whether any items needed to be added or deleted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0034355211427950">Alreck &amp; Settle, 1985</xref>). This was followed up with a pilot study consisting of 10 current VR transition coordinators providing an additional level of feedback and opinions regarding item coverage and totality. After each of the content validity processes, the survey instrument was refined and consisted of 59 transition items.</p>
<p>The survey used Likert-type scale ratings with the stem: “How important do you feel the activity is for your position in the service delivery of transition-age youth with disabilities, how frequently do you perform these activities in your current position, and how prepared do you feel in performing these activities.” The Likert-type scale choices were (a) <italic>not at all</italic> important, frequent, or prepared; (b) of <italic>little</italic> importance, frequency, or preparation; (c) <italic>moderately</italic> important, frequent, or prepared; and (d) <italic>extremely</italic> important, frequent, or prepared.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0034355211427950">
<title>Procedures and Participants</title>
<p>The online survey was developed and disseminated across three midwestern states (i.e., Illinois, Ohio, and Wisconsin) to examine State VR counselors’ perspectives of transition competencies. Directories of all VR counselors in each of he states were obtained for this study. Because each directory did not list caseload information including percentage of caseload that was transition age (i.e., 14–22), the total sample (i.e., all VR counselors) received the survey. Letters that provided background information about the study, a consent form, and a link to the survey were sent to 707 VR professionals. However, only VR professionals who at the time of the study had transition-age youth on their caseload were used in the study. A total of 291 VR counselors who serve transition-age youth completed the survey resulting in a 42% response rate. Because only a portion of the 707 VR professionals had transition-age youth on their caseloads, information on how many general VR counselors who did or did not have transition-age youth on their caseload prior to survey dissemination would have been desirable and would have increased the precision of the sample population and would have resulted in a more accurate and higher response rate. In addition, this study did not obtain demographic data on nonresponders; however, to explore how similar or different the nonrespondents were from the total sample, only geographic information was analyzed. This analysis showed that transition counselors from each geographic area (state region) were represented. More in-depth information regarding VR professional background and experience from nonresponders in transition would have been preferred.</p>
<p>Participants included 214 (74%) females and 77 (26%) males. The majority of the participants were from Ohio (<italic>n</italic> = 134; 46%), followed by Wisconsin and Illinois, 81 (28%) and 76 (26%), respectively. In all, 24% reported having a primary responsibility serving transition-age youth, whereas 76% were considered general VR counselors who served only a portion of transition-age youth consumers. In fact, 55% of the participants reported having less than 20% of their caseload made up of transition-age youth. A total of 48% were certified rehabilitation counselors with 82% having a master’s degree. In all, 60% of the participants had more than 6 years experience with only 10% having less than 2 years experience working with transition-age youth.</p>

<title>Data Analysis Procedures</title>
<p>An online survey was used for respondents to rate their beliefs regarding the most important and frequently performed transition competencies and competencies they felt most prepared to perform. The purpose of this article was to describe current VR counselors’ perceptions regarding transition competencies. Therefore, means, percentages, and standard deviations were computed for each dependent variable (i.e., importance, frequency, and preparedness) across each of the seven domains. Paired sample <italic>t</italic> tests were used to determine if the three constructs significantly differed from zero. The 95% confidence interval was calculated for each comparison, which included an examination of the degree of variability. If the interval did not include zero, the results were considered significant. The data were examined using <italic>t</italic> tests for importance and frequency, importance and preparedness, and frequency and preparedness across each domain.</p>
<p>To reduce the data into domains and, therefore, render them more suitable for analysis, importance rankings were factor analyzed using principle components extraction and orthogonal rotation to the varimax criterion. The Kaiser normalization criterion of an eigenvalue cutoff of 1.0 or greater was applied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0034355211427950">Marradi, 1981</xref>). The final model consisted of seven domains: (a) <italic>Provide Career Planning and Counseling</italic>, (b) <italic>Provide Career Preparation Experiences</italic>, (c) <italic>Facilitate Allocation of Resources</italic>, (d) <italic>Build and Maintain Collaborative Partnerships</italic>, (e) <italic>Promote Nonprofessional Support and Relationships</italic>, (f) <italic>Promote Access and Opportunity for Student Success</italic>, and (g) <italic>Coordinate Program Improvement Activities</italic>. Each of the domains is titled by the research team. Domain title, brief descriptions of each domain, and sample transition survey items for each domain are included in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0034355211427950">Table 1</xref>.

There was a 0.95-µ difference between the highest ranking and the lowest ranking domain in regard to preparedness.

<sec id="section9-0034355211427950">
<title>Frequency</title>
<p>Frequency ranked lower than importance and preparedness. Mean ranking scores of VR counselor perceptions regarding transition competency frequency were significantly lower than importance and preparedness µ scores. The frequency µ across each of the seven domains was 2.55 ranging from 2.16 to 3.19 (<italic>SD</italic> ranged from .59–.71). The top three competency domains were <italic>Provide Career Planning and Counseling</italic> (µ = 3.19), <italic>Facilitate Allocation of Resources</italic> (µ = 2.79), and <italic>Provide Career Preparation Experiences</italic> (µ = 2.69). The other four domains were <italic>Build and Maintain Collaborative Partnerships</italic> (µ = 2.43), <italic>Facilitate Nonprofessional Support and Relationships</italic> (µ = 2.38), <italic>Promote Access and Opportunity for Student Success</italic> (µ = 2.19), and <italic>Coordinate Program Improvement Activities</italic> (µ = 2.16). There was a 1.03-µ difference between the highest ranking and the lowest ranking domain in regard to frequency, which suggests much more variance in frequency than that of importance for each domain. The low means scores suggest that many counselors are not performing transition-related activities that they consider important. The highest µ was 3.18 (i.e., <italic>Career Planning and Counseling</italic>) and indicates that there are no domains considered extremely frequent among VR counselors.</p>
<sec id="section10-0034355211427950">
<title>Paired sample t tests</title>
<p>A paired sample <italic>t</italic> test was used to determine if the constructs differ significantly from each of the other dependent variables (i.e., importance, frequency, and preparedness). The results of the <italic>t</italic> test are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0034355211427950">Table 4</xref>. Each of the three overall means was reported as significantly different when compared with one another. There was a significant difference in the scores for importance (µ = 3.4, <italic>SD</italic> = .37) and frequency (µ = 2.5, <italic>SD</italic> = .54), <italic>t</italic>(231) = 25.35, <italic>p</italic> = .01. There was also a significant difference in the scores of importance (µ = 3.4, <italic>SD</italic> = .37) and preparedness (µ = 2.77, <italic>SD</italic> = .55), <italic>t</italic>(231) = 18.79, <italic>p</italic> = .01, and in the scores of frequency (µ = 2.5, <italic>SD</italic> = .54) and preparedness (µ = 2.77, <italic>SD</italic> = .55), <italic>t</italic>(231) = 9.56, <italic>p</italic> = .01. These results suggest that each of the three constructs is substantially diverse in how professionals perceive them. Specifically, these results suggest that VR professionals feel transition activities are important, but feel less prepared to perform them and perform them even less.</p>

<title>Considerations</title>
<p>Domain level analysis is a useful way to organize and view a big picture when identifying needed areas; however, one critical transition item (i.e., facilitating self-determination) did not factor into a domain, but is believed to be worthy of reporting.</p>
<p>Individuals who are self-determined apply “a combination of skills, knowledge and beliefs” that enable them “to engage in goal-directed, self-regulated, autonomous behavior and understand of one’s strengths and limitations together with a belief in oneself as capable and effective” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0034355211427950">Field, Martin, Miller, Ward, &amp; Wehmeyer, 1998</xref>, p. 2). This competency area could have multiple contexts and subcomponents and therefore should be examined further. It is promising, however, that VR professionals reported performing this activity at a moderate level (µ = 2.91). In addition, it was also valued at a high level (µ = 3.65), and participants felt moderately prepared when performing this competency area (µ = 3.08).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0034355211427950">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Transition competencies were identified from the literature to assist in the development of the survey instrument (i.e., VR–Transition Activities Inventory [VR-TAI]), an instrument that allowed us to assess the perceptions of VR professionals who work in the field of transition. However, only three midwestern states were used in this study. Transition service delivery often looks different in some states, school districts, and even individual schools ranging from providing direct services, such as job placement and transition assessment, to establishing policy and procedures, linking transition team members by providing in-service training to staff, families, and students with disabilities. A broader range of states would have been more desirable. The survey instrument used solicited information about transition in general and did not take into account the unique needs of specific disabilities. It would have been beneficial to understand VR perceptions of transition competencies that are specific to various disability types.</p>
<p>Research regarding transition services are primarily rooted in the special education literature and often viewed solely as a school-based function. The majority of transition competency studies explore a teacher perspective but rarely an adult service provider perspective such as VR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0034355211427950">Plotner, Trach, et al., in press</xref>). In fact, in a recent content analysis of VR publication outlets, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0034355211427950">Plotner, Shogren, et al. (2011)</xref> reviewed 2,571 articles finding less than 5% of articles specifically addressing transition services. VR counselor participation in transition continues to be fragmented and questionable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0034355211427950">Agran et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0034355211427950">Benitez et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0034355211427950">Oertle &amp; Trach, 2007</xref>), consequently contributing to poor postschool outcomes for students with disabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0034355211427950">Newman, Wagner, Cameto, Knokey, &amp; Shaver, 2010</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-0034355211427950">
<title>Important Transition Competency Areas for VR</title>
<p>This study indicates that the domain areas perceived by VR to be the most important are <italic>Providing Career Planning and Counseling</italic> (µ = 3.77), <italic>Providing Career Preparation Experiences</italic> (µ = 3.56), and <italic>Facilitating Allocation of Resources</italic> (µ = 3.55). Furthermore, the overall importance mean (µ = 3.42) for each of the seven domains indicates that VR counselors believe each of the domain areas are moderately to extremely important. This importance extends to activities traditionally viewed as school-based functions suggesting that VR counselors view a significant overlap between public school and VR services. While these data suggest VR professionals value each of the domains the question remains why VR professionals are not involved in any of these areas.</p>
<p>Multiple studies suggest that secondary transition professionals have little practical knowledge of interagency collaboration, such as eligibility requirements or roles of various adult service agencies, which contributed to unsatisfactory levels of involvement in collaboration-related activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0034355211427950">deFur &amp; Taymans, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0034355211427950">Knott &amp; Asselin, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0034355211427950">Oertle &amp; Trach, 2007</xref>). After examining transition components of 399 Individual Education Plans (IEPs), <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0034355211427950">Powers, Gil-Kashiwabara, Geenen, Powers, Baladran, and Palmer (2005)</xref> found that interagency transition connections were inadequate. These findings suggest that the lack of collaboration most likely stems from inconsistently recognizing all transition partners, a general awareness of these partners, or who to contact. This lack of understanding promotes VR and school systems to develop their own goals, mission, funding source, and legislative history, along with personnel training and qualifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0034355211427950">Szymanski &amp; Danek, 1985</xref>). However, if all transition professionals value the same practices and competency areas, it is essential that transition specialists in the various disciplines become familiar with the roles of other agencies and parallel service systems such as VR, and how to operationalize a continuum of services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0034355211427950">Severson, Hoover, &amp; Wheeler, 1994</xref>). Agencies from different service systems not only need to collaborate to execute transition planning successfully (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0034355211427950">Kohler, 2003</xref>) but also must develop working knowledge of multiple disciplines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0034355211427950">deFur &amp; Taymans, 1995</xref>).</p>

<title>Perceptions of Preparedness in Transition and VR</title>
<p>To ensure successful outcomes for students with disabilities transitioning into adult life, VR professionals require certain knowledge and skills. The top three domains in level of preparedness were identical to importance and frequency of activities: <italic>Career Planning and Counseling</italic> (µ = 3.32), <italic>Facilitate Allocation of Resources</italic> (µ = 3.01), and <italic>Provide Career Preparation Experiences</italic> (µ = 2.92). These findings correspond with previous transition competency literature suggesting that VR professionals continue to be excluded from preparation in transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0034355211427950">Benitez et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0034355211427950">deFur &amp; Taymans, 1995</xref>). VR counselors report <italic>little</italic> to <italic>moderate</italic> preparedness in every domain except for <italic>Career Planning and Counseling</italic>. More extensive preparation in career planning is supported by existing literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0034355211427950">Benitez et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0034355211427950">deFur &amp; Taymans, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0034355211427950">Morningstar, Kyeong-Hunt, &amp; Clark, 2008</xref>). Although inferences can be drawn from the existing literature, there is limited information regarding how VR professionals receive transition-focused training at the preservice level. In regard to training and professional development, 85% of the participants reported attending transition-related training only seldom or very seldom. This study suggests that more preservice and continuing education is necessary for VR professionals to assume an effective role in transition services.</p>
<p>The literature base suggests that the entire school community must work together to assist students to successfully complete the transition process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0034355211427950">Kohler, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0034355211427950">Oertle &amp; Trach, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0034355211427950">Plotner, Shogren, et al., 2011</xref>). Legislation requires that public schools conduct formal interagency agreements with their partners, including VR professionals. In addition, this legislation has spawned numerous studies that explore the best transition service delivery practices as they relate to transition service delivery and interagency collaboration. Yet, even with legislative mandates, efforts and outcomes do not always achieve the desired outcomes. Collaboration, via knowledge sharing and frequent communication, must exist if VR professionals are to become equipped to perform the full scope of transition services. Increasing training opportunities and working closer with transition professionals should only increase self-efficacy and feelings of preparedness when delivering transition services. State VR counselors must perform outside of their established boundaries for transition-age youth to obtain successful VR services and appropriate adult outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0034355211427950">Plotner, Trach, et al., in press</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0034355211427950">Taymans &amp; deFur, 1994</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-0034355211427950">
<title>Frequency of Transition Services and VR</title>
<p>The three domains reported as most frequent to VR transition services were also the same as importance: <italic>Provide Career Planning and Counseling</italic> (µ = 3.18); <italic>Facilitate Allocation of Resources</italic> (µ = 2.79); and <italic>Provide Career Preparation Experiences</italic> (µ = 2.69), but with a lower overall mean (µ = 2.55). This data suggests that the top three areas are all used to some extent with VR consumers of all ages and not always specific to transition-age students. In addition, results could be biased, in part, to certain professionals having a relatively small transition-age youth caseload, which would not provide an opportunity to practice numerous activities. The domains <italic>Promoting Access and Opportunity for Student Success</italic> and <italic>Conducting Program Improvement Activities</italic> were ranked the two lowest frequency domains suggesting VR counselors may view these as primary responsibilities of other school professionals. Yet, a broader view of improvement activities and promoting success for students should be undertaken by all transition team members. It is critical that all transition stakeholders be vested in all critical transition activities.</p>
<p>Effectively working toward the same collaborative goal requires a clear understanding of how roles and duties are assigned. However, <italic>Building and Maintaining Collaborative Partnerships</italic> was ranked fifth (µ = 2.38). Activities in this domain (e.g., attend planning meetings, coordinate formal interagency agreements, coordinate transition team responsibilities, and participate in local transition planning council) are the vehicles that lead to better collaboration and are fundamental to the function of the transition team. These findings suggest that collaboration activities are not taking place. Moving from an “entitlement” service such as education to an “eligibility” system such as VR requires a link to postschool environments to assist in securing and continuing services in these environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0034355211427950">Shriner, Plotner, &amp; Rose, 2010</xref>). The variance between importance and frequency scores suggest that even though VR professionals believe these areas to be important, the skills, opportunities, initiatives, or relationships with teams has not permitted anticipated performance. A disconnect has created a breakdown in communication and team work negating an effective collaborative approach to transition services.</p>

<sec id="section16-0034355211427950">
<title>Implications for Practice</title>
<p>The results of this study have some potentially important implications for education and VR transition practice, policy, and training based on counselors’ perceptions of transition competencies. <italic>Career Planning and Counseling</italic> was identified as the most important and frequent domain, with the best preparation for performing these activities. This study suggests that VR counselors already believe that most activities, regardless if they are performing it frequently, are important for VR counselors to understand. It is important for all transition team members to understand the universal elements of transition services.</p>
<p>One disconcerting result was that the µ scores from importance and preparedness were significantly higher than that of frequency. Therefore, VR counselors feel these areas are important and feel prepared to do them; the key may be to determine what prohibits them from performing them. We must consider that training programs may not be equipping VR counselors with the necessary transition skills. Opposing views on roles and responsibilities of transition team members can obstruct interagency collaboration efforts. Yet, it is comforting that VR counselors place high importance on most competency domain areas. Regrettably, literature suggests that rehabilitation professionals are the least connected to transition teams (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0034355211427950">Agran et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0034355211427950">Oertle &amp; Trach, 2007</xref>). The National Council on Disability (October, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0034355211427950">2008</xref>) published a report examining outcomes for transition-age youth and the extent to which VR’s existing structure promotes effective transition service delivery to transition-age youth with disabilities. This report concluded that VR participation in delivering such service needs strengthening. One recommendation made to the Office of Special Education and Rehabilitation Services (OSERS) was to have State VR agencies allocate additional staff development resources for the preparation of current and future rehabilitation counselors to meet the needs of transition-age youth. This supports a belief that additional knowledge-sharing mechanisms and cross-training opportunities are crucial for maximizing student success.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the transition process conceptual framework domain structure (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0034355211427950">Figure 1</xref>) identifies areas for VR professional development efforts, both preservice and in-service, enhances future communication and collaboration due to an improved awareness of competencies, and contributes to the current literature by giving the field a better understanding of the VR transition competencies. One explanation for low levels of preparation could be the limited continuing education and preservice opportunities for VR counselors. Consequently, the fields of VR and special education have recognized various competencies that offer a foundation for professional practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0034355211427950">deFur &amp; Taymans, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0034355211427950">Division on Career Development and Transition, 2000</xref>). Certifications and specializations for VR professionals providing transition service could promote this. The current transition specialist certificate programs almost exclusively encapsulated within special education programs could be extended to VR. An increasing need in transition preservice efforts in related fields such as VR is warranted. This study provides some initial evidence regarding the extent that VR professionals are prepared. VR professional development must incorporate the unique competencies involved in transition services from the various disciplines to expand their role in transition. Leaders of VR preservice training programs may want to consider incorporating a transition-focused seminar and/or a transition-based practicum or internship. For successful postschool outcomes, it is crucial that VR transition practitioners step into this position with the necessary skills and commit to receiving ongoing training as new practices develop.</p>
