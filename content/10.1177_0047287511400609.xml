<abstract>
<p>In this study, information-processing strategies that travelers use in information judgment and decision making were investigated. The study results indicate that individuals use certain information attributes (i.e., text argument quality, picture attractiveness) in different involvement situations. Low-involved individuals under a strong argument condition focused on picture attractiveness to quickly assess positive or negative values. High-involved individuals focused on both text argument quality and picture attractiveness for comprehensive evaluation. Three rules were revealed for high-involved individuals’ interactive processing because of offsetting, redundancy, and negative-valence effects. Theoretical implications are discussed and marketing implications are suggested based on these findings.</p>

<p>Consumer researchers have put considerable effort into revealing information-processing strategies because it is essential to understand individual’s psychological processes that shape decision making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0047287511400609">Engel, Blackwell, and Miniard 1995</xref>). Information-processing strategies, however, have been little studied in travel and tourism contexts. Travel and tourism studies have focused rather on traveler-related factors that correlate with decision making, such as travelers’ demographic profiles, travel motivations, and trip features (e.g., trip duration, travel party; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0047287511400609">Fodness and Murray 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0047287511400609">Weber and Roehl 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0047287511400609">Woodside and Lysonski 1989</xref>). In developing theoretical models to explain and predict travel decision-making behaviors, researchers have attempted to include all of these factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0047287511400609">Mathieson and Wall 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0047287511400609">Mountinho 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0047287511400609">Schmoll 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0047287511400609">Woodside and MacDonald 1994</xref>). As a result, the models are very complex and detailed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0047287511400609">Decrop 1999</xref>), but these studies still have limitations in discovering the substantive rules that travelers use in decision making because they have examined correlations of varying traveler-related variables instead of examining information attributes that affect decision making.</p>
<p>A few researchers have sought information attributes that influence decision making and found that the type of information sources selected, the amount of information searched for, and the type of information used for decision making differ by stage (i.e., pre-, during-, or post-trip) or by product characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0047287511400609">Card, Chen, and Cole 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0047287511400609">Fesenmaier and Jeng 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0047287511400609">Jun, Vogt, and MacKay 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0047287511400609">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0047287511400609">Stewart and Vogt 1999</xref>). These studies are, however, still limited in their ability to explain which information attributes cause behavioral differences. They have suggested that future studies should focus on identifying information attributes that predict decision-making behaviors and demonstrate consistent causal relationships.</p>
<p>The research problem of this study was to investigate the information-processing strategies that travelers use for decision making. It is important to unveil systematically consistent and measurable attributes that define information-processing strategy dynamics. This study examined the influences of three factors (i.e., an effortful cue, an effortless cue, and involvement) on individuals’ information judgment and decision making. A full factorial experimental design was constructed to investigate direct causal relationships between three independent factors and dependent variables (i.e., attitudes, intention). The knowledge of how individuals use certain information features in different involvement situations will assist advertisers in developing advertising strategies that better match consumer’s needs and cause product purchasing.</p>
<sec id="section1-0047287511400609">
<title>Theoretical Background</title>
<p>Decision-making studies in travel and tourism have been dominated by <italic>rational choice theory</italic>, which suggests that individuals are rational decision makers and thus conduct a complete search for information, make an optimal decision, and implement a trip as planned; however, this theory has been criticized as unrealistic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0047287511400609">Bettman, Johnson, and Payne 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0047287511400609">Decrop 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0047287511400609">Jun, Vogt, and MacKay 2010</xref>). Taking a more realistic approach, information-processing strategies are based on <italic>constructive consumer choice processes</italic> (CCCP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0047287511400609">Bettman, Johnson, and Payne 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0047287511400609">Bettman, Luce, and Payne 1998</xref>) grounded in <italic>bounded rationality</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0047287511400609">Kahneman 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0047287511400609">Simon 1979</xref>). Bounded rationality is a school of thought about decision making developed from dissatisfaction with the rational choice theory and influenced by the psychological process of reasoning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0047287511400609">Jones 1999</xref>).</p>
<p>CCCP suggests that decision-making processes are heuristic and contingent because of individuals’ limited information-processing capacity and complex information environments. Individuals cannot process all information available and sometimes ignore available information, especially when it is not relevant to their decision-making goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0047287511400609">Jones 1999</xref>). In addition, individuals make decisions in a complex information environment in which they have to deal with a large number of alternatives and abundant information available from many sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0047287511400609">Bettman, Johnson, and Payne 1991</xref>). Although researchers have expected that recent technological developments (e.g., Internet) would enhance convenience and cost-effectiveness of individuals’ information searches, some suggest that the myriad of information provided by new technology actually increases uncertainties in choice and decreases effectiveness of information searches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0047287511400609">Bettman, Luce, and Payne 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0047287511400609">Lurie 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>In accordance with CCCP, <italic>case-based vacation planning</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0047287511400609">Jun, Vogt, and MacKay 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0047287511400609">Stewart and Vogt 1999</xref>) suggests that travel planning and decision making is contingent. During vacation-planning and actual-trip phases, unexpected events keep happening and thus plan changes are necessary. For example, an individual misses his or her flight because of a car accident on a highway to the airport or his or her airplane is delayed because of bad weather. Because of the contingent events, new information processing and decision making continuously occur until a trip ends. While repeating these processes, individuals learn how to deal with unexpected situations and construct their own effective and efficient means to process information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0047287511400609">Jun, Vogt, and MacKay 2010</xref>). These constructed means evolved through experience become useful strategies that individuals use in current and future decision making.</p>
<sec id="section2-0047287511400609">
<title>Elaboration Likelihood Model of Persuasion</title>
<p>Consumer behavior researchers have revealed information-processing strategies by employing the <italic>elaboration likelihood model of persuasion</italic> (ELM; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0047287511400609">Petty, Cacioppo, and Schumann 1983</xref>). ELM emphasizes that any one of the dual modes (i.e., central route as an effortful mode and peripheral route as an effortless mode) can have an impact on persuasion depending on involvement levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0047287511400609">Reinhard and Sporer 2008</xref>). According to ELM, <italic>involvement</italic> is defined as the amount of attention an individual directs to product information and the degree to which he or she perceives the concept to be personally relevant for his or her purchase decision making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0047287511400609">Celsi and Olson 1988</xref>). A <italic>central cue</italic> generates thinking that has a tendency toward rationality and logic. Individuals exert a central route to answer specific questions for their purchase decision making and to reduce purchase associated risks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0047287511400609">Novak, Hoffman, and Duhachek 2003</xref>). A <italic>peripheral cue</italic> is defined as an element in messages that is not central to the product’s merits and typically requires less cognitive effort in processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0047287511400609">Petty, Cacioppo, and Schumann 1983</xref>).</p>
<p>ELM suggests that individuals in high-involvement situations pay more attention to information and put more effort into information processing because they feel that their information judgments have important consequences for themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0047287511400609">Petty, Cacioppo, and Schumann 1983</xref>). High-involved individuals focus on argument merits in advertisements and thus the extent of attitude change is often dependent on the quality of claims (i.e., central cues; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0047287511400609">Petty, Unnava, and Strathman 1991</xref>). In contrast, individuals in low-involvement situations feel that their judgment about information is inconsequential; therefore, their motivation to process information is attenuated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0047287511400609">Petty, Unnava, and Strathman 1991</xref>). Low-involved individuals look for a simple, quick, and easy way to judge information, rather than examining all of the information carefully (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0047287511400609">Petty and Wegener 1999</xref>). In low-involvement conditions, attitudes are often affected by variables like status of product endorsers or picture attractiveness in advertisements (i.e., peripheral cues; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0047287511400609">Oh and Jasper 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0047287511400609">Petty, Cacioppo, and Schumann 1983</xref>).</p>
<p>Under a dichotomous approach, ELM studies assume that verbal cues are central as they present product merits and nonverbal cues are peripheral as they present no or few product merits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0047287511400609">Petty, Cacioppo, and Schumann 1983</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0047287511400609">Petty and Cacioppo (1980)</xref>, however, found that an endorser’s attractiveness in a picture was equally important for beauty products under both high- and low-involvement conditions. Their study results imply that source attractiveness serves not only as a peripheral cue under low-involvement conditions but also as a central cue under high-involvement conditions because the attractiveness is perceived as visual testimony to the product’s effectiveness (e.g., this shampoo will make your hair look like that of the endorser’s; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0047287511400609">Petty, Unnava, and Strathman 1991</xref>). Similar inconsistent results have been found in other studies, especially with hedonic or expressive products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0047287511400609">Miniard et al. 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0047287511400609">Oh and Jasper 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0047287511400609">Reinhard and Sporer 2008</xref>).</p>

<title>Multiple Roles of Pictorial Information</title>
<p>The dichotomous approach in ELM is less applicable for information-processing studies with hedonic/experiential products because of multiple functions of pictorial information. In travel and tourism contexts, positive affective responses evoked by pictorial information are part of product merits because of the hedonic nature of travel products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0047287511400609">Vogt and Fesenmaier 1998</xref>). Pictorial information, at the same time, plays a major role in persuasive messages as functional information (i.e., central cues). When products cannot be physically presented to the market because of intangibility, a picture is more effective than words in communicating attributes, concepts, and values as functional information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0047287511400609">Lurie and Mason 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0047287511400609">MacKay and Fesenmaier 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>The multiple-function mechanisms of pictorial information occur due to a variety of values incorporated in a single picture. A picture can evoke a diverse set of meanings about a product since it comprises a variety of rhetorical forms (e.g., rhyme, antithesis, metaphor) and different types of signs (e.g., iconic, indexical, symbolic; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0047287511400609">McQuarrie and Mick 1999</xref>). When a variety of information cues are available in a picture, an individual processes selective cues rather than processing all available cues, and the selection rules are contingent and contextual. In addition, his or her interpretation of the selected cues may vary by personal difference (e.g., previous knowledge, willingness to exert effort in processing). According to <italic>rhetoric theory</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0047287511400609">Scott 1994</xref>), although a picture is not relevant to a product, if individuals are highly involved in information judgments, they still attempt to interpret pictures as figurative statements. High-involved consumers perceive an advertised “facial tissue” as soft (i.e., as a product merit) because “a kitten” is displayed in the advertisement; and individuals believe taste of an advertised “soft drink” is exotic (i.e., as a product merit) because “a tropical beach” is displayed in the advertisement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0047287511400609">Mitchell and Olson 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0047287511400609">Scott 1994</xref>).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0047287511400609">Scott (1994)</xref> suggests individuals perform two different forms of visual processing by involvement: classical conditioning and information processes. <italic>Classical conditioning</italic> refers to the pictorial information processing in low-involvement situations. Pictorial information is often treated as visceral because visual components require less cognitive effort to process compared to verbal stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0047287511400609">Hirschman 1986</xref>). In this form, a picture is understood as a simple positive or negative value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0047287511400609">Scott 1994</xref>). <italic>Information processes</italic> refer to the pictorial information processing in high-involvement situations. Visual components are a convention-based symbolic system derived from complex combinations of learned pictorial schemata; therefore, visual information has potential for cognitive impact directly or by providing elaboration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0047287511400609">Scott 1994</xref>). In this form, a picture is capable of representing concepts, abstractions, actions, metaphors, and modifiers, such that it can be used in the invention of complex arguments.</p>
<p>In low-involvement situations, individuals focus mostly on pictorial information because it is easier and quicker to understand compared with textual information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0047287511400609">Chaiken and Maheswaran 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0047287511400609">Reinhard and Sporer 2008</xref>). Low-involved individuals, moreover, reduce their product evaluations when an advertisement contains an unattractive visual element and increase their evaluations when an advertisement contains an attractive picture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0047287511400609">Miniard et al. 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0047287511400609">Mitchell and Olson 1981</xref>). In high-involvement situations, pictorial information is coprocessed with textual information for comprehensive evaluation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0047287511400609">Adaval, Isbell, and Wyer 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0047287511400609">Miniard et al. 1991</xref>). In this case, pictorial and textual information are treated as equally capable of conveying crucial meanings and as equally worthy of cognitive processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0047287511400609">McQuarrie and Mick 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0047287511400609">Reinhard and Sporer 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Individuals use several rules to process pictorial and textual information in high-involvement situations. First, if textual information is unambiguous, high-involved individuals focus on textual information processing, which alone determines attitudes; however, if textual information is ambiguous, they assess both pictorial and textual information and the interactive processing influences attitudes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0047287511400609">Chaiken and Maheswaran 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0047287511400609">Reinhard and Sporer 2008</xref>). Second, if pictorial information is redundant to textual information, the pictorial information does not result in significantly different persuasive effects than textual information presented alone; however, if a picture conveys product information, which is not provided by verbal messages, the picture influences beliefs about the product’s attributes and overall product attitudes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0047287511400609">Miniard et al. 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0047287511400609">Mitchell and Olson 1981</xref>). Third, according to <italic>valence theory</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0047287511400609">Kisielius and Sternthal 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0047287511400609">Shen and Wyer 2008</xref>), when a picture provides unique information, the negatively valenced information (e.g., an unattractive picture) has a greater impact on judgment than the positively valenced information (e.g., an attractive picture). High-involved individuals expect to have positive information about a product that they consider purchasing. Because of the divergence from their expectations, unattractive pictorial information becomes more attention getting or more diagnostic, and eventually works against persuasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0047287511400609">Fiske 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0047287511400609">Skowronski and Carlston 1989</xref>).</p>

<title>Operationalization and Hypotheses</title>
<p>Effortful cues, effortless cues, and involvement were examined as explanatory and moderating variables in the information-processing dynamics. In this study, effortful and effortless cues were conceptualized based on the amount of effort spent in processing and ease of processing. This study specifies that effortful cues demand a greater amount of effort in processing than effortless cues, and effortless cues are easier and quicker to process than effortful cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0047287511400609">Chaiken and Maheswaran 1994</xref>). In terms of involvement, this study focuses on situational decision involvement. Travelers accept that constant decision changes are natural because situational changes continuously occur by goal interactions and environment changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0047287511400609">Jun, Vogt, and MacKay 2007</xref>). Involvement was therefore operationalized as purchase decision involvement.</p>
<p>The effortful cue was operationalized as text argument quality. Textual information processing is inherently effortful because it involves rule-based reasoning and deliberative analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0047287511400609">Lurie and Mason 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0047287511400609">Sloman 1996</xref>). Text argument quality is generally used for the operationalization of effortful cues in ELM studies. A few researchers, however, have criticized this operationalization because two constructs are embedded within the text argument quality: <italic>argument strength</italic> (i.e., strong or weak) and <italic>argument valence</italic> (i.e., favorable/positive or unfavorable/negative; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0047287511400609">Areni 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0047287511400609">Areni and Lutz 1988</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0047287511400609">Areni and Lutz (1988)</xref> found that many ELM studies manipulated argument valence while conceptualizing it as argument strength. Those authors argued that this mismanipulation stemmed from method-related issues such that researchers pretested several arguments in pilot experiments and labeled those that elicited consistently favorable cognitive responses as strong arguments, and those that evoked consistently unfavorable cognitive responses as weak arguments. Argument strength was presumed to be less effective than argument valence in pretests; therefore, researchers have continued to employ argument valence as the argument-quality manipulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0047287511400609">Areni 2002</xref>). This study manipulated argument strength and controlled argument valence because negatively framed messages are unrealistic in real advertising. In both strong and weak conditions, argument quality avoids negatively framed messages. The two conditions of argument quality are distinguished by whether verbal messages are more informative, believable, persuasive, and rational (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0047287511400609">Oh and Jasper 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>The effortless cue was operationalized as picture attractiveness, which is more quickly recognized and requires less effort in processing compared to text argument quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0047287511400609">Hirschman 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0047287511400609">MacKay and Fesenmaier 1997</xref>). This study assumes that effortless cues provide product merits in certain situations. Therefore, effortless processing occurs not only in low-involvement situations but also in high-involvement situations, and an interactive processing between effortful and effortless cues occurs in high-involvement situations. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0047287511400609">Miniard et al. (1991)</xref> manipulated picture attractiveness using unrelated product photos, and their manipulation confounded with product-relevance effects. To avoid these confounding effects, this study controlled for product relevance by using product-relevant pictures and focused on affective (i.e., valence) impacts.</p>

<title>Assumptions and Null Hypotheses</title>
<p>Under the low-involvement condition, it is assumed that individuals focus on picture attractiveness in information processing instead of text argument quality because their perceived relevance toward decision making is low. It is further assumed that low-involved individuals increase information processing only when an attractive picture is provided that elicits positive feelings. Thus, we formed two null hypotheses to test statistical significance. It is assumed that Null Hypotheses 1 and 2 should be <italic>rejected</italic> and there should be positive mean differences:</p>
<list id="list1-0047287511400609" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Null Hypothesis 1</italic>: There is no attitudinal (or intentional) difference between the no-picture and attractive-picture conditions under the strong-argument and low-involvement condition.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Null Hypothesis 2</italic>: There is no attitudinal (or intentional) difference between the no-picture and attractive-picture conditions under the weak-argument and low-involvement condition.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Low-involved individuals reduce information processing when an unattractive picture is provided because they do not have to invest time and effort in processing information that evokes unfavorable/negative feelings. Thus, it is assumed that there is no unattractive-picture effect; accordingly, Null Hypotheses 3 and 4 should be <italic>retained</italic>:</p>
<list id="list2-0047287511400609" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Null Hypothesis 3</italic>: There is no attitudinal (or intentional) difference between the no-picture and unattractive-picture conditions under the strong-argument and low-involvement condition.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Null Hypothesis 4</italic>: There is no attitudinal (or intentional) difference between the no-picture and unattractive-picture conditions under the weak-argument and low-involvement condition.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Under the high-involvement condition, it is assumed that individuals focus on both text argument quality and picture attractiveness to compensate for insufficient information from one or the other. High-involved individuals reduce information processing when pictorial information is redundant to textual information, but increase information processing when pictorial information provides essential information that is not provided by textual information. High-involved individuals perceive an attractive picture as redundant to strong arguments; therefore, an attractive picture has no significant effect under the strong-argument condition. Accordingly, Null Hypothesis 5 should be <italic>retained</italic>. An attractive picture, however, offsets negative effect from weak arguments. Therefore, Null Hypothesis 6 should be <italic>retained</italic> as well:</p>
<list id="list3-0047287511400609" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Null Hypothesis 5</italic>: There is no attitudinal (or intentional) difference between the no-picture and attractive-picture conditions under the strong-argument and high-involvement condition.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Null Hypothesis 6</italic>: There is no attitudinal (or intentional) difference between the no-picture and attractive-picture conditions under the weak-argument and high-involvement condition.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>High-involved individuals pay less attention to an unattractive picture when strong arguments are provided because the strong arguments offset negative effects from an unattractive picture. Thus, Null Hypothesis 7 should be <italic>retained</italic>. High-involved individuals, however, pay greater attention to an unattractive picture when the positively valenced but weak arguments are provided because the unattractive picture is essential functional information that guides them not to purchase that product. Thus, Null Hypothesis 8 should be <italic>rejected</italic> and there should be a negative mean difference:</p>
<list id="list4-0047287511400609" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Null Hypothesis 7</italic>: There is no attitudinal (or intentional) difference between the no-picture and unattractive-picture conditions under the strong-argument and high-involvement condition.</p></list-item>

<title>Design and Procedure</title>
<p>A full factorial 2 (involvement: high or low) × 2 (text argument quality: strong or weak) × 3 (picture attractiveness: no picture, attractive picture or unattractive picture) between-subjects experimental design was used. Twelve websites with different manipulation conditions, dependent measures, and manipulation-check measures were developed (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0047287511400609">Table 1</xref>). Students of two southern U.S. universities were randomly assigned into one of 12 groups and received an e-mail with one of 12 website links. A total of 317 undergraduate students completed the study for extra course credit.</p>

<p>Students who visited the website were asked to read a scenario and imagine that they were in the situation. This form of role-playing is widely used in consumer research. Participants were also informed that once they moved to the next page, they could not go back to the previous pages throughout the study. After reading the scenario, participants were asked to look at three advertisements provided on the following pages. One was the target advertisement and two were filler advertisements used to disguise the true purpose of the study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0047287511400609">Petty, Cacioppo, and Schumann 1983</xref>). A filler advertisement (T’s Restaurant) was first displayed, followed by the target advertisement (Adria House) and another filler advertisement (SanDisk Cruzer USB Flash Drives). The target advertisement was fictitious with a fictional product. While the target advertisement displayed different manipulation conditions, the two filler advertisements displayed the same content on all 12 websites.</p>
<p>The online study was open for one week after the e-mail invitation was delivered. The duration of each participation session was automatically recorded. If a participation session lasted longer than 30 minutes, that person’s results (<italic>n</italic> = 16) were not included in the final data set. Each participant’s IP address was automatically recorded and only the earlier response (<italic>n</italic> = 8) from the same IP addresses was used in the data analysis. After an additional exclusion (<italic>n</italic> = 9) of those who participated in pretests, 284 responses from 129 male (45%) and 155 female students (55%) were used for the data analysis. Cell sizes ranged from 20 to 26. The majority of participants (<italic>n</italic> = 270, 95%) reported that they had no visitation experience to Edinburgh.</p>

<sec id="section8-0047287511400609">
<title>Stimuli Development</title>
<p>The travel product used in this study was a Bed and Breakfast (B&amp;B). While hotels provide standardized services, B&amp;Bs are mostly managed by independent small businesses and provide nonstandardized services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0047287511400609">Egger and Buhalis 2008</xref>). The B&amp;B use excludes unexpected effects from study participants’ prior knowledge or familiarity with previously formed hotel brand images. The B&amp;B used for this study is located in a culturally similar country (e.g., Scotland) to exclude unnecessary confounding effects caused by concerns with safety/security issues, unfamiliar foods, and language barriers.</p>
<sec id="section9-0047287511400609">
<title>Involvement</title>
<p>Involvement was developed into two scenarios (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0047287511400609">Appendix A</xref>). In the high-involvement condition, participants were led to feel that their judgment about Adria House was significant. Thus, they paid more attention and put more effort into information processing for Adria House than other products. In the low-involvement condition, participants were led to feel that Adria House was not relevant to them. In addition, participants’ attention was distracted from Adria House as they were led to focus on T’s Restaurant.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0047287511400609">
<title>Text argument quality</title>
<p>Text argument quality was manipulated with two levels (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app2-0047287511400609">Appendix B</xref>). The strong argument was manipulated with factual information that stimulated thinking by using rational and logical judgments. For the weak-argument manipulation, the criteria used for the strong argument were not included and it was maintained to be positively framed because negatively framed advertisements were unrealistic.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0047287511400609">
<title>Picture attractiveness</title>
<p>The picture attractiveness manipulation was developed within three levels: no picture, an attractive picture, and an unattractive picture. Attractive and unattractive pictures focused on the manner of rendering in pictures based on criteria such as elegance and style for the attractive picture and inelegance and cheap for the unattractive picture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0047287511400609">Miniard et al. 1991</xref>). A pretest was conducted to select pictures for attractive and unattractive conditions. Seven pictures were copied from hotel and B&amp;B websites. Each picture was measured for picture attractiveness using the mean of three 7-point semantic differential scales. Fifty-two undergraduate students at a southern university participated in this pretest. A picture rated as most attractive (<italic>M</italic> = 6.50) was selected as the attractive picture. This picture illustrated a bed, a window, and a chair. Four pictures were rated below the mean score of 5.00. Among the four, two pictures illustrated two beds in a room and another picture illustrated a desk. Since depicting multiple beds and a desk in a room can be treated as the additional functional information, these three pictures were disregarded. The last picture depicting the same features (i.e., a bed, a window, and a chair) was selected as the unattractive picture (<italic>M</italic> = 4.53).</p>

<title>Measures</title>
<sec id="section13-0047287511400609">
<title>Dependent variables</title>
<p>Attitudes toward a product and purchase intention were measured as dependent variables for all three products in the same order of the advertisements. Attitudes were measured by the mean of three 9-point semantic differential scales (1 = <italic>negative meaning</italic> and 9 = <italic>positive meaning</italic>) anchored by the adjectives “unfavorable–favorable,” “dislike very much–like very much,” and “negative–positive.” For intention measures, participants were asked to indicate the probability that they would have dinner at T’s Restaurant if they visited Seattle, choose to stay at Adria House if they visited Edinburgh, and purchase the SanDisk Cruzer USB Flash Drive with 11-point scales anchored by 0% and 100%.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section14-0047287511400609">
<title>Manipulation checks</title>
<p>A 9-point semantic differential scale (1 = <italic>negative meaning</italic> and 9 = <italic>positive meaning</italic>) was used for all manipulation-check questions. To assess involvement manipulation effectiveness, eight items (nonessential–essential, unimportant–important, does not matter–matters to me, not needed–needed, of no concern–of concern, irrelevant–relevant, insignificant–significant, and valuable–worthless; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0047287511400609">Kinard and Capella 2006</xref>) were used for each advertisement. For the manipulation check on text argument quality, four items (not believable–believable, uninformative–informative, unpersuasive–persuasive, and weak rationale–strong rationale; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0047287511400609">Oh and Jasper 2006</xref>) were used for each advertisement. For the manipulation check on picture attractiveness, six items were used for each advertisement. The six items were constructed into two frames: affective measure with three items (unattractive–attractive, ugly–beautiful, and very unlikeable–very likeable) and cognitive measure with three items (not functional–functional, impractical–practical, and useless–useful; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0047287511400609">Oh and Jasper 2006</xref>). An additional question was asked to check informativeness of the picture in decision making. Finally, participants were asked to respond as to their perception of which type of information was easier to process between texts and pictures.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Although manipulation effects were assessed after the measure of dependent variables in order to eliminate threats to internal validity (i.e., testing confound), data on manipulation checks were first analyzed through one-way ANOVA statistics to ensure that manipulations worked as intended. After manipulation checks, hypothesis testing was conducted with two dependent variables, attitudes toward Adria House and purchase intention for Adria House, using three-way ANOVA statistics. After statistical analysis of the primary study, a posttest was additionally conducted to assess if unexpected confounding effects were embedded in the manipulations of text argument quality and picture attractiveness.</p>

<title>Posttest</title>
<p>A posttest was conducted for several reasons. First, picture attractiveness was defined based on criteria such as elegance and style, but these concepts were not directly measured. In this posttest, the attractiveness measure included additional items, “inelegant–elegant,” “unfashionable–fashionable,” and “scruffy–stylish.” Second, product-related functional information was controlled and affective responses were differentiated for picture attractiveness. Although all results were statistically significant in the manipulation check, the mean score difference was 0.86 on cognitive responses and 0.57 on informativeness, while it was 2.40 on affective responses. This indicated that a reexamination was necessary. Third, argument strength was manipulated and argument valence was controlled for text argument quality; however, argument strength was only assessed in the manipulation check. It was necessary to check whether argument valence was embedded in the text argument quality. Fourth, a concern appeared in the text argument quality manipulation that weak arguments might provide stronger hedonic values than strong arguments. To make sure that hedonic values did not confound the argument-strength effects, hedonic values were measured in both strong- and weak-argument conditions. Finally, the same measures were used in assessment of both text argument quality and picture attractiveness to verify that these two factors were independent of each other.</p>
<p>A total of 142 undergraduate students at a southern university participated in this posttest. The six items of the modified attractiveness scale were determined as a single factor based on factor analysis (i.e., eigenvalue &gt;1 criterion and scree test; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0047287511400609">Green and Salkind 2003</xref>), and the scale was reliable (α<sub>text argument quality</sub> = .88 and α<sub>picture attractiveness</sub> = .97). In terms of text argument quality, there was no significant mean difference between weak-argument and strong-argument conditions on attractiveness (<italic>M</italic><sub>weak arg</sub>
<sub>u</sub>
<sub>ment</sub> = 5.80 and <italic>M</italic><sub>strong argument</sub> = 5.87), <italic>F</italic>(1, 69) = 0.05, <italic>p</italic> = .822, and on hedonic values (<italic>M</italic><sub>weak argument</sub> = 5.55 and <italic>M</italic><sub>strong argument</sub> = 5.34), <italic>F</italic>(1, 69) = 0.28, <italic>p</italic> = .601; however, there was a significant difference on functional values (<italic>M</italic><sub>weak argument</sub> = 5.19 and <italic>M</italic><sub>strong argument</sub> = 6.88), <italic>F</italic>(1, 69) = 20.23, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001. As expected, results on picture attractiveness were opposite from the results of text argument quality. There was a significant mean difference between unattractive-picture and attractive-picture conditions on attractiveness (<italic>M</italic><sub>unattractive picture</sub> = 4.75 and <italic>M</italic><sub>attractive picture</sub> = 7.57), <italic>F</italic>(1, 69) = 79.76, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, and on hedonic values (<italic>M</italic><sub>unattractive picture</sub> = 3.87 and <italic>M</italic><sub>attractive picture</sub> = 6.68), <italic>F</italic>(1, 69) = 69.10, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001; however, there was no significant difference on functional values (<italic>M</italic><sub>unattractive picture</sub> = 6.30 and <italic>M</italic><sub>attractive picture</sub> = 6.84), <italic>F</italic>(1, 69) = 3.27, <italic>p</italic> = .075, and on informativeness (<italic>M</italic><sub>unattractive picture</sub> = 6.25 and <italic>M</italic><sub>attractive picture</sub> = 6.37), <italic>F</italic>(1, 69) = 0.06, <italic>p</italic> = .804. These results give us increased confidence that text argument quality and picture attractiveness were manipulated independently; the text argument quality manipulation controlled argument valence and hedonic values; and the picture attractiveness manipulation controlled informativeness and functional values in a logical manner.</p>

<title>Conclusion and Implications</title>
<p>Information-processing strategies that individuals use for information judgment and decision making were investigated through examination on how individuals used certain information attributes (i.e., text argument quality, picture attractiveness) in different involvement situations. Consistent with previous research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0047287511400609">Mitchell 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0047287511400609">Mitchell and Olson 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0047287511400609">Petty and Wegener 1999</xref>), our study results indicate that picture attractiveness in low-involvement situations is used as a simple cue to decide whether to further execute information processing or not. Low-involved individuals increased information processing only when an attractive picture and strong arguments were provided, and they did not increase information processing when an unattractive picture was provided regardless text argument quality.</p>
<p>This study revealed several rules that high-involved individuals use in information processing. First, high-involved individuals consider all available information to compensate for insufficient information from one or the other. The study results indicate that an attractive picture offsets negative impacts of weak arguments, and strong arguments offset negative impacts of an unattractive picture. These offsetting roles support previous research that textual and pictorial information is treated as equally capable of conveying crucial meanings in high-involvement situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0047287511400609">Adaval, Isbell, and Wyer 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0047287511400609">McQuarrie and Mick 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0047287511400609">Miniard et al. 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0047287511400609">Petty and Cacioppo 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0047287511400609">Reinhard and Sporer 2008</xref>). Second, high-involved individuals reduce pictorial information processing when an attractive picture and strong arguments are provided. This result is consistent with Miniard et al.’s (1991) work that pictorial information redundant to verbal information does not result in significantly different persuasive effects than verbal information presented alone. Third, high-involved individuals pay greater attention to an unattractive picture when weak arguments are provided. This result supports valence theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0047287511400609">Kisielius and Sternthal 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0047287511400609">Shen and Wyer 2008</xref>) and previous research that high-involved individuals increase pictorial information processing when a picture provides essential information that is not provided by textual information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0047287511400609">Miniard et al. 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0047287511400609">Mitchell and Olson 1981</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section24-0047287511400609">
<title>Theoretical Implications</title>
<p>The study findings indicate that individuals do not always conduct thorough information searches of every option. To maintain efficiency and effectiveness in information processing, they use different rules based on situations in which their decision has significant consequences or not. This study confirms that individuals use information processing strategies and thus it supports CCCP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0047287511400609">Bettman, Johnson, and Payne 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0047287511400609">Bettman, Luce, and Payne 1998</xref>). The study results also indicate that pictorial information processing occurs in both high- and low-involvement situations and individuals have different mechanisms for the pictorial information processing by involvement. These findings support the multiple roles of pictorial information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0047287511400609">Lurie and Mason 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0047287511400609">McQuarrie and Mick 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0047287511400609">Miniard et al. 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0047287511400609">Mitchell and Olson 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0047287511400609">Reinhard and Sporer 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0047287511400609">Scott 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>This study confirms that low-involved individuals were more likely to focus on an attractive picture, and high-involved individuals were more likely to focus on an unattractive picture. A plausible explanation for these results is found from <italic>extremeness aversion</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0047287511400609">Simonson and Tversky 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0047287511400609">Tversky and Kahneman 1991</xref>), noting that losses (i.e., disadvantages) are weighted more heavily than gains (i.e., advantages) when consumers feel that their decisions have significant consequences. In information processing, low-involved individuals often do not commit to purchase decisions, and their information processing is more hedonic oriented such as for fun (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0047287511400609">Vogt and Fesenmaier 1998</xref>). Since their information judgments are “risk-less,” they pay more attention to attractive pictures that provide them “eye candy” and enjoyment. In addition, they do not have to invest time and effort to process unattractive pictures that evoke unfavorable or negative feelings. However, high-involved individuals pay more attention to unattractive pictures since their decision making is related to “risky choices.” For example, if they do not pay attention to negative product information, the probability of making a poor choice and consequently having less satisfactory product experience increases.</p>

<title>Marketing Implications</title>
<p>The findings of this study suggest what types of information and/or which information attributes marketers should provide in advertisements based on their advertising objectives. If the advertising objective is to persuade consumers to develop positive images toward the product, marketers need to focus on providing attractive pictures that evoke positive affects. If the advertising objective is to lead consumers in target markets to purchase the product, marketers need to focus on text argument quality and avoid providing pictures that evoke negative affect. The study results illustrated that unattractive pictures gain attention in cognitive and substantive information processing. Distribution of different versions of advertisements for each target group is becoming easier because of new technological developments. This suggestion can easily be applied to Internet marketing. For example, on the first page of a website, marketing professionals may ask customers the purpose of their website visit. Based on the response, different website versions, which emphasize picture attractiveness or text argument quality, can be provided. Cruise line corporations have used this strategy to provide customized information to targeted customers (e.g., Royal Caribbean International).</p>
<p>The study results further suggest that pictures in advertisements should provide distinct additional information beyond text information for consumers who are highly involved in the evaluation process. The decision on whether to include text messages and/or pictures has not been a critical issue to consider in website and brochure advertising since these types of advertising have space flexibility. Advertisers value another role of pictures, capturing consumer attention; subsequently, they are likely to include both verbal messages and pictures in advertisements as much as available space allows. However, advertising through portable mobile devices requires consideration of space efficiency in displaying information. In mobile marketing, it is important to be minimalistic in providing only indispensable information, not only because of the small screen sizes of portable devices but also because of the cost of mobile connections to download. It is becoming increasingly important for mobile marketing professionals to understand how and when consumers devote attention to certain types of stimuli in advertisements and what determines their attentional strategies and patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0047287511400609">Rosbergen, Pieters, and Wedel 1997</xref>). Our study results suggest that if pictorial information is redundant to textual information, or if pictures contain negative information differing from text information, it would be better not to provide pictures to those who are in purchase-decision processes.</p>

<title>Limitations and Future Studies</title>
<p>An unintended instrumentation effect was suspected in this study related to the length of text argument statements. For classification of effortful and effortless modes, this study focused on the amount of effort spent in processing and the ease of processing. In this study, it was specified that effortful cues demanded a greater amount of effort in processing than effortless cues; and effortless cues were easier and quicker to process than effortful cues. The manipulation check results indicated that the effortful cues in this study were more difficult to process compared to effortless cues. However, the short sentences described with bullet points in manipulation elicited quicker and easier processing even for the low-involved participants. Future studies should use longer sentences that require more effort in processing.</p>
<p>Study participant demographics are not representative of the general population. This study, however, did not attempt to measure effects based on personal differences (e.g., socioeconomic segments) but rather to measure information attribute effects on judgment and decision making. A homogenous sample such as undergraduate students is more suitable in experimental research because it excludes potential confounding effects caused by wide-ranging personal differences (e.g., age, education; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0047287511400609">Sternthal, Tybout, and Calder 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0047287511400609">Walters, Sparks, and Herington 2007</xref>). Replication adjusts for this limitation. This study’s results are consistent with diverse sample groups from previously published studies. This implies that the theoretical framework is supported by similar results with diverse population groups.</p>
<p>This study started from the question why ELM had hardly been tested with hedonic/experiential products. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0047287511400609">Petty and Cacioppo (1980)</xref> once tested ELM with a beauty product, and their study results did not support their assumptions because the manipulated peripheral-cue was perceived as a central cue by high-involved participants. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0047287511400609">Oh and Jasper (2006)</xref> also found that high-involved participants devoted more efforts to process a peripheral cue for expressive products. We conjectured that if researchers constantly found statistically insignificant results with hedonic/experiential products while pretesting ELM, these products would be overlooked for primary studies. Our study attempted to show that the insignificant results with hedonic/experiential products were due to the multiple roles of pictorial information, which exert offsetting or redundancy effects in high-involvement situations. For this reason, our Null Hypotheses 3 to 7 were expected to be retained. In a rigorous manner, the retained null hypotheses did not mean that those null hypotheses must be accepted. However, the probabilities of occurring results similar to ours if the null hypotheses were true were fairly high (e.g., Null Hypothesis 4 = 100%, Null Hypothesis 5 = 94%, Null Hypothesis 6 = 74%, and Null Hypothesis 7 = 90% in cases of the intention measure; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0047287511400609">Table 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0047287511400609">Agresti and Finlay 1997</xref>). Future study should further focus on examining the offsetting or redundancy effects. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0047287511400609">Smith and Vogt (1995)</xref> found similar effects to the offsetting/redundancy effects, <italic>mitigating effects</italic> between advertising and negative word-of-mouth communication. Their study will be helpful in developing increasingly sophisticated experimental designs to measure the direct offsetting/redundancy effects.</p>
<p>Understanding information-processing strategies that travelers use in judgment and decision making is of importance not only for academic researchers but also for tourism marketers. However, examining an individual’s mental processes is not very feasible with correlational research methods. This study investigated the information-processing strategies through an experimental research method. The method and results used in this study should inspire academic and applied researchers to adopt new ways of conceptualizing information-processing behaviors and to use experimental research methods to expand our understanding of travelers’ decision making.</p>
