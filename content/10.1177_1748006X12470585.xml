<p>This special issue collects a set of extended versions of articles presented at the European Safety and Reliability Conference – ESREL 2011, held in Troyes, France, 18–22 September 2011.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1748006X12470585">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>ESREL is a series of annual conferences promoted by the European Safety and Reliability Association (ESRA – <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.esrahomepage.org">www.esrahomepage.org</ext-link>), which dates back to 1989 (in La Baule, France), but was not referred to as an ESREL conference before 1992 (in Lyngby, Denmark). The conference has become well established in the international community, attracting a good mix of academic and industry participants that present and discuss subjects of interest and application across various industries in the fields of safety, reliability and risk.</p>
<p>The theme of the ESREL 2011 Conference was ‘Advances in Safety, Reliability and Risk Management’. The conference technical sessions covered a number of topics within safety, reliability and risk, and provided a forum for presentation and discussion of scientific articles covering theory, methods and applications to a wide range of industrial, societal and governmental sectors and problem areas. The technical programme included 393 articles from authors coming from all over the world, selected from 543 submitted abstracts and reviewed by the ESREL 2011 Technical Programme Committee. The major thematic areas (in number of presented articles) were ‘Maintenance Modelling and Applications’, ‘Fault Diagnosis, Prognosis and System Health Management’, ‘System Reliability Analysis’, ‘Mathematical Methods in Reliability and Safety’, ‘Human Factors and Human Reliability’, ‘Risk Analysis, Assessment and Management’ but there were also animated focused special sessions and panels on, for example, ‘Dynamic Reliability’ or ‘Fault Tolerant Control and Systems’.</p>
<p>A total of 21 articles were selected within the conference final programme and invited as potential candidates for extension and submission to the journal; after the submission and full review process, eight articles were accepted for publication in this special issue. Even if these eight articles cannot give an exhaustive picture of the works presented at ESREL 2011, we hope that they give a good insight into some recent advances in important topics in safety, reliability and risk.</p>
<p>The first four articles propose original contributions in the broad field of maintenance modelling.</p>
<p>The article by Baraldi et al. deals with monitoring approaches that enable to take into account the dynamic behaviour of signals during operational transients and improve detection of defects during plant transients, such as start-up and shut-down. Two approaches are proposed, respectively, based on the development of several reconstruction models, each one dedicated to a specific operational zone, and on the preprocessing of the signals by means of Haar wavelet transforms. The condition monitoring of a gas turbine during start-up transients is considered as an industrial case study. Performances of the proposed approach are assessed by using an ‘accuracy’ and a ‘robustness’ measure.</p>
<p>The article by Hameed et al. considers the maintenance of offshore wind turbines to cover problems of sharing and exploiting the set-up cost with grouping of different activities at the wind farm level. The aim is to develop an optimal and cost effective decision support tool. A hybrid approach using the age- and condition-based models is adopted and the minimization of an average cost of maintenance over a period of time is proposed. The proposed approach takes into account the impact of new and unforeseen information during planning and implantation phases, such as weather, access, logistics and transportation on developing an optimal combination of grouped activities.</p>
<p>The condition-based maintenance (CBM) modelling framework proposed in the article by Huynh et al. deals with repairable systems whose degradation can be monitored with the help of environmental and diagnostic covariates. A randomized Paris–Erdogan crack growth model is considered with a stressful environment modelled according to a Markov chain with a discrete and finite state space. The environmental condition is observed perfectly, while the crack depth can only be assessed imperfectly through a non-destructive monitoring technique. Two adaptive CBM strategies respectively with a time-based and a condition-based adaptation scheme are developed and compared. The assessment of the maintenance policies uses Monte Carlo simulation and a particle filtering technique for state estimation.</p>
<p>The article by Grall-Maës deals with the use of the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test for comparison of an observed gamma process with a reference process or with another observed gamma process. The cases of periodic and aperiodic inspections are considered. The power of test is assessed in relation to the length of monitoring and to the number of observations. An illustrative example showing the interest of such a test from a dynamic maintenance decision rule point of view is considered.</p>
<p>The four following articles propose diversified contributions in the fields of system reliability analysis, uncertainty and risk management and organizational resilience.</p>
<p>The article by Matuzas and Contini addresses the problem of the variables selection for the fault-tree decomposition method, which was previously proposed by the authors as an alternative approach when methods based on binary decision diagram and/or minimal cut set fail to analyse too complex fault trees regarding the available computational resources. This approach consists in the recursive functional decomposition of the fault tree into a set of mutually exclusive simpler fault trees with respect to a small subset of the basic events set that make its efficiency highly dependent on this subset. The comparison of four selection algorithms carried out in several fault trees leads the authors to conclude that the construction of the subset as a minimal path set is generally the most efficient one.</p>
<p>The article by Jin et al. discusses the assessment of epistemic uncertainties in the reliability analysis for a safety-instrumented system (SIS) operating in low-demand mode. The three classical categories of epistemic uncertainty that are completeness uncertainty, model uncertainty and parameter uncertainty are discussed in the particular context of the SIS reliability analysis process. The authors highlight the importance to integrate uncertainty assessment with SIS reliability analyses, especially regarding the unknown completeness that is most prevalent for new or partly known technology, in order to provide appropriate tools for the decision making about SIS design and the risk management of systems including SISs.</p>
<p>The article by Flage et al. proposes an importance measure to evaluate the effect of input parameters imprecision in probability assignments. The uncertain parameters are modelled by a pair of distribution functions, for example the belief and possibility functions and the measure of imprecision relies on the area of the gap between these two distributions. The examined reductions of input imprecision are the total removal of imprecision and the reduction to a single distribution function that is proposed to be obtained by a possibility–probability transformation procedure.</p>
<p>The article by Trijp and Gelder investigates the possibility to define and to quantify a measure of resilience of a Dutch emergency organization when faced with stress. The results of a large scale survey conducted by the author among safety stakeholders in The Netherlands show that the resilience of an emergency organization can be described by a unique dynamic operational resilience factor.</p>
<p>Finally, we would like to thank all those who have contributed to the ESREL 2011 conference and to this special issue, namely the authors, the reviewers and the Managing Editor team of the Journal.</p>
