<abstract>
<p>This article makes the controversial argument that Bourdieu’s theory of practice offers both a model of transformation and social reproduction. However, it also claims that his account of cultural production is marred by two blind-spots. First, it contends that Bourdieu has neglected key forms of material support, notably, that offered, post-war, from the ‘left hand of the state’. The subsequent New Wave of 1950s and 1960s British drama had authors who possessed neither economic capital nor certified cultural capital. Secondly, it interrogates Bourdieu’s conclusion that popular culture can never be source of canonized art. Adopting the view that Bourdieu focused too exclusively on legitimate culture, it seeks to contrast his theories on this point with the approach developed by Raymond Williams. The last section sketches a Bourdieusian analysis of Bourdieu. It reads his writings in the light of the different origins of the British and French fields of cultural studies.</p>

<body>
<p>There is a generalized agreement in Anglo-American social theory that Bourdieu’s theory of practice is based on a concept of perpetual reproduction. In this paper, I shall draw attention to another – less well-known – Bourdieu, author of a theory of recurrent crisis and transformation. Such crisis-inspired transformations are linked in his thought to various kinds of critical prophecy (‘heterodoxy’), of both religious and secular varieties.</p>
<p>These issues can be considered under another prism: that of the theory of social criticism springing from the cultural avant-garde. Such artistic movements establish a sphere of cultural autonomy, from which they may fuel the bitter conflicts within market-based societies. However, Bourdieu’s major work on the historical trajectories of the avant-gardes, <italic>The Rules of Art</italic>, contains its own ‘disenchantment of the world’, by no means always warranted. Here Bourdieu approaches artists’ recognition or ‘consecration’ as setting in motion a political reorientation, bringing their later cultural production closer to that fraction of the bourgeoisie with high cultural and economic capital. Such a shift, he argues, is invariably marked by a waning of artists’ radicalism and by a decline in active interventions.</p>
<p>This theory has been challenged by 20th-century pan-European evidence drawn from Surrealism and Dadaism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0263276412441034">Asholt, 2004</xref>). Further, detailed analysis of the French resistance to Nazism shows that both generations of the surrealist avant-garde, including the more consecrated writers, exhibited exemplary political action at great risk to themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0263276412441034">Sapiro, 1999</xref>). At the very least, we can set against Bourdieu’s bleak, all-embracing logic the persistence in some movements of a countervailing current based on enduring opposition. This may be linked particularly to oppositional currents produced by moments of national political crisis: in France, these have often derived from the defence of Dreyfus.</p>
<p>Further, Bourdieu has over-estimated the barriers to acquiring the skills for modern cultural production, insisting on advanced levels of schooling and higher education as the royal road to the democratization of culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0263276412441034">Bourdieu and Passeron, 1990 [1970]</xref>: 53, 76). Consistent with this view, he has failed to acknowledge the existence of any consecrated cultural production from those with social origins outside the dominant class, in particular, any popular art (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0263276412441034">Bourdieu and Passeron, 1990 [1970]</xref>: 138). Even more strikingly, he has neglected the ways in which the public sector – the ‘left hand of the state’ – has subsidized experimental cultural forms. Here, we might cite a British example: the support of television drama by Trevor Griffiths and Dennis Potter, both highly-educated playwrights from working-class backgrounds.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0263276412441034">1</xref></sup> Such material opportunities have had the unanticipated effect of widening both the class origins and gender of authors.</p>
<p>I shall advance the view that Bourdieu’s distinctive position-taking in this area – and especially his resistance to popular art – has been profoundly influenced by the characteristics of the French field in which cultural works are studied. This national field has lacked a key element associated with British cultural studies, notably the absence of early contacts with a popular educational tradition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0263276412441034">Richman, 1995</xref>). I shall argue that, despite Bourdieu’s own peasant origins and his Algerian ethnographic studies, he lacks a full understanding of <italic>urban</italic> plebeian cultures. Bourdieu ought to be defended from those who argue that he has failed to advance a theory of change or radical transformation, but there are still major omissions in his account of cultural producers.</p>
<sec id="sec1-0263276412441034"><title>Radical Criticism of Bourdieu’s Theory of Practice</title>
<p>Bourdieu’s wider theory of practice has come under consolidated attack (see, inter alia, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0263276412441034">Alexander, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0263276412441034">Archer, 2007</xref>). In particular, his account of reflexivity has been held to be too narrow. But this criticism makes it appear as though all Bourdieusian actors possess only the fuzzy logic of the Kabylean peasantry or the pre-reflexive doxa of the traditional working class (1977 [1972]: ch. 3; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0263276412441034">1984 [1979]</xref>: 41–7, 180–94). Archer, in particular, creates a straw man from Bourdieu’s agent, one who is <italic>only capable of reflexivity</italic> through the craft of sociology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0263276412441034">Archer, 2007</xref>: 41–8).</p>
<p>Archer fails to note that even Bourdieu’s earliest writings distinguish a category of peasants whose forced regroupments amongst the millions of the Algerian War incited them not just to despair but to ‘reflexivity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0263276412441034">Bourdieu and Sayad, 1964</xref>: 123, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0263276412441034">Wacquant, 2004</xref>: 392–4). Much later, Bourdieu writes of the social conditions of modernism which tend to heighten the ‘reflexivity’ of certain novelists: those who learn the art of ‘social flying’ above closed social circles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0263276412441034">1993: 118–19</xref>). Moreover, in the contemporary natural sciences, even as Bourdieu identifies the importance of <italic>tacit, bodily-based knowledge</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0263276412441034">2004 [2001]</xref>: 38–41), he also emphasizes the necessity for reflexivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0263276412441034">2004 [2001]</xref>: 19) or ‘epistemological prudence’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0263276412441034">2004 [2001]</xref>: 91). Going beyond the ‘epistemological vigilance’ of his earlier work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0263276412441034">Bourdieu et al., 1991 [1968]</xref>: 74–7), he later notes the existence of a ‘reformist reflexivity’ whereby the scientific fact is constructed, tested and <italic>recognized by scientific peers </italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0263276412441034">Bourdieu, 2004 [2001]</xref>: 91–4). A ‘split’ or ‘cleft’ habitus – specifically that created by a transfer from one discipline to another – heightens such reflexivity, predisposing the scientist to symbolic revolutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0263276412441034">2004 [2001]</xref>: 111).</p>
<p>Moreover, unlike leading functionalists, Bourdieu’s sociology can theorize transformations – great and small – including those dependent on the genesis of new fields (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0263276412441034">Bourdieu, 1989</xref>: 104; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-0263276412441034">Wacquant, 2004</xref>: 389–90). <italic>Pace</italic> critics such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0263276412441034">Callinicos (2006)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0263276412441034">Rancière (2004 [1983])</xref>, Bourdieu has developed and elaborated a theory of crisis and revolution, within a tradition that owes much to Marx, Mauss and Merleau-Ponty. Take first the contested notion of ‘the uprooted’. Bourdieu and Sayad emphasize two aspects of the effect of the Algerian War. A profound ‘traditionalism of despair’ coexisted with the emergence of a new reflexivity, producing a discrepancy amongst certain better-off peasants between their values and their concrete new practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0263276412441034">Bourdieu and Sayad, 1964</xref>: 19, 115; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0263276412441034">Bourdieu et al., 1963</xref>: 317–20; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0263276412441034">Bourdieu, 2002</xref> [1995]: 30–3, 39, 45–6). As Silverstein notes, Bourdieu was here seizing the denigrated category of the ‘uprooted’ and rescuing them from the contempt of the early 20th-century Right (Barrès, Maurras, et al.) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0263276412441034">Bourdieu, 2008</xref>: 153–260; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0263276412441034">Silverstein, 2009</xref>: 166–7). This is true. However, there is a danger of missing something else: that the concept of ‘the uprooted’ is also a vital motif in Bourdieu’s wider theory of revolution. It provides him with an updated analysis of the role of charismatic leadership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0263276412441034">Bourdieu and Passeron, 1990 [1970]</xref>: 25–6).</p>
<p>Indeed, Bourdieu’s brilliant weaving together of Marx, Durkheim and Weber in his reflections on religion contributes to an outstanding move beyond the theory of charismatic movements and change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0263276412441034">1991 [1971</xref>]). Bourdieu takes up Marx’s assessment of the failure of revolution in France, especially <italic>18th Brumaire</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0263276412441034">1991 [1971]</xref>: 37). In that essay, Marx argues that the failure of the 1848 Revolution was not because the people had become prosperous and happy. Rather, when – once again – revolution had become the only alternative, they could find only the tired slogans of the 1789 Great Revolution. In other words, in 1848 they were offered a critique of the present and a vision of the future that was woefully inapposite. The <italic>18th Brumaire</italic> makes it crystal clear that the heterodox ideas already circulating need to be taken up <italic>and recoded in fresh linguistic terms</italic>, so that the masses could articulate their discontent and engender a renewed sense of their just entitlements.</p>
<p>For Bourdieu, such critical ideas have historically been derived from prophets or prophet-like leaders, some initially well-placed within the social hierarchy, such as defrocked priests, some uprooted and socially mobile. These ascetic figures – who turned against the established priesthood for its complicity with the rich – are viewed at first as mad and suffer rejection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0263276412441034">1991 [1971</xref>]: 25, 27, 28; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0263276412441034">2002 [1995]</xref>: 322). But the outbreak of a wholesale crisis, provoked by war, famine or depression, makes the condition of the subordinate classes even more precarious. The masses now become receptive to the heretical or heterodox ideas of prophetic figures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0263276412441034">1991 [1971]</xref>: 34, 37–8). The working class starts to feel itself full of potential – or, in Bourdieu’s striking phrase, a ‘mystical body’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0263276412441034">1985 [1984]</xref>: 742). The uprooted prophets or ‘proletaroid intelligentsia’ no longer seem outlandish but become their spokespersons: indeed, their leadership extends far beyond spiritual critiques, into the heart of the political sphere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0263276412441034">1985 [1984]</xref>: 740).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0263276412441034">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>It is often from amongst the uprooted that such new ideas are forged, especially those with a specific ‘habitus clivé’: highly-educated, but devoid of good positions. In particular, unrecognized, precariously-placed writers and artists ally themselves with the dominated class, using their cultural capital for the interests of the propertyless (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0263276412441034">1996b [1988]</xref>: 387). Here art can still become a weapon for the oppressed:<disp-quote>
<p>It thus may happen that the interests associated with the dominated positions in the field of cultural production lead to subversive alliances, capable of threatening the social order. This occurs when, in the cognitive struggle over the social world, the professional producers of the principles of vision and division, globally located in the dominated position of the field of power […] engage their cultural capital in struggles that they more or less completely […] associate with their own struggles in the field of power. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0263276412441034">1996b [1988]</xref>: 387)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0263276412441034">Bourdieu’s last great theoretical statement, Pascalian Meditations (2000)</xref>, posits the importance of ‘a sense of place’ in which a lower-class habitus leads to <italic>an acceptance of reduced chances</italic>. But even in this work, he brings once again into play defrocked priests, unconsecrated artists and ‘proletaroid intellectuals’ (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0263276412441034">2002 [1995]</xref>: 323–4). Such figures produce a transfer of cultural capital that enhances the dominateds’ ‘collective mobilization and [their] subversive action against the established order’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0263276412441034">2000</xref>: 188).</p>
<p>In the sections that follow, I explore further the Bourdieusian analysis of aesthetics (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0263276412441034">Rancière, 2004 [1983]</xref>). It will be argued that Bourdieu’s conceptual distinctions and critique can be deployed beyond the parameters of France in the 1960s and ’70s, if we remember the specific political problematic that Bourdieu was then addressing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0263276412441034">Bourdieu, 1989</xref>: 102; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0263276412441034">Robbins, 2011</xref>: 141–71). In doing so, care must be taken not to abandon Bourdieu’s key differentiations, for example, between early and advanced capitalism and between nation-states historically linked to ‘Kultur' and those linked to ‘Civilisation'.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0263276412441034">3</xref></sup></p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec2-0263276412441034"><title>Bourdieu on Kant’s Judgement of Taste: Popular Art</title>
<p>One of Bourdieu’s most long-standing critics is Jacques Rancière, whose memorable first work distilled the autobiographies of mid-19th-century craftsmen and women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0263276412441034">1989</xref>). As his study shows, the protracted labour of these artisans never destroyed their overwhelming desire to understand their cultural heritage – indeed, to become poets themselves – and to help usher in a new social world. Consequently, Rancière attacks the method of Bourdieu’s <italic>Distinction</italic> for being unnecessarily positivist. This work, in its reliance on questionnaires, deploys a technique unsuited to catching any ‘moments of identification’ that uneducated people might experience with consecrated cultural works, such as Beethoven’s <italic>Ninth</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0263276412441034">2004</xref>: 187–90).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0263276412441034">4</xref></sup> Rancière proposes an ethnomethodological counter-experiment in which Beethoven is played on a piano to peasants on a Peruvian mountain; he places a bet that the music could not fail to attract them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0263276412441034">2004</xref>: 185, 187).</p>
<p>Rancière shares Bourdieu’s critique of the scholastic attitude, ridiculing those who mistake the laws of logic for the wider laws of the social world. But he proceeds to turn this analysis of an intellectualist bias <italic>onto Bourdieu himself. </italic>Poor Bourdieu is held to epitomize a neo-Platonic ‘sociologist King’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0263276412441034">2004</xref>: 165) who, blinkered by his very success within the educational institution, mistakenly assumes that a formal scholarly education is the only prerequisite for understanding society. What is more, the Collège de France meritocrat allegedly <italic>denigrates</italic> figures such as the self-educating shoemakers, compelling them to ‘stick to their last’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0263276412441034">Rancière, 2004</xref>: 200, 202). In brief, disregarding Bourdieu’s own avowal, Rancière sees him less as a realist than a fatalist: indeed, a paradoxical Left elitist.</p>
<p>Now, only certain elements of this argument can be accepted. Rather than attribute class disdain to Bourdieu, I want to focus further on the tragic barriers to self-education placed by modernist developments. Rancière’s swingeing attack on Bourdieu is at first sight curious, especially given Bourdieu’s own acknowledgement of an autodidactic tradition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0263276412441034">1984</xref>: 24–5; 84; 328–9). Indeed, <italic>Distinction</italic> is cited approvingly by Jonathan Rose in his impressive historical work about autodidacts, <italic>The Intellectual Life of the British Working Classes</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0263276412441034">2002</xref>). Crucially, Rancière might have noticed that both Bourdieu and Rose see the decline in the autodidactic tradition as due to the unanticipated consequences of modernism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0263276412441034">Bourdieu, 1996a [1992]</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0263276412441034">Rose, 2002</xref>: 141).</p>
<p>Rose cites Bourdieu’s argument that autodidacts are stigmatized for being unsystematic. Sympathetic to this, Rose contends, plausibly, that autodidacts impose their own, Goffmanesque, ‘frame’ on the books they read (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0263276412441034">2002</xref>: 6–7). This may not be the frame that critics within the literary field give a book: the work’s ideology can be actively decoded to produce variant readings. Yet not everything that autodidacts read in their ‘promiscuous mix of high and low’ is grist to such revalorizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0263276412441034">2002</xref>: 371). Rose notes from his study of autobiographies: ‘Only canonical literature could produce epiphanies in common readers, and, specifically, only great books could inspire them to write’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0263276412441034">2002</xref>: 371). Yet while they might stretch to reading Proust, modernist literature in general put up great barriers to autodidacts’ reading and writing, much as Bourdieu’s theory leads us to expect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0263276412441034">1996a [1992]</xref>: 58–9, 93–7): ‘The difficulty was that leftist intellectuals were looking for a modernist in [workers’] overalls and that combination was impossible to find’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0263276412441034">Rose, 2002</xref>: 141). Rose’s historical study fits well with Bourdieu’s emphasis on the hidden educational preconditions veiled by the more facile universalistic aesthetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0263276412441034">1989</xref>: 110). Certain forms of modernist cultural production puzzle the uneducated, i.e. those readers lacking the literary means to understand them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0263276412441034">2000</xref>: 87–8, 90, 100).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-0263276412441034"><title>The Postwar Field of Cultural Production</title>
<p>Bourdieu argues that in the 19th century ‘pure’ literary or artistic interests were threatened on two sides, first by the harsh imperative of profitability, second, by the needs of the newly-literate after the establishment of compulsory secular education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0263276412441034">1996a [1992]</xref>: 128). There ensued a ‘reformation’ in the fields of the arts: a new <italic>anomie</italic> or clash of irreconcilable artistic regimes. Various prophetic figures – notably Manet – subverted the ‘priestly’ practices of art undertaken by those trained and commissioned through the Academic institution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0263276412441034">Bourdieu, 1993</xref>: 238–53). If, from now on, the large-scale ‘expanded’ field of literature – attractive to the merchants of the culture industry – turns to a profitable ‘production for production’s sake’, this produces also its dialectical opposite: ‘art for art’s sake’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0263276412441034">1996a [1992]</xref>). Within this restricted field, the consecrated positions of the older-generation avant-garde tend to be subverted by a hungry mass of younger avant-garde artists, whose own material insecurity aligns them with an anti-formalist vision of art and an iconoclastic programme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0263276412441034">Bourdieu, 1993</xref>: 103). Of course Bourdieu acknowledges the unconscious strategic practices at work here as the powerless contest the positions of the recognized.

<p>According to Bourdieu, modernist writers overwhelmingly have families from the lesser aristocracy to support them. Such families, rich in every capital <italic>except </italic>economic capital, are sufficiently comfortable to provide meagre allowances for their artistic sons to live off when young, their protection against the ‘freezing winds of egoism’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0263276412441034">Bourdieu, 1996a [1992]</xref>). The main exception that Bourdieu gives for this model is the unsupported <italic>bestselling</italic> writer, Zola, whose courageous defence of Dreyfus allowed him to become consecrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0263276412441034">1996a [1992]</xref>: 116).</p>
<p><italic>However, there are more sources of heterodoxy and symbolic revolutions than Bourdieu has acknowledged.</italic> Note that Bourdieu’s model rules out cultural producers who come from the subordinate classes. Indeed, he explicitly suggests that those writers without means had to go back to the provinces from Paris, the literary capital, doomed to write mere ‘regional novels’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0263276412441034">1993</xref>: 69; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0263276412441034">1996a [1992]</xref>: 82–91). There is considerable truth in this view, but it is ultimately too limited. First, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0263276412441034">Lahire’s massive study (2006)</xref> has demonstrated that <italic>most</italic> recognized writers have, for a while, combined two jobs. Amongst these, Mallarmé was an English teacher, Claudel a diplomat, Joyce an English teacher and bank-employee and Kafka worked in a Workers’ Accident Insurance Office (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0263276412441034">2006</xref>: 28–9). Bourdieu’s <italic>Rules…</italic> at one point recognizes this, but fails to make enough of it.</p>
<p>Second, the burgeoning public sector after the Second World War to some extent took on the former role of aristocratic families in nurturing artists. In Britain there was undeniably a <italic>symbolic revolution in cultural production</italic>. Such changes need to be understood in terms of altered material limits. In the field of drama, there was not simply the provision of unprecedented state funding for the theatre but also the linked technological developments providing opportunities for new writing via television. This transformation signalled the emergence of a new wave of expressionism and a deeper realism, as well as a whole group of ‘uprooted’, socially-mobile authors.</p>
<p>Of these, Harold Pinter is an ideal-typical example: the son of a tailor, from an East London Jewish background, as young as 14 he was avidly reading modernist writers; by 18 he had started work as an actor, and by the age of 27 he had seen his first play produced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0263276412441034">Batty, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0263276412441034">Fraser, 2010</xref>: 6). It could even be said that 1950s and ’60s drama – predominantly by grammar school-educated playwrights – embodied a changed dramatic habitus, a distinctive structure of feeling.</p>
<p>As early as the mid-’50s, the originally pre-war Theatre Workshop movement had brought together new dramatists and groups of actors at Stratford, in London’s East End. Their productions had the subordinate classes as their subjects; moreover, they adopted the settings, choruses and dance familiar elsewhere from the drama of Brecht in Germany or the Living Newspaper, in New York. The Theatre Workshop movement – amongst them, Ewan MacColl and Joan Littlewood – was a nomadic group of actors who had toured Northern theatres and factories with plays in 1945–53. Their <italic>Oh What a Lovely War</italic> (1963) was eventually taken up and diluted for the West End – in other words, it was transformed into Bourdieu’s ‘bourgeois theatre’: the mildly-satirical drama of the commercial field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0263276412441034">1993</xref>: 84–93; 197).</p>
<p>Rather than John Osborne’s <italic>Look Back in Anger </italic>(1957), we might see <italic>Oh What a Lovely War</italic> as the key work of the break, effectively pioneering the later developments of the ’60s. It signalled a profound rupture with the 1940s and ’50s West End theatres, whose ‘well made plays’ (Priestley, Coward, Rattigan, etc.) were invariably set in spacious, middle-class houses, adorned with ‘mandatory’ French windows. Comedy might have deeply troubled the state at the time of Shakespeare (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0263276412441034">Maslen, 2005</xref>: ch. 1), but these drawing-room comedies revolved around merely temporary disruptions of the social order, as though Ibsen’s, Strindberg’s and Synge’s naturalism had never taken place. Indeed, the main linguistic register of the ’40s and ’50s plays was the dominant code, attuned especially to the vagaries of British censorship. The State Chancellor's Office ruled out not just political ideas detrimental to the dominant class but also Anglo-Saxon sexual terms and medical references (abortions, syphilis, impotence – even allusions to miscarriages) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0263276412441034">Cornish and Ketels, 1985</xref>: xiv).</p>
<p>The importance of the British theatrical break of the 1960s was that it returned the theatre to the social reality and language of the street or workplace. It fundamentally broke with the past by bringing in new voices and unexplored issues, such as imprisonment, capital punishment, arbitrary arrest, prostitution, music-hall, and racism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0263276412441034">Worth, 1972</xref>: 11).</p>
<p>The new wave was underpinned by a wider ‘cultural revolution’: a rejection of theatrical conventions and deference, together with a new tone of democratic autonomy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0263276412441034">Williams, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0263276412441034">Worth, 1972</xref>: 20, ch. 9). Thus Wesker’s farm-worker heroine, Beatie, in <italic>Roots</italic>, starts to focus on her own education. Jo, the daughter of a part-time prostitute, in <italic>A Taste of Honey</italic>, keeps her illegitimate baby while being looked after by a gay male friend. Orton’s comedies use farce to demystify orthodox representations of class and sexuality. Arden’s great play, <italic>Serjeant Musgrave’s Dance,</italic> interrogates the sacrifices sanctified by patriotism.</p>
<p>These transformations were accompanied by changes in <italic>who might be called an ‘author’ </italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0263276412441034">Bourdieu, 1993</xref>). The new drama in effect opened up a space between high and low culture at a time when orthodoxy was suddenly fragile (the decline of imperialism; Suez). The Royal Court Theatre – an important centre of the new movement – had already adopted pioneering methods. It advertised for fresh scripts, invited novelists to turn to the theatre and, crucially, organized writers’ groups, including writers’ groups for actors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0263276412441034">Cornish and Ketels, 1985</xref>: ix; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0263276412441034">Rebellato, 1999</xref>). As in Stratford East, its playwrights were chiefly the product of state grammar schools.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0263276412441034">5</xref></sup> Nor did they possess a high volume of certified cultural capital – John Arden, alone, had gone to University (Cambridge). The rest had left school early: Edward Bond at 14, Arnold Wesker and John Osborne at 16, Peter Barnes at 17; almost all were working class (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0263276412441034">Cornish and Ketels, 1985</xref>: x). After a series of manual jobs – Wesker was a chef, Orton a junior clerk, Bond a factory-worker – they typically trained as actors and moved from this to writing.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0263276412441034">6</xref></sup></p>
<p>This symbolic revolution in drama was only made possible because of subsidized culture. The Arts Council, initiated in 1940, was steered in a professional and metropolitan direction under its inaugural chairman, Keynes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0263276412441034">Rebellato, 1999</xref>: 39–47; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0263276412441034">McGuigan, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0263276412441034">Worth, 1972</xref>: x). Nevertheless, on the arm’s length funding principle, <italic>regional</italic> Arts Council-funded theatre groups also flourished in the 1960s and ’70s: 7:84, Communicado, Belt and Braces, North East Theatre: ‘For the first time, artistically-adventurous producing groups could experiment with plays that might not find immediate box-office success’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0263276412441034">Cornish and Ketels, 1985</xref>: xv).</p>
<p>The new drama was greeted by hostility, and initially championed by two critics alone – <italic>The Observer</italic>’s Kenneth Tynan and <italic>The Sunday Times</italic>’ Harold Hobson (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-0263276412441034">Taylor, 1978</xref>). Even Lawrence Olivier derided<italic> Look Back in Anger</italic> as ‘rubbish’, although he was later to play the lead part as Archie in Osborne’s <italic>The Entertainer</italic>. The elision of the authors’ inferior class with the literary worth of the plays was transparent. One recognized cultural producer – Somerset Maugham – icily commented: ‘They are slum’ (cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0263276412441034">Cornish and Ketels, 1985</xref>: xxi).</p>
<p>Williams, in 1961, addressed the fresh appeal of such ‘intensely personal cries in the dark’. He pointed less to specific ideas than to a ‘new wave of feeling’ which motivated the outbursts of Osborne’s Jimmy Porter in <italic>Look Back in Anger </italic>or the critical realism of Wesker’s<italic> Chicken Soup with Barley </italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0263276412441034">Williams, 1968</xref>: 33–4). In contrast, later critics have addressed the lacuna behind the New Wave. Thus Wandor’s gender-sensitive gaze reveals the misogyny within many of these plays. Rebellato, more contentiously, argues for a fresh revaluation of values, claiming that the ‘New Wave’ was a <italic>retreat </italic>into a narrow English public sphere, at odds with the double-coded 1940s and ’50s theatre, with its subtle sexual subversion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr70-0263276412441034">Wandor, 2001</xref>: ch. 3; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0263276412441034">Rebellato, 1999</xref>: 127–54, 223).</p>
<p>Despite its own silences and paradoxes, the New Wave drama has been accepted universally as a transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr79-0263276412441034">Worth, 1972</xref>). It ushered in a revived awareness of the profound fractures within ‘the cultures of British society’, cultures which had been unaffected by improved wages and reduced labour discipline. Yet, as we have seen, the playwrights who made this ‘symbolic revolution’ came to the theatre neither with high levels of cultural capital<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0263276412441034">7</xref></sup> nor supported by families with old money. Rather, secure state funding via the Art Council permitted independent professional theatres to nurture their own authors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr73-0263276412441034">Williams, 1968</xref>: 37). Bourdieu’s model of the ‘autonomous field of cultural production’ needs to be more elaborated to account for such developments.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0263276412441034">Bourdieu’s classification of the cultural field (1984)</xref> depends on a strong analytical demarcation between restricted and expanded fields. This distinction bears witness to the long-lasting gulfs between taste cultures, especially in Britain and France.</p>
<p>In this context, we need to focus further on Bourdieu’s wholesale rejection of ‘populi-culture’ or cultural populism. It will be suggested that this dismissive critical stance has an elective affinity with structuralism rather than ‘culturalism’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0263276412441034">8</xref></sup> and that this, in turn, is linked to differences in the origin of British and French cultural studies.</p>
<p>Such divergent national formations are typified in the work of Williams and Bourdieu. Both men possessed an <italic>anthropological </italic>understanding of culture, refusing to equate it with elite ideas of minority distinction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0263276412441034">Eldridge and Eldridge, 1994</xref>: 72–3, 79, 87, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0263276412441034">Bourdieu, 1984 [1979]</xref>: 100–1). Both stressed that the key historical invention credited to working-class culture has been its collectivist politics and morality, animated by mutual aid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0263276412441034">Bourdieu, 1984 [1979]</xref>: 32–4, 149, 154, 169–208; Bourdieu et al., 1999: 317–20, 331; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr78-0263276412441034">Williams, 1993</xref>: 93). Both agree that the tiny number of proletarian novels are a peripheral dynamic within this culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0263276412441034">Bourdieu, 1984 [1979]</xref>: 32–4; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr71-0263276412441034">Williams, 1961</xref>: 313–14).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0263276412441034">9</xref></sup> Strikingly, both were influenced by the Bakhtin school (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0263276412441034">Bourdieu, 1984 [1979]</xref>: 491, 604; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-0263276412441034">Williams, 1977</xref>: 39–43).</p>
<p>Yet they differed on approaches to learning. Having taught 15 years of extramural tutorial classes, Williams grasped the manifest desire for education on the part of a significant section of adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0263276412441034">McIlroy, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0263276412441034">Smith, 2008</xref>: 316). He also saw such learning as engendering creative writing: hence his later essays on working-class developments of the industrial novel form (1980: 213–29; 1984: 239–56). In this respect, he was sharply divided from his friend, Bourdieu,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0263276412441034">10</xref></sup> who designates the entire category of working-class writers as a product of scholastic fantasy: a ‘populi-literature’, the populist wish-fulfilment of guilty intellectuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0263276412441034">Bourdieu, 1990</xref>: 150–5).</p>
<p>This dismissal of intellectuals’ meetings with self-confident workers as mere ‘scholastic fantasy’ might be seen to justify Alexander’s criticisms of Bourdieu’s cynicism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0263276412441034">Alexander, 1995</xref>). But the issue at stake is subtler: it is Bourdieu’s contention that such a misplaced attempt to identify with workers ultimately denigrates working-class intelligence and taste (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0263276412441034">Le Hir, 2000</xref>: 136–7). The scholastic gaze distorts because it neglects the fact that working-class tastes are determined by the social restrictions of money, time and limited literacy:<disp-quote>
<p>The cult of popular culture (whose historical paradigm is the <italic>Proletkult</italic>) is a form of essentialism, in the same way as the class racism which reduces popular practices to barbarism – of which it is often nothing more than the mere <italic>inversion</italic>, and a falsely radical one at that: indeed it offers all the benefits of apparent subversion, of ‘radical chic’, whilst at the same time leaving everything as it is, some with their actually cultured culture, capable of sustaining its own questioning, the others with their decisively and fictitiously rehabilitated culture. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0263276412441034">Bourdieu, 1998 [1994]</xref>: 137)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>Much of what Bourdieu argues here about the historical unconscious behind consecrated culture must be accepted. Yet, against him, the material and symbolic conditions for creativity <italic>can</italic> be replicated elsewhere, especially within reading groups and adult classes. I have shown above how writing groups for actors – some of whom came from working-class homes – contributed to the cultural shocks of British drama in the 1960s. Autodidacts often possess a similar enthusiasm for learning, as even Bourdieu acknowledges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0263276412441034">1984 [1979]</xref>: 329).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0263276412441034">11</xref></sup> It is well known that such ‘mutual improvement’ groups generated the conditions for critical practices in industry, but they also nurtured sufficient components of the scholastic attitude to engender new cultural works (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0263276412441034">Brantlinger on African-American writing (1990: 154–5, 164)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0263276412441034">Dickstein (2009)</xref> on both the working-class Jewish-American writer Mike Gold and the African-American Richard Wright).</p>
<p>Even within modernity, not all consecrated writers have been as erudite as Mallarmé. Indeed, there is periodic infusion of simpler forms. According to the 1920s’ Russian formalists:<disp-quote>
<p>[W]hen canonized art-forms reach an impasse, the way is paved for infiltration of the elements of non-canonized art, which by this time have managed to evolve new artistic devices – a model they called the ‘law’ of the ‘canonization of the junior branch’. (Sklovskij, cited in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0263276412441034">Erlich, 1980</xref>: 260)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>We can grant that profound material changes are necessary for workers to become proficient intellectuals, especially shorter hours of work and access to well-stocked libraries. This would ultimately require a full social transformation as well as a cultural one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-0263276412441034">Williams, 1965</xref>: 363–83; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0263276412441034">Smith, 2008</xref>: 220). All the same, is not Bourdieu just turning a switch in a structuralist logic when he dismisses a ‘popular aesthetic’ as merely one aspect of barbarism? A facile, workerist conception of the New Man was certainly a feature of Proletkult. But it is too easy to write off all extramural adult education and all popular cultural products in this way. After all, some premodernist consecrated novelists – Dickens, Mrs Gaskell – lacked high levels of formal education, just as did Genet in the 1950s.</p>
<p>Two writers on high and low culture, Grignon and Passeron, have come to a very different conclusion. Like Williams, they accept that the number of working-class writers is small, but they cite the exemplary case of Georges Navel, who exploits all the linguistic armoury of the dominant class against those who exclude him (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0263276412441034">1989</xref>: 73–9). Their argument is that the sociology of culture needs to move, firstly, beyond the elitism or ethnocentrism of minority/high culture, secondly, beyond the cultural autonomy and aesthetic relativism of Lévi-Straussian structuralism and, thirdly, beyond the ‘cultural legitimacy’ perspective of Bourdieu (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0263276412441034">Grignon and Passeron, 1989: 65–72</xref>). Bourdieu, they argue, overemphasizes the degree to which the subordinate classes experience cultivated culture as legitimate (1989: 48–51).</p>
<p>Grignon and Passeron foreshadow an alternative sociology of culture that will transcend both ‘excessive miserabilism’ and ‘relativist populism’. They argue persuasively that this should be undertaken by a ‘double reading’: one which adds a more Thompsonian/Williams’ ‘culturalist’ dimension to subordinated popular culture, as well as granting <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0263276412441034">Bourdieu’s Weberian-Marxist emphases on legitimacy (1989: 73)</xref>.</p>
<p>Whilst thus questioning the logic of Bourdieu’s own argument, perhaps we might also offer a Bourdieusian study of Bourdieu himself. We need to address the historical field of knowledge that takes popular culture as its subject in France. This context situates more broadly the moves stemming from Bourdieu’s own habitus, notably his shift from philosophy to the social sciences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0263276412441034">Bourdieu, 2004 [2001]: 100–9</xref>).</p>

<p>Cultural studies in France had as one of its founding moments an academic dispute over the idealist ‘great tradition’ in literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0263276412441034">Bourdieu, 1988 [1984]: 115–16</xref>). The ‘anti-institutional’ Barthes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0263276412441034">Bourdieu, 1988 [1984]</xref>: xix, xxi–xxii, 117) began applying to a range of contemporary French culture the approaches learnt from Lévi-Strauss and the ‘ethnographic surrealists’: Mauss, Leiris, Caillois, Bataille and Klossowski (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0263276412441034">Richman, 1995: 28–9</xref>). This provided the cathectic force for subsequent development. Although never a separate discipline as in Britain and America, cultural studies in France can be linked to the founding figures cited in Grignon and Passeron’s anthology: Lévi-Strauss and Barthes (as mentioned), Foucault, Halbwachs, de Certeau, Genette, Hoggart<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0263276412441034">12</xref></sup>and Bourdieu himself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0263276412441034">Grignon and Passeron, 1989: 155–202</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0263276412441034">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>Now, what is missing from this French tradition is any ‘ancestral origin’ in extramural education. There had emerged a strong movement for the education of the subordinate classes under the auspices of the Ligue de l’Enseignement, backed especially by the Radical Government of Léon Bourgeois (1896–8) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0263276412441034">Steele, 2007</xref>: 142). The major institutional antecedents for this had come from an anticlerical freemasonry and from Comtean/Durkheimian ‘solidarism’, which played an important part in laying the foundations for the regulation of the market. But neither Masonry nor solidarism adopted the model of the British university extension institutions, perceiving the latter as a poor substitute for a proper secondary education through the lycée (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0263276412441034">Steele, 2007</xref>: 142). Consequently, the Universités Populaires, the main network in France to found an educational alliance between workers and university lecturers, lasted only 15 years. This network, emerging in 1899, blossomed before the First World War but faded away by 1914 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0263276412441034">Mercier, 1986</xref>: 7–11; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0263276412441034">Steele, 2007</xref>: 142–7).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-0263276412441034">14</xref></sup> Nothing later took its place.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-0263276412441034">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>British cultural studies emphasized from the start the drive for education from below (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0263276412441034">Steele, 1997</xref>: intro., ch. 1; 2007; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0263276412441034">Barr, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0263276412441034">Brantlinger, 1990</xref>: 45; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0263276412441034">McIlroy, 1993</xref>). The structures that embodied these collective educational hopes were not just the 18th-century Scottish universities, the artisanal Mutual Improvement Societies, and the early 19th-century Owenist and Chartist movements, but also the later, 20th-century organizations: labour colleges, plebs leagues and the state-aided Workers’ Educational Authority (WEA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0263276412441034">Fieldhouse, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-0263276412441034">Steele, 2007</xref>). Within these, women as well as men were educated to become critical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0263276412441034">Barr, 2008</xref>: 86–92, 115–30). Arguably the most successful method from 1907 on was the three-year course of WEA tutorial classes, until the Second World War, taken up in significant numbers by male manual workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0263276412441034">Fieldhouse, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0263276412441034">Smith, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Steele has illuminated how this neglected component of British educational history shaped the foundation of the Birmingham-based Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies in 1963: ‘From the embers of the independent workers’ educational movement arose the phoenix of cultural studies’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0263276412441034">1997</xref>: 9).</p>
<p>As he points out, the fathers of cultural studies – Richard Hoggart, Edward Thompson, Raymond Williams and Stuart Hall – <italic>were all extramural teachers</italic>. In the WEA, it was they who inventively combined the preoccupations of metropolitan-based artistic modernists with the analysis of political economy. These different strands were plaited together in the extramural teaching of Raymond Williams, for example, who offered a historically-sensitive left Leavisite stance, combining realism and modernism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0263276412441034">Steele, 1997: 186</xref>). Similarly the historian E.P. Thompson gave extramural classes on writers such as Blake. These required a rigorous internal dissection of the poems alongside a historical analysis of the social and economic changes refracted in Blake’s writing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr67-0263276412441034">Thompson, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>Stuart Hall has confirmed the extramural origins of cultural studies, adding that at that stage – the mid-’60s – he had abandoned academia for the ‘dirty world’ outside:<disp-quote>
<p>We thus came from a tradition entirely marginal to the centres of English academic life, and our engagement with questions of cultural change – how to understand them, how to describe them and how to theorise them […] – was first reckoned within the dirty outside world. The Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies was the locus to which we retreated when that conversation in the open world could no longer be continued. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0263276412441034">Hall, 1990</xref>: 12)</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>The importance of these adult classes in the founding figures’ own development cannot be underestimated: they saw themselves as learning as much from their mining and factory-working students – including women – as vice versa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-0263276412441034">Thompson, 1991</xref>: 460; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-0263276412441034">Thompson and Thompson, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0263276412441034">Smith, 2008</xref>: 238, 305, 310, 316–17). In brief, the ‘new’ discipline ‘cultural studies’ was only new in its university setting:<disp-quote>
<p>[W]hen I moved into internal University Teaching, when at about the same time Richard Hoggart did the same, we started teaching in ways that had been absolutely familiar in Extra-mural and WEA classes, relating history to art and literature, including contemporary culture, and, suddenly, so strange was this to the Universities that they said ‘My God, here is a new subject called Cultural Studies’. …</p>
<p>Don’t believe a word of it. That shift in perspective […] began in Adult Education. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr77-0263276412441034">Williams, 1989</xref>: 162).</p></disp-quote></p>
<p>It would be a mistake – <italic>pace</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0263276412441034">Eagleton’s <italic>Literary Theory</italic> (1983)</xref> – to see this development of the curriculum in Althusserian terms, as a legitimation mechanism: a device for creating Foucauldian docile bodies (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0263276412441034">Steele, 1997</xref>: ch. 1). Rather the reverse, teaching outside the university became one of the key arenas in England where cultural politics were fought out. Thus, as Steele remarks, the early extramural curriculum was shaped by working-class puritan democracy and the culture of Romanticism, as well as by economics and politics (1997: 69).</p>
<p>Present, too, at the birth of cultural studies was the early sociology of culture brought over by European exiles fleeing Nazism. Significant figures here were Arnold Hauser, a part-time member of the crucial Leeds-based Yorkshire extramural movement, Klingender in Hull, Karl Polanyi and Karl Mannheim (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0263276412441034">Steele, 1997</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0263276412441034">Smith, 2008</xref>: 303, 440). Indeed, it was European sociology of culture that endowed British cultural studies with a concept of ‘social totality’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0263276412441034">Steele, 1997</xref>).</p>
<p>Bourdieu’s simple contrast between the ‘tastes of freedom’ and the ‘tastes of necessity’ <italic>short-circuits</italic> too many such interchanges of ideas between the culture from below and literary or educational institutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0263276412441034">1984 [1979]</xref>: 175–200). This vision and division of the world is more characteristic of the French field of popular education. Now, of course, after the demise of the original Universités Populaires in France, there had been a Théâtre National Populaire which, in the 1930s, was attended by workers. It can be accepted, too, that French trade unions have had a tradition of ‘éducation populaire’, not least through the Maisons des Jeunes et de la Culture. But, aside from the French Communist Party, there have been no spaces in the 20th century where self-educated workers in France came together extramurally alongside liberal or socialist intellectuals (Steele, pers. comm.).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0263276412441034">16</xref></sup> In contrast, British cultural studies, founded substantially by the WEA, had always possessed a terrain for an interrogation of cultures and for an expression of subaltern voices.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0263276412441034">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>Of course, Bourdieu knew about a certain kind of contact zone: the literature dealing with the move between the periphery and the metropolis. He had, after all, been friendly with the Algerian writers Mouloud Feraoun and Mouloud Mammeri (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0263276412441034">2008</xref>: 351, 354). But he never considers fully the implications of this problematic. In this sense he was rooted in his time, concerned fundamentally with the sociological clarification of the nature and consequences of the cultural ‘great divide’. His aim has arguably been obscured by his hostile press. It was to treat secular culture as the religion of our period, showing for example that cultural ignorance is now felt like a sin. It was to reveal, also, that taste does not just classify, it segregates, even where there are well-intentioned missions to democratize high culture or to relativize it.</p>
<p>As we have seen, Bourdieu cannot conceive of popular cultural forms within modernity that might have literary, artistic or musical power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0263276412441034">Bourdieu, 1990</xref>). Other studies of the cultural field keep this open (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0263276412441034">Hesmondhalgh, 2006</xref>: 217, 222). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0263276412441034">Bielsa (2006)</xref> discusses the <italic>cronica</italic> (chronicle), a hybrid form appearing in Latin American newspapers which blends fictional and documentary genres, some of whose writers are from the subordinate classes, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0263276412441034">whilst Shusterman discusses rap poetry (1992: ch. 8)</xref>. Grignon and Passeron have castigated Bourdieu for ignoring popular art, suggesting that ultimately he is too ‘dominocentric’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0263276412441034">1989</xref>: 117–18):<disp-quote>
<p>To say that there can be no really popular writer, that every writer ceases to be authentically-popular when he comes to be an authentic writer would only be a twisted way of saying once more that there can only be a bourgeois writer; the sociologist must at least ask himself [sic], in the name of what it suits him to reserve ‘writing’ – and its complications for the expression of the mode of life and its tastes – to the dominant class and naïve, disarming sincerity in the description of life to the ‘simple people’. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0263276412441034">1989</xref>: 83, my translation)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0263276412441034">18</xref></sup></p></disp-quote>Reluctantly, I have to agree.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-0263276412441034" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title>
<p>In this article I have considered the prevalent view that Bourdieu is the practitioner of a dismal science, who can envisage only a perpetual reproduction of elites. In dissenting strongly from this, I have shown the subtlety with which he combines Marx, Weber, Durkheim and Mauss to produce a theory of social change, and especially, the role of prophetic heterodoxies.</p>
<p>However, I have also claimed that there is a weakness in Bourdieu’s theory of the cultural field. He has an unmitigatedly tragic view in defining the cultural contradictions of capitalist modernity. He quite rightly stresses that by setting up the ‘banks of symbolic value’, literary and artistic values have been preserved. Nevertheless, whilst correctly noting that it is intellectual complexity that makes art socially legitimate, Bourdieu has missed a strand of <italic>agency from below</italic> in which cultural production without a large volume of certified, formal cultural capital has also been possible. In America, such production has been accompanied by forms of annual award specific to a genre – Oscars, Emmies and Grammies. Whilst not consecration in Bourdieu’s sense, these nevertheless represent a symbolic selection which cannot be reduced simply to high sales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0263276412441034">Shusterman, 1992</xref>: 196; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0263276412441034">Hesmondhalgh, 2006</xref>: 222).</p>
<p>Certainly, we can accept that the absence of time and space for modernist experimentation leads to only a very small minority of working-class writers. But Bourdieu’s theory also omits any of those instances when new playwrights and directors can emerge, due to state support, as in British drama of the late 1950s and ’60s. Although rarely bestselling art,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0263276412441034">19</xref></sup> this is an avant-garde symbolic revolution different from those explored in <italic>The Rules of Art</italic>. Further, Bourdieu’s analysis neglects any account of the fertile contact zones <italic>between </italic>high and low in literature (such as the detective novel or the cronica) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0263276412441034">Bielsa, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>Of course, Bourdieu’s position-takings should not be assessed <italic>reductively </italic>in terms of the spaces in the educational field, especially given his own <italic>habitus clivé </italic>and training in reflexivity (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0263276412441034">1988 [1984]</xref>: xi–xiv). Despite this – and, following his sociology of knowledge – I contend that his gaps owe much to the total isolation of French cultural studies from extramural education. Such extramural origins were crucial in the distinctive tradition of the British field of cultural studies, which drew on the self-activity by workers to shape their own conditions.</p>
<p>Moreover, at a time when the state is retreating from supporting both adult education and the creative arts, it is crucially necessary to counter amnesia. We can draw on an important resource for an oppositional collective memory when we recall the historic gains from state initiatives in the past, including the emergence of a new group of cultural producers within drama.</p>

Thus if, with Merleau-Ponty and Bourdieu, we conceive of institutional meanings as deposited in the body as raw materials, we can also conceive of their active ‘sculpting’, although within certain limits. This creative dynamic within the habitus is organized around a social ‘imaginary’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0263276412441034">Frère, 2011</xref>: 257, 259).</p></fn>
<fn id="fn3-0263276412441034"><label>3</label><p>Bourdieu advocates the pursuit of the universal (peace, justice, ecological change, etc.) but he stresses that ‘[Intellectuals] must learn to recognise in the work of intellectuals from traditions different from their own […] the effect of past or present confrontations with experiences such as fascism or Stalinism. … When dealing with a universal there is always the threat of merely articulating a historical unconscious bound to a particular intellectual microcosm’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0263276412441034">1989</xref>: 102).</p></fn>
<fn id="fn4-0263276412441034"><label>4</label><p>It is instructive that when Bourdieu later writes glowingly about ‘participant objectivation’ he is silent about its <italic>absence</italic> in the period of his 1960s surveys, including that used in <italic>Distinction</italic>.</p></fn>
<fn id="fn5-0263276412441034"><label>5</label><p>However, both Orton and Shelagh Delaney failed the 11+ and went to secondary modern schools. Delaney was only belatedly accepted for a year at grammar school, at the age of 15.

<fn id="fn6-0263276412441034"><label>6</label><p>Cultural capital – often embodied – is gained from acting itself; thus such actors-turned-playwrights may be less exceptional in terms of Bourdieu’s model of modernism than first appears. But while there is some truth in this, the knowledge acquired from acting is based on unscheduled learning, lacking progression through a formal ‘visible curriculum’. In Bourdieu’s view, modernist writers possess skills <italic>derived from the educational institution</italic> rather than these insights, which are closer to the autodidacts’ haphazard acquisition (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0263276412441034">1996a [1992]</xref>: 147; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0263276412441034">1984 [1979]</xref>: 24–5).</p></fn>

Amongst the chief architects of its symbolic revolution, Trevor Griffiths, the son of a chemical process worker, had an English degree from Manchester and Dennis Potter, the son of a miner, graduated in PPE from Oxford. As to some extent with the grammar school-educated authors, it could be argued, with Bourdieu, that in these cases the dominant discourse is learned in order to interrogate it.</p></fn>

<bio>
<p><bold>Bridget Fowler</bold> is an Emeritus Professor of Sociology at the University of Glasgow. She specializes in social theory, Marxist-feminism and the sociology of culture. She has had a long-term interest in the thought of Pierre Bourdieu, whose ideas she has taken up in various articles and books: <italic>The Alienated Reader</italic> (Harvester Wheatsheaf, 1991), <italic>Pierre Bourdieu and Cultural Theory: Critical Investigations</italic> (SAGE, 1997), and an edited volume, <italic>Reading Bourdieu on Society and Culture</italic> (Blackwell, 2000). She has also applied Bourdieusian theory to the study of obituaries (see <italic>The Obituary as Collective Memory, </italic>Routledge, 2007), and is at present working on the social theory of Bourdieu’s former collaborator, Luc Boltanski.</p></bio>
