<abstract>
<p>This article examines website headings used by <italic>Fortune</italic> 500 companies in their efforts to inform stakeholders about corporate social responsibility (CSR). Instead of using “Corporate Social Responsibility” as a heading, companies often use specific terms to identify various CSR initiatives. The purpose of this article is to identify common CSR-related headings that are currently used on <italic>Fortune</italic> 500 company websites. Data were collected from all <italic>Fortune</italic> 500 company websites. The websites were further analyzed according to manufacturing, retailing, and service industry. Interesting similarities and differences were found. This study provides guidance on articulating CSR-related activities to consumers, employees, and stakeholders.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The manner in which corporations address corporate social responsibility (CSR) issues is evolving. Instead of having a “Corporate Social Responsibility” heading on a company website, companies are using more specific terms to identify distinct CSR-related actions and company policies. These CSR-related terms are formed as new social issues emerge. In 1998, the most common CSR-related headings on corporate websites were community/civic involvement, environment, education, and charity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1080569912471185">Esrock &amp; Leichty, 1998</xref>). According to our research, common headings today include sustainability, ethics, diversity, and health/wellness. The purpose of this article is to determine what headings are most popular among <italic>Fortune</italic> 500 company websites to communicate company actions related to CSR. Properly articulating CSR activities has become a prevailing topic in corporate communication because the firm’s reputation and legitimacy may be riding on it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1080569912471185">Verboven, 2011</xref>). It is important to look specifically at company websites since they are a mode of communication that companies typically use when communicating to stakeholders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1080569912471185">Verboven, 2011</xref>). At the managerial level, this study offers practical insights into the design of company websites as it relates to CSR issues. For those that teach business communication in academic or other organizational settings, knowledge can be passed along regarding the CSR-related terminology being used by corporations today.</p>
<p>Besides pursuing a profit, companies are also concerned with helping society and the environment. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1080569912471185">Elkington (1997)</xref> observes, organizational performance is being evaluated on the basis of economic prosperity, social justice, and environmental quality. Management, employees, investors, and consumers are considering more than profit alone as they evaluate company policy and strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1080569912471185">Blazovich &amp; Smith, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1080569912471185">Cronin, Smith, Gleim, Ramirez, &amp; Martinez, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1080569912471185">Makni, Francoeur, &amp; Ballavance, 2009</xref>). This social responsibility mindset is proving to be beneficial. Companies seeking to help people and the environment have been associated with better financial performance, increased creativity and innovation, and improving their competitive standing in the marketplace (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1080569912471185">Kassinis &amp; Vafeas, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1080569912471185">King &amp; Lenox, 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>Academic research findings and marketplace surveys suggest that stakeholders reward good corporate citizens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1080569912471185">Porter &amp; Kramer, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1080569912471185">Smith, Smith, &amp; Wang, 2010</xref>). Thus, companies are investing in activities that contribute to this corporate image. However, studies show that public awareness of a company’s CSR activities is typically low, even among stakeholders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1080569912471185">Bhattacharya, Sen, &amp; Korshchun, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1080569912471185">Du, Bhattacharya, &amp; Sen, 2007</xref>). According to these studies, many consumers are unaware of the fact that most companies today engage in some type of activity that helps people or the environment. If consumers and investors are largely uninformed, then companies are not successfully communicating their CSR activities. If a company is to reap any benefits in the marketplace from CSR initiatives, the company must effectively communicate its policies and activities to stakeholders. In an effort to enhance communication, chemical companies are experimenting with the use of slogans to express their CSR goals and activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr69-1080569912471185">Verboven, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>One way to gather information about a company is through its website. The degree to which a person can easily navigate a company website can facilitate or impede the acquisition of information. Gaining company knowledge can affect the consumer’s development of brand loyalty and customer commitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1080569912471185">Ellonen, Tarkiainen, &amp; Kuivalainen, 2010</xref>). Thus, if a company wants to facilitate the process of stakeholders gaining knowledge of the company, it is helpful to use headings that are easily understood and of interest to the stakeholder. An objective of this article is to examine the website headings used by major companies in their efforts to inform stakeholders about CSR activities.</p>

<title>Literature Review</title>
<p>Research indicates that the focus of CSR is evolving (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1080569912471185">Kotler &amp; Lee, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1080569912471185">Luo &amp; Bhattacharya, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1080569912471185">Zenisek, 1979</xref>). Some scholars say CSR is in a continuing state of emergence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1080569912471185">Blazovich &amp; Smith, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1080569912471185">Hult, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1080569912471185">Lockett, Moon, &amp; Visser, 2006</xref>). CSR refers to the responsibilities businesses have to society that extend beyond their obligations to stockholders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1080569912471185">Carroll, 2010</xref>). There is conflicting research as to whether CSR’s relationship to financial performance is positive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1080569912471185">Orlitzky, Schmidt, &amp; Reynes, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1080569912471185">Ruff, Muralidhar, Brown, Janney, &amp; Paul, 2001</xref>), negative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr75-1080569912471185">Wright &amp; Ferris, 1997</xref>), or simply neutral (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1080569912471185">McWilliams &amp; Siegel, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr68-1080569912471185">Van de Velde, Vermeir, &amp; Corten, 2005</xref>). However, other research suggests that consumers, stockholders, and employees are looking to support companies that help people and the environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1080569912471185">Du, Bhattacharya, &amp; Sen, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>CSR can be a differentiator in the marketplace and create a competitive advantage for a company (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1080569912471185">Ferrell, Gozalez-Padron, Hult, &amp; Maignan, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1080569912471185">Porter &amp; Kramer, 2006</xref>). A company can benefit from being a good corporate citizen if that attribute elevates it above the competition. Studies have found that it “pays to be green” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1080569912471185">Klassen &amp; Whybark, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1080569912471185">Russo &amp; Fouts, 1997</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1080569912471185">King and Lenox (2002)</xref> found a positive relationship between waste prevention and future return on assets. Lower emissions from a company will generate higher financial performance. Consumer, employees, and stockholders can benefit from a cleaner and cost-efficient company. A strong corporate commitment to the environment can create positive relationships with stakeholders, thus reducing the cost of stakeholder and customer relationship management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr74-1080569912471185">Wilson, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Sustainable marketing, while concerned with continuing economic performance, also considers the impact of business operations on society and the environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1080569912471185">Sheth, Sethia, &amp; Srinivas, 2011</xref>). Thus, sustainable marketing is a part of CSR. There is general acceptance that sustainability is a significant element affecting whether or not a company is successful in the long run (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1080569912471185">Kuosmanen &amp; Kuosmanen, 2009</xref>). As a component of CSR, many researchers regard sustainable marketing as adhering to the triple-bottom line of generating a profit while helping society and the environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1080569912471185">Chabowski, Mena, &amp; Gonzalez-Padron, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1080569912471185">Huang &amp; Rust, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1080569912471185">Johnson, 2009</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section3-1080569912471185">
<title>Importance of CSR to Consumers</title>
<p>With the plethora of options in the marketplace today, consumers have the luxury of choosing where they spend their money. Why not purchase from a company that is making a contribution to the world, as opposed to one that is simply out to make a profit? With this in mind, consumers are interested in the nonbusiness activities of a company. To boost public acceptance, companies should provide information about their CSR activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1080569912471185">de Bakker &amp; den Hond, 2008</xref>). According to one study, 84% of Americans say they would switch brands if one brand advocated a good cause (assuming that price and quality are equal). In the same study, 79% of Americans consider corporate citizenship a factor when deciding whether to buy from a company (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1080569912471185">Bhattacharya &amp; Sen, 2004</xref>). These statistics support the conclusion that corporate citizenship is an important criterion in consumer purchase decisions. We may even reach the point where companies have to be socially responsible in order to operate successfully in the marketplace. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1080569912471185">Hult (2011)</xref>, CSR may possibly become a common denominator among organizations. The bottom line is that consumers prefer doing business with a company that is actively helping people or the environment.</p>
<p>Consumers are a driving force behind company initiatives aimed at sustainability. The majority of top management believes that a visible commitment to sustainability can build consumer trust and strengthen brand reputation. Slightly over half of CEOs consider consumers to be their most important stakeholder in influencing how the company handles social and environmental issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1080569912471185">Lacy, Cooper, Hayward, &amp; Neuberger, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>CSR programs have a significant influence on how a consumer perceives products as well as companies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1080569912471185">Pirsch, Gupta, &amp; Grau, 2007</xref>). A consumer’s response to a product can be directly or indirectly affected by CSR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1080569912471185">Brown, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1080569912471185">Brown &amp; Dacin, 1997</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1080569912471185">Luo and Bhattacharya (2006)</xref> reported that CSR positively affects customer satisfaction, which also leads to greater market value. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1080569912471185">Marin, Ruiz, and Rubio (2009)</xref> found that CSR initiatives influence consumer behavior in several ways. Their study proved that higher levels of consumer CSR associations lead to stronger customer loyalty. The customer feels more loyal to the company because he or she can identify with the company. Investing in CSR programs will generate stronger customer loyalty in the future (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1080569912471185">Marin et al., 2009</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section4-1080569912471185">
<title>Importance of CSR to Stockholders</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1080569912471185">Luo and Bhattacharya (2009)</xref> discovered that when implemented well, CSR initiatives and strategic marketing could create an insurance-like protection for greater financial stockholder wealth. Some companies justify their CSR initiatives with the potential of improving the company’s image, enhancing the brand, and increasing the value of its stock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1080569912471185">Porter &amp; Kramer, 2006</xref>). Besides building goodwill and brand loyalty, doing what is right helps secure future resources and markets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1080569912471185">Kher, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Stockholders are more concerned with the overall results in business metrics when it comes to evaluating the success of CSR programs. For the programs to be successful, it is imperative that the programs be properly articulated. Miscommunication of business ethics and CSR initiatives can potentially lead to dissatisfaction and conflict among stakeholders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1080569912471185">DeKay, 2011</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1080569912471185">Du et al. (2010)</xref> stated that when communicating CSR to stockholders, companies should communicate the business impact of their CSR activities, and how these activities have enhanced key business metrics such as customer equity, corporate governance, and risk management.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1080569912471185">
<title>Importance of CSR to Company Employees</title>
<p>Sustainability is emerging as a top concern for CEOs and employees around the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1080569912471185">Lacy et al., 2010</xref>). Management view sustainable business practices as the means for tapping into new sources of demand and inspiring new levels of innovation from their employees. Ninety-three percent of CEOs consider sustainable business practices to be an important factor in the future success of their company (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1080569912471185">Lacy et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Sustainability is generating new business imperatives and changing the consumer’s determinant criteria in the selection of products and services. To be competitive in today’s market, sustainability should be a core goal in business practices. This includes inserting sustainability goals in individual performance measures and compensation packages. Eighty-one percent of CEOs say they have embedded sustainability issues into their company’s operations and strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1080569912471185">Lacy et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Research has shown that companies practicing CSR are more likely to attract the most qualified employees. Corporate social performance is positively related to employer attractiveness for applicants who have multiple job choices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1080569912471185">Albinger &amp; Freeman, 2000</xref>). A job applicant’s perception of a firm’s CSR initiatives contributes to the attractiveness of a potential employer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1080569912471185">Greening &amp; Turban, 2000</xref>). In one study, corporate responsibility specifically related to environmental issues had a positive effect on recruiting employees. Job seekers were more interested in environmentally responsible companies and were more intent on pursuing employment with those companies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1080569912471185">Bauer &amp; Aiman-Smith, 1996</xref>). Millennials who are on the brink of entering the job market are especially interested in the CSR efforts of companies. As one study revealed, young adults perceive CSR as important criteria when selecting an employer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1080569912471185">Kim &amp; Park, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>CSR can also have a positive effect on the retention of employees. An employee feels connected to the firm’s CSR activities. Thus, when a company is practicing social responsibility, this meets the employee’s need for belonging and contributing to society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1080569912471185">Rupp, Ganapathi, Aguilera, &amp; Williams, 2006</xref>). Nurturing a strong corporate culture that supports social responsibility is helpful to human resource management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1080569912471185">Sharma, Sharma, &amp; Devi, 2009</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section6-1080569912471185">
<title>The History of CSR Terminology</title>
<p>Beginning in the 1950s, the social responsibility of businesses became an issue of concern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1080569912471185">Carroll, 1999</xref>). Explicit definitions and alternative emphases for CSR arose in the 1970s. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1080569912471185">Elbing (1970)</xref> termed CSR to mean that businesses have a responsibility beyond profit maximization. In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1080569912471185">1974, Purcell</xref> added a detailed definition of CSR. He stated that CSR is willingness on the part of the corporate manager to confront certain social problems he or she deems urgent and to bend the influence of the company toward the solution of those problems. The manager must intelligently balance the needs of the many groups affected by the firm so as best to achieve both profitable production and the common good, especially in situations in which he or she is not required to do so by law.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1080569912471185">Gavin and Maynard (1975)</xref> expanded the definition of CSR to include the physical and psychological well-being of company employees. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr76-1080569912471185">Zenisek (1979)</xref> dissected CSR into four phases: (a) owner-manager type, (b) organizational-participant type, (c) task-environment type, and (d) societal type. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1080569912471185">Carroll’s (1979)</xref> definition of CSR states that social responsibility must embody the economic, legal, ethical, and discretionary categories of business performance because of the need to address the entire range of obligations that business has to society. This definition is the most cited in academic research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1080569912471185">Montiel, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The 1980s began a new era. The creation of original definitions began to decrease, while further research, methodologies, measurements, and frameworks began to rise. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1080569912471185">Boal and Peery (1985)</xref> defined CSR as a three-dimensional construct: (a) economic, noneconomic, and human outcomes; (b) ethical considerations; and (c) consequences for relevant interest groups.</p>
<p>In the 1990s, CSR evolved to include stakeholders, consumers, business ethics, corporate citizenship, and corporate social performance. Concept models were developed and researchers strived to operationalize CSR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1080569912471185">Carroll, 1999</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr72-1080569912471185">Watts and Holme (1999)</xref> worked with the World Business Council for Sustainable Development and defined CSR as a continued commitment by business to behave ethically and contribute to economic development while improving the quality of life of the work force and their family as well as the community and society at large.</p>
<p>The first decade of the new millennium elaborated on the existing definitions of CSR. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1080569912471185">Maignan and Ralston (2002)</xref> provided a detailed definition of CSR which includes (a) motivating principles driven by values, stakeholders, performance; (b) programs and activities aimed at implementing CSR principles and addressing specific stakeholder issues, including philanthropic, sponsorships, volunteer, code of ethics, quality, health and safety, and managing environmental impacts; and (c) stakeholder issues dealing with community, customer, employee, shareholders, and suppliers. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1080569912471185">Heath and Ni (2008)</xref> define CSR as a commitment to improve community well-being through discretionary business practices and contribution of corporate resources. A more comprehensive definition of CSR today comes from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1080569912471185">Carroll (2010)</xref>: CSR encompasses the economic, legal, ethical, and discretionary or philanthropic expectations that society has of organizations.</p>

<title>Methodology and Research Questions</title>
<p>Data for the study were collected from the entire set of <italic>Fortune</italic> 500 companies in 2011. CSR applies to companies of any size; however, the focus tends to be on large organizations because they are more often in the public eye and have more clout (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1080569912471185">Carroll, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>An initial list of CSR-related headings was created based on the review of literature and a sample of 25 companies within the <italic>Fortune</italic> 500. During the data collection, if an additional CSR-related heading was on one of the 500 company websites, it was added to the list. CSR-related headings are often found under links labeled “Investors” or “Our Company.” On completing the review of all the companies, if a specific heading was used by less than 5% of the companies, the heading was not included in the findings. For the purpose of this study, these headings were deemed inconsequential. The outcome was a list of 11 headings that were tabulated to answer the following research question.</p>

<p>Besides analyzing the data for all the companies as a whole, companies were divided into industry categories in order to discern if headings vary by type of industry. Prior research indicates that companies in varied industries sometimes behave differently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1080569912471185">King &amp; Lenox, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1080569912471185">Klassen &amp; Whybark, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1080569912471185">Lichtenstein, Drumwright, &amp; Braig, 2004</xref>).

<title>Findings</title>
<p>The number of <italic>Fortune</italic> 500 companies that refer to CSR issues on their websites has increased. A 1998 sample of <italic>Fortune</italic> 500 companies revealed that 82% of the company websites made reference to a CSR issue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1080569912471185">Esrock &amp; Leichty, 1998</xref>). In 2006, the percentage of <italic>Fortune</italic> 500 companies with CSR programs was nearly 90% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1080569912471185">Kotler &amp; Lee, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1080569912471185">Lichtenstein et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1080569912471185">Luo &amp; Bhattacharya, 2006</xref>). Today, based on this study, 98% of <italic>Fortune</italic> 500 companies make reference to CSR issues on their websites. Below are the findings for the specific research questions posed in this article.</p>

<list-item><p><italic>Research Question 1</italic>: What are the most common headings used on <italic>Fortune</italic> 500 company websites to convey information regarding CSR?</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Research findings revealed that certain CSR-related headings are being used much more than others. There are two headings currently found on the vast majority of <italic>Fortune</italic> 500 company websites: “Community” and “Environment.” Approximately 83% of the companies use “Community” on their website. A close second is “Environment,” being used by approximately 80% of the companies. An interesting note about these two dominant headings is that “Community” explicitly relates to people and “Environment” explicitly relates to the planet. Thus, the two prevailing social issues, people and planet, are covered under these two headings.</p>
<p>Instead of a singular heading being the next in line for usage, there is a distinct second tier of headings, as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1080569912471185">Table 1</xref>. The percentage of companies using each of the following headings ranged between 62% and 59%. Thus, more than half of company websites contained these headings:</p>

<p>These headings identify distinct company actions or policies. Three of the headings deal explicitly with either people or the planet. Only the heading “Ethics” is used in a broad sense applying to multiple issues.</p>
<p>There is a sharp drop in usage for the remaining headings. Slightly more than a third of the company websites contained the heading “Corporate Responsibility.” Approximately one fourth of the companies used the heading “Employee Compensation” as a heading on their website. Less than 20% of the companies use the following headings: Sourcing, Citizenship, and Green. These are generally more ambiguous headings. Citizenship includes both corporate and global citizenship. As for the heading “Green,” the word green may have been just a part of the heading, such as SmartGreen. Other headings, such as “Eco-Friendly,” were not included in the study because they were used by less than 5% of companies.</p>
<list id="list6-1080569912471185" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Research Question 2</italic>: Do manufacturing, retailing, and service companies use different CSR-related headings on their websites?</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Findings reveal that the usage of CSR-related headings will vary by industry. Of the three industry categories, <italic>Fortune</italic> 500 manufacturing companies use CSR-related headings more than do retailers or service companies. As to which headings are preferred by the three industries, the answer is mixed. The top two most commonly used headings are the same for each industry. After that, the industries differ on their usage of specific headings.</p>
<sec id="section10-1080569912471185">
<title>Manufacturing Companies</title>
<p>As might be expected, manufacturing companies overwhelmingly use the heading “Environment.” With consumers and investors being concerned over manufacturing processes and waste disposal, 94% of manufacturers have space devoted to environmental issues. Interestingly, 88% of manufacturers also have a “Community” heading on their websites. These two headings prove to be very important for company communication with stakeholders. Along these lines, almost 79% of the manufacturers have a “Sustainability” heading on their website.</p>
<p>Manufacturers also have headings for issues of special interest to employees. More than 77% of manufacturers’ websites contain the heading “Health and Wellness.” “Diversity” and “Ethics” are headings on 66% of the websites. Almost half of the websites include “Corporate Responsibility.” As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1080569912471185">Table 2</xref>, the remaining headings are used much less frequently. In summary, the top six headings found on more than two thirds or more of the manufacturing company websites are (in order): environment, community, sustainability, health and wellness, ethics, and diversity. This heavy usage of CSR-related headings suggests that manufacturing companies are exceptionally concerned with issues related to people and the environment. <italic>T</italic> tests reveal a significant overall difference between manufacturing and retail companies (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .01) and between manufacturing and service companies (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .01). There was no significant overall difference between retail companies and service companies.</p>

<title>Retail Companies</title>
<p>“Community” and “Environment” are the most common headings found on retailers’ websites as well. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1080569912471185">Table 2</xref>, these two headings were virtually tied for being used most often in websites of <italic>Fortune</italic> 500 retailers. Although approximately 70% of retailers use Community and Environment, that is a lower percentage than manufacturers or service companies using the terms. The unique finding concerning retailers is that “Ethics” jumped up to be the third most common heading, contained in 64% of the websites. Employee theft is a major problem among retailers, so this topic may have a special emphasis for employees. About half of retailer websites included the headings of “Health and Wellness” and “Diversity.” These are issues of interest to employees. In speaking more to consumers and stockholders, a “Sustainability” heading is included in 45% of the websites.</p>
<p>The headings that are more commonly found on retail websites, compared with other industry categories, are “Employee Compensation” and “Sourcing.” Here again indicating a focus on employees. In summary, the top three headings found on approximately two thirds or more of the <italic>Fortune</italic> 500 retail websites are (in order): community, environment, and ethics.</p>

<p>Like manufacturers and retailers, the most popular headings for service companies are “Community” and “Environment.” As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1080569912471185">Table 2</xref>, the heading “Community” is used by 85% of companies, whereas “Environment” is used by 75% of companies. <italic>Fortune</italic> 500 service companies do not use as many CSR-related headings as manufacturing companies, but they use more than the retailers do. The unique aspect about the service companies is that “Diversity” rose to third place, appearing on 61% of the company websites. Since service companies are labor intensive, this heading would seem appropriate for their employees. Approximately half of the companies use the headings “Health and Wellness,” “Sustainability,” and “Ethics.” In summary, the top three headings found on approximately two thirds or more of the <italic>Fortune</italic> 500 retail websites are (in order): community, environment, and diversity.</p>

<title>Summary and Future Research</title>
<p>Communication CSR initiatives have been an issue of concern for many years. CSR has evolved to encompass multiple goals beyond profit maximization, from taking care of your work force, to improving the community and the environment. Multiple terms have evolved to articulate the many topics related to CSR. All the <italic>Fortune</italic> 500 company websites were reviewed to determine which terms are most commonly used as headings for communication related to the company’s CSR initiatives.</p>
<p>The terms <italic>Community</italic> and <italic>Environment</italic> were found to clearly be the most popular headings on company websites. These two headings were found to be the most popular in each of three industry categories: manufacturing, retailing, and service. Variation among the industries was found when ranking the usage of the remaining CSR-related headings. Manufacturers extensively use the headings “Sustainability” and “Health and wellness” on their company websites. Many of the other CSR-related headings are also found more regularly on websites in this industry. Retailers are also prone to use the headings “Ethics” and “Employee Compensation.” Service companies are inclined to use the heading “Diversity.”</p>
<p>This article reports on what headings are being used on company websites. The simple reason for why these specific headings are being used is that management believes that they effectively communicate what companies are doing CSR-wise. However, beyond this simple reason, to know exactly why these headings are used would require a survey of company management’s thinking. A future research study could survey company managers to obtain a greater understanding of how these headings are perceived by company management. Results of such a study could address questions such as: Where is management getting its information and why are they choosing specific headings for their corporate websites? If the company uses Web analytic software, the survey could also acquire information regarding the number of page views each of the CSR-related headings have received during a specified time period.</p>

<sec id="section14-1080569912471185">
<title>Benefits of Successfully Communicating CRS Initiatives</title>
<p>In its <italic>2002 Sustainability Survey Report</italic>, PricewaterhouseCoopers provides some of the top reasons for being socially responsible. Companies practicing CSR can benefit from the following: having a competitive advantage, enhanced reputation, cost savings, and meeting customer demand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1080569912471185">PricewaterhouseCoopers, 2002</xref>). Other research has found that a company practicing social responsibility may benefit from increased customer loyalty, enhanced community support, fewer regulatory problems, and greater employee satisfaction that may lead to improved productivity or retention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1080569912471185">Carroll, 2010</xref>). With these potential benefits in mind, management would be wise to effectively communicate the CSR policies and activities of the company.</p>
<p>The purpose of this article was to gain a better understanding of the CSR-related headings that are currently being used on corporate websites. Our findings can be used to teach and/or implement CSR-related terminology that can potentially improve the communication process. Many consumers are unaware of the fact that most companies today engage in some type of activity that helps people or the environment. This study can help companies identify headings used to communicate its CSR-related activities and policies with consumers, employees, investors, and other stakeholders. Business culture can influence language choices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1080569912471185">Levin &amp; Behrens, 2003</xref>). By knowing what headings are currently being used by major companies, management can catch a glimpse of the terminology people are being exposed to. Manufacturers, retailers, and service firms can see what their peers are communicating on their websites. Successful communication is facilitated by using headings that are recognized by your audience. Businesses can better leverage their CSR initiatives if company actions and policies are communicated using terminology that people are familiar with.</p>
<p>This study can also help educators prepare their students to effectively communicate the CSR-related activities of their future employers. Students can be equipped to create website communication with terminology that is commonly used in today’s marketplace. Using the appropriate CSR-related language can be an asset when developing any form of communication with consumers, employees, and company stakeholders.</p>
