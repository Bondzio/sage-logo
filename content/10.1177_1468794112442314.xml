<p>Arch G. Woodside offers a very detailed and comprehensive approach to conducting case study research in this textbook for qualitative researchers. From theory building and research design through to execution and evaluation, all facets of the case study research method are scrutinized, highlighting both strengths and weaknesses of this chosen path to investigate and analyse a contemporary phenomenon within its <italic>real life</italic> business context. The reader is encouraged to ‘go deep’ into the field of research, and certainly, the process to embark upon such a mission is provided. The meticulous attention to detail in terms of the process steps—conceptually and analytically—of doing case study research leaves the reader with a sense of witnessing a master class. All the key principles of conducting such a study are noted, and a road map is provided that accounts for all possible distractions, diversions, and pitfalls that may befall the researcher intent on following this method of investigation. Guidelines, flowcharts, diagrams, templates, and all possible visual communication tools that a researcher may require, and most often search for in order to complete the journey, are proposed. Various accounts, experiences, case studies, and up-to-date research examples are drawn together to help steer both the uninitiated researcher and the experienced practitioner. Albeit examples for Industrial Marketing and Business-to-Business are mostly North American and hence there is a lack of geographical coverage, the sheer volume of examples cited highlights the insights and knowledge that may be garnered from adopting this method of research. Indeed, if there was any doubt of the rationale or validity of conducting case study research, then this is the source book to convince otherwise.</p>
<p>However, the microscopic level of detail, and often the scientific description, of the research process suggests that this textbook is not for the fainthearted. Depending on the research ambition and depth of inquiry envisaged by business researchers, organizational psychologists and social scientists, the prescriptive nature of the book may, at times, appear a little daunting. Nevertheless, the advice for both students and scholars alike is to view this textbook as a key guide that can be used both selectively, chapter by chapter, and as an ongoing point of reference and support. In this regard, the chapter on participant observation research in organizational behavior is a gift to those researchers wishing to investigate the rationale behind organizational decision making and unravel the complexities and social constructs that underpin relationships between buyers and suppliers. For those researchers keen to understand the buyer–seller relationship a little more deeply, and the social values and norms associated with that relationship, there is a chapter that describes the steps to evaluate personal exchanges, social behavior, conversation analysis, and face-to-face talk. Other chapters explore how to make sense of qualitative data through the application of quantitative frameworks, for instance, degrees of freedom, the use of system dynamics modeling, and the development of hypotheses to test dependencies between variables in relationships. Indeed, all bases are covered in terms of demonstrating how case study research can be developed and can contribute to the body of knowledge in business marketing. Hence, this textbook offers a range and depth of tools and techniques to meet the needs of a broad community of qualitative researchers, including students, scholars, and business practitioners, both in the sense of theory building and application. And while it may be claimed that a fairly expansive literature exists on case study research methods in the social sciences, this book makes a definitive contribution for those researchers interested in organizational behavior and whose drive to contextualize and interpret such actions leads to evermore varied and detailed research studies in the world of business.</p>
