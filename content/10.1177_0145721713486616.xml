<title>CinSulin</title>
<graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="10.1177_0145721713486616-img1.tif"/>
<p>CinSulin® water extract of cinnamon is a natural and clinically studied ingredient for managing blood sugar levels.<sup>+</sup>* CinSulin uses a patented water extraction process to gently concentrate the beneficial water-soluble components in the plant and largely remove the unwanted fat-soluble components. The end result is the safest cinnamon extract on the market, with a concentration ratio of 10:1 compared with common cinnamon. This means you’d have to take ten 500-mg common cinnamon capsules to get the same benefits of two 250-mg CinSulin capsules. CinSulin has 5 human clinical studies and a meta-analysis validating its ability to lower fasting blood sugar by as much as 10% and increase insulin sensitivity.<sup>+</sup>* Available in 3 formulas—One Per Day, Advanced Strength, and Healthy Weight. Visit <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cinsulin.com">www.cinsulin.com</ext-link> for more information and a list of retail stores carrying CinSulin.</p>
