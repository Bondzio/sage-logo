<abstract>
<p>We modify Berry et al.’s congressional-delegation-based measure of state government ideology to construct a new measure—which we call the state-legislative-based state government ideology measure—by relying on Shor and McCarty’s National Political Awareness Test common space estimates of the ideal points of U.S. state legislators. We conduct tests of convergent and construct validity for the two measures. We find that they correlate highly in each year for which the state-legislative-based indicator is available (1995–2008), and when observations are pooled across all years. We also replicate numerous published studies assessing the impact of state government ideology using each indicator of ideology and find that the two measures nearly always yield similar conclusions about the effect of government ideology. Because the state-legislative-based measure is based on more direct estimates of the ideal points of state legislators than is the congressional-delegation-based measure—which uses estimates of ideal points for members of Congress from the same state as a proxy—we believe the state-legislative-based measure is superior, and we recommend that scholars use it when it is available for the state-years being studied. Because our empirical evidence indicates that Berry et al.’s congressional-delegation-based measure is also valid—and it is available for a much longer period (annually beginning in 1960)—we advise that it be used when the state-legislative-based measure is not available.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1532440012464877">William Berry et al.’s (1998)</xref> indicator of <italic>state government ideology</italic>, observed annually for all states beginning in 1960, has been used widely in research.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1532440012464877">1</xref></sup> Berry et al. conceive of state government ideology as the ideological “center of gravity” of a state’s elected governmental institutions on a liberal-conservative continuum.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1532440012464877">2</xref></sup> Specifically, they define state government ideology as the weighted average of the ideological position of each of five institutional actors—(1) the Democratic delegation in the state house, (2) the Republican delegation in the state house, (3) the Democratic delegation in the state senate, (4) the Republican delegation in the state senate, and (5) the governor—where the ideological position of a legislative party delegation is defined as the central tendency of the ideal point of its members. Lacking data about the ideal points of state-elected officials comparable across states and time, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1532440012464877">Berry et al. (1998)</xref> estimate the ideological position of the five institutional actors by assuming that in each year, the mean position of each party delegation in a state legislative chamber and the position of each governor equal the mean position of the state’s congressional delegation from the same party, as measured by interest group (Americans for Democratic Action [ADA] and AFL-CIO Committee on Political Education [COPE]) ratings.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1532440012464877">William Berry et al. (2010)</xref> modify the original (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1532440012464877">1998</xref>) state government ideology indicator by using <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1532440012464877">Poole’s (1998)</xref> first-dimension NOMINATE common space coordinates for members of Congress instead of ADA/COPE interest group ratings to estimate the position of the five institutional actors. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1532440012464877">Berry et al. (2010</xref>, 117) argue that the resulting NOMINATE measure of state government ideology is “marginally superior” to the original ADA/COPE measure of state government ideology both on conceptual grounds and based on empirical tests of construct validity.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1532440012464877">3</xref></sup> Nevertheless, the NOMINATE measure also relies on information about the ideal points of members of Congress rather than those of state legislators and governors. The indicator undoubtedly could be improved if more direct estimates of the ideological positions of state institutional actors could be employed.</p>
<p>Shor, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1532440012464877">Christopher Berry, and McCarty (2010)</xref> take an important step toward facilitating this objective. These scholars estimate the ideal points of American state legislators by using roll call data for several types of “bridge actors,” including state legislators who were later elected to Congress. However, the utility of the resulting ideal point estimates—which we call <italic>bridge-based common space scores</italic>—in constructing a better measure of state government ideology is limited by the fact that scores are available for only 11 states over a nine-year period. Fortunately, a recent article by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1532440012464877">Shor and McCarty (2011)</xref> employs an alternative methodology to produce estimates of ideal points for state legislators that are available for nearly all states in at least some years. These estimates—which we call <italic>NPAT common space scores</italic>—are constructed using data from Project Votesmart’s National Political Awareness Test (NPAT) survey of state and federal legislative candidates, along with congressional and state legislative roll call voting data.</p>
<p>We take advantage of Shor and McCarty’s contribution by constructing—for each state-year for which NPAT common space scores are available—a state government ideology indicator identical to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1532440012464877">Berry et al.’s 2010</xref> NOMINATE government ideology indicator except that it substitutes median NPAT common space scores within party delegations in state legislative chambers for mean NOMINATE scores within party delegations in Congress when computing ideology scores for the five institutional actors. We call the new state government ideology measure computed from NPAT common space scores the <italic>state-legislative-based state government ideology indicator</italic>; in contrast, we call <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1532440012464877">Berry et al.’s (2010)</xref> NOMINATE measure of state government ideology the <italic>congressional-delegation-based state government ideology indicator</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-1532440012464877">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although we view NPAT common space scores as the best estimates to date of state legislators’ ideal points, these scores are not perfect; they are estimated from survey responses and roll call data, and undoubtedly contain some measurement error.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-1532440012464877">5</xref></sup> Thus, the validity of the state-legislative-based state government ideology indicator is not assured, and must be established. In a classic paper from the psychometrics literature, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1532440012464877">Campbell and Fiske (1959</xref>, 83) appropriately conceive of validity “as the agreement between two attempts to measure the same [concept] through . . . different methods.” Because the state-legislative-based and congressional-delegation-based state government ideology indicators rely on far different methodologies for estimating the ideological positions of state legislative party delegations, we can test the <italic>convergent</italic> validity of the new state-legislative-based state government ideology measure—and provide a new test of the validity of the extant congressional-delegation-based state government ideology measure—by determining the extent of agreement between scores on the two measures. Indeed, we find that scores on the two indicators of state government ideology correlate quite highly. We also find evidence of <italic>construct</italic> validity; across a variety of econometric models in which state government ideology is an independent variable and an aspect of state policy is the dependent variable, a model employing the congressional-delegation-based government ideology indicator tends to yield a similar conclusion about the effect of ideology as a model employing the state-legislative-based measure. These results suggest that both the state-legislative-based and congressional-delegation-based measures of government ideology are valid indicators of their shared underlying concept. We recommend that state politics scholars use the state-legislative-based measure of state government ideology whenever this indicator is available for the state-years being analyzed, and use the congressional-delegation-based measure—which is observed for all states over a much longer time period—when the state-legislative-based measure is unavailable.</p>

<title>The Validity of the State-Legislative-Based and Congressional-Delegation-Based State Government Ideology Indicators</title>

The congressional-delegation-based measure is based on first-dimension NOMINATE common space coordinates derived from roll call votes by members of the Congress. The state-legislative-based state government ideology indicator too takes into account roll call votes by members of the Congress, but it also relies on roll call votes by state legislators, and NPAT survey responses by both state legislators and members of the Congress.</p>
<p>The fact that the state-legislative-based and congressional-delegation-based state government ideology indicators rely on quite different information to measure the ideology scores of institutional actors allows us to assess the validity of the two indicators by conceiving of validity—as do <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1532440012464877">Campbell and Fiske (1959</xref>, 83)—“as the agreement between two attempts to measure the same [concept] through . . . different methods,” and determining the extent of agreement between the two indicators. In particular, we assess the <italic>convergent</italic> validity of the two measures by examining the correlation between them. We also conduct a number of tests of <italic>construct</italic> validity by determining whether the two measures yield similar conclusions about the impact of state government ideology on state public policy in a variety of econometric models.</p>

<title>Convergent Validity: The Correlation between the State-Legislative-Based and Congressional-Delegation- Based State Government Ideology Indicators</title>
<p>The state-legislative-based state government ideology indicator is available for 587 state-years during the 1995–2008 period, and the congressional-delegation-based measure is also available for each of these state-years. Because virtually all studies using the congressional-delegation-based measure of state government ideology either are cross-sectional or pool cross-sections over a period of years, we compare scores on the two measures in both these observational domains. For each year between 1995 and 2008, the cross-sectional correlation between the state-legislative-based and congressional-delegation-based government ideology indicators is between 0.76 and 0.89, averaging 0.81 across the 14 years. (Complete year-by-year results can be found in column 2 of Table S-1 in our unpublished supplement.) Pooling observations across all 587 state-years, the correlation between the state-legislative-based measure and the congressional-delegation-based measure is 0.81.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-1532440012464877">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>However, state politics scholars often estimate a fixed-effects model—with dummy variables for the states—when doing pooled cross-sectional time-series analysis. This approach makes it so that parameter estimates for all but the state dummy variables are based solely on variation <italic>within</italic> states. The overall pooled correlation between the state-legislative-based and congressional-delegation-based measures of government ideology—while large (at 0.81)—does not necessarily imply a high probability that the two measures of government ideology will yield the same conclusion about the effect of ideology when this effect is estimated using a fixed-effects model; it is possible that when cross-sectional variation is eliminated from the picture by including a set of state dummy variables, the close correspondence between the two measures would disappear. To investigate this possibility, we recompute the correlation between the two measures of state government ideology <italic>after scores on both measures are transformed to deviations from their within-state mean</italic>. The correlation remains very strong—at 0.85. Summarizing the results of this section, in the domains in which research is typically performed—either cross-sectional or pooled cross-sectional time-series analysis—the two indicators of state government ideology share much variation.</p>

<title>Construct Validity: Do the State-Legislative-Based and Congressional-Delegation-Based State Government Ideology Indicators Yield Similar Conclusions in the Research Setting?</title>
<p>The strong correlation between the state-legislative-based and congressional-delegation-based state government ideology indicators suggests that the two measures—when used in empirical research—are likely to yield similar conclusions about the impact of government ideology on state public policies. But it would be valuable to see whether this actually occurs in the research setting. Obviously, we cannot observe the implications of using one measure rather than the other in the full “population” of all past and future studies of the impact of state government ideology. However, we can observe these consequences in a large, reasonably representative sample from the population of past studies employing the congressional-delegation-based measure by replicating these studies, substituting the state-legislative-based measure of state government ideology for the congressional-delegation-based measure.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-1532440012464877">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>To maximize the probability that our sample of studies for replication is representative of previous published work, we undertook the following steps:</p>

<list-item><p>Because the state-legislative-based state government ideology measure is available for at least 30 states only for years during the period 1996–2008, we retained in our sample only those studies doing (1) cross-sectional analysis for a year between 1996 and 2008; (2) pooled cross-sectional time-series analysis for years, all of which are between 1996 and 2008 (regardless of the number of years analyzed); or (3) pooled cross-sectional time-series analysis over a set of years containing at least four during the period 1996–2008.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-1532440012464877">12</xref></sup> (Due to the limited number of state-years for which the state-legislative-based indicator is available, this step reduced the pool of eligible studies dramatically.)</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>We searched the internet for replication data for each study in this sample. If we were unsuccessful, we emailed the author and requested replication data.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>For each study in the sample for which we were able to obtain data, we sought to replicate the published results for each model that included state government ideology as an independent variable. If we were unsuccessful for any model, it was eliminated from our sample.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>This left us with 26 econometric models from seven different articles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1532440012464877">Avery and Peffley 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1532440012464877">Martin and Dixon 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1532440012464877">Provost 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1532440012464877">Soss, Fording and Schram 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1532440012464877">Witko 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1532440012464877">Witko and Newmark 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1532440012464877">2010</xref>): 10 models estimated using cross-sectional data, and 16 estimated with pooled cross-sectional time-series data.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-1532440012464877">13</xref></sup></p>
<p>Using all observations for which the state-legislative-based government ideology indicator is available, we estimate each of the 26 models twice—once using the state-legislative-based measure, and once using the congressional-delegation-based measure.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn14-1532440012464877">14</xref></sup> As the two indicators have different scales, to facilitate a comparison of results, “X-standardized” coefficients for the ideology measure are computed.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn15-1532440012464877">15</xref></sup> One criterion for determining the similarity of results across measures is whether the congressional-delegation-based and state-legislative-based measures yield the same conclusion about whether the effect of state government ideology is statistically significant at the .05 level. We summarize our results below (Table S-3 in our unpublished supplement presents critical details, and Appendix S-5 in the supplement contains complete statistical results for all models estimated).</p>
<p>For 22 of the 26 models, the analysis using the congressional-delegation-based measure yields the same conclusion about whether the effect of government ideology is statistically significant at the .05 level as the analysis employing the state-legislative-based measure. For three other models (see rows 1, 6, and 23 of Table S-3), the estimated effect of government ideology is significant at the .05 level for one measure and at the .10 level with the other indicator. Results about statistical significance diverge substantially for only one model (see row 17); with it, the <italic>t</italic>-ratio for the state-legislative-based measure is 0.48, while that for the congressional-delegation-based measure is 2.05.</p>
<p>Of course, estimated effects can be statistically significant without being <italic>substantively</italic> significant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1532440012464877">Achen 1982</xref>, 41–51). Thus, we seek to evaluate whether the state-legislative-based and congressional-delegation-based measures yield similar conclusions about the substantive importance of the effect of government ideology. This is difficult to assess for any model without undertaking a careful analysis of the metric for the dependent variable, and the variances of variables within the estimation sample. Moreover, a comparison of estimated effect magnitudes is complicated by the fact that the two ideology measures are on different scales. Nevertheless, for any replicated model, we can compare the magnitudes of X-standardized coefficients across the two measures of state government ideology. For each of the twelve models in which the effect of the state-legislative-based government ideology measure is statistically significant at the .10 level, we calculate a value—the <italic>deviation magnitude—</italic>that reflects the extent to which the coefficient for the congressional-delegation-based measure deviates from the coefficient for the state-legislative-based measure:</p>

<p>where b<sub>STATE-LEG</sub> is the coefficient for the state-legislative-based state government ideology indicator, and b<sub>CONG-DEL</sub> is the coefficient for the congressional-delegation-based measure.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-1532440012464877">16</xref></sup> The mean deviation magnitude across the 12 models analyzed is 0.30, indicating that, on average, the coefficient for the congressional-delegation-based ideology measure differs from that for the state-legislative-based measure by 30% (see column 10 of Table S-3). This is certainly a nontrivial difference. Yet, we believe that combined with the nearly uniform agreement across the two measures about whether the effect of state government ideology is statistically significant, the mean deviation magnitude of 0.30 suggests a low likelihood that researchers would come to a fundamentally different inference about the effect of government ideology depending on which measure they employed—and indicates that the measures have strong construct validity.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-1532440012464877">17</xref></sup></p>
<p>The evidence of construct validity reported thus far is based on a diverse, but unsystematically varying, set of dependent variables and observational domains. It would also be useful to investigate the construct validity of the state-legislative-based and congressional-delegation-based measures of state government ideology in a context in which the periods analyzed could be systematically adjusted so that we can observe whether the construct validity of the measures is domain bound. Accordingly, we estimate an illustrative OLS regression model in which the dependent variable is a state’s Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) benefit for a four-person family. The independent variables are a measure of state government ideology (either the state-legislative-based or congressional-delegation-based measure), and three “control” variables: per capita personal income, the unemployment rate, and the poverty rate. We estimate this model cross-sectionally for each of the 13 years for which the state-legislative-based government ideology measure is observed (1996–2008). We also estimate the model pooling observations across all possible four-year periods (i.e., 1996–99, 1997–2000, . . . , 2005–08) and seven-year periods (i.e., 1996–2002, 1997–2003, . . . , 2002–08), and the full 13-year period. Pooled models are estimated alternately (1) with no dummy variables for either states or years, (2) including a set of state dummies, and (3) including a set of year dummies. This gives us 50 different regression models, each estimated using each measure of government ideology. Detailed results are presented in Table S-4 in our unpublished supplement.</p>
<p>Only 4 of the 50 models (i.e., 8%) produce a different result about whether the estimated effect of government ideology is statistically significant at the .05 level depending on which measure of ideology is used. In two of these cases, both coefficients are significant at the .10 level, but only one is significant at .05; in the other two—pooled analysis using state dummies over the periods 2005–08 and 2004–07—the difference in <italic>t</italic>-ratios is substantial (2.11 vs. 0.21, and 3.03 vs. 0.69).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-1532440012464877">18</xref></sup> Across the 24 models in which the effect of the state-legislative-based government ideology measure is statistically significant at the .05 level, the average deviation magnitude (calculated according to <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula4-1532440012464877">Equation 4</xref>) is 0.40, a value similar to the average deviation magnitude of 0.30 calculated earlier. The analysis of the welfare model suggests that the construct validity of the state-legislative-based and congressional-delegation-based state government ideology indicators is high in both cross-sectional and pooled cross-sectional time-series contexts.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-1532440012464877">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>A possible objection to our tests of convergent validity is that although the two measures of state government ideology being compared differ substantially in their methodology for estimating the five institutional actor ideological position variables in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula1-1532440012464877">Equation 1</xref> (i.e., <italic>ideol:dem_house<sub>i,t</sub></italic>, <italic>ideol:rep_house<sub>i,t</sub></italic>, <italic>ideol:dem_senate<sub>i,t</sub></italic>, <italic>ideol:rep_senate<sub>i,t</sub></italic>, and <italic>governor’s ideology<sub>i,t</sub></italic>), the two measures have other elements in common that virtually guarantee that the measures have a positive correlation. In particular, they make identical assumptions—inherent in the conceptual definition of <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula1-1532440012464877">Equation 1</xref>—about the values of the four “power share” variables (<italic>power:dem_house<sub>i,t</sub></italic>, <italic>power:rep_house<sub>i,t</sub></italic>, <italic>power:dem_senate<sub>i,t</sub></italic>, and <italic>power:rep_senate<sub>i,t</sub></italic>) and the three constants (0.25, 0.25, and 0.50) reflecting the relative power of the governor and the two chambers of the legislature. We contend that these assumptions about the relative power of institutional actors inherent in the conceptual definition of <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula1-1532440012464877">Equation 1</xref> are irrelevant to the validity of any measure of the concept. If the actual distribution of power among institutional actors is at variance with the distribution assumed by <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula1-1532440012464877">Equations 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula2-1532440012464877">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula3-1532440012464877">3</xref>, this would imply that the concept defined in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula1-1532440012464877">Equation 1</xref> lacks utility, not that the state-legislative-based and congressional-delegation-based measures of the concept are invalid.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, we repeat for the new state-legislative-based measure of state government ideology some sensitivity analysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1532440012464877">Berry et al. (1998)</xref> conducted when they introduced the ADA/COPE measure of state government ideology. In particular, we compute a version of the state-legislative-based measure of government ideology in which the constants 0.25, 0.25, and 0.50 are replaced by 1/3, 1/3, and 1/3—implying that in each state, the house, the senate, and the governor share power equally. The correlation between this alternative measure of ideology and the state-legislative-based measure of state government ideology across all cases for which the measures are available is 0.99. We also construct nine alternative measures of state ideology—each using a different function to map party seat shares into power shares when computing the four power share variables—to create 10 measures overall.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-1532440012464877">20</xref></sup> The correlation matrix showing the relationships among the 10 measures has an entry above 0.98 in each cell. These tests demonstrate that the state-legislative-based measure of state government ideology is robust to nontrivial changes in the specific assumptions inherent in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula1-1532440012464877">Equation 1</xref> about the distribution of power between the governor and the two houses of the legislature, and between parties within the two houses.</p>

<p>Taken literally, this conclusion about “Berry measures” characterizes as invalid a variable that has never been employed in published research, as (to our knowledge) scholars using <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1532440012464877">Berry et al.’s (1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1532440012464877">2010</xref>) data have uniformly employed a measure of <italic>state government</italic> ideology (the [NOMINATE] congressional-delegation-based government ideology indicator, or its predecessor, the ADA/COPE measure) rather than a single component reflecting <italic>house ideology</italic> or <italic>senate ideology</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-1532440012464877">21</xref></sup> Yet, Shor and McCarty’s results about the weak longitudinal relationship between NPAT common space chamber medians and Berry chamber scores in some states can be viewed as evidence of weak convergent validity in a longitudinal domain for indicators of <italic>house ideology</italic> or <italic>senate ideology</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-1532440012464877">22</xref></sup> For this reason, we would be reluctant to use either Berry chamber scores or NPAT common space chamber medians as measures of <italic>house ideology</italic> or <italic>senate ideology</italic> in single-state longitudinal research.</p>
<p>If <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1532440012464877">Shor and McCarty’s (2011)</xref> criticism of “Berry measures” as invalid is intended to extend beyond “Berry component scores” and include the congressional-delegation-based measure of state government ideology, the results reported in this paper confirm that this criticism would be unjustified. Undoubtedly, a strong correlation between Berry chamber scores and NPAT common space chamber medians would lend greater support for the validity of the congressional-delegation-based measure. But a close correspondence between these chamber-level variables is not a necessary condition for Berry et al.’s congressional-delegation-based government ideology indicator to be a satisfactory proxy for measuring <italic>state government</italic> ideology. The congressional-delegation-based measure of state government ideology is used extensively in cross-sectional and pooled cross-sectional time-series analysis, and we have seen that in these contexts, the congressional-delegation-based measure is strongly correlated with the state-legislative-based state government ideology measure.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-1532440012464877">23</xref></sup> Also, the congressional-delegation-based and state-legislative-based measures of state government ideology tend to yield similar conclusions about the impact of state government ideology when each is used as an independent variable in multivariate analysis.

<p>We saw earlier that when we pool all 587 state-years for which the state-legislative-based state government ideology indicator has been measured, the correlation between the congressional-delegation-based and state-legislative-based government ideology measures is 0.81. Over the same observations, the party-proportion measure of state government ideology correlated considerably more weakly (at 0.66) with the state-legislative-based measure. We also saw earlier that for each year between 1995 and 2008, the cross-sectional correlation between the congressional-delegation-based and state-legislative-based measures of state government ideology is between 0.76 and 0.89, and averages 0.81 across the 14 years. Using the same observations, the cross-sectional correlation between the party-proportion measure and the state-legislative-based measure is weaker—ranging across the 14 years between 0.62 and 0.76, and averaging 0.68. (Year-by-year results can be found in column 3 of Table S-1 in our unpublished supplement.)</p>
<p>We also return to the 26 models from the literature involving state government ideology as an independent variable that we discussed earlier. We reported that for 23 of the 26 models, the analysis using the congressional-delegation-based measure yields the same conclusion about whether the effect of government ideology is statistically significant at the .05 level as the analysis employing the state-legislative-based measure. When one uses the party-proportion measure of government ideology, one is much more likely to obtain a conclusion that diverges from that derived using the state-legislative-based measure. These two measures yield the same conclusion about whether the effect of government ideology is statistically significant at the .05 level for only 13 of the 26 models (detailed results are in Table S-3 in our unpublished supplement.)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-1532440012464877">24</xref></sup> Thus, we find strong empirical evidence that the congressional-delegation-based measure of state government ideology is substantially more likely than the party-proportion measure to yield results similar to what would be obtained if the state-legislative-based measure of government ideology were employed.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-1532440012464877">25</xref></sup> This indicates that scholars who are convinced that that the state-legislative-based measure is valid would be making a mistake if they used the party-proportion measure rather than the congressional-delegation-based measure when the state-legislative-based measure is not available for the state-years being analyzed.</p>

<title>Conclusion and Recommendations</title>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1532440012464877">Shor and McCarty (2011)</xref> use Project Votesmart’s NPAT survey of state and federal legislative candidates, and congressional and state legislative roll call voting data to generate estimates of ideal points for state legislators. These ideal point estimates allow us to construct a new measure of state government ideology—the <italic>state-legislative-based state government ideology indicator</italic>—that we believe is superior to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1532440012464877">Berry et al.’s (2010)</xref> congressional-delegation-based measure of government ideology. We recommend that state politics scholars use the state-legislative-based indicator to measure state government ideology in future research whenever feasible.</p>
<p>However, tests of both <italic>convergent</italic> validity and <italic>construct</italic> validity demonstrate that the congressional-delegation-based measure of state government ideology remains a good alternative when research involves state-years for which the state-legislative-based indicator is not available. We find that the congressional-delegation-based measure has a strong correlation with the state-legislative-based measure in each year for which the state-legislative-based measure is available, and when pooling these annual observations across years. Also, we replicate numerous published studies that use the congressional-delegation-based state government ideology indicator as an independent variable; we find that when the state-legislative-based indicator is substituted for the congressional-delegation-based measure, the conclusion about whether the effect of government ideology is statistically significant at the .05 level is almost always identical to that obtained when using the congressional-delegation-based indicator.</p>
<p>Hopefully, NPAT common space ideal points for state legislators will be updated regularly in the future, thereby permitting the updating of the state-legislative-based government ideology measure. As the number of studies using the state-legislative-based measure of state government ideology grows, the opportunity to compare results based on the two measures will expand. If such comparisons continue to show that findings based on the two measures are similar, this will help confirm the results of studies predating the state-legislative-based measure that have relied on the congressional-delegation-based indicator.</p>
<p>Even for those years for which the state-legislative-based government ideology measure is available (1995–2008), there is always at least one state—and sometimes many states—that are not observed (see column 1 of Table S-1). This may leave many researchers with the choice between using the state-legislative-based measure and dropping some observations, and retaining all observations and using the congressional-delegation-based measure. We recommend that researchers in this situation conduct sensitivity analysis by estimating their model both ways to see whether the conclusions about the effect of state government ideology are consistent. If they are, the issue about which measure to use is rendered moot. Indeed, given that neither the state-legislative-based measure of state government ideology nor the congressional-delegation-based measure is perfect, it would be reasonable practice for scholars to estimate any model for which the state-legislative-based measure is available for a substantial proportion of the observations using each of the two measures separately and assess whether the results about the effect of ideology are robust.</p>
<p>To conclude, we consider two possible concerns about the state-legislative-based and congressional-delegation-based government ideology measures. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1532440012464877">Shor and McCarty (2011</xref>, 531) claim that a “potential problem” of the congressional-delegation-based government ideology measure is that the scores it produces are “aggregates [that] . . . reveal little about heterogeneity, especially intra-party, within states.” This observation is undoubtedly correct, and it applies equally well to the state-legislative-based government ideology measure. We do not, however, view this as a weakness of the two government ideology indicators, because neither is intended to reveal information about intra-institutional variation in ideology. Rather, each is designed to reflect the ideological “center of gravity” of a state government’s elected institutions.</p>
<p>Probably the greatest source of measurement error in the state-legislative-based and congressional-delegation-based indicators of state government ideology is the component measuring the ideal point of the governor, which is assumed to be equal to the median or mean ideal point of legislators from the governor’s party. Assuming that the governor’s ideal point is at the center of his or her party’s legislative ideological distribution undoubtedly introduces measurement error, because sometimes a governor will have a more extreme ideology. It is tempting to try to “solve” this problem by simply excluding the governor from the institutions over which ideology is aggregated to produce the state government ideology measure, and constructing the measure based just on the four legislative institutions. This would involve excluding the term for <italic>governor ideology</italic> in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula1-1532440012464877">Equation 1</xref> when estimating <italic>state government ideology</italic>, and changing the weight for each of <italic>house ideology</italic> and <italic>senate ideology</italic> to 0.50:</p>

<p>However, because the concept being measured is the center of gravity of a state government’s elected institutions—which includes the governor—aggregating over only the four components that reflect legislative institutions is mathematically equivalent to assuming that the governor’s ideal point equals the average of estimated <italic>house ideology</italic> and estimated <italic>senate ideology</italic> (as in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula5-1532440012464877">Equation 5</xref>). This means that aggregating over just the four legislative components is equivalent to assuming that the governor’s ideal point is at the central tendency of ideology across legislators from <italic>both</italic> major political parties. This strikes us as an assumption likely to introduce even more measurement error than assuming that the governor’s ideology is at the central tendency of his or her own party.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-1532440012464877">26</xref></sup> When constructing a measure of state government ideology, the only good way to eliminate the error introduced by estimating gubernatorial ideology from information about legislators’ ideal points would be to construct a direct measure of a governor’s ideal point within the same space that state legislators are observed, so that there is no need to rely on a proxy based on legislators’ ideal points. We hope that “bridges” sufficient to achieve such a measure of a governor’s ideal point will eventually be developed.</p>

<p>Among <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1532440012464877">Shor and McCarty’s (2011)</xref> assumptions that are likely to introduce some measurement error into NPAT common space scores are that (1) the ideal point of each legislator is stable over time (even when a legislator moves from the state legislature to Congress), and (2) “the NPAT survey[s] tap into the same issue dimensions that divide legislators on roll call voting” (p. 535).

<p>Even the longitudinal correlation between the state-legislative-based and congressional-delegation-based measures is strong in the vast majority of states. In 43 of the 49 states for which the state-legislative-based measure is available (all states except Nebraska), the time-series correlation between the two measures is positive and statistically significant (.05 level; two-tail test). Across these 43 states (i.e., all non-Nebraska states except DE, ID, MA, NY, RI, and SD), the minimum correlation is 0.66, the maximum is 0.997, and the average is 0.89 (see Table S-2 in our unpublished supplement). Researchers have rarely, if ever, used the congressional-delegation-based measure of state government ideology in a single-state longitudinal study. Our results suggest that this practice—and the use of the state-legislative-based measure in within-state time-series analysis—should definitely be avoided, especially in the six states for which the two measures of ideology strongly diverge.</p>

<p>(1) We do not calculate a deviation magnitude for models in which the coefficient for the state-legislative-based ideology measure fails to be statistically significant because when the denominator of the ratio— b<sub>STATE-LEG</sub> —is small, the ratio could be large even when the numerator is of trivial magnitude. Moreover, in practice, few scholars interpret the substantive significance of statistically insignificant coefficients. We chose to calculate the deviation magnitude for models in which the estimated effect of the state-legislative-based government ideology measure is statistically significant at the .10 level (one-tail test)—rather than the more common .05 level (two-tail test)—to permit averaging over a larger sample of models. (2) We lack a way of determining the implications of any specific deviation magnitude. For example, we know that in one replicated model (see row 2 of Table S-3), the magnitude of the coefficient estimate (−2.13) for the congressional-delegation-based measure is 22% smaller than that for the state-legislative-based measure (−2.73). Do both of these coefficients indicate a substantively significant effect? Do both indicate a substantively trivial effect? Or does the state-legislative-based coefficient indicate substantive significance while the congressional-delegation-based coefficient does not? We would not be comfortable making this type of assessment for the various models we replicate.</p>

<p>We also employ a second strategy for comparing the magnitude of the estimated effect of government ideology across the two indicators that relies on the notion of an “effect size” in the literature on meta-analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1532440012464877">Cooper, Hedges, and Valentine 2010</xref>).

<p>Of course, our empirical evidence is confined to the period for which the state-legislative-based state government ideology indicator has been measured: 1996–2008.

As we have seen, the two measures of state government ideology rest on a number of shared assumptions: the weights (0.25, 0.25, and 0.50) in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula1-1532440012464877">Equation 1</xref>, and the values of the four “power share” variables (<italic>power:dem_house<sub>i,t</sub></italic>, <italic>power:rep_house<sub>i,t</sub></italic>, <italic>power:dem_senate<sub>i,t</sub></italic>, and <italic>power:rep_senate<sub>i,t</sub></italic>) in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula2-1532440012464877">Equations 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula3-1532440012464877">3</xref>. These shared assumptions undoubtedly contribute toward the close correspondence between the two measures of government ideology. Furthermore, to the extent that some of the error in measuring the ideological position of an institutional actor (<italic>ideol:dem_house<sub>i,t</sub></italic>, <italic>ideol:rep_house<sub>i,t</sub></italic>, <italic>ideol:dem_senate<sub>i,t</sub></italic>, <italic>ideol:rep_senate<sub>i,t</sub></italic>, or <italic>governor’s ideology<sub>i,t</sub></italic>) with NPAT common space scores or NOMINATE common space coordinates is random, some measurement error may dissipate when computing a weighted average of these positions to yield a measure of state government ideology.</p>

<p>If, instead, the <italic>concept</italic> of interest is the ideological center of gravity of a state’s <italic>legislature</italic> (i.e., [(0.50) <italic>house ideology<sub>i,t</sub></italic> + (0.50) <italic>senate ideology<sub>i,t</sub></italic>]), then excluding the governor’s ideology from the calculation would be appropriate. In this case, we would advocate using a modified state-legislative-based or congressional-delegation-based measure based strictly on the components of the measure that reflect legislative institutions.</p>
