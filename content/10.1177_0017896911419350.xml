<title>Aim:</title>
<p>To explore the diagnosis, treatment and referral patterns of chronic oro-facial pain patients by generalist primary care dentists (GDPs) in the UK.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0017896911419350">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>A cross-sectional survey was conducted using a non-stratified random sample of 500 GDPs who were selected from the General Dental Council register.

<title>Results:</title>
<p>Two hundred and twenty (44%) GDPs responded. The majority correctly diagnosed temporomandibular disorder (TMD; 88%) and burning mouth syndrome (BMS; 92%). There was more variation in the diagnosis of the other cases related to persistent oro-facial pain. For TMD there was a clear preference for treatment with occlusal splint therapy, and referral to a temporomandibular joint (TMJ) specialist.

<title>Conclusions:</title>
<p>The greater variation in responses to scenarios based on patients with chronic oro-facial pain may reflect the difficulty clinicians face in diagnosing and treating this condition. Management appears to follow a biomedical model and most clinicians chose to refer patients for treatment. There are few specialist services to cater for such referrals, indicating a need to train primary care practitioners in management of chronic COFP, along with the establishment of evidence-based guidelines.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>It is estimated that 7% of the population suffer from chronic oro-facial pain at any one point in time.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0017896911419350">1</xref></sup> There is currently debate as to the aetiology, classification, diagnosis and management of chronic oro-facial pain (COFP) and recent research has shown that the conditions comprising COFP (atypical odontalgia, atypical facial pain, temporomandibular joint disorder, and burning mouth syndrome) cluster together and that the sub-classification of COFP into these four syndromes is primarily based on the area of the face where symptoms occur, as opposed to each syndrome having its own distinct diagnostic variables.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0017896911419350">2</xref></sup> Some authors go on to suggest that the distinctions between the clinical presentations are artificial constructions, and related to the speciality of the health professional making the diagnosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0017896911419350">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0017896911419350">3</xref></sup> The lack of consensus regarding nomenclature and diagnostic criteria inevitably contributes to the potential difficulty clinicians have in diagnosing and managing COFP.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0017896911419350">4</xref></sup> The International Headache Society criteria suggest four diagnostic criteria for persistent idiopathic facial pain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0017896911419350">5</xref></sup> although these have been found to be inadequate as research showed that 29% of patients with facial pain did not fulfill The International Classification of Headache Disorders 2nd edition (ICHD-II) criteria, leaving their diagnoses uncertain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0017896911419350">6</xref></sup> There have therefore been suggestions to amend the criteria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0017896911419350">7</xref></sup> to aid early diagnosis as many clinicians currently diagnose COFP only when all other conditions have been excluded, and this often involves multiple consultations and expensive exploratory investigations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0017896911419350">8</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although there has been some research in this area looking at the opinions of United Kingdom (UK) specialists regarding atypical facial pain,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0017896911419350">9</xref></sup> and the knowledge of General Dental Practitioners (GDPs) regarding temporomandibular disorders in Sweden,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0017896911419350">10</xref></sup> there is no understanding of how and whether both specialist and GDPs vary in their diagnosis and management of the various COFP entities. This is an important area to understand as GDPs are commonly the first point of contact for patients with COFP and a rapid and accurate diagnosis is essential if each case is to be appropriately and efficiently managed. Even more confusion may arise when patients seek help from their medical practitioners who have minimal training in oral medicine and facial pain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0017896911419350">11</xref></sup> As onward referral for specialist care is a common outcome of initial diagnosis it is important to understand if there is a dissonance between generalists’ and specialists’ diagnoses.</p>
<p>Management of the condition is varied and operative interventions are often performed, despite evidence suggesting there is no appreciable benefit and in some cases the pain may be worsened by such interventions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0017896911419350">8</xref></sup> Specifically in the case of temporomandibular disorders, systematic reviews have revealed there is lack of good quality evidence on which to base management.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0017896911419350">12</xref></sup> The lack of evidence supporting occlusal adjustment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0017896911419350">13</xref></sup> suggests that treatments that involve permanently adjusting a patient’s occlusion should be avoided.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0017896911419350">14</xref></sup> In one qualitative study, a participant described management of TMD as a ‘black art’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0017896911419350">15</xref></sup></p>
<p>Psychological therapies may have a role in the management of COFP. Pain is ‘an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage or described in terms of such damage’.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0017896911419350">16</xref>, p. 209</sup> This definition suggests that pain has an emotional component, and indeed current theories of pain such as the biopsychosocial model recognize the role of psychological factors in facial pain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0017896911419350">17</xref></sup> Research suggests that appropriate psychological intervention can reduce the likelihood of transition from an acute episode of oro-facial pain to COFP.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0017896911419350">18</xref></sup> Psychological therapies can range from empathetic reassurance, to relaxation therapies, biofeedback, and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and the use of such therapies for COFP has been evaluated and shown to be effective.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0017896911419350">19</xref></sup></p>
<p>Although the evidence suggests that mechanical approaches may have limited or no effectiveness in the management of COFP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0017896911419350">20</xref></sup> and that psychological therapy may be of more benefit,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0017896911419350">19</xref></sup> the lack of clear evidence and ‘gold standard’ approach to the treatment of COFP means that it is likely that approaches to management will vary widely. If this is the case, it may be that some patients with COFP are receiving ineffective, and at worse potentially harmful treatment. It is important to know how primary care clinicians (GDPs) are currently providing care in order to inform the development of evidence-based guidelines in the management of the condition, and to help clinicians avoid inappropriate treatment. The aim of the current study was therefore to investigate the approach to diagnosis and management of chronic oro-facial pain by GDPs.</p>

<sec id="section6-0017896911419350" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>A postal self-complete questionnaire survey was conducted between April and August 2009 using a random sample of general dental practitioners (GDPs; <italic>n</italic> = 500) from the UK General Dental Council (GDC) 2008 register. The questionnaire consisted of four case scenarios adapted from recent literature on diagnosis and management of oro-facial pain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0017896911419350">4</xref></sup> and agreed upon following discussion with a reference panel of three GDPs, three specialists (oral medicine, oral surgery and TMD specialist backgrounds), and the author of the literature (JMZ). For each scenario three lists were devised: possible diagnoses; possible treatments; and a list of referral options. Participants were asked to select only one option from each list. The questionnaire was then piloted with both specialists and GDPs, and appropriate minor changes in wording and layout were made and the final content agreed (questionnaires available upon request). The questionnaire was mailed in three rounds with two weeks between each wave to maximize response rates. The National Research Ethics Service approved the study; Cheshire ethics committee approved the application on their behalf.</p>
<sec id="section7-0017896911419350">
<title>Analysis</title>
<p>Frequency distributions were used to describe the responses to each question. A non-response analysis was performed using a chi-squared test for linear trend to compare responses to each scenario in successive mailings with those in the third mailing wave being used as a proxy for non-responders. The only data available for true non-responders was their year of qualification and this was also used to assess non-response bias. SPSS Version 16.0 and STATA version 9 were used for data analysis and participant data was anonymized.</p>

<title>Response rates</title>
<p>In total 220 (44%) of questionnaires were returned from GDPs. Given the low response rates we conducted a non-response analysis as described earlier. There was no significant difference in the time since qualification between responders and non-responders. Overall, there were 12 ‘correct’ response items, three per scenario, each describing diagnosis, management and referral. A chi-square test for linear trend showed that of the 12 responses only two items showed a linear trend across the mailing waves (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) with subjects in the third wave showing more variation in their responses compared to those in the first wave; that is, fewer in the third wave chose the correct/most common option. The two items were:</p>

</list>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0017896911419350">
<title>Diagnosis</title>
<p>Most GDPs correctly diagnosed the TMD (<italic>n</italic> = 192 [87%]) and BMS (<italic>n</italic> = 192 [91%]) scenarios (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0017896911419350">Table 1</xref>). Of those who did not choose a diagnosis of TMD for scenario1 (<italic>n</italic> = 28), the majority (<italic>n</italic> =25 [89%]) chose a diagnosis of chronic oro-facial pain or atypical odontalgia which are related unexplained conditions of the oro-facial region. Similarly, of those who did not choose a diagnosis of BMS for scenario 4 (<italic>n</italic> = 19), the majority (<italic>n</italic> = 15 [79%]) chose a diagnosis of chronic oro-facial pain which is a wider diagnosis encompassing BMS. Of concern, however, were the diagnoses for scenarios 2 and 3 whereby 17 (8%) and 21 (9%) chose a diagnosis of pulpitis respectively. Furthermore, there was much greater variation in the diagnoses for these scenarios (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0017896911419350">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Management</title>
<p>The majority of respondents chose occlusal splint therapy (<italic>n</italic> = 150 [68%]) as their treatment for the TMD scenario. Reassuringly, no respondents chose ‘restoration of teeth’ or surgery as a treatment option. Similarly for the BMS scenario, the majority chose drug therapy (108 [49%]) and psychological therapy (59 [26%]; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0017896911419350">Table 1</xref>). Worryingly, however, there was wide variation in the management of the chronic oro-facial pain/atypical facial pain scenarios with substantial proportions choosing invasive treatment like restoration of teeth (60 [27%] for scenario 2 and 22 [10%] for scenario 3) and even surgery in some cases (4 [2%] for scenario 2 and 1[1%] for scenario 3).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-0017896911419350">
<title>Referral</title>
<p>The pattern of referral choices was dictated by the diagnosis and management options such that the majority of GDPs (140 [64%]) chose to refer the TMD scenario to a TMD specialist whilst for the BMS scenario the referral of choice was to oral medicine (169 [77%]). The variation in diagnosis and management was reflected in the referral options for scenarios 2 and 3 with approximately similar numbers choosing to refer to a restorative specialist (55 [25%] for scenario 2 and 21 [10%] for scenario 3), maxillofacial surgeon (51 [23%] for scenario 2 and 61 [28%] for scenario 3) and specialist in oral medicine (60 [27%] for scenario 2 and 79 [36%] for scenario 3).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The findings of our study suggest that although chronic oro-facial pain conditions are diagnosed accurately by GDPs, there is much variation in its management and referral patterns in primary care settings. Particularly the results show a general consensus in the diagnosis of temporomandibular disorder (TMPDS) and burning mouth syndrome (BMS). The results for the case scenarios of persistent oro-facial pain showed considerable variation and, although the majority of GDPs diagnosed it as COFP or atypical odontalgia, their treatment and referral patterns showed wide variation with a worrying proportion selecting invasive options for managing these conditions.</p>
<p>The overall pattern of treatment and referral suggest a very biomedical approach to management of chronic oro-facial pain. For example, the clear preference for the use of splints in managing TMD is interesting, considering that evidence suggests that they have little or no effectiveness in the management of TMPDS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0017896911419350">12</xref></sup> Recent population-based studies suggest that mechanical factors such as bruxism are present not only in COFP, but also other medically-unexplained syndromes, and may represent a heightened awareness of body symptoms generally rather than any causal link to COFP.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0017896911419350">20</xref></sup> Furthermore, risk factors for COFP have been shown to be psychosocial<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0017896911419350">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0017896911419350">22</xref></sup> and a recent review<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0017896911419350">19</xref></sup> suggests that cognitive behavioural therapy is effective in the management of TMD although the trials identified did not reach consensus on the number of sessions, mode of delivery and who should deliver the intervention. Further research needs to establish evidence-based guidelines for its use in the management of COFP and these findings are supported by previous work in this area.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0017896911419350">9</xref></sup> Reassuringly, some of the responders in our study were not opposed to psychological management, the choice of which seemed to be influenced by the duration of pain symptoms; that is, more responders chose psychological management for scenario 2 where the pain had been present for 10 years when compared to the other scenarios.</p>
<p>However, there are methodological issues that need to be addressed in interpreting our findings. First, the generalizability of our findings could be affected by the low response rates. Reasons for the low response were apparent in the correspondence we received with some responders suggesting that COFP was not their area of interest, whilst others commented that COFP patients cannot be diagnosed from case scenarios. It may be that these were among the reasons for not responding. Previous studies in this area – for example a recent survey carried out looking at the management of COFP by general dentists in German university hospitals – also obtained a relatively low response rates (45%).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0017896911419350">23</xref></sup> However, low response rates can only affect the generalizability if there is a presence of non-response bias and, where this is so, it is important to ascertain the direction of such a bias. The non-response analysis for our study showed that, whilst such a bias did exist for only two response items, it was in a direction that suggested late responders were less likely to agree with the most frequent diagnosis, management or referral option; that is, it would suggest more variation in the late responders who we used a proxy for non-responders. Therefore, given the null hypothesis of no variation in diagnosis and management of COFP and our study findings suggesting that the alternative was true, the non-response bias favours the alternative hypothesis that indeed there is more variation than we found. This in itself is an important finding and our study may have only revealed the ‘tip of the iceberg’ and importantly suggests that any non-response bias is unlikely to dilute the strength of the effects in our findings. Further, while our information on true non-responders was limited to year of qualification, there were no differences between non-responders and responders relating to this item.</p>
<p>Second, case scenarios do have their limitations; one study involving general medical practitioners suggested that there was no correlation between referrals based on case histories, and rate of referral to hospital outpatient departments.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0017896911419350">24</xref></sup> However, there are huge implications in attempting to make scenarios more realistic, using actors for example, and as a primary exploration of this area it is more appropriate to undertake a case scenario-based questionnaire survey. It may be possible to undertake further research with more detailed information in future, and also test the validity and reliability of the scenarios in greater detail and compare them to previous studies that have shown COFP can be diagnosed using appropriately designed questionnaires.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0017896911419350">25</xref></sup></p>
<p>Clinically, our findings suggest that there is a need to develop appropriate care pathways for COFP patients to reduce the observed variation in diagnosis and management. This view is supported by some authors who have suggested that management of COFP requires a multidisciplinary approach, with the establishment of facial pain clinics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0017896911419350">3</xref></sup> advising that, although there should be a thorough assessment of the patient to exclude organic pathology, repeated fruitless investigations with referrals to multiple specialists can lead to frustration for both patient and clinician, and possibly even exacerbation of the patient’s condition. Early diagnosis in primary care has been advocated,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0017896911419350">26</xref></sup> with conservative, non-invasive and reversible treatments employed initially.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0017896911419350">14</xref></sup> Some authors suggest the use of pharmacological therapies, but recommend that this be the remit of a liaison psychiatrist.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0017896911419350">27</xref></sup> Surgery is considered to be contra-indicated in nearly all cases of COFP.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0017896911419350">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0017896911419350">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0017896911419350">28</xref></sup></p>
<p>In conclusion, if early intervention in primary care is to become a reality then there is a need to develop not only evidence-based interventions but structured training programmes at both undergraduate and postgraduate levels. Dental curricula may vary in their emphasis on psychology and communications skills which are essential components of the psychological programmes that can benefit patients with COFP.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0017896911419350">19</xref></sup> Further, there is a need to develop national guidelines for the management of COFP and, given its similarity to other idiopathic pain disorders, there is much to glean from the wider chronic pain literature which has a richer evidence base that has been translated into clinical practice.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0017896911419350">29</xref></sup> The preference for referral for example to TMJ specialists, of whom there are very few in the country, demonstrates the current difficulties for clinicians in deciding how to manage patients with this condition.</p>
