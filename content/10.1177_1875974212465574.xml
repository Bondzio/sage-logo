<title>Objective:</title>
<p>Robotic-assisted laparoscopic prostatectomy (RALP) has become an increasingly popular choice of treatment for prostate cancer, but there is a paucity of published outcome data in the UK. We aim to assess the safety and feasibility of RALP at a regional UK hospital.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-1875974212465574">
<title>Methods:</title>
<p>The first 100 cases of RALP performed by four surgeons at our institution were analysed. Demographic, clinical, surgical, pathological and outcome data were collected with a minimum of 12 months’ follow up.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1875974212465574">
<title>Results:</title>
<p>The mean age of the patients was 60.7 years. The D’Amico risk stratifications were 41% low risk, 55% intermediate risk and 4% high risk. The median operating time was 245 min (150–522 min) and the median blood loss was 200ml (50–1800ml). Eighty-four per cent were pathological T1/T2; 16% were T3/T4. The positive margin rate was 22% with T3/T4 disease the dominant risk factor (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05). The stage specific positive margin rate was 16.7% for T1/T2 and 50.0% for T3/T4 disease. At 12-month follow-up the pad free continence rate was 82.0%. The 0–1 pad rate was 96%. The 12-month potency rates were 62.8% for bilateral nerve spare and 31.8% for unilateral nerve spare procedures. Two patients experienced biochemical recurrence at six and 18 months, respectively.</p>

</sec>
<sec id="section6-1875974212465574" sec-type="methods">
<title>Methods</title>
<p>All patients diagnosed with localized prostate cancer were discussed at a regional Urology Oncology Multidisciplinary meeting to determine suitability for RALP. All patients were offered an opinion from a radiation oncologist regarding the option of either brachytherapy or external beam radiotherapy as an alternative to surgery.</p>
<p>RALP was performed by one of four surgeons using a four-arm da Vinci® Robotic System. Two surgeons were fellowship trained in advanced laparoscopy and two were experienced open oncological surgeons. None of the four surgeons had prior experience with robotic surgery at other institutions. Mentoring was provided by three UK robotic surgeons for surgeon one’s first 10 cases, then after gaining experience, surgeon one acted as a mentor for the other three surgeons. Tableside assisting was performed by one of four registrars on rotation at the institution who had no previous experience in robotic surgery.</p>
<p>A standard six port placement and transperitoneal approach was used in all cases. A 1/0 V-Loc™ barbed uni-directional polyglyconate suture was used to control the dorsal venous complex. From case 46 onwards, the periurethral tissue was suspended to the periosteum of the pubic bone as described by Patel et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1875974212465574">10</xref></sup> Antegrade dissection was performed from the bladder neck using monopolar diathermy scissors. The prostatic pedicles were secured with Hem-O-Lock™ clips. For nerve sparing procedures, athermal dissection was performed using scissors and 5mm titanium clips for control of small vessels. A combination of interfascial and intrafascial nerve sparing techniques was employed depending on the preoperative staging and experience of surgeon. Vesico-urethral anastomosis was performed with two 3/0 V-Loc™ uni-directional polyglyconate sutures joined to form a double-ended bi-directional suture for a continuous anastomosis. As part of the anastomosis, a total anatomical repair was performed incorporating Denonvilliers fascia posteriorly and dorsal venous complex anteriorly in a single continuous layer as described by Sengupta et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1875974212465574">11</xref></sup> An 18-French Foley catheter was inserted prior to completion of the anastomosis. A leak test was routinely performed with 100ml of saline to check the integrity of the anastomosis. Pelvic node dissection was only introduced late in the series for high-risk patients once experience had been gained.</p>
<p>Patients were given 40mg of prophylactic enoxaparin immediately after the procedure and for every day of their admission. TEDS stockings were routinely used and patients were encouraged to wear these for a month following their procedure. The drain was removed on the first postoperative day if the drainage was &lt;150ml from the procedure. We aimed to discharge patients once mobile, tolerating solid food and drain removed. Initially the catheter was removed at 14 days; this was decreased to seven days later in the series. A cystogram was not routinely performed prior to catheter removal unless there were concerns about a possible leak.</p>
<p>All pathological specimens were analysed at a central pathology service and discussed at a regional Urology Oncology Multidisciplinary meeting.</p>
<p>A prospective database was established to collect demographic, clinical, surgical, pathological and outcome data. Complications were recorded according to a modified Clavien classification. Continence was defined strictly as being dry with no pads.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1875974212465574">12</xref></sup> Potency was defined as erections sufficient for satisfactory sexual penetration with or without the use of PDE-5 inhibitors. Statistical significance was calculated using either Fisher’s exact test or Student’s <italic>t</italic> test.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>One hundred consecutive RALPs were performed at our institution from November 2008 to July 2010. The mean follow-up was 18.3 months (range 12–24 months). The preoperative characteristics are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1875974212465574">Table 1</xref>. Note the relatively young patient demographic (mean age 60.7 years) and high proportion of intermediate-risk disease (55%). All four surgeons performing RALP at our institution contributed to the series. Fifty-six were performed by surgeon one, 16 by surgeon two, 14 by surgeon three and 12 by surgeon four.</p>

<p>While the overall estimated blood loss was low (median 200ml), there was one outlier with 1800ml blood loss. This case was early in the series, being surgeon one’s 14th case (number 20 overall). In this case, a patient with low-risk disease in a 92g prostate, having a bilateral nerve sparing procedure had persistent bleeding from the dorsal venous complex, which was controlled with some difficulty. Remarkably, the patient remained stable and had a postoperative haemoglobin of 8.2g/dl, avoiding transfusion.</p>
<p>Less than half of the patients (48%) underwent a bilateral nerve sparing procedure. This reflects the relatively low proportion of low-risk patients (41%) in the series.</p>
<p>Three patients underwent pelvic node dissection. Two were high-risk patients who underwent extended dissection to the iliac bifurcation. One patient of intermediate risk elected for a limited dissection. Our current practice is to perform extended node dissection in all high-risk patients, but this is not reflected in our first 100 patients.</p>
<p>Only one patient (1.0%) required a blood transfusion. This patient was of Afro-Caribbean background and had a long and technically demanding procedure (total 480 min) for a 101g prostate. The estimated blood loss was 800ml and two units were transfused in theatre. With post-operative haemoglobin of 7.0g/dl, a third unit was transfused on the ward.</p>
<p>The median length of stay was two postoperative days (range 1–12 days). Twenty-four patients (24.0%) were discharged on the first postoperative day, 34 patients (34.0%) on the second postoperative day and 25 (25.0%) on the third postoperative day. Seventeen patients (17.0%) remained four postoperative days or longer.</p>
<p>The median catheter time was 10 days (range 7–14 days). Our initial protocol was to remove the catheter in 14 days; this was reduced to seven days part way through the series.</p>
<p>The pathological data are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-1875974212465574">Table 3</xref>. The median prostate weight was 45g and six prostates (6.0%) were in excess of 100g. The majority of cancers were organ confined (84.0%). Sixteen prostates had extra capsular disease (16.0%), two of which had seminal vesicle invasion (T3b, 2.0%) and one with microscopic bladder neck invasion (T4a, 1.0%).</p>

<p>The positive margin rate in our series was 22.0%. Of these, 11 were apical (50.0%), nine were circumferential (40.9%) and two were at the basal margin (9.1%). Pathological T3/4 disease was the major risk factor accounting for eight (36.4%) of the positive margins (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05). The stage specific positive margin rates were 16.7% for T2 disease and 50.0% for T3/T4 disease. Twenty-one of the 22 positive margins (95.5%) occurred in either unilateral or bilateral nerve sparing procedures; however, this trend did not reach statistical significance (<italic>p</italic>=0.21) when compared with those undergoing bilateral wide excision. The individual positive margin rates of the four surgeons were 17.8%, 37.5%, 16.7% and 25.0%, respectively. While surgeon two’s positive margin rate is an outlier, this was not statistically significant (<italic>p</italic>=0.10) when compared with the other three surgeons and the majority of these (66.7%) occurred in pT3/4 disease (<italic>p</italic>=0.09).</p>
<p>Two patients with positive margins experienced biochemical recurrence (PSA&gt;0.2) at six and 18 months, respectively. Both patients underwent salvage radiotherapy. A further four patients with T3/4 disease underwent immediate adjuvant radiotherapy. The remaining 94 patients have undetectable PSAs at follow-up.</p>
<p>The Clavien graded complications are outlined in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1875974212465574">Table 4</xref>. There were no grade IV or V complications. Five patients developed limb neuropraxia; this was self-limiting and did not require treatment. The operation times for these patients were longer (342 min <italic>vs.</italic> 245 min); however, this did not reach statistical significance when compared with the rest of the cohort (<italic>p</italic>=0.07). One patient presented in acute urinary retention, requiring catheterization with a flexible cystoscope. A subsequent CT scan revealed a pelvic haematoma causing disruption of the anastomosis. The catheter was successfully removed two weeks later. One patient developed a rectal fistula from an unrecognized rectal injury, likely from picking up rectal mucosa with one of the posterior anastomotic sutures. A cystogram showed a small flare of contrast into the rectum. This settled promptly with 14 days of catheterization. One patient developed severe abdominal pain resistant to intravenous opioids within 24 hours of surgery, demonstrating peritonitis on palpation. An exploratory laparotomy was performed; however, nothing was found apart from a small amount of clear fluid in the pelvis, which may have represented a small urine leak. The patient made an otherwise uneventful recovery. Two patients were found to have incisional hernias from the umbilical wound and were referred to General Surgery for mesh repair. Two patients developed late anastomotic contractures, one of whom represented in urinary retention requiring suprapubic catheterization. Seven patients presented with various lower urinary tract symptoms during follow-up and were found to be obstructed by Hem-O-Lok™ clips having eroded through the bladder neck into the urinary tract. These were all removed endoscopically with prompt resolution of symptoms.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study shows the initial experience of four surgeons in the setting of a regional UK hospital. Lister hospital is a 480-bed hospital covering a population of 1.3 million in Hertfordshire and southern Bedfordshire. Along with direct GP referrals, secondary referrals for RALP are also rovided from Watford General Hospital and Luton and Dunstable Hospital. We believe we are the first regional non-teaching hospital to publish results for RALP.</p>
<p>All patients diagnosed with prostate cancer in our institution are first discussed at a regional Urology Oncology Multidisciplinary meeting where treatment options are discussed. Active surveillance is encouraged in patients with low risk and increasing age. All patients are given the opportunity to discuss radiotherapy options with a radiation oncologist. RALP is often the preferred option in younger patients with intermediate disease. This is reflected in our results with a mean patient age of 60.7 years and a relatively high proportion of intermediate-risk disease (55%).</p>
<p>Our positive margin rate of 22% is well within the range of other published studies of initial RALP experience.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1875974212465574">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1875974212465574">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1875974212465574"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1875974212465574">15</xref></sup> It has not escaped our attention that 95% of the positive margins occurred during a nerve sparing procedure. Perhaps surprisingly, there were no positive margins in patients undergoing a riskier bilateral intrafascial nerve spare. These patients were carefully selected with low-volume, low-risk disease. Half of the positive margins (50%) occurred in patients with intermediate-risk disease undergoing unilateral interfascial nerve spare. In this group where all patients had clinical T1/T2 disease preoperatively, 73% were upgraded to T3/T4 disease. Sixty-three per cent of the ensuing positive margins were circumferential on the side of the nerve spare. This suggests to us that patient selection, rather than technical factors, resulted in a large proportion of the positive margins. With a more conservative approach, preoperative staging with MRI and limiting nerve sparing only to younger patients with good preoperative erectile function, we hope to reduce our positive margin rate in the future.</p>
<p>Accurate definition of erectile function post radical prostatectomy remains a controversial area with many different definitions used in reported series of radical prostatectomy (RP).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1875974212465574">16</xref></sup> Validated questionnaires such as the Short-Form International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5) are popular, but there does not appear to be consensus on a numerical definition for potency with definitions ranging as high as IIEF-5 &gt;21.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1875974212465574">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1875974212465574">18</xref></sup> and as low as IIEF-5 &gt;16.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1875974212465574">8</xref></sup> This series defines potency in the simple term of erections sufficient for satisfactory sexual penetration during intercourse with or without PDE-5 inhibitors. This definition has been used by many authors of RP series, notably including Walsh et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1875974212465574">19</xref></sup> We concede this definition is non-validated making comparisons with other studies difficult. We do find, however, that it provides a ‘real world’ estimate which is useful in counselling our patients preoperatively in terms easy to understand. A limitation of practice in a smaller regional hospital is the absence of full-time research staff, and it was simply not feasible to collect IIEF-5 scores on all patients preoperatively and for all follow-up consultations.</p>
<p>Urinary continence completes the ‘trifecta’ of desirable outcomes along with potency and oncological clearance. Our 12-month pad free continence rate of 82% and 0–1 pad rate of 96% compares favourably with much larger international series.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1875974212465574">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1875974212465574">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1875974212465574"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1875974212465574">22</xref></sup></p>
<p>We noted that 5% of our patients had self-limiting limb neuropraxia related to the procedure. This complication appears related to patient positioning in any kind of urological surgery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1875974212465574">23</xref></sup> Although not commonly reported in RALP series, rates of neuropraxia between 0.6% and 1.6% have been described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1875974212465574">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1875974212465574"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1875974212465574"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1875974212465574"/>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1875974212465574">28</xref></sup> In our series, these occurred despite fastidious positioning with gel pads under pressure points, air inflated gloves to protect the hands, soft gauze wrap around the wrists and yellow fin cushioned stirrups. The leg positions were always checked by the operating surgeon for areas of tension prior to commencement of the surgical scrub. Although just falling short of statistical significance (<italic>p</italic>=0.07), we believe longer procedure times early in the series are responsible for this complication.</p>
<p>Umbilical port-site incisional herniae are considered a rare complication after RALP.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1875974212465574">29</xref></sup> We had two patients (2.0%) presenting with this complication early in our series. This led to a change in our method of wound closure from a continuous stitch with 2/0 Vicryl™ absorbable polyglactin suture to multiple interrupted sutures in the rectus sheath with 1/0 Ethibond™ non-absorbable polyester. We have not observed this complication since this change in technique.</p>
<p>Late migration of Hem-O-Lok™ clips into the urethra occurred in seven patients (7.0%), totalling more than half of our Clavien IIIb complications. This rare phenomenon was first described by Blumenthal et al. in 2008.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1875974212465574">30</xref></sup> Recognizing this as a distinct outlier in complications, we modified our technique to leave a thicker rim of tissue around the bladder neck and avoid the use of clips in the vicinity of the bladder neck or urethra. Fortunately, this problem has not recurred since this modification although we still retain a high index of suspicion in patients representing with obstructive symptoms.</p>
<p>There were no incidents of venous thromboembolism (VTE) during this series. Our protocol for prevention included the use of pneumatic calf compression devices during surgery, early mobilization and compression stockings, which patients were encouraged to wear for a month after their operation. In addition, 40mg of enoxaparin was routinely given at the end of each procedure and daily throughout the hospital admission. After observing incidences of VTE in patients post RALP at other UK institutions, we have now changed our policy to 28 days of enoxaparin, in line with the updated National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1875974212465574">31</xref></sup></p>
<p>Many would consider our positive margin rate and operative times to be higher than expected, especially when compared with an established high volume robotic centre. These results need to be taken in context with the learning curves of the surgeons involved. While all will agree that experience and volume derive better results, there is much debate as to how many cases constitute a generic learning curve for robotic prostatectomy. There is a wide variation in the literature with the learning curve reported to be anywhere between 12 and 250 cases;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1875974212465574">32</xref></sup> however, we feel most would consider the standard learning curve to be around 50 cases. Using this as an arbitrary cut-off, only six of the 100 cases in this series were performed out of a surgeon’s learning curve. As suggested in the literature, we expect our results to improve once all four surgeons are past their respective learning curves. We have deliberately avoided analysing individual learning curves as three of the surgeons had performed fewer than 20 cases and such an exercise would be unlikely to yield any meaningful results at this stage.</p>
<p>We may also be open to criticism for the low number of pelvic lymph node dissections performed in this series. First, there was a reluctance to take on a pelvic node dissection so early in the learning curve. This is for two reasons, namely the operative times were longer than we would prefer and we found it difficult to justify adding another hour to the case with a patient in steep Trendelenberg position. Adding to this, extended pelvic node dissection is technically challenging and we felt this should only be attempted when more experience and confidence had been gained over time and caseload. Lastly, the cases in this series had been performed prior to the NICE guidelines being altered to recommend pelvic node dissection in all patients with intermediate- and high-risk disease. With more experience and confidence, it is currently our routine practice to perform pelvic node dissection as per the current NICE guidelines.</p>
<p>The establishment of a dedicated team for robotic surgery has been the cornerstone of our robotic programme. Aside from the four surgeons, our two regular anaesthetists and six theatre nurses have all undergone extra training and qualification in order to provide a seamless service. The later addition of a fellow in robotic surgery has also played a role in maintaining consistency across the unit. The mentorship and support from other units was essential in getting the programme off the ground.</p>
<p>This series shows that with the right team and good mentorship, it is safe and feasible to perform RALP at a regional UK hospital.</p>
