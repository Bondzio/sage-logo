<abstract>
<p><bold>Background</bold>: Complete repair of massive rotator cuff tears can be limited by tendon retraction and poor tissue quality. When a complete repair cannot be accomplished, a significant partial repair may be possible.</p>
<p><bold>Hypothesis</bold>: A partial repair will yield comparable outcomes to complete repair of massive rotator cuff tears in this specific patient population.</p>
<p><bold>Study Design</bold>: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3.</p>
<p><bold>Methods</bold>: All consecutive arthroscopic rotator cuff repairs done at the authors’ institution over a 2-year period were identified. A retrospective chart review was performed. Inclusion criteria required that each patient have a massive rotator cuff tear (30 cm<sup>2</sup> or greater). Patients were categorized as either partial or complete repair. The University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) shoulder scores were used to measure patient outcomes at an average follow-up of 24 months (10-40 months).</p>
<p><bold>Results</bold>: Of 1128 consecutive arthroscopic rotator cuff repairs, 97 (9%) patients were noted intraoperatively to have massive tears measuring 30 cm<sup>2</sup> or greater. Complete repair was achieved in 52 patients, whereas partial repair was possible in 45 patients. Eleven patients were lost to follow-up. The 41 remaining patients with only partial repair achieved a postoperative mean UCLA score of 29.49, and the 45 patients with complete repair achieved a mean UCLA score of 29.64, yielding significant improvement in both the partial repair group (<italic>P</italic> = .0001) and the complete repair group (<italic>P</italic> = .0001) compared with preoperative UCLA scores. However, no statistically significant differences in postoperative outcomes were noted when the 2 groups were compared with one another (<italic>P</italic> = .89).</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion</bold>: Partial repair of massive rotator cuff tears yielded outcomes comparable with complete repair of massive tears.</p>

<p>Massive rotator cuff tears represent a challenging patient group for the shoulder surgeon to treat and are the cause of significant shoulder pain and disability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546512438763">9</xref></sup> Codman<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0363546512438763">8</xref></sup> described the operative treatment of full-thickness tears of the rotator cuff in 1911.

<p>Burkhart<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0363546512438763">4</xref></sup> introduced the concept of the “functional rotator cuff tear,” a tear that is anatomically deficient yet biomechanically intact, resulting in a more balanced shoulder. Patients with functional rotator cuff tears may have near-normal function despite unrepaired defects in the rotator cuff.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546512438763">7</xref></sup> This invariably leads to the concept and rationale of partial rotator cuff repair as a treatment alternative for the irreparable tear, essentially converting the tear to a smaller but potentially more functional rotator cuff tear that is more biomechanically sound.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546512438763">7</xref></sup> When a complete repair cannot be accomplished, a very significant partial repair may be possible.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546512438763">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546512438763">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546512438763">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546512438763">18</xref></sup></p>
<p>A limited number of studies are available reporting on partial repair of massive rotator cuff tears, and the results are inconsistent.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546512438763">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546512438763">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546512438763">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546512438763">18</xref></sup> Indications for surgery vary widely among these reports.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the outcome of a consecutive series of patients undergoing arthroscopic repair of massive rotator cuff tears.</p>
<sec id="section1-0363546512438763" sec-type="materials|methods">
<title>Materials and Methods</title>
<p>All consecutive arthroscopic rotator cuff repairs done by one surgeon from January 1, 2008, to January 1, 2010, were identified by a computer database search. All operative notes and clinic encounters were dictated by the same surgeon. A retrospective chart review was performed. All patients in our study group had rotator cuff tears preoperatively documented by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Inclusion criteria included all patients with massive rotator cuff tears measuring 30 cm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546512438763">2</xref></sup> or greater as noted and measured intraoperatively. Exclusion criteria included any patient who had significant superior humeral head migration such that the acromion-humeral distance was less than 6 mm.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0363546512438763">21</xref></sup> In addition, patients with glenohumeral arthritis of grade II or higher following the Samilson-Prieto classification<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0363546512438763">23</xref></sup> were excluded. Revision rotator cuff repairs were not excluded, and 4 patients in the study had each undergone 1 previous arthroscopic rotator cuff repair by the authors. Operative reports and intraoperative photography of all patients were reviewed, and the repair configuration was documented. Patients were then categorized into 1 of 2 groups (partial repair or complete repair).</p>
<sec id="section2-0363546512438763">
<title>Evaluation of Rotator Cuff Tears</title>
<p>All patients in the study were classified as possessing massive rotator cuff tears by satisfying all of the following 3 criteria: a diameter greater than 5 cm,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0363546512438763">9</xref></sup> involving 2 or more tendons,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0363546512438763">13</xref></sup> and having an area of 30 cm<sup>2</sup> or greater<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546512438763">5</xref></sup> as noted intraoperatively. Rotator cuff tear size was measured arthroscopically using an Elite calibrated probe (Smith &amp; Nephew, Andover, Massachusetts) to obtain maximum medial-to-lateral and anterior-to-posterior dimension of the tear for each patient from which a rotator cuff tear size area (cm<sup>2</sup>) was then calculated.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0363546512438763">
<title>Clinical Assessment</title>
<p>University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) shoulder scores<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546512438763">12</xref></sup> were collected in the clinic setting preoperatively and at latest follow-up to assess patient outcome in all patients. The results were graded on the UCLA Shoulder Rating Scale and divided into excellent (34-35 points), good (28-33 points), fair (21-27 points), and poor (0-20 points). Scores greater than or equal to 28 were classified as satisfactory, whereas scores less than 28 were considered unsatisfactory.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546512438763">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0363546512438763">20</xref></sup> Average follow-up for these patients was 24 months (10-40 months).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0363546512438763">
<title>Operative Technique</title>
<p>All operative procedures were performed by 1 surgeon with the patient in beach-chair position under general anesthesia in combination with an interscalene block. Three routine arthroscopic portals (anterior, lateral, posterior) were used to perform the arthroscopy, and accessory portals were created as needed.</p>
<p>After glenohumeral arthroscopy and subtotal removal of the subacromial bursa, the rotator cuff was debrided. While viewing from the lateral portal, the surgeon assessed the mobility of the rotator cuff of these massive rotator cuff tears by use of an arthroscopic grasper, usually through an accessory lateral portal. The amount of tension required to lateralize the tendon edge to the footprint region was noted. With lateral traction applied to the rotator cuff tissue, peritendinous adhesions and rotator cuff capsular contractures were routinely and thoroughly released. If necessary, anterior or posterior rotator interval slides were also performed. To minimize potential devascularization of the tendon, the authors attempted to limit performing both an anterior and a posterior slide concomitantly when possible. The arthroscopic anterior interval slide improves mobility of the rotator cuff by releasing the interval between the supraspinatus tendon and the rotator interval, effectively incising the coracohumeral ligament.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546512438763">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0363546512438763">25</xref></sup> Arthroscopic scissors were introduced through an accessory lateral portal with the release oriented along the anterior border of the supraspinatus and directed toward the base of the coracoid. The arthroscopic posterior interval slide improves mobility of the rotator cuff by releasing the interval between the infraspinatus and supraspinatus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546512438763">6</xref></sup> When a posterior interval slide was carried out, the scapular spine was identified and cleared of any subacromial fibroadipose tissue. The scapular spine served as a marker between the supraspinatus and infraspinatus and helped orient and direct the posterior interval release.</p>
<p>Once the rotator cuff tissue was mobilized to its fullest extent, careful assessment was made as to which repair configuration would yield the most complete repair at the lowest tension possible. Margin convergence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546512438763">6</xref></sup> was often used to lateralize the free margin of the rotator cuff tear and to minimize strain at the repair site. Suture anchors were placed to repair the rotator cuff to the bone by single-row or double-row fixation techniques depending on tissue quality and mobility. Attempts were made to completely repair all massive rotator cuff tears. However, if reapproximation of the tendon to bone could not be accomplished even after extensive rotator cuff mobilization without undue tension on the mobilized tendon, repair of only the adequately mobilized tissue was carried out. Whether a partial or complete repair became possible after rotator cuff mobilization, rotator cuff mobilization attempts usually started with an extensive capsular release along with release of any peritendinous adhesions. If additional rotator cuff mobilization was still thought to be necessary, an anterior or posterior interval slide was accomplished. Occasionally, both an anterior and posterior interval slide was carried out in an effort to maximize lateral rotator cuff mobility and thus reduce tension on the reattached tissue.</p>
<p>Concomitant procedures were performed when necessary. These included acromioplasty, distal clavicle excision, biceps tenodesis, glenohumeral capsular release, and labral repair. No tendon transfers were carried out and no supplemental tendon augmentation grafts were used on any of these patients.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-0363546512438763">
<title>Postoperative Rehabilitation</title>
<p>All patients in this study had the surgical procedure performed on an outpatient basis. Patients were immobilized in a sling postoperatively. Physical therapy consisting of passive mobilization and pain-free assisted active exercises were initiated from 1 to 4 weeks postoperatively depending on individual tears and repairs, at the discretion of the operating surgeon. At 6 to 8 weeks, gentle active exercises were usually initiated. Organized physical therapy continued for an average of 4.9 months in the partial repair group and an average of 4.3 months in the complete repair group.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0363546512438763">
<title>Statistical Analysis</title>
<p>Parametric paired <italic>t</italic> tests were used to compare preoperative and postoperative outcome measures within each group. An unpaired <italic>t</italic> test was used when comparing outcome measures between the 2 groups. The data were tested for normality using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. A significance level less than .05 was considered statistically significant. GraphPad Prism Software Version 5 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, California) was used to calculate the mean, standard deviation, and level of significance for all outcome measures evaluated.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<sec id="section8-0363546512438763">
<title>Patients</title>
<p>A total of 1128 patients underwent arthroscopic rotator cuff repair by 1 surgeon during the period of the study. Of those consecutive cases, 97 (9%) patients were noted intraoperatively to have massive rotator cuff tears measuring 30 cm<sup>2</sup> or greater. In these patients with massive cuff tears, complete repair was achieved in 52 patients, and partial repair was possible in 45 patients. No patients during the study period had debridement alone. Four patients from the partial repair group and 7 patients from the complete repair group were lost to follow-up, leaving 86 of 97 patients (88.7%) for evaluation. The mean ± SD age was 64.5 ± 9.5 years (range, 44-83 years) for the partial repair group and 63.4 ± 12.2 years (range, 37-82 years) for the complete repair group. No significant difference between the 2 groups with respect to age was found (<italic>P</italic> = .6542).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-0363546512438763">
<title>Clinical Assessment</title>
<p>The 41 patients with partial repairs had a preoperative mean ± SD UCLA score of 12.10 ± 3.05 (range, 7-18). The 45 patients with a complete repair had a preoperative mean ± SD UCLA score of 11.22 ± 2.89 (range, 5-18). No significant difference in the preoperative UCLA scores between the partial versus complete repair groups was noted (<italic>P</italic> = .1754). The 41 patients with a partial repair achieved a postoperative mean ± SD UCLA score of 29.49 ± 5.90 (range, 10-35). The 45 patients with a complete repair achieved a postoperative mean ± SD UCLA score of 29.64 ± 4.92 (range, 14-35). There was no significant difference in the postoperative UCLA shoulder scores between the partial versus complete repair groups (<italic>P</italic> = .8937). In patients who underwent a partial repair, there was a significant improvement in postoperative UCLA scores (<italic>P</italic> = .0001). Also, among the patients who underwent complete repair, significant improvement was noted in postoperative UCLA scores (<italic>P</italic> = .0001) as well. In the partial repair group, there were 12 excellent results, 19 good results, 7 fair results, and 3 poor results. Thirty-one of 41 patients (75.6%) attained satisfactory results, and 10 patients (24.4%) had unsatisfactory results. In the complete repair group, there were 14 excellent results, 18 good results, 11 fair results, and 2 poor results. Therefore, the complete repair group had 32 of 45 patients (71.1%) with satisfactory results and 13 patients (28.9%) with unsatisfactory results.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0363546512438763">
<title>Evaluation of Rotator Cuff Tears</title>
<p>For the partial repair group, the average intraoperatively measured medial-to-lateral width of the rotator cuff tear was 6.07 ± 0.26 cm, and the average anterior-to-posterior length was 6.54 ± 0.64 cm, creating an average tear size of 39.73 ± 4.57 cm<sup>2</sup>. For the complete repair group, the average intraoperatively measured medial-to-lateral width of the tears was 5.96 ± 0.21 cm, the average anterior-to-posterior length was 5.91 ± 0.70 cm, and the average tear size was 35.20 ± 4.36 cm<sup>2</sup>. The rotator cuff tear size of the partial repair group was noted to be significantly larger than that of the complete repair group (<italic>P</italic> = .0001). In the partial repair group, the residual rotator cuff defect was measured and recorded in all patients as well. The average medial-to-lateral residual defect width was 2.34 ± 1.49 cm, and the average anterior-to-posterior length was 2.39 ± 0.92 cm, creating an average residual defect area of 5.68 ± 4.59 cm<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p>The individual tendons involved in these massive rotator cuff tears were also noted. In the partial repair group, the supraspinatus was completely detached in all 41 patients, whereas the infraspinatus was at least partially detached in 40 patients. The subscapularis was at least partially detached in 11 patients, whereas the teres minor was torn in 4 patients. After partial repair was accomplished, the tendons that were unable to be completely repaired were noted. The supraspinatus was unable to be completely repaired 83% of the time (34 patients), whereas the infraspinatus was unable to be completely repaired 28% of the time (11 patients). There were only 4 patients in whom the supraspinatus was completely repairable but the infraspinatus was not. Complete repair could not be achieved for the subscapularis in 4 patients and for the teres minor in 1 patient. In the complete repair group, the supraspinatus was completely detached in all 45 patients, whereas the infraspinatus was at least partially torn in 44 patients. The subscapularis was at least partially detached in 14 patients, whereas the teres minor was torn in 1 patient. Complete repair was achieved on all tendons in this group of patients.</p>
<p>Concomitant procedures performed in the partial repair group included acromioplasty in 33 patients, distal clavicle excision in 32 patients, biceps tenodesis in 22 patients, circumferential capsular release in 8 patients, microfracture of the glenoid in 2 patients, and labral repair in 1 patient. In the complete repair group, acromioplasty was performed in 44 patients, distal clavicle excision in 43 patients, biceps tenodesis in 32 patients, circumferential capsular release in 4 patients, microfracture of the glenoid in 3 patients, and labral repair in 1 patient.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0363546512438763">
<title>Complications and Reoperations</title>
<p>In the partial repair group, 3 patients underwent subsequent revision partial rotator cuff repair. In these 3 patients, a significant functional deterioration with a significant increase in pain was noted at approximately 4 to 6 months postoperatively and was thought by the authors to be most likely due to a significant re-tear of the partial repair. After revision partial repair, these patients had UCLA shoulder scores of 34, 32, and 24 at follow-up, representing 1 excellent, 1 good, and 1 fair outcome. In the complete repair group, 1 patient sustained a significant re-tear in the early postoperative period (2 months) after a traumatic injury and underwent revision complete rotator cuff repair. At latest follow-up, this patient had a UCLA shoulder score of 26, signifying a fair outcome.</p>

Arthroscopic techniques continue to advance, and with an understanding of advanced techniques, the great majority of rotator cuff tears can be completely repaired.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546512438763">16</xref></sup> Even when grade 3 and 4 fatty degeneration of the rotator cuff is noted on MRI, repair can provide significant functional improvements in certain patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546512438763">5</xref></sup> These massive tears, however, can be retracted and have poor tissue quality. Although extensive soft tissue and capsular releases can help mobilize even a retracted rotator cuff, there are occasions when the lateral tendon edge is unable to be completely reapproximated to even the medial rotator cuff footprint.</p>
<p>Short-term and mid-term results of simple arthroscopic cuff debridement for massive rotator cuff tears have shown promising results.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546512438763">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0363546512438763">16</xref></sup> However, several long-term studies have demonstrated that these initial results deteriorate significantly with time.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0363546512438763">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0363546512438763">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0363546512438763">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0363546512438763">17</xref></sup> In the present study, patients indicated for surgery with massive rotator cuff tears all underwent at least partial repair. In this series of 97 massive tears, complete repair was achieved in 54% and partial repair was accomplished in 46%. No rotator cuff tear was found to be completely irreparable, and no tears were treated with debridement alone.</p>
<p>Proper surgical indications play a major role in the success of surgical repairs for massive rotator cuff tears. A thorough history must be obtained to determine important information such as the length of time the patient has had shoulder dysfunction, any recent decline in shoulder function, and the specific circumstances surrounding those changes in function. A patient with a presumed longstanding rotator cuff tear may present for treatment only after developing a relatively recent and significant decline in function and/or increase in symptoms. In this setting, such a patient may have sustained an acute extension of an otherwise chronic tear, resulting in increased shoulder dysfunction and pain, and may have significant functional improvement even if only the acute extension of the tear can be repaired. If, however, such a patient has radiographic evidence of superior humeral head migration with an acromion-humeral distance of less than 6 mm, rotator cuff repair may be less likely to be successful as a treatment option.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0363546512438763">21</xref></sup></p>
<p>Recognizing rotator cuff tear patterns is critical to the appropriate mobilization and reapproximation of massive rotator cuff tears. Attempting to laterally mobilize and repair the apex of a retracted tear to a lateral bone bed will often result in high tensile stresses in the repaired tissue, causing tensile overload and subsequent failure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546512438763">6</xref></sup> Techniques such as margin convergence not only allow repair of some very large tears but also minimize strain at the repair site, thereby providing an added degree of protection for the tendon-to-bone component of the repair.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546512438763">6</xref></sup> An incorrectly reapproximated and/or inadequately mobilized rotator cuff tear may have such large stresses at the tear margin that achieving and/or maintaining a secure repair cannot be accomplished.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546512438763">6</xref></sup> Adhering to these principles is important in an effort to maintain a low tension partial or complete repair, and the authors made a concerted effort to do so.</p>
<p>Patients in this study had massive tears that extended anteriorly or posteriorly to such an extent that the transverse plane force couple was no longer balanced. Similar to the study by Burkhart et al,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546512438763">7</xref></sup> the authors’ goal was to convert these dysfunctional rotator cuff tears into more functional tears by attempting to restore the force couples, even if complete repair was not possible.</p>
<p>The concept of partial repair using tissue releases and margin convergence has been well defined.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546512438763">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546512438763">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546512438763">7</xref></sup> The partial repair serves to help restore the shoulder’s essential force couples. Thus, the “suspension bridge” system of force transmission in the shoulder is potentially reestablished.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0363546512438763">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0363546512438763">7</xref></sup> The rebalanced force couples of the remaining anterior and posterior components of the rotator cuff can improve stability and function.</p>
<p>Porcellini et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0363546512438763">21</xref></sup> found that partial repair of the infraspinatus in patients with irreparable rotator cuff tears of the supraspinatus gives good results in terms of patient satisfaction and in restoring the acromion-humeral distance even at long-term follow-up. Berth et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0363546512438763">2</xref></sup> recently evaluated functional outcomes after debridement versus partial repair of massive rotator cuff tears. This study determined that patients treated with partial rotator cuff repair had greater improvements in shoulder function compared with patients treated with arthroscopic debridement alone. These findings are consistent with a study done by Duralde and Bair,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0363546512438763">11</xref></sup> which also concluded that the results of partial repair were superior to those of debridement alone. Burkhart<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0363546512438763">3</xref></sup> also found that partial repair of large and massive rotator cuff tears leads to significant pain relief and improvement of shoulder function. Moser et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0363546512438763">18</xref></sup> compared a series of massive rotator cuff tears treated with complete repair, partial repair, or debridement. A significant difference in their study was improvement in active external rotation among the complete repair group.</p>
<p>The present study demonstrates statistically significant improvements in postoperative outcomes after both partial repair and complete repair of massive rotator cuff tears. Both partial and complete repair of these massive rotator cuff tears measuring 30 cm<sup>2</sup> or greater resulted in significant improvement in the postoperative UCLA scores. Burkhart et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0363546512438763">5</xref></sup> also found complete repair resulted in clinical improvement in 86.4% of massive rotator cuff tears that were classified as Goutallier stage 3 and 4 fatty degeneration. In our study, there were no significant differences found among the parameters assessed between the complete and partial repair groups except for the finding that the group undergoing partial repair had a larger average preoperative tear size. The authors believe that the results of the present study emphasize the potential value of partial repair in selected patients with massive tears.</p>
<p>Strengths of this study include the fact that it represents a consecutive series of arthroscopic rotator cuff repairs done by a single surgeon and employed a consistent arthroscopic repair technique. Weaknesses of the study include the retrospective design and relatively short-term follow-up.</p>
<p>In summary, there are instances when a complete repair of the rotator cuff insertion is not possible due to significant retraction and poor tissue quality. In such cases, partial repair of the rotator cuff in appropriately selected patients appears to yield results comparable to complete repair in short-term follow-up.</p>
