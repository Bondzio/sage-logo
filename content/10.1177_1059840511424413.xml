<abstract>
<p>School nurses can play a key role in the detection of significant refractive error. The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of a statewide school nurse vision screening program by evaluating the outcomes of screening among first, third, and fifth graders in 10 schools in North Carolina during the 2009–2010 school year. Of the 2,726 children who were screened, 7.7% (<italic>n</italic> = 209) were abnormal, of which 89% (<italic>n</italic> = 186) were placed into a comprehensive database for follow-up. No documentation of any follow-up was available for 35% (<italic>n</italic> = 65) of these children. Of the 106 with complete eye examination data available, 54.7% (<italic>n</italic> = 58) had myopia, 22.6% (<italic>n</italic> = 24) had hyperopia, 11.3% (<italic>n</italic> = 12) had astigmatism, 1.9% (<italic>n</italic> = 2) had anisometropia, and 9.4% (<italic>n</italic> = 10) were normal. Even with incomplete follow-up, this screening activity led to identification of 3 cases for every 100 children screened, underscoring the importance of high-quality school-based vision screening programs.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Uncorrected refractive error is common (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1059840511424413">Vitale, Cotch, &amp; Sperduto, 2006</xref>) and may adversely affect student performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1059840511424413">Dusek, Pierscionek, &amp; McClelland, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1059840511424413">Goldstand, Koslowe, &amp; Parush, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1059840511424413">Marshall, Meetz, &amp; Harmon, 2010</xref>). Although vision screening is a recommended component of routine preventive care for children, the rate and quality of screening in primary care settings is inconsistent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1059840511424413">Gustafson, Kinne, Little, &amp; Strawhacker, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1059840511424413">Wall et al., 2002</xref>). To address this gap, most states require vision screening within schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1059840511424413">Prevent Blindness America, 2011</xref>). However, little is known about the impact of school-based vision screening programs, including their positive predictive value. Because vision screening can be difficult to administer in the often chaotic school setting with high reliability and validity, formal training of school nurses in the process of screening is a critical component of any vision screening program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1059840511424413">Strawhacker, Gustafson, Kinne, &amp; Little, 2003</xref>).</p>
<p>There is significant concern about whether children with an abnormal school vision screening test receive timely diagnostic follow-up and treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1059840511424413">Yawn, Lydick, Epstein, &amp; Jacobsen, 1996</xref>). Barriers to follow-up include the cost of eye care, the logistical difficulty of obtaining the eye examination, and parent’s lack of belief in the importance of follow-up eye care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1059840511424413">Kimel, 2006</xref>). Many vision screening programs monitor follow-up by having parents return follow-up information. Not surprisingly, this approach can underestimate the true number of children who actually receive an eye examination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1059840511424413">Kemper, Fant, Bruckman, &amp; Clark, 2004</xref>) and thus undervalue the impact of the screening program.</p>
<p>To better understand the impact of school-based vision screening, we chose to evaluate a statewide vision screening program in North Carolina that is unique in two important respects: (a) school nurses and other members of the public are trained and certified in vision screening by an independent nonprofit organization, Prevent Blindness North Carolina (PBNC) and (b) follow-up data can be actively collected by the school nurses from both parents and eye care professionals using an electronic database developed in partnership with PBNC and its parent national organization, Prevent Blindness America. During the 2009–2010 school year, nearly 500,000 children were screened, leading to more than 25,000 eye exams (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1059840511424413">North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services, 2010</xref>). Data collected by the state suggest that most (&gt;70%) of those referred receive follow-up eye care (North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services, 2010). The outcome measures for this study included the rate of referral, the proportion with documented eye examinations, the results of these eye examinations, and the degree to which school- or grade-specific factors were associated with the lack of follow-up after an abnormal vision screen.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<sec id="section3-1059840511424413">
<title>Program Overview</title>
<p>Vision screening is offered in most North Carolina schools for children in kindergarten through fifth grade and one middle school grade. Individual schools can opt out of offering vision screening or modify the program. PBNC has developed the recommended program, trains and certifies screeners, and provides the necessary screening equipment. The certified screeners, who range from school nurses to lay volunteers, conduct the screening program within the schools. Recommended screening includes distance visual acuity for all children and stereopsis (i.e., depth perception or the ability to see in three dimensions) testing for children in kindergarten through third grade or through 9 years of age. The recommended distance visual acuity test for the North Carolina program is the HOTV chart, which includes the letters H, O, T, and V, for children in kindergarten and first grade and the Snellen chart for 2nd through 12th graders. Distance visual acuity is measured at a 10-foot distance and recorded in the 20-foot equivalent (e.g., 10/25 is equivalent to 20/50). The recommended referral criteria are 20/50 or worse in either eye for 5-year-old children, 20/40 or worse for children older than 5 years, or a two-line difference between the two eyes within the passing range. The Lang II stereotest is recommended by the North Carolina program for testing stereopsis, with referral for children who are not able to see any of the three three-dimensional figures (moon, elephant, and car). Seeing these 
 requires each eye to work together. In addition, children could be referred for any concerns on the part of the screener based on appearance, behavior, or complaints (e.g., ptosis, squint, or complaints of headache or blurry vision). Screening typically takes less than 5 min per child.</p>

</fig>
<p>PBNC recommends that parents be informed about the results of an abnormal vision screen by a letter, which describes the reason for the abnormal screen and the need for follow-up for an eye examination. These letters include a form for the eye care provider to inform the screener about examination results. PBNC has developed a sample letter (see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-1059840511424413">Appendix A</xref>) in both English and Spanish that schools can modify. PBNC also recommends at least three additional attempts to contact parents by telephone or letter to assure that follow-up was completed. To assist with follow-up, PBNC provides vouchers for eye care and corrective lenses for those otherwise unable to afford these services.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-1059840511424413">
<title>Subject Selection and Data Collection</title>
<p>Ten elementary schools from four counties in North Carolina (Lenoir, Orange, Robeson, and Wilkes Counties) that adhered to the PBNC screening recommendations and administered all components of the program by PBNC certified trained screeners were included in this project. For each, school nurses administered the screening program.</p>
<p>Screening data were collected for all first-, third-, and fifth-grade students during the 2009–2010 school year. Data collection was restricted to these grades to minimize the extra burden placed on school nurses for the evaluation activities described in this report. In addition, follow-up tracking by the school nurses lasted only until March 2010, instead of to the end of the school year as is normally the case.</p>
<p>To encourage follow-up, parents were given a small incentive ($5 gift card) for assuring that the eye care follow-up form was returned after an eye examination, and the school nurses were given a small incentive ($10 gift card) for collecting data on each child that was referred and who had full completed follow-up information. This research was approved by the Duke University School of Medicine institutional review board. Because this was an evaluation of an existing public health program using deidentified data, a waiver of informed consent was granted.</p>

<sec id="section5-1059840511424413">
<title>Classification of Refractive Error</title>
<p>Refractive error was classified for those children who were referred for an abnormal screen and who had completed follow-up information available based on the strength of the lenses required for normal vision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1059840511424413">Negrel, Maul, Pokharel, Zhao, &amp; Ellwein, 2000</xref>). One measure of lens strength is Diopters (D) spherical equivalent (SE). Negative D SE implies myopia (i.e., near sightedness) and positive D SE implies hyperopia (i.e., far sightedness). For this study, children were classified with myopia for ≤−0.5 D SE in at least one eye. Hyperopia was classified as ≥+2.0 D SE. Astigmatism (i.e., refractive error due to irregular curvature of the eye) was classified as ≥+0.75 D cylinder. Anisometropia (i.e., differential refractive errors between the eyes, such as one eye with myopia and the other with hyperopia) was classified as ≥1 D SE difference between the eyes. Otherwise, children were classified as not having refractive error. For analysis, children were categorized into one of five groups: myopia regardless of other findings, hyperopia regardless of other findings, astigmatism without other findings, anisometropia without other findings, or no refractive error.</p>

<title>Screening Results</title>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1059840511424413">Figure 1</xref> illustrates the flow from screening through follow-up and treatment with corrective lenses. Overall, there were 2,726 children who were screened, of whom 7.7% (<italic>n</italic> = 209) had an abnormal screening result. There was no statistically significant difference in the overall proportion with an abnormal screening result by grade (6.2% of the 887 first graders, 9.1% of the 910 third graders, and 7.6% of the 929 fifth graders; <italic>p</italic> = .07). However, within one elementary school, the proportion of first graders (1.3%) who were referred was lower than the proportion of third (11.2%) or fifth graders (9.9%; <italic>p</italic> = .01). Among the children who had an abnormal vision screen, specific screening results were available for 186 (89%). Most (86.1%) of these children had an abnormal visual acuity test or a combination of abnormal visual acuity test and abnormal stereopsis test (8.0%). Few children were referred because of an abnormal stereopsis test alone (1.1%) or because of some other concern on the part of the screening (4.8%). Included among those with an abnormal vision screen were 37 children (19.8%) who were already wearing corrective lenses at the time of screening. Among those referred, the likelihood of already having corrective lenses increased with grade (first 14.6%; third 16.7%; fifth 26.9%; <italic>p</italic> = .04). Of the 209 with an abnormal screening result, 186 (89.0%) were entered into the database.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1059840511424413">
<title>Follow-Up Results and Receipt of New Corrective Lenses</title>
<p>For 106 (56.7%) of those who were referred and in the database, the results of the subsequent eye examination were collected by the school nurse. Another 15 (14.2%) were reported by parents to have had a follow-up eye examination, but the school nurses were unable to obtain the results. Of the children whose results were documented, 58 (54.7%) had myopia, 24 (22.6%) had hyperopia, 12 (11.3%) had astigmatism, 2 (1.9%) had anisometropia, and 10 (9.4%) were normal. None of the 28 children with glasses in the database who were referred for eye care (15%) had a normal eye examination and all but one received new glasses.</p>
<p>Most (88.7%, <italic>n</italic> = 94) of those who were referred received new corrective lenses. This included 88 (92%) of those with significant refractive error and 6 (40%) of those with no significant refractive error. The likelihood of receiving new corrective lenses after referral did not vary by grade (<italic>p</italic> = .99).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1059840511424413">
<title>Factors Associated With Lack of Follow-Up</title>
<p>The likelihood of having documentation of a complete eye examination did not vary by grade (<italic>p</italic> = .91). Three schools were outliers in verifying and obtaining documentation of follow-up eye examinations. One school, which only referred three children, had documentation on one (33.3%). Another school, which referred 19 children, had documentation on 2 (10.5%). In contrast to these schools, one had documentation on all 15 children referred (100%). Among the other schools, the proportion with documentation ranged from 43.2% to 80.0%.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-1059840511424413">
<title>Discussion</title>
<p>About two third of the children who had an abnormal vision screen had documented follow-up by 6 months after screening, and most of these children had refractive error that required corrective lenses. This evaluation supports the importance of school nurse administered vision screening programs. Even without improving follow-up, this program led to the identification of at least three cases of refractive error for every 100 children screened.</p>
<p>Because few children (8%) had an abnormal Lang II stereopsis test and even fewer were referred for an abnormal stereopsis test alone (1.1%), this study suggests that stereopsis added little to the screening program. In the future, consideration should be made to replacing this test with the random dot E test, which has greater sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1059840511424413">Hammond &amp; Schmidt, 1986</xref>). However, this test is also more time consuming to administer.</p>
<p>One of the greatest challenges in evaluating community-based screening programs is determining the degree to which missed follow-up is due to actual failure to follow-up or failure to obtain documentation of follow-up. The database system helped improve the process for the school nurses but relied on nurses to track and enter data. A potential long-term solution would be the development of automated systems for health information exchange and tracking. Although there is much work around the meaningful use of electronic health records, the degree to which school programs or public health agencies could access or add health data is unclear. This would be an optimal solution for assuring that the results of vision screening were known by both families and other health care providers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1059840511424413">Jha, 2010</xref>). Such data would also be helpful for school-based interventions to improve eyeglass use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1059840511424413">Ethan, Basch, Platt, Bogen, &amp; Zybert, 2010</xref>) by alerting teachers and school nurses about which children require corrective lenses. However, in addition to the significant technical hurdles, adopting this approach would require careful attention to privacy issues and rules (e.g., the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act).</p>
<p>A more feasible approach might be to embed vision screening within a coordinated school health program (CSHP). CSHPs provide a framework for students’ “physical, mental, and social well-being” (Center for School Health at Education Development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1059840511424413">Center, 2011</xref>) through the provision of coordinated services. This approach improves outcomes by leveraging available resources in an efficient and coordinated manner to improve both health and learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1059840511424413">National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, 2011</xref>). Components of CSHPs that would directly benefit vision screening, diagnosis, and treatment include involvement of families and community organizations, comprehensive school health education, school health services, and the availability of social services (Center for School Health at Education Development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1059840511424413">Center, 2011</xref>). Opportunities from this approach include having school nurses and teachers work with families to assure that students have follow-up after an abnormal screen and that students use corrective lenses as prescribed. North Carolina is the receipient of federal funds to develop a CSHP, and each local school district is required to have a School Health Advisory Council (SHAC). Future work may include better integration of vision screening into activities of the SHAC.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section12-1059840511424413">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>The main limitation of this study is the inability to calculate the positive predictive value of the screening program because of the lack of follow-up data among nearly 30% of the children who were referred. Another limitation is that there is variation across eye care providers (e.g., ophthalmologists, optometrists) in how refractive error is diagnosed and the threshold for treatment. Controlling for these differences, however, goes beyond what a screening program can do. Finally, findings from this evaluation may not be generalizable to other communities.</p>
<sec id="section13-1059840511424413">
<title>Implications for School Nurse Practice</title>
<p>School-based vision screening programs such as the one in North Carolina lead to the identification and treatment of refractive error for most children who have follow-up after a positive screen. Even with incomplete follow-up, many children with significant refractive error receive corrective lenses. Schools are under tremendous financial pressure to provide high-quality educational services for children, and many communities do not have additional resources for comprehensive school health programs. This evaluation underscores the benefit of these programs even with partial documentation or completion of follow-up. In the future, using CSHPs or involvement of the SHACs may improve follow-up, treatment, and long-term health and educational outcomes.</p>
