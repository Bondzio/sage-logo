<abstract>
<p>A building energy use dataset from over 100 performing arts buildings was created by Julie’s Bicycle and Oxford University’s Environmental Change Institute. The dataset was used to test the robustness of CIBSE’s TM46 entertainment hall benchmark, the closest building type category for performing arts buildings. Based on the analysis it is found that 110 kWh/m<sup>2</sup>/yr electricity and 140 kWh/m<sup>2</sup>/yr gas are more robust benchmarks than TM46 180 kWh/m<sup>2</sup>/yr electricity and 420 kWh/m<sup>2</sup>/yr gas and that seating capacity is a more useful relative measure than floor area. Therefore, after consultation with CIBSE, Julie’s Bicycle and Theatres Trust will adopt the new benchmarks for co-display with Display Energy Certificates and voluntary energy reporting. The energy analysis will be extended to other arts buildings.</p>
<p><bold><italic>Practical application:</italic></bold> Performing arts venues provide a challenge to the modern professional in the building industry. Running on the tightest budget and rarely employing staff with formal building management training, these buildings face significant technical and financial trials in order to operate in a cost- and carbon-efficient manner. Energy benchmarks can be applied in new and existing buildings, to test designs, motivate owner and occupant action and unlock funds for building energy performance improvement.</p>

<sec id="sec2-0143624412465093"><title>The need for benchmarks</title>
<p>Benchmarking allows an organisation to compare energy performance with a sector-specific average and set intelligent targets for improvement.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0143624412465093">1</xref></sup></p>
<p>Performing arts buildings undertake a range of functions: office, catering, rehearsal, production (such as manufacturing and staging) and hosting performances. Historically, the performing arts have not collated or shared their building energy performance: the first systematic attempt for the music industry<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0143624412465093">2</xref></sup> gathered data for many building types and activities and, in-so-doing highlighted the paucity of data.</p>
<p>The performing arts need accurate benchmarks that address their cultural context, to help them improve their energy performance (D/E energy efficiency A-G benchmark rating boundary). Many drivers impact them including: funder requirements (such as Arts Council England); financial viability; legislative requirements (such as for Display Energy Certificates (DEC)) and compliance (CRC Energy Efficiency League Tables, local authority targets). For networks of venues, grouped by, for example, owner, art form or geography, benchmarks will facilitate knowledge sharing as well as competition to reduce energy use and resulting emissions as far and fast as possible. Performing arts buildings are highly visible, at a local and often on a national or international scale. Performing arts venues contribute significantly to the stock of the UK’s public buildings: for example there are ∼2200 music venues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0143624412465093">2</xref></sup> and ∼3000 theatres on the Theatres Trust database, though some of these theatres are no longer operational and there is some overlap. For all these reasons it is important that meaningful benchmarks are applied to help building managers, artists and audience to navigate energy issues.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec3-0143624412465093"><title>The rationale for benchmark review</title>
<p>In 2011, CIBSE’s energy benchmarks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0143624412465093">3</xref></sup> were reviewed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0143624412465093">4</xref></sup> The review compared benchmarks with actual DEC results. For all building types with a sample size of over 50 buildings, those of concern were those with a median operational rating outside ±25% of 100 and/or one DEC grade away from the D/E boundary. The review identified the entertainment halls benchmark to be one of the categories of concern against both criteria. The benchmark is too generous (i.e. the values for gas and electricity too high per m<sup>2</sup> per year) and the minimum hours of use may be too high. The benchmark is understood to be derived from older commercial cinemas, which could have significantly different energy use and hours of use compared to performing arts venues.</p>
<p>The growing awareness amongst venue operators that the environmental and economic impacts of energy use are business-critical concerns has significantly improved data quality and availability since 2008. This paper uses a newly compiled energy use dataset collated from across the performing arts to recommend improvements to the benchmark.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="sec4-0143624412465093" sec-type="methods"><title>Method</title>
<p>This section describes the data sources used to create the dataset, data cleaning, data analysis and benchmark calculation.</p>
<p>The dataset was derived from building energy use data collected through energy audits and two self-reporting online software tools: IG Tools<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0143624412465093">5</xref></sup> (Julie’s Bicycle) and sMeasure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0143624412465093">6</xref></sup> (developed from research by Oxford University’s Environmental Change Institute – ECI). This enabled a range of performing arts buildings, including theatre, music and dance energy use to be analysed. The seating capacity of these buildings ranged from 40 to 15,600 seats. Some of the mixed-use venues include cinema screens but no cinema-only venues are included. The current CIBSE entertainment halls benchmark includes dancing schools, therefore rehearsal spaces have been included.</p>
<sec id="sec5-0143624412465093"><title>Annual greenhouse gas audits</title>
<p>Annual greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions audits for buildings are a source of annual electricity, gas and oil consumption based on billing. Auditors collated kWh data, which improved reliability as compared to self-reporting. Venues also report their floor area, seating capacity and number of performances to act as factors to compare their performance over time and with other venues.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec6-0143624412465093"><title>Industry Green tools</title>
<p>The Industry Green tools<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0143624412465093">5</xref></sup> are online calculators developed by Julie’s Bicycle for organisations running festivals, venues, tours and offices, to calculate their annual GHG emissions. Users with venues enter their building energy consumption on an annual or a monthly basis, which may be sourced from billing or meter readings. In addition, performing arts organisations are asked for building floor area, seating capacity as well as numbers of performances and ticket sales for the respective years being calculated. Once data is submitted, it is checked and, if any data looks unusual Julie’s Bicycle contacts the user.</p>
<p>The Industry Green tools have been available for just over 2 years, capturing energy data that was not previously available. They provide a low-cost, efficient and effective means to gather sector intelligence and feedback to the sector quickly. IG Tools are self-reporting and rely on the end-user to accurately input data.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec7-0143624412465093"><title>Measure</title>
<p>Oxford University’s Environmental Change Institute has developed an energy management software – sMeasure – for buildings of all types.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0143624412465093">6</xref></sup> Julie’s Bicycle has shared this tool with the performing arts (and wider creative industries) and the Theatres Trust has used it as the core of the ERDF-funded EcoVenue project. Building energy consumption is accurately calculated using weekly meter readings by fuel type (i.e. electricity, gas and oil). sMeasure integrates weekly heating degree days data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0143624412465093">7</xref></sup> to weather normalise fossil fuel consumption and provide energy efficiency feedback on building fabric and heating systems. Weather normalisation also allows annual energy consumption to be estimated from less than a year of readings, provided data covers a range of heating and non-heating weekly degree days. sMeasure is a self-reporting tool and relies on the end-user to accurately input data. sMeasure has been available for 5 years.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec8-0143624412465093"><title>Definitions of floor area and capacity</title>
<p>The guidance on floor area for audits, Industry Green and sMeasure accords with the CIBSE guidance of gross internal floor area (GIFA), minus balconies and circles. A useful way to visualise GIFA for a venue = (total footprint − performance area) × number of floors + performance area − (balconies + circles). Guide F (Table 20.1) is clear that balcony and circle areas are excluded for theatres, cinemas, social clubs and bingo clubs.</p>
<p>The Industry Green guidance on capacity is to use the maximum seating or standing capacity, whichever is largest. For those venues with more than one performance space, the capacity of each space is summed. Capacity of separate café and bar areas is not included.</p>
<p>Anecdotal evidence shows many performing arts venues do not know their floor area and do not have access to the plans to precisely measure it. While building managers can immediately recall their capacity, floor area is rarely a measure they know as accurately. Many performing arts buildings have one or more of the following features: pre-date 1950s; formed from a mix of adjoining buildings; in refurbished buildings not originally built for performance arts functions or have complex land and building ownership histories. All these factors reduce the likelihood of having access to reliable plans. Even if plans are available, ensuring that balcony and circle areas are correctly removed from total floor area can be error-prone. Floor area and capacity are explored further in the results and discussion.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec9-0143624412465093"><title>Data cleaning</title>
<p>A summary of venue GHG audit results was accessed. As some venues have received repeat audits, the 22 most recent entries were chosen.</p>
<p>The Industry Green tool database of venues was accessed. All tests and anonymous entries were removed. All entries with either no floor area or capacity or with no energy data were removed. Venues outside the UK were removed. For venues that had entered multiple years, the latest year was chosen: 41 entries remained.</p>
<p>A download of sMeasure results from buildings classified as entertainment halls was accessed. Non-weather normalised data was used. Entries with fewer than 25 readings or no floor area were removed: 94 entries remained.</p>
<p>Entries were combined from all three data sources and duplicate entries for the same venue were removed by choosing the most recent data. Data covered both financial and calendar years, covering 2009–2011. A total of 118 entries remained for analysis.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec10-0143624412465093"><title>Data analysis</title>
<p>The collated dataset was tested for effect of type of venue and size of venue on energy performance (see section ‘Effect of size and type of venue’): both results showed benchmark sub-categories are unnecessary due to no clear relationships or groupings. The result is the simplicity of a single benchmark regardless of size or art form.</p>
<p>Median benchmarks for electricity and gas were calculated. Experience with groups of venues that are confidentially sharing reliable data within the group is that relative energy performance ranges by a factor of 10 between the least and most efficient. An example of one such group is shared in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0143624412465093">Table 1</xref> below. A wide range of performance was expected from the combined dataset. However, the full dataset had an even wider range than a factor of 10. Therefore, benchmarks were calculated for differing ranges of the dataset to test resulting benchmark reliability: sample size and standard deviation were used as the criteria of reliability.

<p>For benchmarks relative to floor area – the most standard way to compare energy performance between buildings – the most and least efficient performance varied by a factor of 30. This is expected to be largely due to the uncertainty about floor area as discussed in section ‘Definitions of floor area and capacity’ above. Four ranges were chosen to test both the electricity and gas kWh/m<sup>2</sup>/yr data:
<list id="list1-0143624412465093" list-type="alpha-upper">
<list-item><p>45–1000 kWh/m<sup>2</sup>/yr – to test the full range.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>45–450 kWh/m<sup>2</sup>/yr – to test a range of a factor of 10 commonly seen in confidential venue groupings.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>50–400 kWh/m<sup>2</sup>/yr – a tighter range than B to test data robustness.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>100–1200 kWh/m<sup>2</sup>/yr – to test exclusion of the most efficient buildings.</p></list-item>
</list></p>
<p>For benchmarks relative to capacity, the dataset proved more reliable: the electricity and gas per seat only varied by a factor of 10. This supports the concerns over the floor area data that varied by a factor of 30. A similar set of four ranges were chosen to test both the electricity and gas kWh/seat/yr data:
<list id="list2-0143624412465093" list-type="alpha-upper">
<list-item><p>100–1000 kWh/seat/yr – to test the full range.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>100–800 kWh/seat/yr – a tighter range than E to test data robustness.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>100–600 kWh/seat/yr – a tighter range than F to test data robustness.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>200–1000 kWh/seat/yr – to test exclusion of the most efficient buildings.</p></list-item>

The distribution of electricity kWh/seat/yr in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0143624412465093">Figure 1</xref> shows an asymmetrical distribution with a long tail and the commonest performance being within 100–300 kWh/seat/yr. The distribution of gas kW/seat/yr in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0143624412465093">Figure 2</xref> is less well characterised. Although the commonest performance is 200–400 kWh/seat/yr the distribution’s tail is fatter, suggesting allowance could be made for higher gas use.

<p>Before benchmark calculation, analysis was needed to test whether different benchmarks were required for different art forms or scales of venue.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0143624412465093">Figure 3</xref> illustrates the data below 2000 kWh/seat/yr for both electricity and gas. This highlights no clear relationship between energy consumption and art form, due to the intermingled scatter of venue types and no evidence of groupings.

<p>To investigate whether venue size is a determinant of energy efficiency, carbon (Kg CO<sub>2</sub>e) emissions per seat were plotted against capacity. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0143624412465093">Figure 4</xref> illustrates the venues with emissions between 120 and 940 KgCO<sub>2</sub>e/seat/yr. This shows that venue size does not influence energy efficiency, particularly as the small- and medium-sized venues show the full range of carbon emissions. The results for small and medium venues are easier to see by zooming in on the results, excluding venues over 3000 seats, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0143624412465093">Figure 5</xref>.

However, seating capacity is a more useful relative measure than floor area and therefore it is recommended performing arts use 320 kWh/seat/yr electricity and 370 kWh/seat/yr gas. A TM46 relative benchmark based on seating capacity is 520 kWh/seat/yr electricity and 1220 kWh/seat/yr gas. A TM46 benchmark relative to seating capacity was estimated based on the median 2.9 m<sup>2</sup>/seat from section ‘Relationships between floor area and capacity’.

<p>It is recommended that this benchmark be applied to the auditoria, concert halls, dancing schools, entertainment halls and theatres currently covered by the entertainment halls benchmarks. We also recommend casino, bingo and cinema only venues should be covered by a separate benchmark(s). An additional recommendation is that arts centres are removed from the cultural activities benchmark in TM46 and included with the performing arts venues, as anecdotal evidence suggests arts centres often have a larger performing content than visual arts content.</p>
<p>These recommendations are based on the larger and more sector-specific dataset analysed here compared to the current CIBSE benchmark. Collation, analysis and application of these benchmarks raise a number of issues discussed below.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec19-0143624412465093"><title>Size and sector differentiation are unnecessary</title>
<p>Size differentiation due to larger venues either being more likely to have air conditioning or achieving an efficiency of scale might have been expected, though was not identified. It is possible that the two factors effectively cancelled each other out or that with an even larger dataset or with improved energy efficiency across all venues a trend will emerge.</p>
<p>Sector differentiation could be expected due to the differing show power demands, for example between dance and musical theatre. However, this has not been proven, which may be due to evidence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0143624412465093">8</xref></sup> and anecdotes that the majority of energy use within any venue is due to heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) not show power.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec20-0143624412465093"><title>Capacity is more sensitive than floor area</title>
<p>The capacity relative benchmark is more sensitive than the current standard of floor area relative. This may be partly due to capacity benefitting from a more reliable dataset. Many venues do not know their floor area whereas all know their capacity, as discussed in section ‘Definitions of floor area and capacity’ above. A comparison of floor area showed a significant amount of scatter, suggesting that floor area has been both over and under-reported. Analysis of median floor area (2.9 m<sup>2</sup>/seat) means that floor areas and floor area relative results can be tested and converted.</p>
<p>Underlying the improvements seen when using capacity may also be the possibility that capacity reflects the size, particularly the volume, of the venue and its HVAC consumption better than floor area. For example, capacity is a better proxy for high ceilings and balconies responsible for much HVAC energy use but excluded from GIFA. Therefore, a shift in emphasis towards the capacity relative benchmark is recommended.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec21-0143624412465093"><title>Reflecting activity intensity is problematic</title>
<p>Work with individual venues and groups of venues is highlighting that venue managers feel that opening hours, number of performances, length of performances and activities such as restaurants and bars are skewing their results. The existing benchmarks can be adjusted according to hours of use. No information was available from CIBSE on how many DEC assessors had made use of this adjustment. The current guideline is that occupancy must be &gt;20% of maximum occupancy for the building to be considered open. Due to the large capacity of venues, it is unlikely that public use of a bar, a rehearsal, overnight stage builds or dismantling, or the staff being present during office hours would qualify as officially occupied. This guideline could be adjusted for venues though guidance would have to be detailed and possibly restrictive to enable consistent application across various venues.</p>
<p>Over the next 12 months, it will be assessed whether a more straightforward and useful measure of activity will be the number of performances, resulting in a benchmark of kWh/performance/seat. This will provide an adjustment to take account of dark periods, matinees and the range of performances a venue may host. Experience to date shows that venues can gather this data, that it must not become confused with number of rehearsals and for venues with multiple performance spaces a capacity-weighted number of performances is required. Guidance on collating performance numbers is within the IG tool and will be shared more widely. Performance numbers reflect the time over which the performance space needs to be heated, cooled and ventilated, reflecting the single biggest energy demand within venues.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec22-0143624412465093"><title>Separables and isolating venue energy</title>
<p>Experience so far suggests few venues have sufficient meters or sub-meters to allow use of separables and that no separables have been identified. Separating office activity and catering functions could help isolate and improve the performing arts venue benchmark and improve managers’ understanding and control of their buildings. Venues that may particularly benefit from this include those with significant year-round office-based education activities, relatively few performances or large catering facilities. Over the next 12 months, as new data becomes available from buildings using sub-metering, clip-on meters and smart meters venue energy use will be isolated from office and catering.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec23-0143624412465093"><title>Performing arts buildings are relatively unique</title>
<p>The most useful benchmark is one that a building develops using its own performance over time. Considering the unique built fabric and functions within performance arts buildings, this is a vital approach that will be recommended as a starting point for all for understanding building energy use efficiency.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec24-0143624412465093"><title>Next steps</title>
<p>Julie’s Bicycle and the Theatres Trust are developing a DEC co-display document in collaboration with the CIBSE benchmark group, applying the recommended benchmarks. Venues are encouraged to use the benchmarks to provide a reliable indicator of relative progress towards energy efficiency. Application of the new benchmark is considered particularly useful as the existing TM46 benchmark has proven inappropriate. It is hoped that TM46 will be updated using the data presented here. In the meantime, the promulgation of an update before or instead of a TM46 update through co-display and voluntary reporting should help prepare or improve the sector.</p>
<p>Over 2012–2013, further research will be done to test number of performances and isolating venue energy from office and catering energy as further improvements upon the new benchmark. More data from a range of venues, especially music, dance and mixed-use venues and medium-large scale venues will be gathered, allowing a thorough review of this paper.</p>
<p>Energy use data for galleries and museums is being gathered via the IG Tools and sMeasure so this benchmark analysis can be extended to test whether the CIBSE cultural activities benchmark can be helpfully reviewed.</p>
