<p><bold>Objective:</bold> The objective of this paper is to describe and discuss a municipal model for prevention, identification and treatment of postpartum depression (PPD).</p>
<p><bold>Major findings:</bold> The changed care in the municipality was associated with a significant difference in Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale scores between the intervention municipality and the usual care municipality at 6 weeks, 3, 6 and 12 months postpartum. The women who had been depressed at least once during the first postpartum year reported significantly higher levels of parenting stress at 12 months. The public health nurses found the scale easy to score and easy for the mothers to complete, and they were confident that they identified PPD more frequently than before.</p>
<p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The results of the present study suggest a basis for a municipality model that gives the primary health care system better possibilities to help women with mental health problems in the postpartum period. The changed care consisted of several elements considered important for the result of this study. The results can be incorporated in a descriptive model for prevention, identification and treatment in municipalities. The components are (1) preconditions in the municipality, (2) initiatives to prevent PPD, (3) identification of women with PPD, (4) treatment of PPD and (5) follow-up.</p>

<sec id="sec1-1744987111433447" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title>
<p>Postpartum depression (PPD) is reported to be the most frequent psychiatric disorder to occur after childbirth; the prevalence rate is reported to be 10–15% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1744987111433447">Cox and Holden, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1744987111433447">Kendall-Tackett, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1744987111433447">Rubertsson et al., 2005</xref>). Pregnancy and the period following delivery is a transition in life with changes and challenges. The distinction between a natural reaction to a major transition in life and a disorder can be difficult to detect, both for a new mother and for people around her. For many women, this is a period of increased psychological vulnerability and distress, detectable across a broad spectrum of reactions with consequences for the woman’s well-being, bonding between the mother and child and the whole family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1744987111433447">Cox and Holden, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1744987111433447">Kendall-Tackett, 2005</xref>). Transition to motherhood may cause a great deal of stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1744987111433447">Kendall-Tackett, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1744987111433447">Wilkins, 2006</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1744987111433447">Chick and Meleis (1986)</xref>, one response to transition events, such as parenthood, is depression. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1744987111433447">Brockington (2004)</xref> states that childbearing is the most complex event in human experience and that recently delivered mothers are vulnerable to the whole spectrum of general psychiatric disorders.</p>
<p>A mother’s depression may affect her relationship with her child, as well as the quality of care she provides. Due to disturbed maternal sensitivity, the child may develop an insecure attachment to its mother, which may affect the child’s later emotional and cognitive development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1744987111433447">Dennis, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1744987111433447">McLearn et al., 2006</xref>). Maternal depressive symptoms might also contribute to unfavourable parenting practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1744987111433447">McLearn et al., 2006</xref>), and depressed mothers report higher parenting stress than non-depressed mothers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1744987111433447">Abidin, 1995</xref>). Thus, identifying and treating PPD as early as possible may be critical.</p>
<p>Despite growing evidence that PPD can be effectively treated and possibly prevented, this disturbance is still undetected or untreated in many women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1744987111433447">Dennis, 2009</xref>). Several barriers to detection and treatment are described: women lack knowledge about PPD, they deny or minimise their symptoms, they assume their problems are common after giving birth or they are not aware of the treatment options. Barriers among clinicians and in the health care system, as well as economic and personal factors, caused low treatment rates among a sample of at-risk women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1744987111433447">Horowitz and Cousins, 2006</xref>). Health professionals may trivialise symptoms or offer treatment that is not suitable for the women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1744987111433447">Dennis, 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>Universal PPD screening during well-child care visits has been shown to increase the detection of PPD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1744987111433447">McLearn et al., 2006</xref>). Early intervention through primary health services within the existing system has been shown to prevent long-term PPD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1744987111433447">Dennis and Creedy, 2004</xref>). Psychosocial and psychological interventions may be effective treatment options for mothers with PPD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1744987111433447">Dennis and Hodnett, 2007</xref>). A recent study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1744987111433447">Morrell et al. (2009)</xref> provides evidence that health visitors can be trained to identify and treat PPD. In a review of 21 studies of preventative interventions for PPD, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1744987111433447">Boath et al. (2005)</xref> found several studies suggesting positive short-term effects of psychological or supportive interventions. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1744987111433447">Dennis et al. (2009)</xref>, women who received peer support had half the risk of developing PPD at 12 weeks postpartum than those in the control group.</p>
<p>As many women do not report physical or emotional disorders after childbirth, the primary health care service does not adequately address their needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1744987111433447">Cox and Holden, 2003</xref>). There is a need for comprehensive screening programmes and better organisation of care for preventing and treating PPD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1744987111433447">Dennis, 2009</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1744987111433447">McLearn et al. (2006)</xref>, identification, guidance and referral related to women’s mental health are a professional responsibility. Nurses are well positioned to counsel depressed mothers about treatment options, to make recommendations and to provide referrals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1744987111433447">Horowitz and Goodman, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>The present study was conducted in Norway, where the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1744987111433447">Local Community Health Care Act (1982)</xref> requires all municipalities to organise maternity care and well-baby clinics for infants 0–5 years old. The service must keep a record of physical, mental and social health status and other matters that are of concern for children’s health and welfare (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1744987111433447">Norwegian Directorate of Health, 2004</xref>). The well-baby clinics offer comprehensive preventive and health-promoting services for children, as well as for adolescents and families. The well-baby clinics play a central role in providing information and support to the family during the first years of a child’s life. The basic staffing in the clinics consists of a midwife, public health nurse (PHN), physician and a health secretary. The well-baby clinics work in close co-operation with other public services in the municipality. Each child makes 12–15 visits up to school age, including eight vaccinations by the PHN and five routine examinations by a doctor. The PHNs have a central role in this service and are the health care workers who meet the family most frequently. The work of the PHNs is often at a universal level and may be both indicatively preventive and selectively preventive (Ministry of Education and Research, 2005). Within Norway the secondary services for mothers with more severe PPD include access to psychologists or psychiatrists in the municipality or in the specialist health services.</p>
<p>Four papers have been published from this study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1744987111433447">Glavin et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1744987111433447">2010a</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1744987111433447">b</xref>,c). They demonstrated that the changed care in the municipality was associated with a significant difference in Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) scores between the intervention municipality and the usual care municipality at 6 weeks, 3, 6 and 12 months postpartum. However, the municipality model has not been described and discussed. This model is now used in about one fourth of the municipalities in Norway, and many municipalities are training PHNs to start working this way. The model could be used in other countries and settings if the criteria are met. This paper’s objective is to describe and discuss a municipality model for prevention, identification and treatment for PPD.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec2-1744987111433447" sec-type="methods"><title>Methodology</title>
<p>A quasi-experimental post-test design to investigate the effect of prevention and treatment of PPD was used. The study population comprised postpartum women, residing in two large municipalities near Oslo, who had delivered a live-born child between June 2005 and December 2006. They were eligible for inclusion if (1) they were over 18 years old, (2) the birth took place within the municipality in the study period, (3) they could read and understand Norwegian and (4) they were not currently undergoing treatment for depression. In total, 2247 women were enrolled: 1806 in the intervention municipality and 441 in the usual care municipality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1744987111433447">Glavin et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1744987111433447">2010a</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1744987111433447">b</xref>). PHNs (26) in the intervention municipality were trained to identify PPD using the EPDS and a clinical assessment, and to provide supportive counselling. Measurements: EPDS at 6 weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1744987111433447">Glavin et al., 2009</xref>), and again at 3 months, 6 months and 12 months postpartum, and the Parenting Stress Index (PSI) at 12 months postpartum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1744987111433447">Glavin et al., 2010a</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1744987111433447">b</xref>). A descriptive qualitative study, based on in-depth interviews with 11 nurses, was conducted to describe the PHNs’ experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1744987111433447">Glavin et al., 2010c</xref>). The methodology is further described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1744987111433447">Glavin et al.

<sec id="sec4-1744987111433447"><title>Training programme</title>
<p>The PHNs, the midwives and the psychologists in the intervention municipality participated in a PPD training programme over five days in 2005. Experienced psychologists and researchers gave the lectures. The training programme covered five main elements: (1) PPD as a phenomenon, risk factors, symptoms and treatment; (2) identification of mental health problems in new mothers; (3) EPDS forms and the scoring of these in combination with clinical judgment to identify postpartum mothers with depressive symptoms; (4) supportive conversational methods; (5) monthly supervision in groups (8–10 PHNs and midwives in each group) through the entire period, with psychologists from the public health service in the municipality as supervisors (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1744987111433447">Table 1</xref>).

<sec id="sec5-1744987111433447"><title>Intervention procedure</title>
<p>The following elements constituted the main content of the intervention procedure postpartum: (1) increased focus on maternal mental health at a home visit about two weeks after delivery; (2) identification of women with PPD at six weeks postpartum with EPDS and a clinical assessment by the PHN; (3) one counselling session by the PHN after the mothers had completed the EPDS at six weeks postpartum; (4) supportive counselling sessions for the mothers with severe depressive symptoms; (5) openness about mental health issues at every visit to the well-baby clinic; and (6) a system for referral for further treatment in the municipality.</p>
<p>As part of the municipality’s screening procedure, the PHNs provided general information about mental health problems that may occur in the postpartum period, and each family received an information brochure at the first home visit about two weeks after the birth. The PHNs encouraged the fathers to be at home during the home visit. The parents were also invited to contact the well-baby clinic about the mother’s possible mental health problems before the appointment at six weeks postpartum.</p>
<p>All mothers in the intervention municipality had one counselling session with the PHN after completing the EPDS at six weeks, with a focus on the women’s mental health. The time at the six-week appointment was increased from 20 minutes to 40 minutes to allow for the counselling session after the women had filled in the EPDS. The Norwegian EPDS validation study recommends a cut-off score of 10 to identify women with PPD, with a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 87% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1744987111433447">Eberhard-Gran et al., 2001</xref>)<italic>.</italic> Sensitivity and specificity are somewhat different depending on how high the score for depression is set; with a cut-off score of 10 some false positives results will arise. The EPDS, however, is a screening device and not a diagnostic tool and movement to treatment depended on the PHN assessment and not just on the EPDS score. A clinical assessment by the PHN, charting the woman’s current condition, how serious her problems were, the woman’s history of mental health problems and the woman’s wishes, was important for further follow-up. The women who scored ≥10 on the EPDS, and whom the PHN assessed as needing treatment, were then offered more supportive counselling sessions with the PHN between six weeks and three months postpartum. The counselling took place at the well-baby clinic and each woman was followed up by the same PHN during the entire period. Each supportive counselling session lasted about 30 minutes. The number of counselling sessions was individualised according to each woman’s need after assessment by the PHN and in agreement with the woman (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1744987111433447">Glavin et al., 2010a</xref>).</p>
<p>In the supportive counselling sessions, the PHN used active listening and empathetic communication (non-directive counselling) as a method, and the significance of establishing a positive relationship between the woman and the PHN was considered important. The PHN was acting as an understanding listener, helping the woman by providing advice and alternate interpretations to past events only when asked (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1744987111433447">Rogers, 1951</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1744987111433447">1980</xref>). The method focused on the woman’s experience, reflections and ability to manage her own problems. Some main elements were emphasised in the counselling: (1) to listen and try to understand how things are from the woman’s point of view; (2) to check their own understanding of the situation with the woman if unsure; (3) to treat the woman with the utmost respect and regard; (4) to be self-aware, self-accepting and open with the woman. If the PHN made the judgment that a woman needed further help for her depression, she was referred to the municipality’s mental health team, which included psychologists who could treat women with serious depression. The content of the psychologists’ treatment is not described, as this not was a part of this study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1744987111433447">Glavin et al., 2010a</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1744987111433447">b</xref>).</p></sec>
<sec id="sec6-1744987111433447"><title>Procedure in the usual care municipality</title>
<p>The PHNs in the usual care municipality did not receive any training in PPD, and the women received the standard service provided by the well-baby clinics. This service included a home visit at two weeks postpartum and follow-up appointments at the well-baby clinic at about 10 time points during the child’s first year of life, but did not include a special focus on mothers’ mental health.</p></sec></sec>
<sec id="sec7-1744987111433447" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title>
<p>The municipalities did not differ significantly socially and economically; the proportion of the population in the two municipalities that was unemployed was 1.8% in CG and 1.6% in EG; the proportion of children 0–17 years old was 26.6% in CG and 25.5% in EG; the proportion of immigrants was 7.2% and 7.7%, respectively; and the proportion with higher education 40.9% and 43.0%, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1744987111433447">Glavin et al., 2009</xref>). In Norway the total overall unemployment rate was higher, but the proportion of children, the proportion of immigrants and the proportion with higher education were lower than in the two municipalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1744987111433447">Statistics Norway, 2007</xref>).</p>
<p>The prevalence of PPD (EPDS ≥ 10) was 10.1%. However, there was a significant difference between the municipalities, with a prevalence of 14.4% in the usual care municipality and 9% in the intervention municipality. Primiparous mothers showed a higher prevalence than multiparous mothers did, and the oldest mothers (36 years and over) showed the highest prevalence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1744987111433447">Glavin et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>A total of 228 women scored ≥10 at the EPDS at six weeks, 64 in the usual care municipality and 164 in the intervention municipality. As the birth rate was lower in the comparison municipality than in the intervention municipality, there were more women in the intervention municipality participating in the study. Of the 164 women in the intervention municipality, 56 received more extensive intervention (2–7 supportive counselling sessions, mean 3.4, SD = 1.1); this subgroup is designated EG2 (more extensive). The other subgroup, EG1 (less extensive), received only one supportive counselling session after completing the EPDS at six weeks postpartum. Referral to the municipality’s mental health team was reported for one woman in the EG1 group, and 19 women in the EG2 group. The mean EPDS score at baseline was 12.6. The mean score at baseline for the intervention municipality and the usual care municipality was similar for the two groups (p = 0.76). The mean score for EG2 was significantly higher than the mean score for the other two groups, EG1 (p &lt; 0.01) and the usual care municipality (p &lt; 0.01). The mean difference was significant between the usual care municipality and intervention municipality at 3 months (p &lt; 0.01), at 6 months (p &lt; 0.01) and at 12 months (p 0.02) postpartum. The women who received only one supportive counselling session after completing the EPDS at six weeks postpartum also demonstrated a significantly higher decrease in the depression score than the women in the usual care municipality. Supportive counselling sessions provided by PHNs to women with more severe depressive symptoms resulted in a significant difference in the depression score between the municipalities up to 12 months postpartum. In the total period, the depression score in the intervention municipality fell by 5.9 points, versus 3.4 points in the usual care municipality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1744987111433447">Figure 1</xref>). The women who, in addition to the supportive counselling sessions with the PHN, were referred for further treatment (19 women) did not evince a more substantial decrease in depression score than the others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1744987111433447">Glavin et al., 2010a</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1744987111433447">b</xref>).
<fig id="fig1-1744987111433447" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Mean difference in EPDS score in the groups (women scoring ≥10) at all measurement times.

<p>The changed care yielded a significant group difference on EPDS scores at 6 weeks, 3, 6 and 12 months postpartum for all women. The mean EPDS score for the intervention municipality was significantly lower than the mean score for the usual care municipality at all measurement points (p &lt; 0.01). The overall prevalence of depression (EPDS ≥ 10) at six weeks postpartum was 10.1% (228/2247). The prevalence rate was significantly lower in the intervention municipality (9.1%) than in the usual care municipality (14.5%) at six weeks. At 3 months the prevalence rate was 5.5% (4.3% in the intervention municipality and 10.4% in the usual care municipality), at 6 months the prevalence rate was 4.6% (3.6% in the intervention municipality and 8.8% in the usual care municipality), and at 12 months the prevalence rate was 3.6% (3.0% in the intervention municipality and 5.9% in the usual care municipality). The decrease in depression score for all women was significantly lower in the usual care municipality than in the intervention municipality at 3 months and 6 months, and lower but not significant at 12 months (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1744987111433447">Figure 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1744987111433447">Glavin et al., 2010b</xref>).

<p>The women who had been depressed at least once during the first postpartum year reported significantly higher levels of parenting stress at 12 months. The Pearson correlation coefficients between the PSI and EPDS were all positive (a high PSI score was associated with a high EPDS score) and in the range from 0.17 to 0.50. All correlations were statistically significant (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01). The results are further described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1744987111433447">Glavin et al.

<p>The PHNs regarded the screening procedure as valuable and felt that the training they had received made them more confident about supporting parents by discussing mental health problems.

<p>The results of the present study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1744987111433447">Glavin et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1744987111433447">2010a</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1744987111433447">b</xref>,c) suggest a basis for a municipality model that gives the primary health care system better possibilities to help women with mental health problems in the postpartum period. The changed care consisted of several elements that are considered important for the result of this study. The municipality model can be placed together in a descriptive model for prevention, identification and treatment of PPD in the municipalities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1744987111433447">Figure 3</xref>). The components in the model are (1) preconditions in the municipality, (2) initiatives to prevent PPD, (3) identification of women with PPD, (4) treatment of PPD and (5) follow-up. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-1744987111433447">Figure 3</xref> shows the descriptive model that structures the discussion.

<sec id="sec9-1744987111433447"><title>Preconditions in the municipality</title>
<p>The municipality must fulfil certain conditions in order to achieve good results. Training of the PHNs must be available before the start of the programme, extra time for the PHNs to follow-up the depressed women is required and a system of referral for further treatment for the women who need it must be available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1744987111433447">Glavin et al., 2010a</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1744987111433447">b</xref>).</p>
<p>Nurses’ ability to offer alternative treatment options depends on their skill in being alert to the clinical situation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1744987111433447">Benner et al., 2009</xref>). The training provided to the PHNs led to increased confidence in their work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1744987111433447">Glavin et al., 2010c</xref>). According to the results of the supporting counselling sessions, they seemed to make good clinical judgments and clinical reasoning, they could help the mothers and responded to the situation, and they made referrals when required (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1744987111433447">Glavin et al., 2010a</xref>). Using the knowledge and skill required for nursing requires translation and intelligent dialogue with the particular practice situation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1744987111433447">Benner et al., 2009</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1744987111433447">Hardin (2009)</xref> describes some characteristics that can be considered competencies that are essential for providing care. The competencies are clinical judgment, advocacy, caring practices, systems thinking, facilitation of learning, collaboration, response to diversity and clinical inquiry. All competencies reflect an integration of knowledge, skills and experience of the nurse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1744987111433447">Hardin, 2009</xref>). The present training and supervision that took place over time probably increased the knowledge and skills of all the PHNs in the municipality, regardless of their earlier experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1744987111433447">Glavin et al., 2010c</xref>). The PHNs’ intervention was associated with a lower occurrence of depressive symptoms in women and the PHNs’ care practices created an empathetic, supportive and therapeutic environment for the women in the municipality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1744987111433447">Glavin et al., 2010a</xref>). They had probably developed the awareness required and anticipated the needs of the women. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1744987111433447">Benner (1984)</xref>, holistic understanding improves nurses’ decision making by enabling them to gain a perspective on which of the many extant attributes and aspects in a situation are the important ones. The PHNs were of the opinion that the training and the supervision they had received had led to encouragement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1744987111433447">Glavin et al., 2010c</xref>). Training and supervision over time in a practical setting are important for the development of knowledge and practical skill performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1744987111433447">Glavin et al., 2010c</xref>). This is supported by other studies indicating that PHNs felt more secure and experienced that they had a better basis of knowledge after similar training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1744987111433447">Seeley et al., 1996</xref>) and supervision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1744987111433447">Vik et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>The PHNs were concerned about time constraints, as they found it essential to have sufficient time to provide feedback to the mother after she had completed the EPDS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1744987111433447">Glavin et al., 2010c</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1744987111433447">Seeley (2001)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1744987111433447">Poole et al. (2006)</xref> underline the importance of feedback to the mothers after completion of the EPDS, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1744987111433447">Poole et al. (2006)</xref> note that mothers who did not receive feedback did not feel satisfied. The home visit, the information and the feedback after filling in the EPDS as an entity appear to be central to the acceptance of the screening procedure. Therefore, sufficient time is essential in screening for PPD in the municipality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1744987111433447">Glavin et al., 2010c</xref>).</p></sec>
<sec id="sec10-1744987111433447"><title>Preventing postpartum depression</title>
<p>The changes in the community postpartum care to prevent and treat PPD resulted in statistically significant improvement in depression scores among women, as compared to women in the usual care municipality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1744987111433447">Glavin et al., 2010b</xref>). The differences in the mean EPDS scores between the municipalities were statistically significant up to 12 months postpartum. The women in the usual care municipality evinced a higher prevalence rate of depression at all measurement times. A significantly larger proportion of those who were depressed (EPDS ≥ 10) at six weeks in the usual care municipality were also depressed later (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1744987111433447">Glavin et al., 2010b</xref>). The women in the intervention municipality also showed a marginally lower level of parenting stress at 12 months postpartum compared with the women in the usual care municipality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1744987111433447">Glavin et al., 2010b</xref>).</p>
<p>The PHNs felt that the changed care was helpful to the parents in several ways, and they regarded the home visits as particularly valuable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1744987111433447">Glavin et al., 2010c</xref>). At the home visit, the PHNs informed the parents about PPD and the screening procedure, and had a dialogue about the mother’s mental health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1744987111433447">Glavin et al., 2009</xref>). The PHNs in the intervention municipality had undergone specific training related to PPD and had more knowledge about this condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1744987111433447">Glavin et al., 2010c</xref>). This fact, in addition to the information provided in pregnancy and postpartum, the brochure and the invitation to contact the well-baby clinic before the next appointment, may account for the significant difference that was detected between the two groups. Other studies support the present findings. Thus, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1744987111433447">Morrell et al. (2009)</xref> reported a decrease in the depression score among women who received support from the health visitors. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1744987111433447">Dennis and Creedy (2004)</xref> found that home visits after birth by PHNs or midwives helped to prevent PPD. These studies suggest that support and information may have a preventive effect on PPD in women. The PHNs in the intervention municipality reported that they thought the focus on mental health problems gave the home visit an altogether different significance. The mothers gave positive reports, and many of the multiparous mothers expressed the wish that they had received this information and tool after their first birth. In the PHNs’ opinion, providing information about mental health and handing out the brochure at the first home visit was a kind of primary prevention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1744987111433447">Glavin et al., 2010c</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1744987111433447">Dennis and Creedy (2004)</xref>, psychosocial and psychological interventions may be effective treatment strategies, which may also be used in the early postpartum period to prevent PPD. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1744987111433447">Stern (2006)</xref> states that home visits seem to have a positive effect on a wide variety of mental health and other problems, and the non-specific positive factors may lie in the relationship between the PHN and the family, especially the mother. A newly fledged mother needs a secure base and the PHN may fill the need for a secure attachment figure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1744987111433447">Stern, 2006</xref>). The information and support provided by the PHNs at the home visit seem to have had a preventive effect on PPD in women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1744987111433447">Glavin et al., 2009</xref>).</p>
<p>According to the results of this study, older primiparous women, who demonstrated a higher level of PPD, should be given extra attention and support in the postpartum period, as the transition to motherhood may be especially challenging for them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1744987111433447">Glavin et al., 2009</xref>). Some women need information and support from people other than the closest family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1744987111433447">Brown et al., 2002</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1744987111433447">Brown et al. (2002)</xref>, early discharge from hospital after delivery may have negative consequences for mothers and babies, since decreased maternal confidence is common due to lack of professional support and higher prevalence of PPD. It is possible that some of the women in the present study who had high scores on the EPDS at six weeks had had a difficult transition to motherhood and experienced problems in managing the change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1744987111433447">Antonovsky, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1744987111433447">Glavin et al., 2009</xref>). In a preventive programme, it is important to strengthen the resources of the municipalities to provide support to newly fledged mothers after early discharge from the hospital. More emotional and informational support to parents both in pregnancy and during the postpartum period has been a recommendation made in other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1744987111433447">Wilkins, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1744987111433447">Deave et al., 2008</xref>), and should be considered important to the primary health care services.</p>
<p>The women in the usual care municipality reported more parenting stress than did the women in the intervention municipality, despite reporting equal levels of life stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1744987111433447">Glavin et al., 2010b</xref>). These findings indicate that the effect of the extra support from the PHN was not limited to depression. There was a significant correlation between parenting stress at 12 months and depression at all measurement points (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1744987111433447">Glavin et al., 2010b</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1744987111433447">Morrell et al. (2009)</xref> also reported less parental stress among women with extra support from health visitors. The women who had been depressed one or more times during the first postpartum year reported a significantly higher level of parenting stress than those who had not. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1744987111433447">Leigh and Milgrom (2008)</xref> reported that among many risk factors, PPD was the strongest predictor of parenting stress. Thus, preventing depression seems to have an influence on the level of parenting stress, so logically should have a beneficial effect on the mother’s parenting capacity. Since a high level of parenting stress during the first three years of life may have adverse consequences for the developing parent–child relationship and for the child’s emotional and behavioural development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1744987111433447">Abidin, 1995</xref>), it is important for health care workers to be aware of early-onset depression.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec11-1744987111433447"><title>Identification of PPD</title>
<p>The PHNs regarded the EPDS as very valuable as a universal screening tool, and they were convinced that they had identified more mothers with PPD than they had done previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1744987111433447">Glavin et al., 2010c</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1744987111433447">Georgiopoulos et al. (2001)</xref> also found that EPDS screening at six weeks postpartum increased the rate of diagnosed PPD.</p>
<p>Following completion of the EPDS at six weeks postpartum, the PHNs had a counselling session with the mother about her mental health and her feelings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1744987111433447">Glavin et al., 2010a</xref>,b). The authors of the EPDS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1744987111433447">Cox and Holden, 2003</xref>) and the guidelines for its use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1744987111433447">Coyle and Adams, 2002</xref>) confirm the importance of this feedback to the mother. The EPDS increases the focus on PPD, and it functioned as a door opener for the PHNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1744987111433447">Glavin et al., 2010c</xref>). Other studies also show that the EPDS can be used as a starting point for conversations about the mother’s psychological condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1744987111433447">Cox et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1744987111433447">Cooper and Murray, 1998</xref>). The PHNs in the present study reported that the parents provided positive feedback about the screening procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1744987111433447">Glavin et al., 2010c</xref>).</p></sec>
<sec id="sec12-1744987111433447"><title>Intervention for postpartum depression</title>
<p>Supportive counselling sessions for the women who scored ≥10 on the EPDS at 6 weeks resulted in a significant difference in the depression score between the municipalities after the intervention up to 12 months postpartum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1744987111433447">Glavin et al., 2010a</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1744987111433447">b</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1744987111433447">Figure 1</xref>). As previous studies have demonstrated, the training of PHNs in detecting and treating PPD, and in providing supportive counselling, has decreased depression among women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1744987111433447">Holden et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1744987111433447">Wickberg and Hwang, 1996</xref>). However, longer-term effects have not been reported in these studies. In a review of 10 trials including 956 women, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1744987111433447">Dennis and Hodnett (2007)</xref> found that psychological and psychosocial interventions were effective as a treatment option for PPD, but these authors also state that the longer-term treatment effects remain unclear. The findings of this study clearly demonstrated the positive longer-term effect of supportive counselling sessions provided by PHNs as treatment for PPD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1744987111433447">Glavin et al., 2010b</xref>). The present results are supported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1744987111433447">Morrell et al. (2009)</xref>. In the intervention group, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1744987111433447">Morrell et al. (2009)</xref> found a reduction in EPDS depressive symptoms and secondary outcomes at 6 and 12 months postpartum among those women who were depressed at 6 weeks, as well as among the non-depressed.</p>
<p>The most effective support for families at risk is to strengthen the parent’s competence when it fails, and to create a condition for secure attachment between parents and children. Maternal depression when prevalent places children at risk, and the treatment for PPD is not always sufficient to improve child outcomes. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1744987111433447">Forman et al. (2007)</xref> found that even if the treatment was helpful for the depression, the mothers' responsiveness to the infant and the child was not necessarily improved. The earlier in the life of the baby that the intervention is provided, the greater is the positive effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1744987111433447">Stern, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1744987111433447">Forman et al., 2007</xref>). For this reason the PHN should be aware of the mother's responsiveness to the infant and not just of the depression. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1744987111433447">Klier (2006)</xref>, the Postpartum Bonding Questionnaire (PBQ) can be used in cases of PPD, together with the EPDS, to evaluate the treatment process for both variables: depression and difficulties of the mother in relating to her child. The PBQ is a 25-item screening questionnaire for mother–infant bonding disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1744987111433447">Wittkowski et al., 2007</xref>). By using the PBQ, the PHN can screen for mother–infant relationship disorders and possibly assess the severity of the disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1744987111433447">Klier, 2006</xref>). When identifying high scores on the PBQ, the PHN must assess possible relationship problems and provide support and guidance to the mother.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec13-1744987111433447"><title>Follow-up</title>
<p>In both municipalities, new cases of PPD were found at all measurement times, which indicate that the PHNs need to be aware of PPD among women during the whole first postpartum year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1744987111433447">Glavin et al., 2010b</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1744987111433447">Davies et al. (2003)</xref> also found new cases of depression at 3, 6 and 12 months postpartum and recommended that health visitors should screen for PPD for a longer period, not only in the immediate postpartum period. In a Swedish study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1744987111433447">Rubertsson et al. (2005)</xref> found new cases up to 12 months postpartum and recommended strategies to evaluate maternal emotional well-being during the entire postpartum period. PPD often goes undiagnosed and untreated even in women who have had multiple visits to health care providers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1744987111433447">Driscoll, 2006</xref>). Findings from the current study suggest that home visits with an increased focus on mothers’ mental health, screening at six weeks postpartum and supportive counselling by trained PHNs decrease the level of PPD in the year following childbirth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1744987111433447">Glavin et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1744987111433447">2010a</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1744987111433447">b</xref>). Still, it is important to be aware of new cases and continue to use a screening tool on indication later in the postpartum period in order to prevent and treat new cases of depression.</p></sec></sec>

<p>In several countries, the circumstances for following up postpartum women are satisfactory, and in many countries mothers receive a home visit by a midwife, health visitor or PHN after birth. In these countries, almost all women who have given birth have frequent contact with well-baby clinics or health centres during the first year of the child’s life. It is also important to be aware of the new cases of women who are likely to be suffering from PPD in the first year postpartum, as depression is strongly related to parenting stress. Trained nurses have the opportunity to identify and treat PPD in women, which can improve the quality of the services provided. If additional training of nurses and information to the parents at the home visit can improve the quality of the services and provide support to the parents, this would seem a worthwhile investment. The prevention and treatment of PPD could make a significant difference in women’s lives and the lives of their children and families. The findings of this study are relevant both to leaders and to providers of primary health care.</p></sec>
