<p>Visual representation in the form of a symbolic depiction that highlights the relationship among elements of a city, such as people, places and its environment, has been approached in diverse ways in the urban studies literature. Nadia Amoroso takes the art and science of transforming statistical urban data into innovative maps to the next level in her recent book <italic>The Exposed City: Mapping the Urban Invisibles</italic>. When engaged in mapping the urban environment, researchers typically face a challenging situation, namely, selecting from a variety of elements to include in a single map that is both informative and enticing. The author provides guiding principles to suggest a selection process that proves useful to achieving the right balance between aesthetics and empirical evidence in the process of creating a map. The book makes an interesting text for graduate courses in planning, urban geography, landscape architecture, and urban design. The text could also serve as a reference for designers and planners who are interested in using maps not only as visual artifacts but also as an essential part of a methodology that could be powerfully used to incorporate the aspects of new digital urban life that otherwise would remain invisible. Amoroso uses the vast amount of information in urban areas that is invisible to the human eye, such as crime levels and air quality, and asks a simple question: “If a city was able to be defined by these characteristics, what form would it take? How could it be mapped?” (p. i). The author tackles these questions with numerous examples accompanied with groundbreaking maps showing the unseen urban elements.</p>
<p>The book is divided into two main parts, Essays and Visuals. As the name suggests, the first part consists of four essays focusing on six scholarly contributions by others to the art of visualizing urban data. The second part largely focuses on providing numerous examples from the author’s own work as well as from the academic projects of her graduate students in highly specialized courses on this subject. The book has a foreword by Richard Saul Wurman (an architect and graphic designer whose contributions are discussed in one of the essays in the book) acclaims her work as defining the planet earth as an “urban globe.” The book ends with an afterword written by the team at SENSEable City Lab of MIT and by Google Earth Inc. that highlights how her “map-landscapes” can be more communicative when integrated with global mapping platforms like Google Earth.</p>
<p>In Part 1 (Essays), the author reviews the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0739456X11436361">Hugh Ferriss (1986)</xref>, then sweeps through the well-known work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0739456X11436361">Kevin Lynch (1960)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0739456X11436361">Richard Saul Wurman (2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0739456X11436361">2008</xref>), and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0739456X11436361">Edward Tufte (1990)</xref>; revisits provocative maps of the urban future developed by MVRDV/Winy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0739456X11436361">Maas (1999)</xref>; and finally discusses the mapping process and art developed by James <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0739456X11436361">Corner (1996)</xref> in four chapters, respectively. The author’s goal is to outline a methodology of mapping urban data from the work of these influential scholars and practitioners. This methodology can be useful for architects, landscape architects, and urban designers interested in exploring a variety of urban issues.</p>
<p>The author provides a massive amount of details on the works of Hugh Ferriss in chapter 1. Ferriss rendered the development potential of the city of New York in his three-dimensional architectural drawings based on nuances of the zoning ordinance of 1916. These influential drawings incorporated legal and economic measures of the zoning regulation and served as the blueprints of potential scenarios for developers and architects who did not always seem to be completely clear about implications of the ordinance on building practicability. Ferriss showed the power of drawings, referred to as map-drawings by Amoroso, translating complex information into a vision of urban form that, in fact, influenced the then future urban form of New York City. Ferriss’s ability to achieve the balance between the informative aspects of a map and its artistic properties gave his work a great visual and communicative power.</p>
<p>The idea of the tension between expressed and unexpressed is the central theme in chapter 2, an essay that briefly covers the work of three well-known scholars, Lynch, Wurman, and Tufte, who show the use of mapping as a means of simplifying the complexity of urban form. Lynch used mapping to show the imageability of cities using the labels “the path,” “the edges,” “the districts,” “the nodes,” and “the landmarks,” which are now part of the urbanism vocabulary. The compelling maps of Lynch were based on human perception and behavior in relation to the city that highlighted what was really being experienced in the city. While Lynch showed the importance of mental maps that resulted in line drawings reduced to placing of the path, edges, districts, nodes, and landmarks in a city, the work of Wurman investigated the ability to graphically represent a massive amount of information in a map. While Wurman’s work is not limited to urban areas alone, it is highly relevant and his more recent project on global urbanism (19.20.21 project; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0739456X11436361">Wurman 2008</xref>) focuses on nineteen cities with twenty million people in the twenty-first century. On the other hand, Tufte is influential in visual communication that is graphically legible and hence the focus is not necessarily on what is traditionally known as mapping but is more on the means and methods of delivering information. Tufte creates complex but clear drawings, using rules such as scale integrity, correct proportions, and avoidance of what he calls chartjunk.</p>
<p>Chapter 3 explores the work of the Dutch architectural firm MVRDV that provided alternative ideas for urban forms using statistical data to help guide planners to make urban design decisions. In 1990, MVRDV published <italic>Metacity/Datatown</italic> (Maas 1990), which portrays extreme scenarios and examines spatial, social, and economical consequences of an ever-expanding population density, using mind-blowing statistics and shocking graphics. These images took the role of maps, giving the viewer an idea of future urban forms much similar to Ferriss’s ordinance drawings in the early twentieth century. Amoroso highlights the concept of datascapes in this chapter and the importance of modern-day computing in creating such maps. Final thoughts are discussed in an interview with Winy Maas from MVRDV, who acknowledges that some degree of dramatization in data visualization is required to bring out urban issues powerfully.</p>
<p>The review of influential scholars in mapping the urban data ends with a chapter on the work of James Corner who developed a concept of map-drawing hybrid. The most famous work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0739456X11436361">James Corner and Alex MacLean (1996)</xref> is discussed in chapter 4 that incorporates aerial photographs in the form of collage-like drawings. These drawings tell a story that is both artistic and informative. The chapter concludes with an interview with Corner, who highlights the importance of creativity in mapping landscapes that takes his work to the next level in the McHargian mapping tradition for landscape architects suggesting superimposing multiple layers of information to analyze the landscape. Nevertheless, the McHargian maps are more information driven, leaving no room for creativity unlike Corner’s work.</p>
<p>In part II of the book (Visuals), Amoroso presents her own work, the map-landscapes, supplemented with a battery of her graduate students’ work on a multitude of urban issues. In her work, she maps urban invisibles and creates “densityscapes,” “crimescapes,” “market-valuescapes,” and “surveillancescapes” for three global cities, Toronto, New York, and London. While the book allows her to present her map-landscapes only in the static three-dimensional form, some of her work is dynamic and presents changes over time in animated form on the websites and exhibitions. For example, her light-switch maps for Toronto are originally in the form of an animated map representing building occupancy over the 24-hour cycle. The essays in the previous part help the readers to fully appreciate her own and her students’ work presented in this part. The chapter concludes with a few guiding principles that is the most important contribution of this book. The most important principle is to treat urban data as spatial representations and then several principles related to increase the artistic quality of maps such as choosing appropriate viewpoints to render the three-dimensional map and using lighting to emphasize points of interest.</p>
<p>A few limitations of the book are evident. First, the author discusses the classic works of urban mapping scholars at great length although this discussion is generally well documented in urban studies literature (including in those scholars’ original works). The interviews with Wurman, Maas, and Corner, of course, provide important insights into the main argument of the book. Second, the discussion in the chapter on her own work follows almost the similar appraising tone used in her essays. The interpretation of her work could have been left to readers or for others to critique. The author could have focused on discussing the actual content of the map-landscapes or on the details about how they were created, among other points. Or even better, she could have focused on explaining how her work answers the questions that she asked her interviewees rather than presenting her students’ annotated portfolio. Nonetheless, <italic>The Exposed City</italic> is a highly recommended book for those who are interested in using urban mapping as a methodology to derive plans and policies. The discussion on mapping principles from the classic work combined with the exploration of the newest technological advancements, such as computer numerical control (CNC) and the Google Earth mapping platform from the current digital era, makes the book a very good reference text for urbanists.</p>
