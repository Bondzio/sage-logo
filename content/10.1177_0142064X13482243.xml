<abstract>
<p>James Robinson’s narrative of how the Nag Hammadi codices were discovered is popular and compelling, a piece of ﬁne investigative journalism that includes intrigue and blood vengeance. But there are several different, conflicting versions of the story, including two-person (1977), seven-person (1979) and eight-person (1981) versions. Disagreements include the name of the person who ﬁrst found the jar. Martin Krause and Rodolphe Kasser both questioned these stories in 1984, and their scepticism is corroborated by the Channel 4 (UK) series, <italic>The Gnostics</italic> (1987), which features Muhammad ‘Ali himself, in his only known appearance in front of camera, offering his account of the discovery. Several major points of divergence from the earlier reports raise questions about the reliability of ‘Ali’s testimony. It may be safest to conclude that the earlier account of the discovery offered by Jean Doresse in 1958 is more reliable than the later, more detailed, more vivid versions that are so frequently retold.</p>

<title>The ‘Canonical’ Nag Hammadi Story</title>
<p>The story of the discovery of the Nag Hammadi codices in 1945 has attained near canonical status in scholarship of early Christianity. James Robinson’s compelling narrative of how Muhammad ‘Ali al-Samman and his brothers unearthed the jar containing the codices combines skilled investigative journalism with tales of intrigue and blood vengeance.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0142064X13482243">1</xref></sup> It is a staple of introductory classes on Christian origins, particularly important for courses introducing the <italic>Gospel of Thomas</italic>. Books on the Nag Hammadi collection narrate the story to grab the reader’s attention and to set the scene. The story is comparable to the often-narrated, near contemporary story of the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls in 1947, a story that similarly sets the scene in discussions of Qumran and early Judaism.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0142064X13482243">2</xref></sup></p>
<p>One of the most popular retellings of the story is told at the beginning of Elaine Pagels’s seminal <italic>Gnostic Gospels</italic>:<disp-quote>
<p>In December 1945 an Arab peasant made an astonishing archeological discovery in Upper Egypt … Thirty years later the discoverer himself, Muhammad ‘Ali al-Samman, told what happened. Shortly before he and his brothers avenged their father’s murder in a blood feud, they had saddled their camels and gone out to the Jabal to dig for <italic>sabakh</italic>, a soft soil they used to fertilize their crops. Digging around a massive boulder, they hit a red earthenware jar, almost a meter high. Muhammad ‘Ali hesitated to break the jar, considering that a <italic>jinn</italic>, or spirit, might live inside. But realizing that it might also contain gold, he raised his mattock, smashed the jar, and discovered inside thirteen papyrus books, bound in leather. Returning to his home in al-Qasr, Muhammad ‘Ali dumped the books and loose papyrus leaves on the straw piled on the ground next to the oven. Muhammad’s mother, ‘Umm-Ahmad, admits that she burned much of the papyrus in the oven along with the straw she used to kindle the ﬁre.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This ﬁnd story is already compelling, but it is capped with the tale of an appalling murder:<disp-quote>
<p>A few weeks later, as Muhammad ‘Ali tells it, he and his brothers avenged their father’s death by murdering Ahmed Isma’il. Their mother had warned her sons to keep their mattocks sharp: when they learned that their father’s enemy was nearby, the brothers seized the opportunity, ‘hacked off his limbs … ripped out his heart, and devoured it among them, as the ultimate act of blood revenge’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0142064X13482243">Pagels 1979</xref>: xiii).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>It is a fantastic story, irresistible for introducing these amazing and important discoveries.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-0142064X13482243">3</xref></sup> The bloodthirsty, illiterate peasants happen upon an amazing ﬁnd while out looking for fertilizer. They worry about genies but lust for gold, they have no inkling of the magnitude of their ﬁnd, and their mother is as stupid as she is callous, burning valuable documents and then encouraging her sons to use the very mattocks that had broken open the earthenware jar now to murder a man. The narrative scarcely hides its moral, that important artefacts like this need to be wrested from the hands of those who cannot hope to understand them, and placed in the hands of responsible, Western academics.</p>
<p>The status of this story in the guild, our love of retelling it, our fondness for its dramatic impact, has deterred us from subjecting it to the kind of critical scrutiny that we apply to ancient texts. In this article, I would like to draw attention to legendary embellishments of the story, contradictions between the different versions, and curiosities that are sufﬁcient to place a question mark over the conﬁdence with which we like to tell this familiar tale.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section2-0142064X13482243">
<title>The Mystery of the Growing Jar</title>
<p>Like many a canonical narrative, the story is subject to legendary embellishment. One interesting example relates to the size of the jar in which the codices were found. The jar itself is no longer in existence.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4-0142064X13482243">4</xref></sup> The bowl that was used as a lid allegedly survived,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn5-0142064X13482243">5</xref></sup> but nothing of the pottery itself survived the discovery. According to James Robinson’s interviews, Muhammad ‘Ali smashed into the jar with his mattock, taking the volumes and leaving the broken shards of pottery behind. They were never retrieved. Robinson therefore estimates the size of the jar on the basis of his interviews in the 1970s<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6-0142064X13482243">6</xref></sup> as follows:<disp-quote>
<p>The pottery was red slip ware, distinguishing it from the creamy color of the modern Qina ware common in the region, and had four small handles near the opening. The jar was also large, with dimensions roughly illustrated by Muhammad ‘Ali as 60 cm or more in height and an opening of some 15 to 20 cm widening to some 30 cm in the flank. The jar had been closed by ﬁtting a bowl into its mouth. Khalifah<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn7-0142064X13482243">7</xref></sup> had taken this bowl with him to the home in al-Qasr where he was a servant for the Copt, Salib ‘Abd al-Masih, who preserved the bowl intact. It is Coptic red slip ware of the 4th or 5th century with a rim decorated with four ﬁelds of stripes. The diameter at the outer edge is 23.3–24.0 cm, with a diameter inside the bowl of 18.2–18.7 cm, adequate to close a mouth large enough to admit the codices, whose broadest leaves, in Codex VII, measure up to 17.5 cm. There are a few black tar like stains about 2.0 cm from the outer edge on the under side of the rim, perhaps vestiges of a bitumen used to seal the bowl into the jar. Thus, the jar probably could not be opened readily to investigate its contents, which would explain why it was broken by its discoverers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0142064X13482243">Robinson 1979</xref>: 213-14).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn8-0142064X13482243">8</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>So it was ‘60 cm or more’ high, which is just under 2 ft. However, in <italic>The Gnostic Gospels</italic>, Elaine Pagels says that the jar was ‘almost a meter high’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0142064X13482243">Pagels 1979</xref>: xiii), which is already a lot bigger than Robinson’s estimate. One meter is 3.28 ft. So the jar has grown from just under 2 ft to well over 3 ft.</p>
<p>Subsequently, the jar almost doubles in size. In several interviews and publications, Elaine Pagels states that it was a ‘six-foot jar’. The ﬁrst example of this is in <italic>The Gnostics</italic> TV series from 1987,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn9-0142064X13482243">9</xref></sup> which features a clip of Elaine Pagels teaching a class at Princeton. She says that it was ‘a large earthenware jar, about six feet high’, motioning with her hand to illustrate that the jar was higher than her head (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0142064X13482243">Segaller 1987</xref>). It is ‘six feet’ when she appears in the PBS documentary <italic>From Jesus to Christ</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0142064X13482243">Cran 1998</xref>). It features also in written interviews and then again in her <italic>Beyond Belief</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0142064X13482243">Pagels 2003</xref>: 97).</p>
<p>A six-foot jar would be enormous. This is unfeasibly large, three times the size of the two-foot jar of the earliest accounts. The best guess about the origin of this measurement is that it occurred in Pagels’s oralization of the Robinson story in the classroom, an inadvertent error, perhaps brought about by misremembering the ‘60 cm’ ﬁgure from Robinson’s story. This kind of corruption can happen easily in story-telling. An error is introduced inadvertently, but it is then retold until it becomes embedded in the story and its origin forgotten.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn10-0142064X13482243">10</xref></sup></p>
<p>However, the differences between the various versions of the story of the Nag Hammadi ﬁnds are not limited just to the subsequent retellings, and the differing versions do not emerge solely through writers’ recasting in their own words, adding legendary embellishments and re-oralizing. There are some interesting differences in the source materials themselves.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0142064X13482243">
<title>Different Versions of Robinson’s Narrative</title>
<p>Robinson’s accounts are based on extensive research in and around the Nag Hammadi region, and many interviews on several occasions with the protagonists in the 1970s.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn11-0142064X13482243">11</xref></sup> His attempts to dig up the details of what had happened a generation earlier and his success in writing so fascinating an account witness to the industry and expertise of so influential and important a scholar. Nevertheless, the scope of the research and the craft of the story-telling do not mask the interesting fact that there are variant versions of the story.</p>
<p>There are several points of contact between the different versions. The core is the same, and the major differences relate to length and detail. Nevertheless, at the key point, when Robinson is narrating the discovery itself, there are striking differences relating especially to the personnel involved. In the earliest published version, in 1977,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn12-0142064X13482243">12</xref></sup> the introduction to the classic <italic>Nag Hammadi Library in English</italic>, only two men are said to be present, the brothers ‘Muhammad and Khalifah ‘Ali of the al-Samman clan’. The more detailed 1979 version, published in <italic>Biblical Archaeologist</italic>, features seven people, three of whom were brothers. The third brother is the youngster Abu al-Majd. In this version, Abu al-Majd, previously unmentioned, is the one who ‘actually unearthed the jar’ before his older brother takes over.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn13-0142064X13482243">13</xref></sup> The next version, in 1981, adds an additional camel-driver, bringing the total number at the site to eight. The similarities and differences are easiest to see in synopsis:</p>

</table-wrap>
<p>The differing versions have not generated comments in previous scholarship. No doubt this is in large part because scholars are unaware that there are different versions.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn16-0142064X13482243">16</xref></sup> In so far as there is awareness of the issue, the different versions are simply regarded as terse and summarizing or longer and detailed. Perhaps, then, to focus on these differences would be to nit-pick. Though we may scrutinize ancient texts with excitement where the details diverge, some might argue that contemporary scholarly texts should be treated with more patience. Two scholars involved in the publication of the Nag Hammadi codices would beg to differ.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section4-0142064X13482243">
<title>Kasser’s and Krause’s Disclaimer</title>
<p>Although the compelling story of the discovery of the Nag Hammadi codices is frequently narrated, it is not widely known that two scholars questioned the story and wished to distance themselves from it. Rodolphe Kasser and Martin Krause, who worked with Robinson on the Nag Hammadi Library in the 1970s and early 1980s, expressed major reservations about Robinson’s story, so much so that they asked him to publish the following remarkable disclaimer in <italic>The Facsimile Edition</italic> on which they collaborated:<disp-quote>
<p>Rodolphe Kasser and Martin Krause wish to make it known here that they have serious reasons to put in doubt the objective value of a number of important points of the Introduction that follows. They contest especially the detailed history of the discovery of the Coptic Gnostic manuscripts of Nag Hammadi resulting from the investigation of James M. Robinson. Kasser and Krause and others who were involved do not consider as assured anything more than the core of the story (the general location and approximate date of the discovery), the rest not having for them more than the value of stories and fables that one can collect in popular Egyptian circles thirty years after an event whose exceptional signiﬁcance the protagonists could not at the time understand. R.K. and M.K. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0142064X13482243">Robinson <italic>et al</italic>. 1984</xref>: 3).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Although Robinson’s account has often been retold, Krause’s and Kasser’s publicly stated objection to it is rarely repeated.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn17-0142064X13482243">17</xref></sup> This is probably simply because of ignorance. This quotation is written in a tiny font in square brackets as the ﬁrst few lines in a two-page footnote in the preface to an expensive and highly technical volume. And by 1984, when the introductory volume to the <italic>Facsimile Edition</italic> appeared, the discovery story had already been told and retold so many times that the impact of any disclaimer was likely to be minimal.</p>
<p>Clearly stung by the criticisms of those like Krause and Kasser, Robinson responded by suggesting that, like all good science, his research was open to good, repeatable investigation. At the time of writing, the people involved were still alive and they could be found and interviewed:<disp-quote>
<p>This methodical and critical investigation is what history is made of, not fable. Like scientiﬁc experiment, it can be repeated, and unless that is done with contrary results, it is unscientiﬁc to deny the validity of the result attained thus far (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0142064X13482243">Robinson <italic>et al</italic>. 1984</xref>: 4 n. 1).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The claim echoed something already in one of Robinson’s earlier accounts:<disp-quote>
<p>One important dimension of the status of the story of the Nag Hammadi codices from the cliff to Cairo is the quality of the repeatability inherent in the scientiﬁc experiment, in that the persons interviewed are still accessible for others who may wish to repeat and advance the investigative process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0142064X13482243">Robinson 1981</xref>: 58).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Unfortunately, the time that has now passed since Robinson’s careful and detailed investigations of the 1970s makes it impossible any longer to engage in the kind of re-investigation here suggested. And it seems that Robinson’s critics themselves never attempted to do this, perhaps not surprisingly given the content of their criticism, which is about the unreliable nature of this kind of testimony in general.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn18-0142064X13482243">18</xref></sup></p>

<title><italic>The Gnostics</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0142064X13482243">1987</xref>)</title>
<p>Here, then, the story might have ended were it not for the fact that a television crew followed in Robinson’s footsteps a decade later, for a Channel 4 (UK) documentary series that aired in 1987, <italic>The Gnostics</italic>, in which Muhammad ‘Ali himself appears on screen.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn19-0142064X13482243">19</xref></sup> The man behind the series was Tobias Churton, and as he tells the story, his encounter with Muhammad ‘Ali was a case of good luck:<disp-quote>
<p>Just over forty years later [after the discovery], Border Television’s ﬁlmcrew were in the neighbourhood with Gilles Quispel, Professor of New Testament studies at the University of Utrecht, in order to ﬁlm the location of the discovery. Our production manager, Valerie Kaye, was walking down the main street of al-Qasr with a copy of <italic>Biblical Archaeologist</italic> (Fall 1979) which featured a colour photograph of Muhammad ‘Ali al-Samman on its cover. A rather serene looking man, in his mid-sixties, walked up to her and, seeing the picture, pointed to it and then himself.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn20-0142064X13482243">20</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The documentary series itself is now difﬁcult to ﬁnd. It was broadcast only twice, in 1987 and again in 1990, and it was never released on VHS or DVD. After a long search, I was able to track down an anonymously made recording. It is a fascinating series, featuring interviews with Elaine Pagels, Gilles Quispel, Hans Jonas and James Robinson, interspersed with bizarre scenes in which a clean-shaven, blond-haired Gnostic Jesus (played by Nigel Harrison) appears all in white to recite sayings from the <italic>Gospel of Thomas</italic> in an ethereal manner. In a remarkable scene in the documentary, Gilles Quispel meets Muhammad ‘Ali and pays him homage. When they interview ‘Ali about what he remembers of the discovery, this is how he responds, speaking through an interpreter:<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn21-0142064X13482243">21</xref></sup><disp-quote>
<p>‘I was digging for sabakh, for fertilizer, with my pick-axe and carrying it back to the ﬁelds on the camel. Then I came across this big earthenware pot which was buried in the sand. I had a feeling that there might be something inside … I came back later the same day and I smashed the pot open. I broke it open exactly where I had found it. I thought there might be an evil spirit inside, a <italic>jinni</italic>. I had never seen anything like it before. I smashed the pot on my own and inside I found these old books. Then I brought the others over to see. They said, “We don’t want anything to do with these books. They belong to the Christians, the Copts.” They said, “It’s nothing to do with us.” … It was all just rubbish to us. Yes, my mother did burn some in the bread oven.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn22-0142064X13482243">22</xref></sup>… One of the people from the village of Hamra Dum killed my father so it was decided that I should kill his murderer, in revenge. I did kill him and with my knife I cut out his heart and ate it. I was in jail because of the killing and when I got out of jail I found that my mother had burned a lot of those old papers. Later on I sold one book. All the others had gone. I got eleven Egyptian pounds for it.’</p>
<p>Professor Quispel’s interpreter asked Muhammad ‘Ali if he had any regrets about what happened when he found the books. ‘No, I don’t care. I don’t give a damn about them. It doesn’t even enter my head to think about it.’<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn23-0142064X13482243">23</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>There are points of contact between this version of the story and the earlier ones told to Robinson: digging for <italic>sabakh</italic>, the fear of breaking the pot because of the <italic>jinni</italic> and the mother’s burning of the papers.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn24-0142064X13482243">24</xref></sup> The points of divergence, though, are striking. In this testimony, the discovery of the pot and the breaking of it are narrated as separate incidents, and ‘Ali is alone at both points and is responsible for both. He is insistent on the point—’I smashed the pot on my own’. There are ‘others’ subsequently present, but there is a contrast here with all the versions narrated by Robinson, in which the other(s) are present at the point of discovery and breaking of the pot.</p>
<p>This version of the discovery of the Nag Hammadi codices is today unknown in the guild, in spite of the fact that it is the only extant footage of Muhammad ‘Ali al-Samman himself. Television documentaries are quickly forgotten,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn25-0142064X13482243">25</xref></sup> all the more so in the days before the widespread distribution and endless repeats that mark contemporary documentary making for cable networks in the USA.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn26-0142064X13482243">26</xref></sup> Not surprisingly, it does not appear in any of the scholarly literature that deals with the topic. And Tobias Churton’s book based on the series has been neglected because of its popular-level presentation.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn27-0142064X13482243">27</xref></sup></p>

<title>A Bottle of Whiskey and a Ten-Pound Note</title>
<p>How reliable, then, is the story of the Nag Hammadi discovery? Can we continue to trust it in our classroom presentations and introductory texts? The question itself conceals the difﬁculty. There is no single story of the Nag Hammadi discovery but several different versions. It is true that there are major points of contact between the different versions, but there are also signiﬁcant differences, differences that are sufﬁcient to place a question mark over the reliability of Muhammad ‘Ali’s testimony, all the more so given the doubts raised by Krause and Kasser, and the obvious differences in ‘Ali’s later, on-screen account. To continue to tell the tale of the Nag Hammadi ﬁnds in an uncritical way would be akin to treating the Synoptic Gospels in a harmonizing fashion, ignoring differences and suspending the kind of healthy scepticism that is so important in the armoury of the scholar of early Christianity.</p>
<p>A degree of scepticism about the ﬁnd stories, though, inevitably raises questions about the nature of the research that led to them. One of the difﬁculties is that the kind of careful ethnographic research that is now common in universities was in its infancy in the 1970s. Detailed guidelines about how to conduct interviews, how to record interviews and how to investigate without contaminating the ﬁeld were not available at the time. Robinson did not tape-record his interviews and he did not publish his notes. This is not to say that his work was shoddy. His narratives are strong in scope and precise in detail and there is no question about the initiative, the energy and the time that went into researching them. However, there are question marks over elements that may have emerged from the imagination of the protagonists rather than their memory of the events, from providing the researchers with what they wanted to hear rather than accurate recollection.</p>
<p>The difﬁculty is illustrated in Robinson’s most recent discussion of the Nag Hammadi ﬁnd story. In <italic>The Secrets of Judas</italic>, Robinson is attempting to set the record straight about the provenance of the <italic>Gospel of Judas</italic>, and he wishes to make it clear that it did not come from Nag Hammadi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0142064X13482243">Robinson 2007</xref>: 39). He produces a lengthy quotation from one of his articles on the discovery<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn28-0142064X13482243">28</xref></sup> in an attempt to clarify the number of codices that were found, but then he adds the following revealing commentary:<disp-quote>
<p>Muhammad ‘Ali had heard me and others talk of thirteen codices, and so he would quite naturally speak of thirteen, not recalling what he had counted at the time (if he had counted at all—he was illiterate). In all probability, he was just playing back what he had learned was the ‘correct’ number.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn29-0142064X13482243">29</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Aside from the surprising note that illiteracy might imply inability to count, the comments are striking in demonstrating that the witness’s testimony was contaminated. Although in 1979, ‘Ali is cited as maintaining that there were thirteen codices in the jar,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn30-0142064X13482243">30</xref></sup> it now appears that this may have been no more than the repetition of a detail ‘Ali had heard from those questioning him.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn31-0142064X13482243">31</xref></sup></p>
<p>Still more seriously, there are questions over Muhammad ‘Ali’s trustworthiness. If the nasty but implausible tale of modern-day cannibalism, eating a man’s heart raw, were not enough to raise suspicion, it is clear that Robinson himself sometimes had trouble with ‘Ali’s honesty. He refers to ‘instances of not impeccable veracity on his part’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0142064X13482243">Robinson 1979</xref>: 213) and notes that on at least one occasion a ‘ﬁnancial consideration’ was necessary to overcome ‘Ali’s unwillingness to explore the possible location of the ﬁnd (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0142064X13482243">Robinson 1979</xref>: 212). Herb Krosney suggests that such incentives were a major element in the research:<disp-quote>
<p>Robinson made inquiries with the Egyptian fellahin in the area of Nag Hammadi. He found witnesses who would often tell him to come back in a short time and they would reveal the story to him. Robinson would return as requested, ready with the proper incentives. ‘Whenever I went down, I would bring the villagers a bottle of whiskey and a ten-pound note. That was big money at the time. That was my chore in tracking it down. I am not a ﬁeld archaeologist. I went from rumor to rumor, village to village’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0142064X13482243">Krosney 2006</xref>: 132).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn32-0142064X13482243">32</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The same note is conﬁrmed in Krosney’s report of Rodolphe Kasser’s scornful comment on Robinson’s research:<disp-quote>
<p>Robinson went down [to the area of Nag Hammadi] in full force, accompanied by Egyptian notables, promising compensation to his informants. For them [the Egyptian fellahin], the windfall was beautiful.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn33-0142064X13482243">33</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Krosney’s account of Kasser’s scepticism sheds light also on the disclaimer that appeared in the <italic>Facsmilie Edition</italic> in 1984:<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn34-0142064X13482243">34</xref></sup><disp-quote>
<p>Krause and I, who knew Egypt well, and the fabricating capabilities of the Egyptian fellahin lured by the prospect of gain, disapproved, asking Robinson to restrict himself to the minimum kind of presentation foreseen by our committee back in 1970 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0142064X13482243">Krosney 2006</xref>: 135).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>For Kasser, the testimonies gathered were simply unreliable. According to Krosney, Kasser wondered ‘whether a small event of minimal importance for the local population could be remembered in such detail so many years after the fact’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0142064X13482243">Krosney 2006</xref>: 135).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn35-0142064X13482243">35</xref></sup> The time gap between the discovery in the mid-1940s and the interviews in the mid-1970s is certainly a concern in research of this nature, and it encourages some reflection on how it is that Robinson is able to discover so much detail in the 1970s when Jean Doresse had failed to ﬁnd the same kind of detail in the 1940s.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn36-0142064X13482243">36</xref></sup></p>

<title>The Original Story of the Find: Jean Doresse</title>
<p>One of the many curiosities of this story is the difference between what Jean Doresse was able to discover in his investigations in the late 1940s, within years of the discovery, and what James Robinson was able to discover in the mid 1970s, three decades after the discovery. Doresse found out ‘rather vague’ information in his visits to Upper Egypt in 1947, 1948 and 1949 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0142064X13482243">Doresse 1960</xref>: 128)<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn37-0142064X13482243">37</xref></sup> and followed this up with a fact-ﬁnding mission in January 1950 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0142064X13482243">Doresse 1950b</xref>). Doresse describes the site of the discovery in some detail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0142064X13482243">Doresse 1960</xref>: 128-33), and he captions his photograph with a note that it was at the ‘south-east flank of the Gebel et-Tarif’, where there are ‘entrances to the tombs of the princes of the sixth dynasty’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0142064X13482243">Doresse 1960</xref>: ii). Doresse writes:<disp-quote>
<p>Was it in one of these tombs that the papyri were found? Certainly, one cannot, even if one searches very far around, see any other place—any ruin or sepulchre—from which they could have come. The peasants who accompanied us and who did not know the real object of our search (we had come here on the pretext of visiting the pharaonic tombs) guided us, of their own initiative, to the southern part of the cemetery and showed us a row of shapeless cavities. Not long since, they said, some peasants of Hamra-Dûm and of Dabba, in search of manure, found here a great <italic>zir</italic>—which means jar—ﬁlled with leaves of papyrus; and these were bound like books. The vase was broken and nothing remains of it; the manuscripts were taken to Cairo and no one knows what then became of them. As to the exact location of the ﬁnd, opinion differed by some few dozen yards; but everyone was sure that it was just about here. And from the ground itself we shall learn nothing more; it yields nothing but broken bones, fragments of cloth without interest and some potsherds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0142064X13482243">Doresse 1960</xref>: 133).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>One of the values of Doresse’s research is that he does not appear to have asked leading questions, and he avoids the danger of contaminating the ﬁeld. He writes:<disp-quote>
<p>Given as they were, quite spontaneously, I am sure that these testimonies related to our library: they agreed perfectly with the details we had been able to collect through different channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0142064X13482243">Doresse 1960</xref>: 134).</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Although much shorter and more basic, the story Doresse tells is, in fact, similar to the one told by Robinson, but the precise, colourful details are missing: the brothers, the <italic>jinn</italic>, burning leaves in the oven, the blood vengeance.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn38-0142064X13482243">38</xref></sup> Curiously, Doresse does appear to have been aware of versions of the story more akin to those told by Robinson, but he treats these details with scepticism:<disp-quote>
<p>Rumour added—as we have said—that two of these volumes had been used by the fellahs as fuel for making their tea, and that the rest had been sold for a trifling sum to the dealers who had taken them to Cairo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0142064X13482243">Doresse 1960</xref>: 128).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn39-0142064X13482243">39</xref></sup></p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Doresse may be right to treat the motif of the burning of valuable ancient texts as mere rumour since it is a trope that also appears in other stories of westerners rescuing documents from those who do not understand their value, seen in the legends surrounding both Codex Sinaiticus<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn40-0142064X13482243">40</xref></sup> and the Dishna Papers.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn41-0142064X13482243">41</xref></sup> The difﬁculty for the researcher is the possibility that motifs like this ﬁnd their way into the retellings of the story through hearsay, rumour and the creative imagination.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-0142064X13482243">
<title>The Ramiﬁcations</title>
<p>What does this strange story teach us? Is there a moral? I would like to suggest that there are several. First, it reminds us of the importance of applying a healthy scepticism to our work, and to ask questions even—or especially—about the things we think we know. The appeal of the Nag Hammadi ﬁnd story is connected with its pedagogical appeal. We like to tell the story in the classroom<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn42-0142064X13482243">42</xref></sup> because it has some blood, some mystery, some intrigue.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn43-0142064X13482243">43</xref></sup> It comes from a world totally different from ours and features characters quite different from us. In its orientalizing representation of illiterate, ignorant, blood-thirsty peasants, it enables academics to celebrate their literacy, civilization and wealth. It is a story of the rescue of valuable documents from the hands of superstitious murderers who would have thrown them all on the ﬁre if they had not wanted to make a quick buck.</p>
<p>But pedagogical usefulness is not a barometer of truth, and there are dangers in suspending our scepticism in order to tell a good tale. Moreover, when it comes to the <italic>Gospel of Thomas</italic>, there is an alternative discovery story that is usually relegated to second place if it is discussed at all, namely Bernard Pyne Grenfell and Arthur Surridge Hunt’s unearthing of the Oxyrhynchus papyri, the ﬁrst of which, P.Oxy.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0142064X13482243">Grenfell and Hunt 1897</xref>) caused a minor sensation in the 1890s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0142064X13482243">Grenfell 1897</xref>). The difﬁculty with this story is that it features people a little bit like us, academics with an interest in antiquity, and it has nothing like the same classroom appeal. And yet the prioritizing of Robinson’s Nag Hammadi story in introductions to the <italic>Gospel of Thomas</italic> functions subtly to downplay the importance of the earlier textual evidence in Greek and so to increase the distance between the <italic>Gospel of Thomas</italic> and the Synoptics.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn44-0142064X13482243">44</xref></sup></p>
<p>A second, related point is the reminder to be as ethical in our dealings with secondary sources as we encourage our students to be. The multiple retellings of Robinson’s story in the secondary literature often sail perilously close to plagiarism. Every scholar who tells the tale is of necessity dependent on James Robinson. The debt is clear in passages like this one, where Werner Kelber retells certain details of the story, his debt to Robinson clear from the tell-tale phrase ‘the ultimate act of blood revenge’, a phrase that only occurs in the literature where authors are dependent on Robinson:<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn45-0142064X13482243">45</xref></sup></p>

<p>It is easy to understand the problem. I once tried to write an introduction to the story and I continually found myself inadvertently drifting into the all too familiar words from Robinson. I used to love the <italic>Arabian Nights</italic> as a child and I desperately wanted to talk about Muhammad ‘Ali’s fear that the jar might contain ‘a jinn’,<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn46-0142064X13482243">46</xref></sup> but that his lust for treasure overcame his fear.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn47-0142064X13482243">47</xref></sup> Robinson’s accounts are the only detailed sources for the story and they are so compelling that the temptation to something approaching plagiarism has proved irresistible to some.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn48-0142064X13482243">48</xref></sup> Given the seriousness with which plagiarism is treated in our universities, though, it is a temptation that should be avoided.</p>
<p>There is also some value for the study of the Nag Hammadi codices in trying to get the story right. It is important to know whether any valuable texts were lost in an oven in Hamra Dûm. How complete is the collection? Should we continue to speak about ‘thirteen codices’ when it is clear that only twelve complete codices have survived?<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn49-0142064X13482243">49</xref></sup> Is it true that massive damage was done at the site of the discovery? Did the <italic>fellahin</italic> attempt to rip up the codices and divide them among themselves? If there were only two present, how could this have happened? If there were seven or eight present, could the division of the library indeed go back to its discovery? And were the discoverers really just farmers out looking for <italic>sabakh</italic> or were they grave-robbers who found the jar in an ancient cemetery? If so, what might that tell us about those who buried them back in the fourth century?<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn50-0142064X13482243">50</xref></sup> These questions are now, of course, difﬁcult to answer, but the uncritical acceptance of one version of the ﬁnd story may run the risk of throwing us off the scent.</p>
<p>Finally, the discussion of the Nag Hammadi discovery story provides some enjoyable analogies for the exploration of Christian origins. There is a dark, oral period for several decades during which knowledge of the ﬁnd is limited, and only Doresse can help, just as knowledge of the Jesus movement in the early decades is limited largely to Paul. James Robinson in the 1970s, like Mark in the 70s, provides a compelling new written account that then forms the basis for several subsequent accounts. Elaine Pagels produces so strong a new version, embellished with legendary details, that it becomes as famous as Robinson’s, just as Matthew writes a new version of Mark, likewise embellished with legendary details. But Robinson is also like Luke, who tells the same story on different occasions with different details, most famously the story of Paul’s conversion (Acts 9, 22, 26). Perhaps too, the story reminds us of the caution necessary in conducting research on early Christianity. Sometimes, admitting our ignorance is a virtue.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn51-0142064X13482243">51</xref></sup></p>

<p>In 1979, Robinson reports that his visits on 3 March and 23 April 1966 produced ‘a few leads’ but that the major research took place ‘toward the end of November 1974, for visits of some days in January and September 1975, and for about a month each of the next three winters’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0142064X13482243">Robinson 1979</xref>: 207-208). This coheres with the fact that Robinson’s ﬁrst publication on the discoveries, a 1974 pamphlet, has none of the detail that emerges in the later accounts, although it does feature the germ of the later, more detailed versions: ‘One report is to the effect that the person who actually found the jar was a lad who had avenged the murder of his father by killing the murderer and had then fled to the desert to avoid arrest’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0142064X13482243">Robinson 1974</xref>: 4).

<p>The testimony is also given in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0142064X13482243">Churton 1987</xref>: 9, but with major differences: ‘I found it at the Hamra Dūm mountain in the December of 1945. By 6 o’clock in the morning when I started my work … all of a sudden I found this pot. And after I found it I had the feeling that there was something inside it. So I kept it, and because it was cold this morning … I decided that I would leave it and would come back again for it to ﬁnd out what’s inside. I came back in the same day in fact, and I broke this pot. But I was afraid at the beginning because there might be something inside it—a jinn, a bad spirit. I was by myself when I broke the pot. I wanted my friends to be with me. After I broke it I found that it was a story book. I decided to bring my friends to tell them about the story. We were seven and we realized immediately that this has something to do with the Christian people. And we said that we don’t really need it at all—it was just useless to us. So I took it to the ministry over here and he told me, well we really don’t need it. It was just rubbish for us. So I took it back home. Some of them were burned and I tried to sell some of them.’ It is possible that Churton has assimilated the testimony more closely to Robinson’s account, e.g. by adding reference to December 1945 (cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0142064X13482243">Robinson 1979</xref>: 209). It is puzzling, in this version, that ‘Ali should now apparently remember the date when earlier Robinson had had to work it out on the basis of several clues. Churton also narrates the version of the story in which Abu unearths the jar, presumably derived from Robinson, but without drawing attention to the differences between the two versions.</p>
