<abstract>
<p>Acute kidney injury (AKI) following cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) is associated with increased mortality, requirement for dialysis, and longer intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital length of stay. Rewarming during CPB and poor oxygen delivery have been associated with AKI; however, the role of temperature management on AKI has not been clearly defined. This study aims to evaluate the role of hyperthermia during CPB and the temperature upon admission to the ICU on AKI following cardiac surgery, using the RIFLE (renal Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss of renal function and End-stage renal disease) criteria.</p>
<p>To determine whether CPB hyperthermia (measured as the cumulative time the arterial outlet temperature &gt;37°C) and ICU admission temperature were independent risk factors for AKI, data from 1393 consecutive adult patients undergoing isolated on-pump coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), valve repair and/or replacement and valve/CABG procedures was analysed using a logistic multivariate model. After testing for interaction, we incorporated covariates having a p-value &lt;0.1. AKI was defined according to the RIFLE criteria as an increase in serum creatinine &gt;50% from baseline to peak value postoperatively. Overall, 12.3% of patients developed AKI with a 4.5-fold increase in in-hospital mortality. Variables found to be independent predictors of AKI included CPB hyperthermia (Odds ratio [OR] 1.03 per minute increase [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.01-1.05]; p = 0.01), ICU admission temperature ([OR] 1.44 per degree increase [(CI) 1.13-1.85]; p&lt;0.001), minimum CPB haemoglobin ([OR] 0.83 per g/dL increase [(CI) 0.71-0.97]; p = 0.02), use of intra-aortic balloon pump ([OR] 2.69 [(CI) 1.24-5.82]; p = 0.01) and ICU readmission ([OR] 3.13 [(CI) 1.73-5.64]; p&lt;0.001).</p>
<p>Avoiding arterial outlet hyperthermia may help decrease AKI following cardiac surgery using CPB. Both intraoperative and postoperative temperature management strategies should be the focus of future randomised studies to determine optimal interventions.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Perioperative renal failure following cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) is associated with increased mortality, requirement for dialysis, and longer intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital length of stay.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0267659112472385">1</xref></sup> Limitations in the prevention and treatment of perioperative renal failure have been caused by inconsistencies in defining the injury and a lack of understanding of the pathophysiology in the clinical setting.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0267659112472385">2</xref></sup> In order to create a common definition and to improve risk stratification, the term <italic>acute kidney injury</italic> (AKI) has been adopted to reflect the spectrum of disease, from minimal elevations in serum creatinine to anuric renal failure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0267659112472385">2</xref></sup> A 5-stage classification system developed by the Second International Consensus Conference of the Acute Dialysis Quality Initiative (ADQI) group defines AKI according to changes in serum creatinine and/or urine output, using the acronym RIFLE (renal Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss of renal function and End-stage renal disease). The first three stages define grades of increasing severity of AKI (risk, injury and failure) based on changes from the baseline serum creatinine or glomerular filtration as well as a decline in urine output. The last two stages are outcome variables (loss of renal function and end-stage kidney disease).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0267659112472385">3</xref></sup> This criterion is currently the most extensively used and validated consensus definition and method of classifying AKI.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0267659112472385">4</xref></sup></p>
<p>Various pharmacological interventions aimed at the manipulation of renal hemodynamics and glomerular filtration have failed to demonstrate significant clinical protection during cardiac surgery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0267659112472385">1</xref></sup> A number of modifiable factors have been identified as predictors for AKI, including haemodilution, intraoperative transfusion, hypotension and oxygen delivery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0267659112472385">5</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0267659112472385"/>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0267659112472385">7</xref></sup> The role of temperature management on AKI has not been clearly defined. In animal models, hyperthermia has been shown to exacerbate ischaemic renal injury and hypothermia to have a protective benefit; however, randomised clinical studies have not demonstrated a protective effect of hypothermia during cardiac surgery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0267659112472385">1</xref></sup> Two trials reported by Boodwhani et al.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0267659112472385">1</xref></sup> designed to evaluate neurocognitive outcome following coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), also reported the influence of temperature management and rewarming on kidney injury after surgery, defined as a 25% increase in serum creatinine from baseline. In the earlier trial, 223 patients were cooled to 32°C during CPB and randomised to rewarm to 37°C or 34°C. The authors reported a higher (non-significant) incidence of renal injury in patients rewarmed to 37°C than those rewarmed to 34°C (17% versus 9%, p = 0.07). In the second trial, 267 patients were randomised to sustained mild hypothermia at 34°C with postoperative rewarming or normothermia (37°C). The authors reported a comparable incidence of renal injury in both groups (20%: 34°C versus 15%: 37°C, p = 0.28). In a post hoc analysis of both trials to evaluate the influence of rewarming on AKI, they reported that rewarming was an independent risk factor for renal injury; however, the influence of hyperthermic perfusion was not examined.</p>
<p>In a rat model of renal ischemia, prophylactic hypothermia was found to be effective when applied not only during ischaemia, but also during early reflow post-ischemia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0267659112472385">8</xref></sup> However, there is a paucity of data regarding the renal effects of prophylactic hypothermia post injury.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0267659112472385">4</xref></sup> Although hypothermia upon ICU admission in CABG patients has been shown to be associated with an increase in mechanical ventilation time, transfusion requirements and hospital length of stay,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0267659112472385">9</xref></sup> the association between ICU admission temperature and AKI following cardiac surgery has not been reported.</p>
<p>This study aims to evaluate the role of hyperthermic perfusion during CPB and the temperature upon admission to the ICU on AKI following cardiac surgery, as defined by the RIFLE criteria.</p>

<title>Data source &amp; collection</title>
<p>In an observational cohort study of consecutive adult patients undergoing isolated on-pump CABG, isolated valve repair and/or replacement and valve/CABG procedures at Flinders Medical Centre between January 2007 and August 2011, data was analysed retrospectively. Study approval (411.11) was given and the requirement for written informed consent was waived by the Clinical Human Research Ethics Committee.</p>
<p>Preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative data was collected prospectively, using the Flinders Medical Centre Cardiac Surgery Database. Continuous intraoperative variables were collected at 20-second intervals, using the Data Management System (DMS) (Stockert, Munich, Germany). Arterial outlet temperature was measured at the outlet of the Capiox® SX25RX oxygenator (Terumo Corporation, Tokyo, Japan), using the oxygenator integrated thermistor temperature probe without correction for inaccuracy of the thermistor. Intraoperative monitoring artifacts, as defined by an arterial pressure &lt;5 mmHg, nasopharangeal temperature &lt;10°C or arterial outlet temperature &lt;10°C, were excluded from the analysis. Haemoglobin data was collected electronically, with sampling every 20-30 min during CPB, using an ABL700 analyser (Radiometer, Copenhagen, Denmark). Patients with preoperative chronic renal disease requiring dialysis, or operated off-pump, were excluded.</p>
<p>CPB parameters, including arterial outlet temperature &gt;37°C, mean arterial pressure &lt;40 mmHg, mean arterial pressure &lt;50 mmHg and cardiac index &lt;1.6 l/min/m<sup>2</sup>, were calculated electronically as cumulative time as previously described.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0267659112472385">10</xref></sup></p>

<sec id="section4-0267659112472385">
<title>Clinical management</title>
<p>General anaesthesia was induced with fentanyl (10–30 g/kg) and supplemented with sevoflurane and/or propofol. All patients underwent cardiac surgery with CPB using a SIII roller pump (Stockert). The arterial pressure was monitored via a radial artery catheter. Cardiopulmonary bypass was instituted after positioning of either a single 36/51 Fr two-stage atrial cannula (Sarns<sup>TM</sup>, Terumo Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) or 32–36 Fr bicaval cannulation (Sarns<sup>TM</sup>) and a 22 Fr ascending aortic cannula (DLP, Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN) or a 20 Fr FemFlex used in the ascending aortic position (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA). The CPB circuit included a hard-shell membrane oxygenator (Capiox® SX25RX), biopassive tubing (SMARxT®, Cobe Cardiovascular, Arvada, CO) a 40-micron arterial-line filter (D703, Dideco, Mirandola, Italy) and a 0.2-micron pre-bypass filter (Prebypass Plus®, Pall Corporation, Port Washington, NY). The circuit was primed with 525 ml of Plasmalyte solution, 500 ml of Gelofusine (isolated CABG procedures) or 4% albumin (other procedures), 50 ml 8.4% sodium bicarbonate solution, 525 ml Hartmann’s solution and 10,000 IU heparin. Packed red blood cells were added, if required, to provide a predicted haemoglobin level of &gt;7 g/dL on initiation of CPB (determined by the algorithm of the DMS software). The CPB protocol included an arterial, non-pulsatile, target flow rate of 1.8-2.4 L/min/m<sup>2</sup>, alpha-stat pH management with a target pO<sub>2</sub> of 100-250 mmHg, gravity venous drainage and tepid systemic temperature management (nasopharyngeal temperature 34-35°C), with no active cooling. After placement of the aortic cross-clamp, cardioplegic arrest was induced with blood cardioplegia (32-34°C), 30 mmol/l at induction and intermittent boluses (16 mmol/l) as required. Mean CPB arterial pressure was controlled using metaraminol, phentolamine or isoflurane to achieve a target of 40-80 mmHg, The target nasopharyngeal temperature for separation from bypass was &gt;36°C with a rewarming rate &lt;1°C per min. During the study period, our protocol for the maximum arterial outlet temperature during rewarming was reduced from 37.5°C to 37°C in October 2009.</p>
<p>Transfusion of red blood cells during CPB was triggered when the haemoglobin level was measured to be &lt;7 g/dL. Postoperative renal replacement therapy was initiated according to physician assessment based on oliguria unresponsive to fluid resuscitation measures, hyperkalaemia, severe acidaemia or clinically significant lung oedema.</p>

<title>Acute Kidney Injury</title>
<p>AKI was defined according to the serum creatinine criteria of the RIFLE classification as an increase in serum creatinine &gt;50% from baseline to peak value postoperatively. Serum creatinine measurement was performed using the enzymatic method (Roche, Basel, Switzerland).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section6-0267659112472385">
<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>Statistical analysis was carried out using SPSS software version 19.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). Variables were screened for normality using histograms, with normally distributed data presented as the mean ± SD and non-normally distributed data as medians with interquartile range. Categorical data are presented as percentages. Continuous variables were analysed using the t-test or the Mann–Whitney U-test according to the normality of distribution, while categorical variables were compared using the Chi-square statistic. Incident AKI after cardiac surgery was analysed with logistic regression, showing the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Due to regression model over-fitting constraints, all covariates were evaluated in univariable analyses for their association with AKI and only retained for further multivariable analysis when the univariable result indicated p&lt;0.1. Logistic regression model discriminatory and fit indices included the Hosmer and Lemeshow χ<sup>2</sup> test and the c-index.</p>
<p>Due to our change in the rewarming protocol during the study period, we dichotomised the dataset to procedures performed before or after the reduction in maximum arterial outlet temperature protocol from 37.5°C to 37°C. Chi-square analysis was performed to compare the incidence of AKI before and after the temperature protocol. In all analyses, a two-sided p-value &lt;0.05 was considered to be statistically significant and we did not adjust for multiple comparisons.</p>

<title>Univariate and multivariate associations with AKI</title>
<p>The univariate and multivariate association between variables and AKI ascertained by logistic regression are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0267659112472385">Table 3</xref>. The variables meeting the criteria for inclusion in the multivariate model (p&lt;0.10) were; female gender, chronic obstructive airway disease, peripheral vascular disease, previous cardiac surgery, renal disease, diabetes, congestive heart failure, cardiopulmonary bypass time, emergency surgery, minimum CPB haemoglobin, CPB cardiac index &lt;1.6 l/min/m<sup>2</sup>, CPB MAP &lt;40 mmHg, arterial outlet temperature &gt;37°C, ICU admission temperature, use of intra-aortic balloon pump, units of red blood cells transfused, return to operating room and intensive care unit readmission. When such variables were subjected to multivariate logistic regression, only minimum CPB haemoglobin, arterial outlet temperature &gt;37°C, ICU admission temperature, use of intra-aortic balloon pump and ICU readmission remained independently associated with AKI. Specifically, CPB haemoglobin (OR 0.83: CI 0.71-0.97; p = 0.02) translated to a 20% lower risk of AKI per g/dL increase in haemoglobin. With respect to arterial outlet temperature time &gt;37°C (OR 1.03: 95% CI 1.01-1.05; p = 0.01), the result translated to a 34% increase in odds for AKI with every ten minutes spent &gt;37°C. The ICU admission temperature results (OR 1.44: CI 1.13-1.85; p&lt;0.001) suggested that a 44% increase in odds for AKI was evident for every 1 degree increase in temperature. The use of the intra-aortic balloon pump (OR 2.69: CI 1.24-5.82; p = 0.01) translated to a nearly three-fold greater odds for AKI amongst patients receiving IABP. Finally, having an intensive care unit readmission (OR 3.13: CI 1.73-5.64; p&lt;0.001) was associated with more than three-fold greater odds for AKI.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In the development of AKI following cardiac surgery, this analysis found temperature management to be important. In particular, we identified arterial blood temperature &gt;37°C and the ICU admission temperature to be independent predictors. Intraoperative minimum haemoglobin level, transfusion of red blood cells, postoperative use of an intra-aortic balloon pump and readmission to the ICU were also found to be independent predictors of AKI.</p>
<p>The confirmation of the hypothesis that hyperthermic perfusion during CPB, defined as the cumulative time &gt;37°C, is associated with an increase in the incidence of AKI following cardiac surgery is consistent with the observations of Boodhwani et al., who reported exacerbation of AKI attributed to rewarming during CPB.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0267659112472385">1</xref></sup> In their study, arterial blood temperatures were reportedly kept &lt;37.5°C, suggesting that patients would have encountered some degree of hyperthermic perfusion. However, a quantification of hyperthermia was not reported. An observational study of 1072 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting with target core temperatures between 24 and 36°C found the lowest arterial perfusate temperature to be an independent predictor of AKI.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0267659112472385">11</xref></sup> Kourliouros et al. proposed that the increase in AKI associated with lower CPB perfusate temperature may be related to injury associated with the need for increased rewarming. However, an evaluation of the influence of hyperthermia or the highest CPB temperatures was not performed. Given our ability to quantify oxygenator arterial outlet temperature during CPB, our study was performed to evaluate the relationship between hyperthermia and AKI since this data was not included in previous studies. Our analysis found that, for every 10 minutes the oxygenator arterial outlet temperature exceeded 37°C, there was an associated 34% increase in the incidence of AKI. Since we did not report the minimum perfusate temperature, we are unable to make a comparison with the study reported by Kourliouros et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0267659112472385">11</xref></sup> We did not observe a relationship between the minimum patient temperature during CPB and AKI; patients were maintained between 33-35°C in our study compared with 24-36°C in the Kourliouros et al. study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0267659112472385">11</xref></sup></p>
<p>The rationale for avoiding hyperthermia during CPB has focussed on reducing the risk of neurologic injury associated with CPB, as highlighted in the recommendation by Shann et al., <italic>“Limiting arterial line temperature to 37°C might be useful for avoiding cerebral hyperthermia. (Class IIa, Level B”).</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0267659112472385">12</xref></sup> During the study period, we observed a significant decline in the incidence of arterial outlet hyperthermia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0267659112472385">Figure 2</xref>), reflecting our change in the rewarming protocol in compliance with the Shann et al. guideline.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0267659112472385">12</xref></sup> Following the change in protocol, our incidence of AKI fell significantly from 14% to 9.6%, suggesting the association that reducing the incidence of arterial hyperthermia may be beneficial in reducing AKI. The evidence reporting a relationship between hyperthermia and adverse outcome is largely derived from the association between cerebral hyperthermia in the setting of stroke with increased morbidity and mortality. However, in the setting of CABG surgery, both exposure to a faster rewarming rate during CPB and hyperthermia postoperatively have been demonstrated to be associated with a greater incidence of neuropsychologic dysfunction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0267659112472385">12</xref></sup> In Boodwhani et al.’s (2009) retrospective report designed to evaluate neurocognitive outcome and kidney injury following CABG, they reported a similarity in neurologic outcome and renal outcomes, with worse outcomes observed in patients who had greater rewarming.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0267659112472385">1</xref></sup> The authors reported arterial outlet temperatures to be limited to &lt;37.5°C in these studies. Therefore, it is likely that patients experienced some degree of hyperthermia, however, continuous electronic temperature data was not available for quantification. The results from our study, therefore, raise the question of the influence of arterial outlet hyperthermia on the results of previous studies of temperature management during CPB.</p>
<p>In our study, patient temperature upon arrival to the ICU was also identified as an independent predictor of AKI. We found no correlation between arterial hyperthermia blood temperature &gt;37°C and ICU arrival temperature, and that intraoperative patient temperatures (both minimum nasopharangeal and nasopharangeal temperature at CPB separation) were not univariate predictors of AKI. Therefore, our results may suggest that ICU arrival temperature is a relevant measure to predict the postoperative course. Grocott and associates have reported postoperative hyperthermia to be associated with greater neuropsychologic dysfunction following CABG surgery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0267659112472385">13</xref></sup> However, the relationship between ICU arrival temperature and postoperative hyperthermia in our practice and the influence of postoperative temperature management and AKI are yet to be determined. Further evaluation of postoperative temperatures are required to determine whether higher ICU admission temperatures are associated with subsequent hyperthermia or whether lower ICU admission temperatures are beneficial in reducing the incidence of AKI.</p>
<p>Various modifiable factors related to the conduct of CPB have been reported to be associated with AKI, including red blood cell transfusion, combined anaemia and hypotension<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0267659112472385">6</xref></sup> and oxygen delivery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0267659112472385">14</xref></sup> A recent analysis of 920 consecutive on-pump cardiac surgery patients reported by Haase et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0267659112472385">6</xref></sup> identified decreased haemoglobin concentration as an independent risk factor for AKI (defined by an increase in serum creatinine &gt;50% from baseline to peak value within the first seven postoperative days) and the volume of transfused red blood cells represented a specific additional risk factor in patients with a haemoglobin concentration &gt;8 g/dL. In their study, systemic hypotension alone (&lt;50 mmHg) was not independently associated with AKI. However, the combination of low haemoglobin concentration and severe hypotension acted synergistically to increase the risk of AKI. Although our study found a univariate association between red blood cell transfusion, minimum haemoglobin during CPB, CPB cardiac index &lt;1.6 l/min/m<sup>2</sup>, CPB MAP &lt;40 or 50 mmHg and AKI, multivariate analysis failed to indicate the indices of pressure or flow reported to be independent predictors. Our study, similarly, identified the minimum haemoglobin reported during CPB to have an independent association with AKI. Since measurements of hyperthermic perfusion and postoperative temperature have not been included in these previous studies, this highlights the importance of our findings from a pathophysiological perspective. In addition, our study supports the practice recommendations of published consensus guidelines for the conduct of CPB in relation to minimising anaemia during cardiac surgery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0267659112472385">15</xref></sup> and limiting arterial outlet temperature to 37°C during CPB.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0267659112472385">12</xref></sup> Postoperatively, the use of an intra-aortic balloon pump and readmission to the ICU were found to be independent predictors of AKI, most likely secondary to compromised haemodynamic function. The inclusion of these factors in the multivariate model highlights the role of the modifiable intraoperative predictors of AKI, since they remain significant, even after controlling for these postoperative factors.</p>
<p>Renal dysfunction has been frequently used as a surrogate outcome measure for reporting renal outcomes, determining risk factors, and assessing treatment benefits, however varying definitions have been proposed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0267659112472385">1</xref></sup> The ADQI group<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0267659112472385">3</xref></sup> made recommendations that the change from the baseline in serum creatinine or estimated creatinine clearance be used whenever possible rather than single absolute values. According to the RIFLE criteria, as the categories of AKI progress according to change from the baseline creatinine, sensitivity for the endpoint decreases and specificity increases. More recently, a modification to the RIFLE classification by the Acute Kidney Injury Network (AKIN) included a shorter time frame within which AKI has to occur (48 hours), a milder serum creatinine value increase from baseline to peak value and the staging of patients receiving renal replacement therapy. A comparative study of the classification systems found that modification did not improve the clinical usefulness of the definition, the authors concluding that, in the interest of meaningful comparison of study findings, it appears to be advisable that only 1 AKI classification system should be referenced.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0267659112472385">16</xref></sup></p>
<p>The quantification of hyperthermia during CPB is limited by the accuracy of the measurement of arterial outlet temperature. We have determined previously that a temperature of 37°C measured at the arterial outlet of the Capiox® SX25RX oxygenators purports to an actual blood temperature of approximately 37.5°C.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0267659112472385">17</xref></sup> We have also previously reported under-reading of the arterial blood temperature by arterial outlet oxygenator thermistor probes in all other oxygenators we have evaluated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0267659112472385">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0267659112472385">18</xref></sup> Therefore, although we have defined hyperthermia in this study as an arterial outlet temperature of &gt;37°C as recorded by the heart-lung machine, actual blood temperatures are likely to have been at least 0.5°C higher. Although Shann et al. suggest that <italic>“Coupled temperature ports for all oxygenators should be checked for accuracy and calibrated”</italic>,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0267659112472385">12</xref></sup> the ability to calibrate temperature measurement ports on our heart-lung machine is not a feature provided by the manufacturer. To avoid actual arterial blood temperatures exceeding 37°C when using the Capiox® range of oxygenators, a measured arterial outlet temperature target of 36.5°C should be used.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0267659112472385">18</xref></sup> As a result of this report, we have modified our protocol to limit the measured arterial outlet temperature to 36.5°C. A prospective audit is required to determine whether this change in practice is associated with a further reduction in the incidence of AKI. This is a single-centre study, therefore, reproduction of these results using a larger multicentre dataset encompassing differences in management approaches to modifiable CPB factors affecting AKI, such as anaemia, transfusion, pressure and flow during CPB and rewarming may improve generalisabilty. Due to the change in the rewarming protocol, there was a strong negative correlation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0267659112472385">19</xref></sup> between the incidence of arterial outlet hyperthermia and the year of operation (Pearson correlation coefficient <italic>(r)</italic> = -0.61, p&lt;0.001); the year of operation was not included in the multivariate model. No significant changes were made to clinical practice during the study period other than the introduction of retrograde autologous priming during 2010. The minimum CPB haemoglobin was similar for each year of operation. This study was observational in nature and, therefore, associations identified cannot infer causality.</p>
<p>In conclusion, avoiding arterial outlet hyperthermia may help decrease AKI following cardiac surgery using CPB. Both intraoperative and postoperative temperature management strategies should be the focus of future randomised studies to determine optimal interventions.</p>
