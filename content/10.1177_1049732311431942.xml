<abstract>
<p>The aim of this study was to explore and define the different dimensions of professional stigma attached to obese patients by dietitians. Four focus groups were conducted with 23 Israeli dietitians. Findings showed that while treating obese patients, dietitians underwent a stigmatization process involving cognitive, emotional, and behavioral phases. Obese patients with an internal locus of control, who took responsibility for their failure to diet, triggered positive feelings (e.g., pity and empathy), whereas obese patients with an external locus of control, who blamed others for their failure, triggered negative feelings (e.g., anger and frustration). Participants’ emotional rejection of obese patients was manifested in three behavioral dimensions: instrumental avoidance (e.g., shorter sessions); professional avoidance (e.g., less energy and effort); and interpersonal avoidance (negative tone and evasive verbal and body language). Continuing education for dietitians is recommended to assist them in dealing with their negative feelings and behaviors toward resistant obese patients.</p>

<p>The concept of stigma was first defined by the sociologist Goffman as “an attribute that links a person to an undesirable stereotype, leading other people to reduce the bearer from a whole and usual person to a tainted, discounted one” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1049732311431942">1963</xref>, p. 11). Many researchers believe that the strong social stigma associated with obesity has the most profound impact on the emotional health of obese individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1049732311431942">Gerhard, 2001</xref>). Studies show that obese persons are subject to intense social pressure in different aspects of their lives to lose weight, including education, employment, health care settings, in their interpersonal relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1049732311431942">Puhl &amp; Heuer, 2009</xref>). Losing weight and being thin are also promoted by the media and the fashion industry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1049732311431942">Kim &amp; Willis, 2007</xref>; Puhl &amp; Heuer; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1049732311431942">Seipel, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1049732311431942">Stuber, Meyer, &amp; Link, 2008</xref>). This pressure can have devastating consequences for people suffering from such a stigmatized medical condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1049732311431942">Bayer, 2008</xref>). Indeed, studies show that obese people who fail to achieve the ideal body weight are prone to social anxiety, depression, low self-image, and reduced quality of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1049732311431942">Blaine, Diblasi, &amp; Connor, 2002</xref>). As a result of social stigma, some obese people choose to retreat from social opportunities (Seipel), whereas others delay or avoid seeking medical care, thus further jeopardizing their own physical health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1049732311431942">Drury &amp; Louis, 2002</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1049732311431942">Muennig (2008)</xref> recently suggested that the psychological stress resulting from social stigma plays a role in the association between adiposity/body mass index and morbidity.</p>
<p>Despite the accumulating knowledge about the multifactorial origin of obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1049732311431942">Chan &amp; Woo, 2010</xref>), society still continues to focus primarily on the behavioral causes of obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1049732311431942">Adler &amp; Stewart, 2009</xref>). Obese people are therefore considered responsible for their condition, and are expected to rectify it by simply eating less and exercising more (Adler &amp; Stewart). Recently it has been shown that obese people feel stigmatized by such public health messages, and prefer messages that acknowledge the complexity of their condition and suggest more realistic solutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1049732311431942">Lewis et al., 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>The stigma associated with obesity starts as young as the age of 3 and continues up from childhood through adolescence and into adulthood. In a national survey of more than 3,000 American adults, obese people were more likely to report both major lifetime discrimination (e.g., getting a job, renting an apartment) and daily interpersonal discrimination (e.g., character assaults and unkind treatment) than were nonobese individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1049732311431942">Carr &amp; Friedman, 2005</xref>). The stigma associated with obesity and the social pressure to lose weight are evidenced not only among lay persons, but among health professionals, as well. Indeed, a few studies conducted among health professionals (e.g., physicians, nurses, psychologists) have shown that even those who treat obese people share negative stereotypes about them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1049732311431942">Puhl &amp; Heuer, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1049732311431942">Weiner, Perry, &amp; Magnusson, 1988</xref>), albeit to a lesser extent than the lay public (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1049732311431942">Teachman &amp; Brownell, 2001</xref>). In a recent review of 15 studies among different health professionals it was suggested that attitudes toward overweight patients, although primarily still negative, have improved over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049732311431942">Budd, Mariotti, Graff, &amp; Falkenstein, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>Health care professional’s obesity stigma has been reported by the public. One qualitative study conducted among parents and their overweight children showed that both parties complained about negative interactions with health professionals, especially with physicians and dietitians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1049732311431942">Holt et al., 2008</xref>). Nevertheless, in another qualitative study, mothers of overweight children still expressed respect for both physicians and nutritionists, by virtue of their professional authority, and welcomed their advice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1049732311431942">Hughes, Sherman, &amp; Whitaker, 2010</xref>).</p>
<p>Because dietitians play an important role in the treatment of obesity, several studies have focused on their attitudes toward obese people. A recent review regarding the stigma of obesity concluded that students of nutrition as well as professional dietitians are not immune to weight bias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1049732311431942">Puhl &amp; Heuer, 2009</xref>). Based on the results of these studies, it seems that dietitians’ attitudes toward overweight and obese individuals are ambivalent, ranging from positive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1049732311431942">McArthur, 1995</xref>), through neutral (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1049732311431942">Harvey, Summerbell, Kirk, &amp; Hill, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1049732311431942">McArthur &amp; Ross, 1997</xref>), to negative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1049732311431942">Berryman, Dubale, Manchester, &amp; Mittelstaedt, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1049732311431942">Oberrieder, Walker, Monroe, &amp; Adeyanju, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1049732311431942">Puhl, Wharton, &amp; Heuer, 2009</xref>). In one study, dietitians’ attitudes were found to be more negative toward the obese patient than toward the overweight patient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1049732311431942">Harvey et al., 2002</xref>).</p>
<p>These inconclusive findings might be attributable to the fact that research regarding obesity stigma among dietitians, as well as other professionals, lacks a clear definition of the concept of stigma attached to obese persons. Most studies conducted among professionals refer to obesity stigma as negative attitudes or stereotypes, rather than as a complex process leading to negative behavior. A clear conceptualization of this term might facilitate the assessment of obesity stigma and discrimination among health professionals, and provide a basis for the development of strategies to fight it at different levels. Corrigan and colleagues’ conceptualization of stigma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1049732311431942">Corrigan, Markowitz, Watson, Rowan, &amp; Kubiak, 2003</xref>), in which stigmatization is seen as a process in which cognitive or causal attributions (stereotypes) lead to emotional reactions (prejudice) and behavioral consequences (discrimination), might provide us with such a conceptualization. Their conceptualization was based on Attribution Theory, which has been extensively used among the lay public for the understanding of social stigmas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1049732311431942">Weiner et al., 1988</xref>), including that of obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1049732311431942">Puhl &amp; Brownell, 2003</xref>). According to this theory, the public attributes negative traits (e.g., laziness and lack of will power) to obese people, and therefore holds them responsible and in control of their condition. These cognitive assumptions are the reason that obesity stigma, unlike other social stigmas, has become legitimized. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to explore and define the different dimensions of professional stigma attached to obese persons by dietitians, using Corrigan’s conceptualization of stigma (Corrigan et al.) as its theoretical background.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<sec id="section2-1049732311431942">
<title>Participants</title>
<p>Participants were 23 dietitians working in the community for the two largest health maintenance organizations (HMOs) in Israel, both of which include medical/ nutritional advice provided by registered dietitians in their “basket” of services. All participants were women, with a mean age of 41 years (range 27 to 59 years). At the time of the study, they had been practicing on average for 14 years (range 1 to 35 years) and had been working in the HMO on average for 10 years (range 1 to 29 years). Inclusion criteria were a minimum of 1 year of experience in the HMO and having elderly persons among their patients.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-1049732311431942">
<title>Procedure</title>
<p>Four focus groups were conducted, two in each HMO, with an average of 6 participants in each group. Recruitment of the participants was accomplished with the cooperation of the head dietitian in each HMO, who contacted the 13 regional dietitians, each supervising between 25 to 50 dietitians. In turn, those regional dietitians who agreed to cooperate invited the dietitians in their region to volunteer for participation in the focus groups. Potential participants were contacted by telephone until a minimum of 6 to 7 dietitians were recruited for each focus group. The study protocol was approved by a formal ethics committee of Clalit Health Services, and all participants read and signed an informed consent form approved by the Helsinki committee.</p>
<p>Given the novelty of the study and the social desirability bias that might emerge on any topic associated with stigmatic beliefs, relatively small groups were preferred so as to give the participants more time to express their thoughts. To facilitate participation, the focus groups were held in the staff room of one of the clinics of each HMO. All sessions were scheduled for 90 minutes and were tape-recorded. The focus groups were comoderated by an organizational consultant and the head researcher (first author Stone, a registered dietitian).</p>
<p>Because the aim of this research was clear and focused, a relatively structured approach was used to ensure that all the groups discussed the same issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049732311431942">Morgan, 1997</xref>). At the beginning of each session, the participants were asked to recall and write down a single particularly memorable case of an obese patient they had treated. These notes provided the basis for the ensuing conversation as each dietitian shared her story with the group. The moderators then steered the conversation toward answering the three focus questions: (a) the feelings that arise while counseling obese patients; (b) the influence of these feelings on the participants’ practice; and (c) recommendations on the ideal treatment for obesity (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1049732311431942">Table 1</xref> for the moderator’s guide). In this article we focus on the first two issues.</p>

<title>Analysis</title>
<p>Content analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1049732311431942">Patton, 1990</xref>) of all sessions was conducted to identify topics and themes. The initial classification was done according to the three conceptual dimensions of stigma: cognitive issues, emotional issues, and behavioral issues. Further analysis classified comments under the emotional category into positive and negative feelings, and comments under the behavioral category into three types of avoidance: instrumental, professional, and interpersonal. In accordance with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049732311431942">Morgan’s (1997)</xref> “group to group validation” technique, we include here only themes that were raised in all four groups, were mentioned by more than one member of the group, and generated a consistent amount of energy and enthusiasm among the participants in all groups.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>All three conceptual dimensions of stigma—cognitive, emotional, and behavioral—emerged in the focus groups in relation to obesity.</p>
<sec id="section6-1049732311431942">
<title>Cognitive Aspects: Responsibility and Controllability</title>
<p>Cognitive aspects comprise the first component of obesity stigma. The main cognitive aspects addressed by the participants in relation to their obese patients were responsibility and controllability. While telling their stories, each dietitian suggested that their obese patients were responsible for their own excess weight, either because of inappropriate diet or lack of physical activity, as well as for their failure to lose weight. None of the participants presented stories of patients whose obesity was attributable to medical reasons (e.g., hypothyroidism). For example, one of the dietitians described a man who wanted to lose weight but was not following any of her advice to attain this goal, and therefore was perceived as being responsible for his own condition:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>A young male, 30 to 40 years old, obese, arrived weighing 98 kg, and now he’s 104 [kg]. He arrived about a year ago. I give him assignments, yet he completes them partially with excuses. [I ask him to bring] a food diary and [he] doesn’t always do that. He brings a wrinkled piece of paper. He does not go walking because he lives in a neighborhood with hills.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Another dominant cognitive aspect raised in the focus groups was the patient’s locus of control. Dietitians expressed difficulty in dealing with obese patients with an external locus of control, who tended to place the blame for their excess weight and unsuccessful dieting attempts on other exterior situations and persons, including the dietitian herself. For example:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Today, I had a 23-year-old woman with morbid obesity. It was her third visit. On her first visit, she received a dietary plan. She didn’t connect to it. The second time, she came in with her mother. She cried and blamed me: “It’s your entire fault that I didn’t lose [weight], you gave me a horrible [dietary] plan I couldn’t follow.” I was shocked. A 23-year-old child sitting in tears. I didn’t know what to do. I was shocked.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section7-1049732311431942">
<title>Emotional Aspects</title>
<p>According to Corrigan’s conceptualization of stigma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1049732311431942">Corrigan et al., 2003</xref>), emotional feelings comprise the second dimension of stigma and are affected by the cognitive component. These feelings can be either negative, in which case obese individuals are seen as being responsible for their own condition, or positive, when the obesity is not perceived to be the individual’s fault. Although all of the participants described obesity as being controllable, meaning that obesity is the personal responsibility of the individual, their descriptions reflected both positive feelings of pity and negative feelings of anger. Pity was reported as the overriding emotion at the beginning of treatment, but as they progressed and the obese patients took no responsibility for their situation, feelings of anger started to emerge. One of the dietitians explained:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>At the first session, there is more of a sense of pity, but later on, you let your real feelings surface. Because when they start coming and explaining why it didn’t work (“there were holidays, weddings”), you start getting restless. You find yourself thinking, “Him again, with his stories.”</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Participants were aware of their feelings of anger and described different techniques used to control their anger, such as taking a deep breath to relax or listening to an inner voice telling them to take it easy. It was important for them to control the anger because they felt that it affected their ability to treat the patient. However, they admitted that sometimes, in spite of their efforts, they just could not help themselves and could not prevent the anger from affecting their practice:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I felt anger because essentially she’s not doing anything, and her excuses are really those of a small child. . . . I no longer bother myself with what can make a breakthrough and take her to the next level. It is up to her [the patient] now to take the first step, to show motivation. As long as she doesn’t do the minimum [change] required (such as keeping a food diary or walking 10 minutes a day), I’m not investing energy in her.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Pity and anger were not the only feelings reported to surface and influence the dietitians’ practice with obese patients. Two additional and very profound feelings expressed in the groups were empathy, a positive emotion, and frustration, a negative emotion. The development of these feelings was similar to the development of pity and anger, wherein the participants described that their strong feelings of empathy at the beginning of treatment turned to feelings of frustration if the patient made no real effort nor took any active steps to adhere to the treatment plan:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>And this situation repeats itself, this frustration of people coming and not losing any weight. This frustration of knowing that I did my best, and I kept my end of the deal, and now it’s your turn [the patient’s]. “You can choose to do your part, and if you didn’t choose to do it, I don’t give up. I keep on giving to you, but it’s your part and you have to choose.”</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Despite the high number of failures leading to frustration, there were also successful cases of patients who adhered to the treatment plan and succeed in losing weight. In addition, the participants recognized that there are many cases in which nothing can be done on their part to change the patient’s situation:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>If there were no successes, on the other hand, then you would really be wallowing in your frustration, but there are successes. There are those cases when you tell yourself, “It’s no wonder they’ve reached this weight, they have so much on their minds.” Who am I? A psychological treatment of a hundred hours per day won’t help them. I had a person like that [with issues requiring psychological help] today. I did my best to reflect the patient’s condition to her. There was nothing more to do. I told myself, “You are not frustrated with her. There is nothing you can do.”</p>
</disp-quote></p>
</sec>
<sec id="section8-1049732311431942">
<title>Behavioral Aspects</title>
<p>Behavioral aspects comprise the third component of obesity stigma. According to Corrigan’s conceptualization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1049732311431942">Corrigan et al., 2003</xref>), positive feelings lead to willingness and attempts to help the stigmatized person, and negative feelings arouse avoidance behavior and social distance. However, the participants in our focus groups expressed a strong desire to continue helping their obese patients, even when the failure to follow their advice caused them to have mixed feelings and frustration:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>I don’t work with dietary plans as often as I used to. I prefer working with guidelines or a [food] diary. In the last session, after she [the patient] hadn’t been [at the clinic] for quite a long time, she gained two kilos. She was totally desperate. I felt helpless and frustrated. I tried to motivate her. I felt that I wanted it for her more than she did for herself. It was one of those difficult moments. So I gave her a dietary plan, just to help her overcome her despair of gaining weight. I told her, “If you follow this dietary plan for the next two weeks, there is no chance you will gain weight: you will just lose weight. This is where you start, and I want to see you in two weeks.”</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The participants still acknowledged that despite any good intentions, their negative feelings did sometimes influence their practice by causing them to act out through avoidance behavior. The avoidance behavior reported in the focus groups can be classified into three categories: instrumental, professional, and interpersonal.</p>
<p><italic>Instrumental avoidance</italic> was defined as evasive behavior expressed in the amount of time allocated to the patient. According to the HMO requirements, the standard amount of time to be allocated per session is 30 minutes for a new patient and 15 minutes for a follow-up visit. However, the dietitians in our focus groups admitted to holding shorter sessions with obese patients who triggered anger and resentment, while allotting additional time to those who triggered pity, empathy, and a desire to help, despite the stress caused by other patients waiting for their appointments. Participants were also willing to schedule more frequent sessions for patients with whom they empathized, whereas they were more inclined to schedule a remote date for patients toward whom they felt angry or frustrated. One dietitian acknowledged, “I gave a less detailed explanation than I usually do. She [the patient] made me lose my motivation. The session was shorter than usual.”</p>
<p><italic>Professional avoidance</italic> was defined as evasive behavior provoked by the patient that negatively affected the treatment style or professional interaction between the dietitian and the patient. Strong feelings of anger and frustration were reported to result in a reduction in the level of energy (i.e., less enthusiasm) and effort (i.e., less initiative) invested by the dietitians in treatment. One of the ways in which this reduction in energy and effort was manifested in their counseling technique related to the debate between two treatment approaches: behavioral guidelines vs. dietary plan. Despite the consensus among all participants that obesity is best managed with clear guidelines and behavioral assignments, rather than with a dietary plan, all of the participants agreed that this approach requires a greater investment of energy and effort in terms of careful listening, thorough information gathering, and a creative approach to changing the patient’s behavior. Moreover, they often needed to convince the obese patient—who usually was more interested in getting a prepared and seemingly “magical” dietary plan rather than embarking on a real process of changing health behaviors—that dietary plans simply do not work. Participants admitted that in cases in which they got angry and frustrated, they sometimes gave in and handed out a dietary plan, even knowing that it would not be used. In the following two excerpts, one can sense how in the absence of anger, the first dietitian led the patient from his paradigm of a dietary plan to her new paradigm, whereas in the second case, anger led to reduced motivation and surrender to the patients request for a dietary plan:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>If you ask obese people how many dietary plans they have in their drawer, they will tell you, and that’s how I start with them. When they ask me for a dietary plan, I ask them, “Do you have any at home? Recipes? Do you also collect dietary plans? How many do you have? How many have you tried? So let’s try something else [e.g., behavioral guidelines].”</p>
<p>So, I [the dietitian] lose [motivation] as well. I start with strong motivation and . . . she [the patient] came in today and said, “Last time you only gave me guidelines for blood lipid [reduction], so aren’t you giving me a dietary plan now?!” I told her, “What I wrote you last time—Did you do it all?” Then she said, “Yes, I did it all.” I told her, “Let’s go over [the dietary guidelines] one by one: use oil [instead of other fats]”—she didn’t do. “Walking”—she didn’t do. In the end, I gave her a dietary plan; she got on my nerves.</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p><italic>Interpersonal avoidance</italic> was defined as evasive behavior reflected in the dietitians’ tone and in their verbal and body language. The participants admitted that when a patient aroused negative feelings in them, they used a negative tone and physical expressions of dissatisfaction, such as not smiling. In extreme cases, they sometimes consciously showed their resentment to the patient, knowing that this behavior might prevent the patient from returning for a follow-up session:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Today, I had it up to here with her. I couldn’t stand it anymore. I told her I couldn’t read a month [of food diary]. She said, “But I must ask all the questions.” At some point, I felt I was about to explode. I said, “Lady, we are not in a private session. It’s almost 30 minutes. Have a nice holiday. We’ll continue this conversation next time.” She felt I was angry. She said, “It’s no big deal, let them [other patients] wait the way I did before.” I answered, “They are scheduled for 30 minutes [first session]; you have only 15 minutes [follow-up session].” She’s really problematic.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study in which dietitians’ stigmatic beliefs toward obese patients were assessed based on Corrigan’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1049732311431942">Corrigan et al., 2003</xref>) conceptualization of stigma and using focus group as a methodology. This approach offers a unique opportunity to explore the cognitive-emotional-behavioral process that leads to obesity stigma in an in-depth and thorough way. We found that while treating obese patients, the dietitians underwent a similar process to that of the lay public, involving cognitive, emotional, and behavioral phases. Their cognitive attributions of obese patients were based on their perceptions about the cause of the problem, as well as on their perceptions about the patients’ awareness and willingness to give up old habits and take the necessary steps to lose weight.</p>
<p>The emotional component emerged very strongly among the dietitians in our focus groups. Viewing this component in terms of locus of control, it can be suggested that obese patients with an internal locus of control, who took responsibility for their situation, triggered positive feelings, such as pity and empathy, whereas obese patients with an external locus of control, who blamed others (including the dietitian), triggered negative feelings, such as anger and frustration. This finding is interesting in light of a recent qualitative study conducted among 76 people living with obesity. It was found that although participants often blamed themselves for not being able to follow a diet, they still wanted someone else, mainly their general practitioner, to take responsibility for their dieting attempts. Participants in that study felt they could not do it on their own and expressed a strong need for ongoing support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1049732311431942">Thomas, Hyde, Karunaratne, Kausman, &amp; Komesaroff, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>Empathy is considered to be an important component of motivational interviewing (MI; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1049732311431942">Miller &amp; Rollnick, 2002</xref>), which has been shown to be an effective strategy for weight loss intervention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1049732311431942">Rubak, Sandbaek, Lauritzen, &amp; Christensen, 2005</xref>). In a pilot study conducted among 3 dietitians and 40 of their diabetic patients, dietitians hardly ever missed an empathic opportunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1049732311431942">Goodchild, Skinner, &amp; Parkin, 2005</xref>). Indeed, the dietitians in all four focus groups of our study expressed strong feelings of empathy toward obese clients. Still, despite their feelings of empathy, they also acknowledged experiencing negative feelings, especially anger and frustration. Feelings of frustration with the client’s commitment, compliance, motivation, and expectations in the management of obesity have been previously reported by Australian dietitians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049732311431942">Campbell &amp; Crawford, 2000</xref>). Unlike the lay public (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1049732311431942">Puhl &amp; Brownell, 2003</xref>), however, the dietitians’ negative feelings did not automatically lead to avoidance behavior and social distance from their obese patients.</p>
<p>Whereas our conceptualization of stigma assumed a linear and unidirectional relationship between the emotional and behavioral aspects, the findings of our study showed that negative emotions could also lead back to the cognitive dimension of the process. Because dietitians were aware of their cognitive and emotional reactions, as well as the possible consequences of those reactions on their treatment protocol (e.g., investing less time and energy and creating social distance), they often attempted to overcome their negative feelings toward their obese patients by returning to the cognitive phase. They referred to this process as “hearing the inner voice.” If such attempts failed, then rejection of the obese patient could appear in various forms of avoidance behavior—actions that dietitians knew could lead to professional social distance and ultimately drive the patient away. This self-developed technique shows that dietitians are in need of additional counseling skills. Studies conducted among Canadian dietitians have also pointed out the need for additional education in motivational and behavioral modification counseling techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1049732311431942">Barr, Yarker, Levy-Milne, &amp; Chapman, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1049732311431942">Chapman et al., 2005</xref>). The researchers explained that the dietitian’s role has shifted from an “educator” providing mainly nutritional knowledge to a “therapist” providing behavioral counseling (Chapman et al.).</p>
<p>Regarding the behavioral aspects of stigma, the findings of the present study revealed three types of discriminating behavior: instrumental avoidance, professional avoidance, and interpersonal avoidance. Instrumental avoidance refers to the amount of time allocated to the patient. Research has demonstrated instrumental avoidance toward obese patients among physicians as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1049732311431942">Hebl &amp; Xu, 2001</xref>). Despite the fact that Israeli public dietitians are supposed to allocate 30 minutes for a new patient and 15 minutes for a follow-up meeting, still the dietitians in our focus groups admitted that not all obese patients received the same amount of time. Obese patients who were positively perceived by their dietitians often received more time than their negatively perceived counterparts.</p>
<p>Professional avoidance refers to the reduced energy and effort invested in treatment on the part of the dietitian. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1049732311431942">Harvey and colleagues (2002)</xref> reported that lower acceptance of obese patients by dietitians was associated with a reduction in social and psychological advice given and time spent in developing a good relationship with clients. In our focus groups, the dietitians similarly acknowledged less investment, particularly in those obese patients who triggered negative cognitions and emotions. When obese patients were perceived as having an external locus of control, they were typically provided with a dietary plan, which represents a more brief and technical approach to treatment. This effectively means that the client was not adequately treated. In another qualitative study also using focus groups, many Canadian dietitians expressed similar feelings about providing meal plans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1049732311431942">Chapman et al., 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>Interpersonal avoidance refers to the translation of resentful feelings toward an obese person into negative body language. Indeed, it seems that obese patients could feel this resentment from their therapists. In another study in which the experience of bariatric patients was examined in the preoperative period, the researchers showed that obese patients were often on the receiving end of negative attitudes and remarks from their care team, especially from dietitians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1049732311431942">Kaminsky &amp; Gadaleta, 2002</xref>).</p>
<sec id="section10-1049732311431942">
<title>Limitations</title>
<p>One possible limitation of this study is the fact that the participants knew each other and worked at the same HMO; some participants also knew the researcher. This might have influenced their responses as a result of the social desirability of positive case studies rather than negative case studies. Another possible limitation was the homogeneity of the focus groups, especially in terms of their extensive professional experience. Participants were older and more experienced than the average dietitian working in either of these two organizations (38 years of age with 11 years of practice). In future, researchers should try to replicate the findings with other populations. A third possible limitation is the fact that the participants were all female dietitians; however, female dietitians constitute the majority of the professionals in this discipline in Israel. It should also be noted that the findings regarding gender and attitudes toward obesity are inconsistent in terms of whether or not the professionals’ gender influences their attitudes about obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1049732311431942">Schwartz, Chambliss, Brownell, Blair, &amp; Billington, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1049732311431942">Teachman &amp; Brownell, 2001</xref>).</p>

<sec id="section11-1049732311431942">
<title>Implications for Researchers, Clinicians, and Policymakers</title>
<p>Based on our findings, Corrigan’s conceptualization of stigma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1049732311431942">Corrigan et al., 2003</xref>) can be used as the foundation of further research on obesity stigma among professionals. To better understand the differences between professional and public obesity stigma, we suggest investigating the differences between professionals’ attitudes toward obese people in general (e.g., neighbors, family members, and friends) and obese patients. In other words, does the dietitian’s stigma toward the obese person change when he enters her room and becomes her patient, rather than a stranger with obesity?</p>
<p>Dietitians should be aware of the cognitive-emotional process that might lead them to stigmatization and rejection of the obese patient. Following a cognitive analysis of the reasons for the obese patient’s failure, treatment of the patient usually starts with feelings of pity and strong empathy, but can gradually change into anger and frustration. Increasing their awareness is the first step in helping dietitians to fight obesity stigma. Because dietitians are the obvious professionals to whom obese people turn for help, it is extremely important that they feel comfortable in doing so, and will not be obstructed in their attempts to lose weight by previous maltreatment.</p>
<p>The second step is to acquire additional professional skills in learning how to cope with the feelings of anger and frustration that arise in reaction to an obese patient’s failure to follow their advice. Dietitians are in need of continuing educational tools, such as MI, to help them deal with negative feelings and behaviors toward resistant obese patients. MI communication skills (e.g., open questions, reflection, affirmation, and summary) have been shown to be effective tools in building patients’ motivation through amplifying and resolving their ambivalence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1049732311431942">Söderlund, Madson, Rubak, &amp; Nilsen, 2010</xref>), and therefore might help reduce professionals’ negative feelings. A recent qualitative study conducted among 58 professionals in 10 clinics in Denmark showed that implementing MI with staff helped to change their routine medical practice in relation to preventive health services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1049732311431942">Ledderer, 2011</xref>).</p>
<p>We also believe that support groups conducted under the supervision of a mentor should be encouraged as a means for dietitians to share their negative feelings freely while acquiring skills for more effective interactions with their clients. Supervision is well accepted in other therapeutic professions.</p>
