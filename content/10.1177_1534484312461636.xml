<abstract>
<p>Post-positivist methods are common in Human Resource Development (HRD) theory and research, however some argue that this perspective limits analysis, and there is opportunity for more alternative paradigmatic approaches in this discipline (Callahan, 2007; Deetz, 2001; Elliott &amp; Turnbull, 2005; Fenwick, 2004; Githens, 2007; Lynham, 2000; Rigg, Stewart, Trehan, 2004, 2007; Sambrook, 2004, 2008; Stewart, 2007, Valentin, 2006). Structuration theory (ST) is a viable option, as it provides a means for organization analysis and initiation of change interventions, but does so from an alternate paradigm perspective. ST, formulated by Anthony Giddens (1984), provides a framework for understanding the interplay between individuals and organizations and how this interplay develops and provides opportunity for organizational change. The purpose of this article is to illuminate ST as an alternative approach to HRD that does not draw from the post-positivist tradition and provide suggestions for how one might apply this theory toward research.</p>

<p>Predominant approaches to research and theory within the human resource development (HRD) discipline are frequently grounded in post-positivist philosophies (a modified version of positivism) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1534484312461636">Bierema &amp; Cseh, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1534484312461636">Githens, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1534484312461636">Kim, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1534484312461636">Lincoln &amp; Lynham, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1534484312461636">Valentin, 2006</xref>). This approach often provides a particular perspective in which observable data is the foundation of knowledge and results typically suggest generalizable and predictable outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1534484312461636">Popper, 1972</xref>). This approach has provided valuable insights, but there is a void. Some argue that, although alternative approaches to HRD are emerging, there is a lack of and need for greater use of alternative forms of investigation, such as postmodern, constructivist, or critical perspectives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1534484312461636">Callahan, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1534484312461636">Deetz, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1534484312461636">Elliott &amp; Turnbull, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1534484312461636">Fenwick, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1534484312461636">Githens, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1534484312461636">Lynham, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1534484312461636">Rigg, et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1534484312461636">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1534484312461636">Sambrook, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1534484312461636">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1534484312461636">Stewart, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1534484312461636">Valentin, 2006</xref>). Alternative approaches “can provide new frameworks with which to analyze organizations and stimulate creativity—not only new ways of doing things but also new ways of thinking about things” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1534484312461636">Valentin, 2006</xref>, p. 27). Therefore, the opportunity exists for increased use of different approaches to research and theory within HRD.</p>
<p>Structuration theory (ST), formulated by Anthony <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1534484312461636">Giddens (1984)</xref>, provides a framework for understanding the interplay between individuals and organizations, and how this interplay develops and provides opportunity for organizational analysis and change. ST is paradigmatically aligned with both the critical and the constructivist stances. His theory has been applied effectively within management, business, education, organizational culture, and organizational communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1534484312461636">Callahan, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1534484312461636">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1534484312461636">Kissack &amp; Callahan, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1534484312461636">Poole &amp; McPhee, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1534484312461636">Pozzebon, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1534484312461636">Pozzebon &amp; Pinsonneault, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1534484312461636">Reed, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1534484312461636">Sarason, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1534484312461636">Sarason, Dean, &amp; Dillard, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1534484312461636">Shuler &amp; Davenport Sypher, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-1534484312461636">Stubbs, Martin, &amp; Endlar, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1534484312461636">Whittington, 1992</xref>). However, minimal work has examined how ST could inform organizational analysis and change management in HRD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1534484312461636">Toracco, 2005</xref>). For example, within the past decade, only three articles have been published in the four main HRD journals that referred directly to ST’s relevance to HRD<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-1534484312461636">1</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1534484312461636">Haugen, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1534484312461636">Scully-Russ, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1534484312461636">Toracco, 2005</xref>) and none examined how ST could practically inform organizational analysis and change management research and theory. Due to increasingly rapid changes in the external environment, a need for a greater understanding of organization analysis and change exists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1534484312461636">Burke, 2008</xref>). This article will examine how ST can create greater understanding by elaborating briefly on common HRD research and its grounding in the post-positivist tradition, highlighting the emergence of and call for alternative approaches in HRD, and then presenting ST as one such alternative approach, highlighting its relevance to organizational analysis and change management. Finally, a potential research strategy using structuration theory as a guide to organizational analysis and change management, in regards to leadership style as an organizational structure, is provided.</p>

<title>Problem and Purpose Statement</title>
<p>Post-positivist methods are common in HRD theory and research; however, some argue that this perspective limits analysis, and there is opportunity for increased use of alternative paradigmatic approaches in HRD theory and research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1534484312461636">Callahan, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1534484312461636">Deetz, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1534484312461636">Elliott &amp; Turnbull, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1534484312461636">Fenwick, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1534484312461636">Githens, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1534484312461636">Lynham, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1534484312461636">Marsick, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1534484312461636">Rigg, et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1534484312461636">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1534484312461636">Sambrook, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1534484312461636">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1534484312461636">Stewart, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1534484312461636">Valentin, 2006</xref>). The need for increased understanding in organizational analysis and change management is emphasized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1534484312461636">Burke, 2008</xref>), but research conducted from the post-positivist paradigm can exclude important issues of power, values, and lived experience, which might inform this understanding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1534484312461636">Deetz, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1534484312461636">Townley, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1534484312461636">Valentin, 2006</xref>). ST is a viable alternative, as it provides a means for organization analysis, as well as initiation and management of change interventions, but does not align with the post-positivist paradigm. The purpose of this article is to illuminate ST as an alternative approach to HRD that does not draw from the post-positivist tradition and provide suggestions for how one might apply this theory toward research. In an attempt to demonstrate the trustworthiness of my methodology in this conceptual piece, a detailed account of the research process is provided, first, outlining the process for reviewing literature on ST broadly. Second, although this article is not purposed as a comprehensive literature review, as an example of the minimal use of ST as it relates to HRD, a literature review of the four core HRD journals was conducted and is detailed below.</p>

<title>Method</title>
<p>The basic tenets of ST are established in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1534484312461636">Gidden’s (1984)</xref> book, <italic>The Constitution of Society</italic>, which fully detailed his theory. To identify how ST had been applied to organizational work, I utilized a snowball method by locating the work of two authors who did work on ST and management (Sarason) and ST and organizations (Callahan) and then using their articles to identify other seminal pieces on ST in organizations and likewise used those pieces to identify further pieces. It was determined that a literature review of all work on ST would not be beneficial, as my interest was to discover how ST had been applied specifically in HRD, and previous authors have already provided reviews and compilations of ST in other fields (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1534484312461636">Clark, Modgil, &amp; Modgil, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1534484312461636">Pozzebon, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1534484312461636">Pozzebon &amp; Pinsonneault, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1534484312461636">Whittington, 1992</xref>). Thus, a literature review of ST’s use in the four core HRD journals will be provided along with recommendations for future work.</p>
<p>Review of the seminal articles on ST suggested that application to HRD had not occurred in a significant manner. However, to confirm this, a search of scholarly, refereed journal articles including <italic>“structuration theory”</italic> in the title and all fields was made of the four journals associated with the Academy of Human Resource Development: <italic>Human Resource Development Review, Advances in Developing Human Resources, Human Resource Development Quarterly, and Human Resource Development International.</italic> The search results indicated that zero articles included structuration theory in the title and three articles included structuration theory in all fields. There was one article from each journal except for <italic>Advances in Developing Human Resources</italic>. These pieces will be summarized below in addition to a synthesis of the work on paradigms and ST.</p>

<title>Paradigmatic Approaches in HRD</title>
<p>All research, whether acknowledged directly or otherwise, is generated out of a particular research tradition (paradigm), which likewise shapes the researcher’s understanding of reality, truth, attainable knowledge, and research goals and methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1534484312461636">Merriam, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1534484312461636">Pallas, 2001</xref>). Research within the social sciences draws from scientific tradition that is heavily rooted in the positivist paradigm, and, in more recent years, the modified paradigm of post-positivism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1534484312461636">Corman, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr64-1534484312461636">Wardlow, 1989</xref>). As mentioned, research and theory within the HRD realm have predominantly drawn from this paradigm as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1534484312461636">Bierema &amp; Cseh, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1534484312461636">Githens, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1534484312461636">Kim, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1534484312461636">Lincoln &amp; Lynham, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1534484312461636">Valentin, 2006</xref>). The post-positivist paradigm is briefly described below, followed by discussion of the call for more research and theory from alternative paradigm perspectives.</p>
<sec id="section4-1534484312461636">
<title>Post-positivist Paradigm</title>
<p>Although there has been an increase in the number of alternative methods used in HRD research, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1534484312461636">Valentin (2006)</xref> argues that the underlying ontological and epistemological foundations of most HRD research have still been primarily post-positivist. The ontology of the post-positivist paradigm asserts that reality or ultimate truth exists and can be partially understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1534484312461636">Guba, 1990</xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-1534484312461636">2</xref></sup> Likewise, epistemologically, objectivity is the regulatory ideal, although post-positivists acknowledge that complete objectivity is not possible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1534484312461636">Guba, 1990</xref>). Based on this ontology and epistemology, the post-positivist tradition tends to focus on prediction and explanation, and the researcher is removed from the exploration process. The post-positivist researcher approaches inquiry with a theory to be tested and aims for nonfalsified hypotheses that are probable facts or laws (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1534484312461636">Guba &amp; Lincoln, 2005</xref>). Results aim for generalizability and an explanation of the relationship between variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1534484312461636">Popper, 1972</xref>). This type of inquiry is appropriate and beneficial for discovering cause and effect relationship, measuring impact, and testing theories deductively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1534484312461636">Greene, 1990</xref>). Post-positivist approaches have yielded important findings and knowledge for the field; however, there is room for additional research founded in alternative paradigmatic approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1534484312461636">Valentin, 2006</xref>).The theory presented below allows for more research from alternative paradigms and provides researchers the tools to continue to fill this gap in the research.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section5-1534484312461636">
<title>Alternative Approaches</title>
<p>The paradigm to which we subscribe shapes what is known to us (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1534484312461636">Kuhn, 1996</xref>).Therefore, we are only capable of seeing and understanding what our paradigm allows. Scholars have noted the lack of research and theory that is generated from alternative paradigms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1534484312461636">Callahan, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1534484312461636">Deetz, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1534484312461636">Fenwick, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1534484312461636">Gioia &amp; Pitre, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1534484312461636">Githens, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1534484312461636">Lynham, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1534484312461636">Pozzebon, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1534484312461636">Sambrook, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1534484312461636">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1534484312461636">Sarason, Dillard, &amp; Dean., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1534484312461636">Valentin, 2006</xref>). They have called for an increase in alternative approaches within organizations and acknowledge the opportunity for increased insight if research and theory draw from different paradigms.</p>
<p>The various approaches do not have to be seen as contradictory, but rather complementary, as they contribute necessary knowledge regarding organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1534484312461636">Sarason et al., 2010</xref>). Likewise, scholars should ask not which paradigm is best, but which approach resonates best with the situation or will allow for different explanations and understandings of organizational life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1534484312461636">Pozzebon, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Along with recognition that various paradigmatic approaches have the potential to reveal new knowledge and insights comes criticism of the post-positivist tradition; the limitations of this paradigm necessitate alternative approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1534484312461636">Callahan, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1534484312461636">Deetz, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1534484312461636">Gioia &amp; Pitre, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-1534484312461636">Townley, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1534484312461636">Valentin, 2006</xref>). Shortcomings of the post-positivist paradigm are cited as lacking local/emergent knowledge, presenting only a representation of the majority, and not allowing room for multiple realities and experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1534484312461636">Deetz, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1534484312461636">Guba &amp; Lincoln, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1534484312461636">Lincoln, 1990</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1534484312461636">Deetz (2001)</xref> was critical specifically of systems approaches from the post-positivist perspective because the research is usually “apolitical and value neutral” and implicitly supports “an orderly, well-integrated world, with compliant members and regulated conflicts, and has accepted without examination existing organizational goals and member positions” (p. 19).<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3-1534484312461636">3</xref></sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1534484312461636">Callahan (2007)</xref> added that within HRD, specifically, the prevalence of post-positivist approaches has created “very little critique of the workplace, and even less critique of society, within the dialogue of the field” (p. 77) and that a focus on performance can subvert knowledge and truth. Some have suggested that often this research has taken a prescriptive-and technique-oriented approach, where HRD is simply a tool designed to produce achievement of goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1534484312461636">Elliott &amp; Turnbull, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1534484312461636">Fenwick, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1534484312461636">Rigg, Stewart, Trehan, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1534484312461636">2007</xref>). Finally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1534484312461636">Valentin (2006)</xref> explained that from a post-positivist approach, “management is seen as a purely instrumental process, objective, politically neutral, simply concerned with methods to ensure control and efficiency in organizations. The roles of managers and the distinction between managers and those they manage are seen to be natural and inevitable” (p. 17). Thus, the opportunity for more alternative perspectives in HRD exists and structuration theory can provide the framework for guiding one possible alternative approach. As the researchers above have argued, alternative approaches are necessary, as they provide different types of knowledge, as well as respond to some of the limitations of the post-positivist paradigm. As I discuss below, ST may be a way to respond to this need for alternative research.</p>

<title>Structuration Theory and its Tenets</title>
<p>ST stands between structurationist approaches, which considers external, environmental forces as predominant to the shaping of organizations, and hermeneutic approaches, which consider the actions and communication of agents to be most influential in the development of structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1534484312461636">Pozzebon, 2004</xref>). ST identifies the simultaneous and reciprocal influence of the agent and structure on each other. Each operates as a resource for and a product of the other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1534484312461636">Boden, 1994</xref>). The foundations of the theory are summarized by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1534484312461636">Giddens (1990)</xref>:
<disp-quote>
<p>The basic suppositions of structuration theory . . . are built upon the notion of the duality of structure, where ‘structure’ in its most generic sense refers to the rules and resources implicated in relation to situated actors. The concept of agency is regarded as equally central . . . the notion of the ‘individual’ or ‘person’ is problematic, not to be taken for granted or left as a ‘blank’ in sociological analysis. A human individual is an agent who, in a chronic and routine way, reflexively monitors the course of her or his action in the <italic>duree</italic> of day-to-day life. (p. 301)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The equal focus on both agent and structure, and their simultaneous influence on the other, establishes the duality of structure. Agents are enabled and constrained by structures; however, the structures are a product of previous actions of the agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1534484312461636">Sarason, 1995</xref>). This duality is described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1534484312461636">Poole and McPhee (2005)</xref>:
<disp-quote>
<p> . . . every action, every episode of interaction has two aspects: It ‘produces’ the practices of which it is a part and it ‘reproduces’ the system and its structure, usually in a small way, as changed or stable. Structuration theory thus explains the system itself as the product of human actions operating through a duality in which structures are both the medium and the outcome of actions. (p. 175)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This interplay constitutes the development of institutionalized practices that are of interest for organizational analysis and change management exploration in HRD. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1534484312461636">Figure 1</xref> below demonstrates the way in which structure and the action of the agent develop institutionalized practices.</p>

<p>This diagram reveals the interplay between the agent’s actions, the rules and resources of the structure, and how the simultaneous interaction generates institutionalized practices which become the norms and standards of the organization. Likewise, because ST acknowledges the role of process in the development of organizations, it allows for exploration of communication as a part of this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1534484312461636">Poole &amp; McPhee, 2005</xref>). To expand this discussion, a few key terms will be discussed and some examples provided: agent, structure, rules, and resources.</p>
<sec id="section8-1534484312461636">
<title>Agent</title>
<p>All humans are considered “knowledgeable agents” within ST (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1534484312461636">Giddens, 1984</xref>). Individuals have agency because of their capability to simply act, no matter their intentions or the consequences of their actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1534484312461636">Giddens, 1984</xref>). This action gives individuals power because of the potential to influence circumstances: “to be able to ‘act otherwise’ means being able to intervene in the world, or to refrain from such intervention, with the effect of influencing a specific process or state of affairs” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1534484312461636">Giddens, 1984</xref>, p. 14). Agents are considered knowledgeable and they participate in reflexive monitoring: “Reflexivity refers to the capacity of humans to routinely observe and understand what they are doing while they are doing it” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1534484312461636">Sarason, 1995</xref>, p. 48). This capacity to be reflexive substantiates the agent’s ability to change the structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1534484312461636">Pozzebon, 2004</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section9-1534484312461636">
<title>Structure</title>
<p>The structure consists of the rules and resources the individuals draw on in their day-to-day lives. The nature of this structure is described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1534484312461636">Giddens (1984)</xref>: “structure thus refers, in social analysis, to the structuring properties allowing the ‘binding’ of time-space in social systems, the properties that make it possible for discernible similar social practices to exist across varying spans of time and space and which lend them ‘systemic form’” (p. 17). These practices reveal themselves in observable patterns of relationships among agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1534484312461636">Poole &amp; McPhee, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>For example, one might observe the current leadership style of an organization as a structure. Because of the organizational values and culture that are often implicit in a chosen leadership style, it is easy to apply the tenets of ST. A particularly hierarchical leadership structure is visible in organizational charts, office set up, pay scale, as well as the observable patterns of relationship among agents (i.e., how decisions are made, who’s allowed to question decisions or make suggestions).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-1534484312461636">
<title>Rules and resources</title>
<p>The techniques and procedures used to inform the agent’s actions are referred to as rules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1534484312461636">Giddens, 1984</xref>). A rule is any principle or routine that guides people’s actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1534484312461636">Poole &amp; McPhee, 2005</xref>). Agents demonstrate their knowledge of the system through their actions, which in turn demonstrate an awareness of the social rules they follow. Individuals apply these rules or formulas to their daily activities as a means for navigating through social interactions in the organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1534484312461636">Giddens, 1984</xref>). A rule that might apply to leadership as a structure would be the either written or unwritten acceptance that the CEO (top leader) can make a unilateral decision. Thus, this rule would inform individuals in the organization about whether it is appropriate to question the CEO’s decisions or how one might give input.</p>
<p>Likewise, access to resources influences the role of the agent and the organization. Resources can either be allocative or authoritative and are anything people are able to use in action or for organizational change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1534484312461636">Poole &amp; McPhee, 2005</xref>). Allocative resources are material features of the environment, means of material production/reproduction, and produced goods. Examples of allocative resources might include one’s position or role in the company, one’s access to financial resources or clients as these could be used as a means to influence or alter the current leadership practices. Authoritative resources are described as organization of social time-space, production/reproduction of the organizational structure, and organization of life chances. Authoritative resources would be those that are less concrete, such as knowledge, power, and tenure in the company. Access and use of both of these types of resources generates power and determines how power functions within the structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1534484312461636">Giddens, 1984</xref>).</p>
<p>Agents, structure, rules, and resources constitute the basic foundation of ST and provide a framework for understanding how social systems are created through the duality of structure. This duality is visible, for example, when examining leadership style in an organization as a structure. Employees abide by the organizational hierarchy as presented by organizational structure charts, decision-making processes, and pay scales; however, they also reinforce this structure with the way in which they choose to communicate or not communicate their opinions and observations with their superiors.</p>
<p>As such, ST provides some guidelines for HRD to approach organizational analysis and change management. However, it will first be beneficial to discuss where ST rests paradigmatically.</p>

<sec id="section11-1534484312461636">
<title>Structuration Theory and Paradigms</title>
<p>Those who discuss ST speak to the error of paradigmatic allegiances that create agency/structure, discourse/organization, or subjective/objective dichotomies and the opportunity for increased understanding with ST (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1534484312461636">Pozzebon, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1534484312461636">Reed, 1997</xref>). In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1534484312461636">Giddens’ (1984)</xref> eyes, these debates were at the ontological level, in that “what is at issue is how the concepts of action, meaning, and subjectivity should be specified and how they might relate to notions of structure and constraint” (p. 2). ST offers “discourses that embrace non-dichotomist logics” as “valuable attempts to purposively explore new understandings of human agency and strategic choice” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1534484312461636">Pozzebon, 2004</xref>, p. 249). Researchers who are interested in asking “what would be the best approach for overcoming dichotomist logics (if overcoming is desired) and embracing a more integrative approach” may find utility in ST (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1534484312461636">Pozzebon, 2004</xref>, p. 250). So, although ST is commensurable with elements of several different paradigms, its primary purpose is to bridge differences with an alternative approach. The specific dichotomies ST attempts to bridge will be discussed first, followed by my assessment of where ST fits paradigmatically.</p>
<p>In developing ST, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1534484312461636">Giddens (1984)</xref> identified the debate and tension between interpretive sociologies, which elevate the actions and influence of humans above structure, and functionalism and structuralism, which view the structure as primary in its influence on action. This agency/structure dichotomy impacted how organizational change might be viewed, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1534484312461636">Pozzebon (2004)</xref> explained:
<disp-quote>
<p>Some of us would operate from imperative lenses, where external environmental forces, viewed as autonomous and formal constraints, shape organizational change or permanence. On the other hand, those who operate from strategic choice views would assume that the first and foremost sources of organizational transformation or maintenance is human agents’ choice and decisions. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1534484312461636">Pozzebon, 2004</xref>, p. 248)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>This dualism created problems for <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1534484312461636">Giddens (1984)</xref>, as he felt it led to two possible errors. On the one hand, the structuralists and functionalists were “suppressing or discounting agents’ reasons—the rationalization of action as chronically involved in the structuration of social practices—look[ing] for the origins of their activities in phenomena of which these agents are ignorant” (p. 26). And on the other hand, the hermeneutic approaches were susceptible to “regard society as the plastic creation of human subjects” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1534484312461636">1984</xref>, p. 26). Both approaches fell short of acknowledging the simultaneous interaction and influence of both structure and agent. ST can provide the opportunity to move beyond the “hegemony of functionalism” and “avoid dualist logic” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1534484312461636">Pozzebon, 2004</xref>, p. 250). It offers a balance between overly deterministic perspectives and dualist approaches by suggesting a dualism which acknowledges the mutual influence of structure and agent on one another.</p>
<p>Along these lines, ST provides a means to bridge the discourse/organization dichotomy as well. The role of discourse in ST will be discussed below, but brief discussion of its orientation toward discourse and the organization is relevant now. As in the agency/structure debate, there are those who view discourse as primary to the organization and those who view the organization as primary to discourse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1534484312461636">Fairhurst &amp; Putnam, 2004</xref>). ST acknowledges the dynamic relationship between the organization and discourse. This mutuality of language and structure is described: “Discourse and organization then mutually constitute one another in that conversations form texts through linguistic patterns that both develop and draw upon memory traces and discursive objects as organizational forms” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1534484312461636">Fairhurst &amp; Putman, 2004</xref>, p. 18). The interplay between language and structure provides another framework for analyzing organizations and their potential for change.</p>
<p>Within this theory an attempt is also made to “bridge objective and subjective ontologies,” because he saw the debate between the two as artificial and believed it was possible to develop a theory that incorporated both (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1534484312461636">Sarason et al., 2010</xref>, p. 239). The functionalists were placing the object (the structure/organization) as dominant over the subject (the agent), whereas those subscribing to a hermeneutic approach tended toward subjectivism where the subject was predominant. ST embraces subjectivism in its conception of the cocreation of structures and institutionalized practices, and acknowledges that reality will vary from organization to organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1534484312461636">Giddens, 1984</xref>). However, ST also acknowledges that sedimentation can occur in organizations as structures and practices are built on other structures and practices, thus making it increasingly difficult to change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1534484312461636">Poole &amp; McPhee, 2005</xref>). The organizational structure, can in that sense become an objective reality with which change agents must come to terms.</p>
<p>Giddens does not make any claims about where ST rests paradigmatically; however, it is easy to see how it might provide an alternative to post-positivist approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1534484312461636">Callahan, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr65-1534484312461636">Weaver &amp; Gioia, 1994</xref>). ST resonates in many ways with the constructivist or critical paradigm. Its ability to work in each paradigm will be delineated below.</p>
<sec id="section12-1534484312461636">
<title>Constructivist paradigm and ST</title>
<p>Constructivism acknowledges the ongoing cocreation of reality and truth through the interactions of individuals in various contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1534484312461636">Lincoln, 1990</xref>). The process nature of ST also emphasizes interactions as the site where reality is generated. Likewise, constructivism views knowledge and truth as context dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1534484312461636">Mishler, 1979</xref>) which aligns with ST’s emphasis on consideration of the context in understanding the duality of structure.</p>
<p>Finally, the methodology of constructivism, “naturalistic, field study, ethnographic, subjective, and grounded theory” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1534484312461636">Merriam, 1991</xref>, p. 48), is also commensurate with ST’s desire to examine processes that occur across time and space. ST aims to explore how the duality of structure generates institutionalized practices; thus, longitudinal research often supported by constructivism is necessary.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section13-1534484312461636">
<title>Critical paradigm and ST</title>
<p>Those who subscribe to the critical paradigm suggest that “society and human nature are human constructions that can be altered through people’s progressive understanding of historically specific processes and structures” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1534484312461636">Comstock, 1982</xref>, p. 372). ST provides one means for discovering and examining these processes and structures. In addition, critical scholars are concerned with conditions of social regulation, unequal distribution, power, and unmasking domination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1534484312461636">Deetz, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1534484312461636">Popkewitz, 1990</xref>). ST provides the opportunity for “scholars to look for the role of power and domination in structuring processes that underlie organizations” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1534484312461636">Poole &amp; McPhee, 2005</xref>, p. 180) and examine how power can be used to dominate social systems. ST aids this process, as “typically, though not always, the operation of power is hidden in complexities of the system, so it is often necessary for scholars to carefully delve in to deeper layers of the structurational process to grasp the locations of power” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1534484312461636">Poole &amp; McPhee, 2005</xref>, p. 177). ST facilitates a process by which a critical analysis of the organization can take place and change might be instigated, which corresponds with the goals of the critical paradigm as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1534484312461636">Greene (1990)</xref> described them:
<disp-quote>
<p>Critical knowledge . . . enlightens an audience by revealing the structural conditions of their existence, specifically, how these conditions came about and what distortions or injustices they currently represent . . . enabling, motivating force to stimulate action, a catalyst for self-reflection toward greater autonomy and responsibility and for strategic political action toward emancipation. (p. 242)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>As ST’s utility as an alternative approach becomes apparent, we can begin to speculate how this approach might offer new and distinct ways of analyzing organizations and instigating change interventions.</p>

<sec id="section14-1534484312461636">
<title>Structuration Theory and HRD</title>
<p>Now that the basics of ST and its paradigmatic grounding have been established, it is necessary to elaborate on its relevancy to HRD. Discussion of how ST has been applied in the three articles previously mentioned will be provided, followed by an analysis of how it might be used based on its tenets and application in other fields.</p>
<p>One article published in the HRD literature refers directly to ST and applies its principles to an understanding of work roles in the organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1534484312461636">Haugen, 2006</xref>). The author argues that a proper understanding of the structure/agent relationship can facilitate organizations that more effectively manage work roles. The other two articles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1534484312461636">Scully-Russ, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1534484312461636">Toracco, 2005</xref>) refer only to a version of ST known as Adaptive Structuration Theory (AST), propounded by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1534484312461636">DeSanctis and Poole (1994)</xref> as a means for understanding adaptation and change in information technology systems. AST is applied to low-wage labor markets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1534484312461636">Scully-Russ, 2005</xref>) and its utility for work design theory is explored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-1534484312461636">Toracco, 2005</xref>). However, in addition to these initial applications of ST, research in other fields suggest that there is verdant opportunity to explore ST’s relevance toward organizational analysis and change management/interventions in HRD.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section15-1534484312461636">
<title>Organizational Analysis</title>
<p>ST provides a framework for analyzing the makeup of an organization in its processes, culture, language, values, and practices because of its focus on how organizations are created and maintained through the language and actions of organization members. This analysis is described as, “studying the modes in which such systems, grounded in the knowledgeable activities of situated actors who draw upon rules and resources in the diversity of action contexts are produced and reproduced in interaction” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1534484312461636">Giddens, 1984</xref>, p. 25), and it can contribute to a better understanding of how organizational identity is shaped by and in turn shapes action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1534484312461636">Sarason, 1995</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1534484312461636">Callahan (2009)</xref> explained that the underlying characteristics of ST render it “important for any field that has interest in properties associated with human organizing” (p. 1154).</p>
<p>ST also facilitates analysis of the discourse/language that is buttressing current practices. Language is the means by which individuals express their awareness of the rules and resources they utilize in their social interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1534484312461636">Poole &amp; McPhee, 2005</xref>). This identification can foster understanding of how the organizational structure has been developed, is reinforced, and how it might be changed through language choices.</p>
<p>In addition, ST helps bridge micro and macro levels of analysis as both contribute to the organization’s makeup. The levels interact as:
<disp-quote>
<p>individuals perform actions in the name of groups or organizations. When these actions become a constituent element in the relations between an organization and external bodies, they move to an even higher level of process. Micro practices begin to be shared, reproduced, routinized and finally institutionalized. Similarly, institutionalized practices, norms, and rules at the macro level (industry, for example) influence everyday activities, constraining or stimulating certain individual perceptions and choices. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1534484312461636">Pozzebon, 2004</xref>, p. 267)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>So, for organizations who are interested in determining how their cultures, values, and practices come to be and are maintained, ST could facilitate this examination. In turn, this analysis provides a means to begin conceptualizing how change might take place through agency.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section16-1534484312461636">
<title>Change Management and Interventions</title>
<p>ST provides a framework not only for identifying the language and interactions that buttress current practices, but also for identifying how individuals might utilize resources to make changes to these practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1534484312461636">Sarason, 1995</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1534484312461636">Poole &amp; McPhee (2005)</xref> added:
<disp-quote>
<p>As agents engage in practices, they draw on structures grounded in the institutional realm and produce and reproduce them in the structuring of meaning, norms, and power. This contextualizes the structures to a particular practice and has the potential to change the institution if particular modes of action that change the structure become widely established in the society. (p. 179)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>As such, there is an opportunity to look differently at how organizational change happens by taking into consideration the embedded institutional practices within an organization and the significant time and effort required to alter these practices. ST could prove helpful for organizations that desire or have attempted significant cultural change but are struggling to identify the engrained values and practices creating their current system and how those values and practices might need to be changed.</p>
<p>In addition, ST’s acknowledgement of resources offers a means to identify what agents might need (in terms of language, power, and knowledge) to enact and sustain change. The utility of ST for supporting and understanding change is highlighted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1534484312461636">Poole &amp; McPhee (2005)</xref>: “Because it is closely tied to the understanding of practices, ST has the potential to yield knowledge that is eminently practical: As we come to understand structuring processes, we give people insights into how systems can be changed or designed differently” (p. 180).</p>
<p>Because this article suggests that ST provides a means to facilitate research and practice from a paradigmatic stance other than post-positivism, it must be noted that the author is not suggesting that ST be used solely as a tool of management to change an organization to meet desired outcomes (a practice that has been critiqued early in this article). However, part of the utility of ST is that not only does it allow a sophisticated means for gaining an understanding of organization practices, but, because it acknowledges the input of agents in the structuring process, there is a means by which change can be initiated. This change may originate from various agents within the organization. However, to align with the philosophical foundations of the critical or constructivist paradigm, the aim of the change should be toward improved organizational action that seeks to enlighten and empower rather than limit or oppress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1534484312461636">Merriam, 1982</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1534484312461636">1991</xref>).</p>
<p>Although ST offers a viable means for analyzing organizations and initiating change, research and application of the theory in organizations has been limited. The necessity for its translation to research is highlighted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1534484312461636">Pred (1990)</xref> who stated, “perhaps the most important means for going beyond Giddens is that of proceeding beyond the theorization of practice to the practice of theory, to theory informed empirical research, to the interpretation of concrete circumstances, actual agents, relations” (p. 128). Discussion of how the theory can be applied to research follows.</p>

<p>Several authors in addition to Giddens have provided suggestions for how research should be conducted from an ST perspective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1534484312461636">Barley &amp; Tolbert, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1534484312461636">Pozzebon &amp; Pinsonneault, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1534484312461636">Reed, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1534484312461636">Whittington, 1992</xref>). There are, however, some challenges to using ST for empirical work. Some critiques of ST suggest that applying the concepts is difficult because the theory is complex, operates at a high level of abstraction, and ST is not easily coupled with any specific research method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1534484312461636">Archer, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1534484312461636">Bryant, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1534484312461636">Callinicos, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1534484312461636">Pozzebon &amp; Pinsonneault, 2005</xref>). However, by reviewing suggestions from Giddens and previous applications of ST, potential research methods can be derived.</p>
<p>It is not necessarily beneficial or useful to try to apply ST as a whole in research projects because of its complexity, and “the value of structurationist concepts will vary according to the particular project in question” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1534484312461636">Giddens, 1990</xref>, p. 312). Thus, it becomes necessary to determine how ST can best facilitate research within HRD. Because ST focuses on the reproduction of practices, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1534484312461636">Giddens (1990)</xref> suggests there are two questions appropriate in any empirical situation: “how should we characterize the practices in which the persons studied engage? What are the basic factors underlying their reproduction across space and time?” (p. 313). These questions, along with a few foundational elements of ST, offer a guide for how research might occur. An ethnographic approach is advocated because the study of day-to-day life is necessary for analysis of how institutionalized practices are reproduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1534484312461636">Giddens, 1984</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1534484312461636">1990</xref>). The relevance of this approach was elaborated upon by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1534484312461636">Giddens (1990)</xref>:
<disp-quote>
<p>to know a form of life is in principle to be able to participate in it—to be able to follow the rules or conventions which are constitutive of the actions of its members . . . if the researcher fails to ‘get to know what agents know’ (discursively and on the level of practical consciousness), behavior can be misunderstood, reasons for action misinterpreted, and false conclusions drawn about the causal processes involved. (p. 314)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>An ethnographic approach, which would include participant-observation, interviews, and artifact analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-1534484312461636">Spradley, 1979</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-1534484312461636">1980</xref>), lends itself to careful consideration of the context, which is integral to understanding social reproduction. Context includes “time-space boundaries around interaction strips; the copresence of actors, making possible the visibility of a diversity of facial expressions, bodily gestures, linguistic and other media of communication; and awareness and use of these phenomena reflexively to influence or control the flow of interaction” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1534484312461636">Giddens, 1984</xref>, p. 282). A thorough understanding of organizations can only be gained when the context is taken into consideration: “The structural properties of social systems exist only in so far as forms of social conduct are reproduced chronically across time and space. The structuration of institutions can be understood in terms of how it comes about that social activities become stretched across wide spans of time-space” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1534484312461636">Giddens, 1984</xref>, p. xxi). Considering the argument that ST facilitates research from a constructivist or critical approach, it would be necessary for researchers utilizing ST to work ardently to avoid the stance of a detached observer and instead seek to involve the organization agents themselves in the process of diagnosis and understanding. Gathering narratives, as described below, could facilitate integration of organization agents. With these basic principles established, specific research strategies can be discussed.</p>
<p>Based on their examination of studies that utilized ST in the information technology (IT) field, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1534484312461636">Pozzebon and Pinsonneault (2005)</xref> identify several effective strategies for gathering, analyzing, and making sense of data from a ST perspective. They isolated two particular strategies as most pertinent: narrative and temporal bracketing and add that these two strategies are most beneficial when examining the duality of structure. Narrative strategies include gathering rich descriptions from participants for analysis as well as crafting narratives as a final product of the research, whereas temporal bracketing separates phases or events within an organization that evolve over time as a means to identify sequences and patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1534484312461636">Pozzebon &amp; Pinsonneault, 2005</xref>).They elaborated:
<disp-quote>
<p>Because of their focus on contextual details, the variety and richness of the incidents described, and the linkages between them, narrative strategies can facilitate the detailed observation of events over time. Complementarily, bracketing strategies, especially in their fine-grained form, increase the ability to follow sequences of subtle changes (or reproductions) of structural properties. Temporal bracketing helps to recognize when and how changes are triggered; narrative strategies help to explain why. (pp. 1366-1367)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The relevance of narrative strategies, which aim to gather and present the rich, contextual stories of the organization, is supported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1534484312461636">Giddens’ (1990)</xref> description of how one should analyze a social system when using ST for research:
<disp-quote>
<p>Analyzing a social system does not mean specifying the rules and resources which ‘compose’ it—for social systems are not made up in such a way. It involves analyzing forms of interaction, and their overlap with social relations, which are expressed in a given cluster of practices . . . [structure] is implicated in the fragmentary, overlapping and quite often contradictory practices whereby day-to-day life is carried on. Structuration theory lays considerable emphasis upon the intersection of day-to-day activities, even of the most routine and apparently trivial kind, with larger institutional forms, including those spanning wide areas of time-space. (p. 313)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Although not directly stated, narrative strategies seem to be most appropriate for capturing this kind of data. Likewise, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr66-1534484312461636">Whittington’s (1992)</xref> call for examination of the multiple identities that managers hold supports a narrative approach. To gather these narratives, an ethnographic approach seems highly suitable.</p>
<p>In addition to these strategies, because of the emphasis on the necessity to consider the context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1534484312461636">Giddens, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1534484312461636">Reed, 1997</xref>) and its impact on the agent, and more specifically the context beyond the organization (that of broader social structures), I suggest that analyzing artifacts of the organization (i.e., memos, organizational charts, etc.) and artifacts of the culture (i.e., popular books on organizational leadership and other media) would enhance the data.</p>

<title>Application of ST for Research in Organizations</title>
<p>Based on ST’s foundations and suggestions for research from Giddens and other authors working with ST, a research strategy is outlined below with justification for each step briefly provided. For purposes of clarity and more specific application, the research strategy will be applied to the structure of leadership within an organization. Leadership style is a particularly pertinent area for ST-guided research due to the organizational values and culture that are often implicit in the chosen leadership style. ST may provide the means to unearth the duality of structure that generates leadership practices in the organization. This approach would be appropriate for three possible situations: (a) organizations that desire an accurate analysis of their current leadership system (what language, actions, and interactions produce and reproduce the system and what rules and resources influence agents’ actions?); (b) organizations that wish to change the current leadership system but are facing resistance, roadblocks, and setbacks (what language, actions, and interactions are reinforcing the old system and what rules and resources are preventing agents from transitioning to the new system?); or (c) organizations that are interested in beginning a change intervention to initiate a shift in leadership systems (analysis similar to that in (a) followed by what modifications in language, rules, and resources need to be made to ensure that change will occur successfully?). The research strategy is necessarily qualitative based on the kinds of questions ST seeks to ask and answer. This strategy includes (within an ethnographic approach) participant observation, narratives, analysis of artifacts, and interviews. Each step is detailed further.</p>
<p>Participant observation forms the basis of this research strategy because it is the means for examining and understanding the day-to-day interactions between structure and agent that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1534484312461636">Giddens (1984</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1534484312461636">1990</xref>) highlighted as instrumental to the creation of social structures. Due to the need for close analysis of actions and interactions, participant observation would need to occur for an extended period of time (at least 3 months up to 3 years) in close proximity. Participant observation of the meetings, communication, and interactions of those in leadership and those impacted by the leadership of the organization would be necessary. The goal would be to identify language, values, beliefs, rules, and resources that are used to shape leadership processes and in turn how leadership processes shape the aforementioned items. Data gathered from participant observation would be used to generate the temporal bracketing mentioned previously.</p>
<p>As mentioned, temporal bracketing separates phases or events within an organization that evolve over time as a means to identify sequences and patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1534484312461636">Pozzebon &amp; Pinsonneault, 2005</xref>). These sequences are also referred to as “rhythmic action clusters” and are evidenced in “serial cumulative and repetitive action embedded within and woven throughout the vast tapestry of longitudinal data” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1534484312461636">Saldana, 2003</xref>, p. 141). This strategy would aid identification of how particular actions or systems instigated or reinforced other actions or practices. For example, are patterns evident in how decisions are made or communication practices that seem to reinforce the leadership system?</p>
<p>Narratives would also be gathered from individuals within the organization to allow for increased analysis of the day-to-day interactions. Individuals would be asked to write narratives around particular events identified as reinforcing or changing the structure. The narratives, in turn, would be analyzed for language that depicts the current leadership system or acts in resistance to the current system.</p>
<p>Examining the context on both micro and macro levels would be accomplished through analysis of artifacts within the organization and cultural artifacts, which might hold bearing on the organization. Internal artifacts for analysis would include interorganizational communication such as emails and memos, policy manuals/handbooks, and organizational charts/structures. External artifacts could include popular books on leadership practices, any governing bodies that might provide direction or guidelines for the organization’s leadership systems, and any other relevant cultural artifact that influences the organization (additional artifacts of importance may be identified through the process of observation). Interviews may be conducted to further explore significant events or sequences that arise through observation or within the participant narratives.</p>

<title>Implications for Future HRD Work</title>
<p>The utility of ST in informing organizational analysis and change management is an area generally untapped in the HRD discipline. Due to increasingly rapid changes in the external environment, a need for a greater understanding of organization analysis and change exists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1534484312461636">Burke, 2008</xref>). Likewise, although alternative approaches to HRD are emerging, there is lack of and need for greater use of alternative forms of investigation, such as postmodern, constructivist, or critical perspectives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1534484312461636">Callahan, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-1534484312461636">Deetz, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1534484312461636">Elliott &amp; Turnbull, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1534484312461636">Fenwick, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1534484312461636">Githens, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1534484312461636">Lynham, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1534484312461636">Rigg, et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1534484312461636">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1534484312461636">Sambrook, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1534484312461636">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-1534484312461636">Stewart, 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr63-1534484312461636">Valentin, 2006</xref>). ST provides one means of approaching research, theory, and practice in organization analysis and change management and offers an alternative paradigmatic approach, which could generate new and creative insights.</p>
<p>For future research, ST provides an alternative paradigmatic foundation from which research can start but also, as illustrated in the aforementioned example, there are specific research strategies that best facilitate this. As research has not been completed using ST, exactly as I have suggested, claims of its relevance are only theoretical. Thus, the opportunity for researchers to apply the principles of ST is verdant.</p>
<p>For theory, HRD scholars might ask if and how ST could be modified to better reflect the nature of organization analysis and change. Several others have suggested adaptations or variations of ST for a particular field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1534484312461636">DeSanctis &amp; Poole, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1534484312461636">Sewell, 2005</xref>) and in the spirit of continuous theory refinement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1534484312461636">Lynham, 2000</xref>), we should work to adapt and improve ST to best suit work in HRD.</p>
<p>In regards to practice, ST provides an opportunity to look differently at organizational change and potentially determine how HRD professionals can more effectively facilitate successful, lasting change. If change agents are able to correctly identify the values, beliefs, processes, and languages that are generating and generated by the organizational structure and culture, efforts to change these can be more informed and thus potentially more successful. Organizational change, like social change, takes time and strategic effort, which are often neglected through ill-prepared change interventions. Although, some may argue the impracticality of ST’s use in HRD because of the time and proximity required, I would suggest that it might be of the upmost practicality if it facilitates successful and lasting change.</p>
