<p>This book documents the fascinating stories of the ‘invisibles’ (domestic workers) among the most ‘visible’ migrant population of China’s cities. Drawing from socialist feminist theory, the author has tried to capture the alienation and exploitation of rural women migrant workers employed in domestic labour. In particular, she highlights the pivotal but patriarchal role of the Chinese state in creating and maintaining the divide between urban and rural employer and employee. By embracing economic globalisation, the Chinese state has not only limited the options for unskilled rural women but also reinstated the age-old gendered division of labour expressed in the form of domestic labour. The economic reforms have brought potentially skilled women into the production markets while shifting the burden of social reproduction to the uneducated and less skilled. In Xinying Hu’s assessment, paid domestic labour in China has created a ‘new underclass’, reinstating a feudal regime of gendered labour in the era of state-guided capitalism.</p>
<p>Economic growth in China has not only given rise to new production relations but also to a new social divide in which female paid domestic labour is the most oppressed. While the Chinese government sees this development as simply the outcome of changed economic relations, the author relates it more to the patriarchal employment regimes that have continued from China’s feudal past.</p>
<p>The second chapter of the book analyses the dismal situation of female labourers in China since feudal times. The old bond-servant regime of the Qing dynasty (1644–1911) where women were bought and sold as slaves conformed to Confucian ideas which confined women to the domestic space, leading to all manner of exploitation. With the colonisation of China by Western forces and the rise of indigenous capitalism, bonded labour was replaced by wage labour. As a result, women’s labour was no longer confined to the domestic domain. Under the garb of liberation, poor rural women were brought into factories as cheap labour. Simultaneously, women were glorified as the ‘mothers of the nation’ in order to encourage nationalist feeling against foreign oppression. The subsequent rise of Marxism as an alternative to old Confucian ideas also saw increased consciousness among women about their rights. The old slave/bond-servant regime was gradually replaced by wage labour, abolishing class distinction and oppression at least in theory, for there were women working as maidservants for Communist officials of higher ranks. This practice was legitimised under the cadre stipend system of certain ranks (Uberoi and Chakrabarti 2004). The Communist era also heard some voices in the form of special articles in journals influenced by the Left, urging better working conditions for domestic servants in order to create a new society in which all the people were masters (p. 27).</p>
<p>In 1949, the advent of the socialist centrally-planned economy promised the inauguration of this ‘new society’, supporting women’s equal participation with men in public production, thus freeing them from domestic unpaid labour. The number of women employed in both rural and urban enterprises increased considerably, requiring the domestic service workers to fulfil the responsibility of social production and childcare for the benefit of the nation. Elderly, less skilled women formed a considerable part of this labour force and a proper employer–employee relationship came into being. However, this employment regime could not permeate the broader national economy due to the socialist commitment to the creation of a classless and equal society.</p>
<p>With the economic reforms beginning in the late 1970s which resulted in the introduction of private enterprises, a large number of urban workers, particularly women, became redundant. At the same time, along with the growing GDP, the urban–rural income gap increased. From the 1980s onward, due to the Chinese government’s focus on employment in the informal sector, the mass migration of people to urban areas led many women to join the domestic labour force as a form of ‘flexible employment’, effectively pushing women back into the private sphere where they had no legal access to rights and job security.</p>
<p>Chapter 4 of the book discusses childcare as one such form of ‘flexible employment’, and the state policies behind its high demand. The restructuring of state policies in the wake of neoliberal economic reforms has led an increasing number of women to seek various types of employment that shift the burden of social reproduction and childcare to domestic workers. The chapter traces changes in the forms of childcare from the early Republican era to recent times, observing that cutbacks in social services like child care, which earlier formed an important part of China’s social welfare system, have increasingly given rise to the need for paid domestic labour.</p>
<p>In Chapter 5, which explores the precarious nature of paid domestic work in China, the author describes the ‘Chinese characteristics’ of paid domestic work, which have developed against the background of eroded socialist morals in the market economy era (pp. 104–5). With the new inequalities created by the market economy, domestic workers have been reduced to a commodity that can be exploited as long as it is paid for. Rural migrant women and laid-off female workers are the worst affected. Due to their educational backwardness and desperation for work, these women end up working in domestic households on low wages, occasionally suffering maltreatment as well. Since state labour laws do not encompass labour relations in the private sphere, the rights of the domestic workers, such as equal pay and access to social security, remain unattended to.</p>
<p>The next chapter (Chapter 6) represents a very important contribution of this book, since it discusses one of the less-discussed aspects of domestic work in China, namely, the resistance offered by the workers for safeguarding their rights and dignity. The resistance is practised at three levels. First, at the individual level where workers negotiate one-to-one with their employers on matters such as wages, working hours, decent living conditions and refraining from doing certain jobs. They also choose their own employers, can refuse to work for some people and can walk out of the job. Second, at the level of NGOs where organisations such as the Migrant Women’s Club, the Centre for Women’s Law Studies and Legal Services of Peking University and the Research Centre for Women’s Development and Rights of the North-western Polytechnic University have been doing a commendable job in providing domestic workers with access to legal and financial aid. Because of the support system provided by national and some international NGOs, many migrant women workers have been able to use the labour laws to fight against serious violations of their rights. These organisations also serve as platforms for domestic women workers to share their experiences.</p>
<p>Third, although domestic work does not conform to the legal definition of a work unit in China, efforts have been made by the All China-Federation of Trade Unions to bring domestic workers under its purview by recognising some private domestic workers’ unions. The Tai Ji Chang Community Domestic Worker’s Union and Xi’an Domestic Worker’s Trade Union represent many cases of successful intervention by these unions for domestic workers’ rights.</p>
<p>Analysing the situation of the workers in all the above chapters and looking at some success stories, Chapters 6 and 7 look into some of the solutions at the policy level in order to improve the working conditions of domestic workers. Drawing upon International Labour Organisation (ILO) standards, the author suggests that the Chinese state should not only implement the international standards for domestic workers but that it should also work on existing laws in order to legally bring domestic work under state labour laws. Efforts should be made to provide actual protection in practice (p. 131) by regulating domestic service agencies and also employers. Most importantly, the government should relax the <italic>hukou</italic> provisions so that rural migrant workers get access to some basic facilities such as health and education services in the cities.</p>
<p>The Chinese central government’s high ideals of creating a ‘harmonious society’ and promoting inclusive growth disregard the very deeply imbibed social disparities that emanate from Chinese history itself. Economic reforms might have opened lucrative avenues in cities for some rural women, but they come along with inherent disparities. The roles of women as the biological as well as ‘social’ producers have always overwhelmed their presence in other sectors of society. Despite the fact that some domestic women workers today are able to fight for their rights, there are many who know nothing of such rights. The domestic work industry in China reinforces the gendered division of labour, which forms the crux of gender inequalities. Unless the state itself takes up the challenge to provide for some public welfare services such as childcare, there is little chance of fulfilling the dream of gender equality in China. The state’s emphasis on economic growth has to be accompanied by a concern for the well-being of the people who are responsible, directly or indirectly, for this growth.</p>
<p>Though this book presents an interesting study of domestic workers in China, it lacks enough empirical support. Some data throwing light on the number of migrants would have helped the readers to get a better sense of the migration patterns among this particular section of women. Nonetheless, given that the substantial writings on the lives of migrant women workers focus mainly on the manufacturing sector, this book is a welcome addition to the literature that argues against the homogenisation of migrant women workers. Solely focusing on the domestic female workers, Xinying Hu’s attempt to reach this highly invisible and scattered population and trace the historical roots of domestic work in China deserves appreciation. Moreover, her detailed interviews with domestic workers help the reader understand this complex phenomenon in a more comprehensive way.</p>
<p>Not only in China, but throughout the world, the easy availability of this occupation to women who are economically vulnerable and not well-equipped in terms of education and training, has led to an increase of studies in this direction. Even in India, the shift from an agrarian-based economy to a manufacturing and services-based economy saw a sudden growth in the numbers of domestic women workers in this highly unorganised employment sector. According to the ILO, the number of domestic workers in India is around 2.5 to 90 million, out of which more than half of the labour force comprises women, who migrate from rural areas sometimes because of marriage and sometimes without it in search of work (International Labour Organisation 2011). There have been several instances in India too, where cases of subjugation of domestic workers have surfaced. However, Indian NGOs and other women’s organisations are making efforts to bring paid labour by women under some kind of legal umbrella so that they have access to a rights and redressal mechanism against any type of harassment at the workplace. In both India and China, the government and non-governmental bodies need to make consolidated efforts and take firm steps to create conditions to reintegrate this ‘underclass’ into mainstream labour.</p>
