<title>Resume</title>
<p>This article approaches the concept of tendential modernity as a type of evolution towards principles and norms of modernity within societies with an insufficiently functioning capitalist economy. In these societies, there is a gap between faster institutional renewal and slower economic development. Consequently, cultural, political and intellectual modernity outrun economic modernity. Tendential modernity refers to the ideas and actions aimed at modernization which remain partial and not finalized. Modernity is more an aspiration, a societal developmental intention, a goal to be reached, but which is never fully realized. Due to the fact that modernity is merely a tendency that is never finalized, the transitions are never completed. Modernity moves slowly and with difficulty through the intricate network of socio-institutional structures of the patriarchal and traditional society. It is inlay modernity, not structured under a clear, dominant form. My thesis is applied to the study of Romanian society’s modernization through all its stages: the emergence of the national state, the period between the two World Wars, the communist period and the post-communist period. Even though these periods are not all homogeneous in their rate of development, tendential modernity characterizes the evolutionary process of modern Romania.</p>

<title>Résumé</title>
<p>L’article aborde le concept de modernité tendancielle comme un type d’évolution vers des principes et des normes de la modernité dans des sociétés d’économie capitaliste insuffisamment fonctionnelle. Dans ces sociétés, en raison de l’écart entre le renouveau institutionnel plus ou moins rapide et le développement économique, la modernité politique, culturelle, intellectuelle, va plus vite que la modernité économique. La modernité tendancielle se réfère à des idées et des actions en vue de la modernisation, qui restent partielles et non finalisées. La modernité est une aspiration, une intention de développement, un objectif à atteindre, mais elle n’est jamais pleinement réalisée. Etant donné que la modernité n’est qu’une tendance, jamais finalisée, les transitions ne sont jamais achevées. La modernité avance lentement et difficilement à travers le réseau complexe des structures socio-institutionnelles de la société patriarcale et traditionnelle. Il s’agit d’une modernité incrustée, non structurée en vertu d’une forme dominante claire. Cette analyse s’applique à l’étude de la modernisation de la société roumaine à travers toutes ses étapes, émergence de l’Etat national, période entre les deux guerres mondiales, période communiste et période post-communiste. Même si toutes ces périodes ne sont pas homogènes dans leur rythme de développement, la modernité tendancielle reste une spécificité du processus d’évolution de la Roumanie moderne.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The new geopolitical configuration after 1989, together with the accession of new states to the European Union (EU), challenges the researcher to find a more adequate approach to the standards of modernity EU Member-States are expected to acquire. Some studies describe different types or stages of modernity within the European Union, and argue about the existence of modernity differences within it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0539018411426518">Stråth &amp; Triandafyllidou, 2003</xref>). The type of modern development found in Western and Northern countries is not totally replicated in other European societies, such as Greece, Spain and Portugal, among those countries that gained access to the European Community prior to 1989. There is no doubt that several types of modernity can be found in Europe: the modernity of the Western and Northern countries, the modernity of the Southern European countries and the modernity of the former communist countries.</p>
<p>Most of the current sociological paradigms focus on explicative models regarding modernity in the Western regions of the EU. J <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0539018411426518">Habermas (1987)</xref>, A <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0539018411426518">Giddens (1990)</xref>, U <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0539018411426518">Beck (1992)</xref> and Z <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0539018411426518">Bauman (2000)</xref>, the creators of some of these modernity models – the reflexive, the second and the liquid models – outline the pattern of Western modernity. It is no accident that the paradigms mentioned above do not tackle the modernity found in other European regions, such as Central and Eastern Europe, since they emerged within a Western-centered vision of the evolution of modern society.</p>
<p>Giddens states clearly that his analysis of modernity refers to institutional transformations, to the national states and the systematic capitalist production that originated in Western Europe:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Both [the national states and the systematic capitalist production] have their roots in the specific characteristics of European history and have few parallels in prior periods or in other cultural settings. If, in close conjunction with one another, they have since swept across the world, this is above all because of the power they have generated. No other, more traditional social forms have been able to contest this power in respect of maintaining complete autonomy outside the trends of global development. Is the modernity distinctively a Western project in terms of the ways of life fostered by these two great transformative agencies? To this query, the blunt answer must be yes. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0539018411426518">Giddens, 1990</xref>: 174)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The evolution and the dispersion of modernity throughout the world have demonstrated, over time, the limits of the unique pattern of modern development. As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0539018411426518">Habermas (1987)</xref> writes, the theory of modernization moves modernity away from its modern European origins. It proposes a pattern of development process beyond the spatial and temporal dimension, for instance conceptualizing multiple modernities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0539018411426518">Eisenstadt, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0539018411426518">Kaya, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0539018411426518">Lee, 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>The historical evolution of modernity is understood as a transition from a traditional society to a modern one, focused on industrialization, rule of law, urbanization, welfare and wealth, and science through education and instruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0539018411426518">Alexander, 1994</xref>: 168–169). In fact, this description expresses the functionalist view on modern society. One may say that those societies with a solid, structured modernity have a universalistic vocation because they intend to spread and impose their own values all around the world.</p>
<p>Studies on Romanian modernity fall into at least three categories or positions.</p>
<list id="list1-0539018411426518" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Modernity occurs and acts in the same way in all societies, and, therefore, Romanian society should follow the same stages of the unique evolution that led to modernity in an industrialized, urbanized and democratized society.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Romania is experiencing late modernity, and this modernity is, unavoidably, the result of an imitation of Western modernity. When we talk about late modernity, we are in fact referring to a modernity which occurred later than in the West, but which follows the same trend as in the West.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Romanian modernity is specific because of the relative independence of its historical and cultural traditions from the economic development. These traditions are very deeply rooted in the Romanian collective subconscious.</p></list-item></list>
<p>In this article, I discuss the necessity of approaching modernity from the angle of the historical trend of Romanian society. In contrast to theses stating either that Romania is modern or that its modernity is not real, I will try to provide evidence that highlights the existence of a certain type of modernity, one that is specific to Romanian society, and perhaps to other societies with an insufficiently functioning capitalist economy. In opposition to the classical definition of modernity, related to progress and linear evolution, to never-ending advance in a pre-determined direction, Romanian modernity shows a particular penchant for co-habitation with pre-modern social practices and traditions. As a result, the thesis of the connection of today’s Romanian society to the reflexive Western model of modernity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0539018411426518">Vlăsceanu, 2007</xref>) cannot be defended without having a debate about the existence of a modernity that will evolve into the Western type.</p>
<p>I explain the present-day situation of Romania – the least economically developed EU member-state – with the help of the historical, political, geopolitical and cultural contexts which led a society with an underdeveloped economy to build the political, legal and institutional organism of the modern Romanian state. I start from the premise that the modernity of Romanian society from its early times – the end of the 18th century – was closely related to the European space, especially the Western and Central European zone. Undoubtedly, the agents of modernization and of modernity have always looked for a modern institutional construction identical with the institutional framework of the West. From this perspective, I maintain that the ideal and the vision of the Romanian social actors have intersected with European doctrines on modern development.</p>
<p>First, I discuss the phases of the appearance of modernity in the region inhabited by Romanians. I then go on to discuss the concept of tendential modernity. Finally, I analyze the types of conduct and discourse on modernity.</p>

<title>The historical evolution of Romanian modernity</title>
<p>The modernization of Romanian society is concomitant with processes of the foundation of the independent unitary nation-state, an action that accords with the European institutional and ideological models of modernization. To understand the tendential modernity that is specific to Romanian society, it is worthwhile to briefly summarize the phases of the modern foundation of the Romanian nation-state, an independent state, built on the idea of national consciousness and shared history and culture.</p>
<p>For a long time, Romanians had been living in the separate states of Moldavia, Walachia and Transylvania. Since 1775, Moldavia-Bukovina to the north had been annexed by the Habsburg Empire; and, since 1812, Moldavia-Bessarabia in the east had been annexed by the Russian Empire.</p>
<p>Moldavia and Walachia were organized as separate states with a certain degree of autonomy from the big empires of the Central- and East-European zones. The two Principalities were unified in 1859, but under Ottoman suzerainty; while independence from the Ottoman Empire would be gained in 1877 and recognized by the Treaty of Berlin in 1878. In 1881, Romania was proclaimed a Kingdom. In 1866 a modern Constitution had been adopted. Romania was the first constitutional state from Southeastern Europe.</p>
<p>Under the principle of nationalities and the right of peoples to self-determination, Transylvania, Bukovina and Bessarabia were integrated into the Romanian Kingdom in 1918.</p>
<p>The Romanians’ historical ideal of integrating in Europe, ‘in the civilized world’, and thus distancing themselves from Balkanism or from Russian and oriental influence, brought the Romanian dissidents to adopt, politically and institutionally, the path of social development through modernity. From the foundation of the modern Romanian state to the present day, all ideologies highlighted modernity as a dimension of development.</p>
<p>The first modern advances in the Romanian provinces happened under different influences related to the geopolitical areas to which each province belonged. In Moldavia and Walachia, modernity appeared under the influence of French culture and civilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0539018411426518">Eliade, 1898</xref>), an influence that continued after the unification of the two principalities that created the Romanian national state in 1859.</p>
<p>In Transylvania and Bukovina, in the 19th century, the dominant influence was the modernity derived from the modernizations produced within the Habsburg Empire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0539018411426518">Hitchins, 1996</xref>); here Romanians, especially the elites, were influenced by the processes of modernization taking place in the Romanian kingdom.</p>
<p>Once Greater Romania was founded, in 1918, modernity became related to the processes and actions that arise within a nation benefiting from its own well-identified state. This modernity started from the ideal of building a unitary political and legal institutional framework, able to modernize the whole of Romanian society, since, in this way, the levels of development specific to Western countries could be reached. The emphasis of the modernization process was on the creation of a national, coherent and strong state capable of achieving the national ideal, which was to unite the Romanians into a unitary state. The antebellum governing programs did not give priority to economic issues, and Romania had the lowest per capita domestic product in Europe in the interwar period.</p>
<p>The instauration of the communist regime in 1948 interrupted the European-like, Western-originated modern evolution of the Romanian state, which had not reached the standards of a developed country. Communism was established as a social system opposed to the modern capitalist system. This was the principle that acted to destroy the institutions and the elites as agents of modernization.</p>
<p>It has to be said that, during the communist period, processes of modernization had been in operation, such as industrialization, urbanization, literacy, but all these had been implemented in a social and political context that denied individual rights and freedoms.</p>
<p>After the Romanian Revolution in 1989, Romanian society returned to European modernity by modernizing all sectors and by embracing an institutional construction similar to that of the European Community. The post-communist period gave modernity a fundamental goal, that of reconfiguring Romanian society: ‘The existing resources of modernity become a factor of pressure towards acceleration of the social changes, especially of democratization’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0539018411426518">Sandu, 1996</xref>: 260). Still, in my opinion, these resources are insufficient because the effects of modernization are not present in the development of all areas of the society, as I argue in this article.</p>
<p>Following this short presentation of the phases inherent in Romanian modernity, one can say that the modern history of the Romanian people is characterized primarily by their efforts towards achieving the independence and the unification of all Romanians in a single state, two imperatives which directly impacted on the consolidation and the legitimacy of the Romanian nation-state. The construction of this state is configured by modern principles and institutions, borrowed from other European countries – for example, the legal system, the parliament and the constitution. But these were applied in a rural and predominantly agrarian society, whose norms and values differed from those of the modern Western societies.</p>
<p>Modernization motivated and obliged the internal actors to work towards the construction of the modern Romanian state, with modern institutions and legal frameworks. To this end, they adopted the French model of a centralized political and administrative system, and, as far as the unification of all Romanians into a single state was concerned, took Germany as the main model, which conceived the nation according to the ethnic principle, to culture and to traditions. Both models were adjusted to the historical and geopolitical contexts of Central and Eastern Europe that defined Romanian society. The modernization processes had to deal with a versatile institutional environment – decisions and actions kept changing – a fact that had an obvious impact on the depth and duration of modernity. It is acknowledged that the historical trajectory of Central and Eastern Europe was significantly different from that of Western Europe: ‘The region became the periphery of a transforming West during the early modern centuries. The nineteenth and twentieth centuries were characterized by repeated attempts to catch up with the West’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0539018411426518">Berend, 2005</xref>: 401).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section3-0539018411426518">
<title>Modernity produced by the state</title>
<p>Throughout its history, the Romanian state has given priority to national construction, and the problems related to economic and social development were postponed or subordinated to the national issue. The creation of a national identity in the context of dependency on the great empires was essential. The same situation also existed during the communist period, when the country’s autonomy from the Soviet Empire was the top priority for the Romanian state.</p>
<p>The Romanian state provided the necessary framework for the modernization process, including that of the institutions: ‘the state represented the instrument through which the renewal policy was elaborated and implemented – becoming state policy –in the dimensions required by the creation of the modern bourgeois society’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0539018411426518">Platon et al., 1993</xref>: 89).</p>
<p>The institutional creation of the modern Romanian state was based on the Western democratic system but it was adopted under different circumstances than those in Western Europe. The Western-European values of democracy and liberty appeared as a result of the aspirations and interests of the bourgeoisie, which also created the national state for their own support. Before gaining political power, the Western bourgeoisie had economic power – a fundamental element in imposing a bourgeois political regime. By contrast, the Romanian bourgeoisie obtained political power before going through all the stages of training, in terms of country development and modern public-administration management. The Romanian bourgeoisie, being few in number, did not have a strong economic base. However, after the 1866 Constitution and through the liberal leadership of 1876–1888 it became a predominant political force in society. Under the pressure of internal forces, European powers accepted the creation of the modern Romanian state, on condition of turning it into a capitalist society, which had to develop through institutions of the bourgeois state. A modern state was created in the absence of a modern Romanian society. Since 1989, the same thing has happened: the new Romanian capitalists appeared as a consequence of the privatization of property and not just of the functioning mechanisms of a capitalist economy. In the post-communist period, the new ruling elite in Romania formed like those in Eastern Europe, where a ‘capitalism without capitalists’ has been promoted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0539018411426518">Eyal, Szelenyi &amp; Townsley, 1998</xref>).</p>
<p>Capitalism creates new forms of government embodied in the shape of the national state, based on the bureaucratic organization of its institutions. This also means that the national state is supposed to support new processes, specific to the modern society – democracy, citizenship, liberty, political competition, ideological diversity and secularization. Had a national state not existed, any consequent change in the modernized societies would have been impossible. This is the context, which also generates its limits. State structures were necessary in order to democratize the society and to develop its economy. Logically, the national state should protect the majority classes. Yet the national state acted to create the classes of modern society, especially the bourgeoisie. It did not work towards finding solutions to the problems of agriculture, the state and the peasants. The modern Romanian state acted, paradoxically, against the interests and the needs of the majority social groups. The adoption of modern institutions was a way of satisfying certain minority social groups’ interest in creating a modern civilization and culture; it was not an objective of the entire social organism. The real needs of social modernization were postponed for the future because the action of the state in this sense was always limited.</p>
<p>Modernization driven by the state is one of the main features of Romanian modernity. The difference with Western Europe lies in the fact that, in Western Europe, the state acted with the direct support of the new class, the bourgeoisie, which possessed the tools of the capitalist economy. By contrast, in Romania, the state adopted legal and political structures by borrowing them from the Western space and not because of pressure from internal representative social groups. In Western Europe, modernization went from bottom to top, that is, it was accomplished by the society itself, while in Romania, it was imposed by the state through institutional structures. While in Western Europe the state and the society together produced the modern transformations, in Romania, the state imposed the modern institutions that later created the modern society. Capitalist rationality was slowly enforced by state actions. Unlike the situation of economically and socially consolidated countries, in countries of emergent modernity, the state is of an authoritarian type, but the same state is far weaker than modernized states.</p>
<p>The Romanian model of modernity has been created through bureaucratic ways, but not by a bureaucracy in Weber’s sense, derived from the bourgeois institutional system, but instead a bureaucracy which imposed the top-down reformation of Romanian society by elites situated in top positions in administration. Unlike the West, where, as a result of their economic power, the bourgeoisie won political power as well, in Romania, the state created the political-legal framework, formed mainly by institutions borrowed from Western society, a situation which allowed the bourgeoisie to take the political power and, from here, to own the economic power. The Romanian bourgeoisie became a social force <italic>de facto</italic> only after they gained economic power with the direct help of the Romanian state.</p>
<p>A bureaucratic organism, unprepared to increase the efficiency of the activities of its institutions, sustained this state. The Romanian bureaucratic system distinguishes itself by a rigid structure, which does not allow true social mobility of public servants, financially and professionally motivated by involvement in the process of exercising their attributions. This could be a fundamental reason for the inefficiency of Romanian bureaucracy, and this has happened because of the contradiction between the state budget bureaucratic apparatus and the real capacity of the state to financially and economically sustain this system. This situation leads to outsize expenditure from the state budget to a lack of qualified labor in the administration, to a lack of tradition in managing modern institutions, to corruption, nepotism, bureaucracy, and to an incapacity to understand the mechanisms of the state in a modern society.</p>
<p>Low economic development did not, however, stop the Romanian state from upholding modernization by creating and supporting modern institutions: schools, army, justice, parliament and political parties. These institutions laid the foundations for the new Romanian identity. The education reforms that took place in 1864, 1898 and 1924, which supported the development of the school system, are significant in this respect. The school system has proved to be a promoter and sustainer of modernity values.</p>
<p>In conclusion, modernization was and still is a process of political institutional construction, which takes precedence over economic development. This modernity stems from the modernizing acts of a nation-state. The Romanian state focused on national construction, while economic and social development were postponed or subordinated to the national imperative. The construction of a national identity in the geopolitical context of the Romanian nation was and remains fundamental.</p>

<title>Romanian theses on modernity</title>
<p>Several approaches to the modernization of Romanian society have been highlighted. In Romania the modernization process has always known a deficit of modern development and synchronization, which generated specific effects during the pre-modern period, such as economic dependency, lack of balance between rural and urban areas, and poverty (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0539018411426518">Love, 1996</xref>). Most authors who deal with this issue in Romanian history analyze this deficit using Western theoretical concepts and visions, even if the question itself was posed long ago in explicit forms by some authors. Although there are Romanian contributions to the study of modern development, i.e. theories like ‘forms without substance’ (Eminescu, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0539018411426518">1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0539018411426518">Maiorescu, 1978</xref>), ‘the politicking’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0539018411426518">Rădulescu-Motru, 1904</xref>), ‘new-serfdom’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0539018411426518">Gherea, 1910</xref>) and ‘synchronism’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0539018411426518">Lovinescu, 1925</xref>), these are not included in the pool of fundamental concepts of modernity studies.</p>
<p>In 1868, in his article ‘Against the present direction in the Romanian culture’, Titu Maiorescu defined his thesis on the discrepancy between the internal background and the forms adopted from the West during the modernization process. He writes that progress cannot be achieved without passing through all the inherent phases that occurred in the modern states, and the sudden adoption of Western institutions does not unconditionally lead to change in the context of a lack of an internal foundation capable of sustaining the modern institutions. On the contrary, the result is the fragmentation of the organic evolutionary course of Romanian society. Adopting Western forms only gives the illusion of Romania as a modern country:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>Apparently, according to the statistics on the external forms, Romanians today possess almost all the features of Western civilization. We have politics and sciences, journals and academies, schools and literature, museums, conservatoires, theaters, we even have a constitution. But in reality, all these things are lifeless, they are claims without foundation, ghosts without a body, illusions without truth, and therefore the culture of the Romanian upper class is null and valueless and the abyss which separates us from the lower classes gets deeper and deeper. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0539018411426518">Maiorescu, 1978</xref>: 151)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Maiorescu remarks on the creation of the modern political and administrative institutions, deprived of a modern economic foundation and in the absence of a Romanian bourgeois class.</p>
<p>As for the construction of modern Romanian institutions, the Romanian philosopher C Rădulescu-Motru has a pertinent perspective. In his study, <italic>The Romanian Culture and the Politicking</italic> (1904), he states that Romanian modern institutions were brought in as a result of ‘social imitation’. In reality, it was all about a ‘change of scenery’, because such institutions were not compatible with the Romanian rural soul. The modern institutions would be beneficial only for a small group. The bourgeoisie and the capitalist institutions of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century have no roots in Romanian historical realities, they are just improvisations, forms without substance.</p>
<p>In the second decade of the 20th century, Ştefan Zeletin argued, in contradiction of Titu Maiorescu, that the Romanian institutional organism is bourgeois owing to social and economic capitalist transformations. His conception was a reaction to the idea – well known in Romanian culture – that Romanian modern development relied on the importation of forms. Zeletin points to a contradiction in the conduct of the Romanian elites:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>… we work like the bourgeoisie and we think like the medieval people, we reached the modern period on foot, we remained in the medieval period in our minds; this is why our entire culture is to caricature ourselves: we try to understand our bourgeois aspirations through our medieval mentality. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr62-0539018411426518">Zeletin, 1925</xref>: 254)</p>

<p>This contradiction between the aspirations to modernity and a non-modern mentality characterizes Romanian society’s evolution up to the present day.</p>
<p>Zeletin considers the capitalist forms in Romanian society to be the consequence of a necessity or of a ‘historical fatality’: ‘the birth of the Romanian modern bourgeois societies is an effect of the development of capitalism’, of the production and of the capitalist exchange of goods, originally developed in the West and then expanded to Romania.</p>
<p>Striving to suggest a sociological interpretation of the formation of the Romanian civilization, E Lovinescu elaborated the theory of synchronism, according to which the Romanian civilization</p>

<p>Mihail Manoilescu is recognized by the international scientific community for his theory of underdevelopment. One of his main ideas is that protectionism is a way to develop the economy of agrarian societies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0539018411426518">Manoilescu, 1929</xref>). Manoilescu’s corporatist ideas on economics were very popular and were applied in Latin America (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0539018411426518">Love, 1990</xref>: 62), especially in Brazil: ‘[his] ideas were a kind of Bible for most of the Brazilian industry’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0539018411426518">Fausto, 1999</xref>:18).

<title>Tendential modernity</title>
<p>The modern development of Romanian society was and still is studied in the light of sociological concepts related to modernization theory, which has developed over time: tradition, diffusion, adoption, adaptation, development, underdevelopment, independence, dependency, center–periphery, unequal exchange, industrialization, Westernization, reforms, sustainable development and structural reform. It is dominated by the organicist point of view, which considers it to be a transitional process from pre-modern to modern society. If the emergence of classical modernity is the consequence of radical changes, derived from industrialization processes, rationalization, the emergence of the national state, and the differentiation between public and private spheres, then it is clear that Romanian modernity had a different evolution than the classical form.</p>
<p>In contrast to all the above-mentioned types of modernity, Romanian society has known a particular modernity, which can be labeled ‘tendential modernity’.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1-0539018411426518">1</xref></sup> The term refers to the actions and ideas of modernization within Romanian society, actions and ideas that remain partial and not finalized; to this extent, modernity remains mostly an aspiration, a goal to be reached, but never fully achieved. Tendential modernity is a provoked modernity, the result of rearguard modernity, not avant-garde. The thesis of tendential modernity presupposes mainly a separation between ideas, or projects, and actions, or policies. In this case, the ideas are circulated within the public space, but the actions that derive from those ideas are not finalized. Tendential modernity is conceptually understood as a distance between intended modernization and achieved modernization due to the speed differential between the economic (development) side of modernity and the cultural, political and intellectual side.</p>
<p>The tendential represents an evolution of the modernization process, an evolution determined by internal and external factors and societal contexts. These factors and contexts usually act in a contradictory manner, and the intensity of their respective influences may be different. From the temporal point of view, tendential evolution is not certain and univocal, but probabilistic. Being a tendential state of a society, modernity is not a certitude on all levels of the social organism because it is inconsistent and it manifests itself unequally in different areas. While the classical theory of modernization considers modernity as an unavoidable process derived from the organic, pre-determined evolution of the society, in my view, modernity presents itself as a tendential transformation, as a result of the interactions between internal and external contexts of a society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0539018411426518">Schifirneţ, 2009c</xref>).</p>
<p>I want to stress that the words ‘tendency’ and ‘tendential’ are not synonymous, even though they may be understood as a major orientation towards a certain option among other possible options. We must separate ‘tendency’ from ‘tendential’. Tendency expresses the trend, the direction of an action which, if it is not unavoidable, is definitely steady; while tendential expresses the non-fulfilment, the fragmentation and the incompleteness of tendency.</p>
<p>The concept of tendential modernity refers to the idea that modernity is inconsistent and slow. Given the lack or insufficiency of internal modernizing resources (ideological, economic, administrative, financial, etc.), tendential modernity is a type of asymptotic modernization, which never succeeds in reaching the requirements of modernity, no matter how close it seems to come to Western modernity.</p>
<p>Basically, all modernities are tendential. Tendential modernity is universal, including the case of states that have a well-structured and functional type of modernity. Even in this case, there is a tendency to surpass the status quo, to reach a new level of relationship with the establishment. The concept of tendential modernity covers a dynamic reality; it may be divided up only for the purpose of investigation and analysis, but actually it is a continuum, and it is therefore difficult to tell where it starts and where it ends.</p>
<p>In contrast to societies where modernity is well structured owing to a solid and efficient economic ground, in a society with a modernity in the process of consolidation, this modernity is primarily tendential. It seems that this tendential modernity is never settled, that its modernizations are always mere tendencies because, here, the time span of these kinds of phenomena is much longer.</p>
<p>In non-Western rural societies, modernity is only tendential and projective; it reflects the path of modernization that is going to be accomplished, sometime in the future. Tendential modernity is characterized by ambiguity, contrasts, contradictions, paradoxes and features that are also specific to other societies, like India (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0539018411426518">Pick &amp; Dayaram, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>It is true that tendential modernity is contemporaneous with reflexive modernity, the latter being convergent in some aspects with the modernity of developed Europe, and divergent and particular in other aspects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0539018411426518">Vlăsceanu, 2007</xref>: 99), which, in fact, represents the difference. For instance, Romanian modernity is mainly tendential because it has too many particularities and too few convergences with contemporary Western modernity. Romanian society does not face the transition just from one modernity to another (industrial to post-industrial), it has also to make a simultaneous transition from pre-modern to modern and from industrial to post-industrial.</p>
<p>Modernization produces, or should produce, the disintegration of traditional societies, a process finalized in Western societies. Other societies did not experience the same radicalism and profoundness. Their modernity was a dissolving of the old traditions alongside, to a small degree, an act of building modernity. The example of globalization as a process of the interdependency of all nations is relevant to our thesis. This interdependency shows the presence of modernity all over the world, not modernity as a unique pattern, but modernity as a diversity of modernities.</p>
<p>The internal modernization processes have been oriented, at the beginning of each transition stage from the old regimes to the new ones, towards the creation of a political, judicial, democratic and modern organism through a profound change of the old institutions. However, the concrete actions of modernization have been accomplished, for different reasons, by imitating the Western institutions and adopting their laws in the absence of a knowledge and critical evaluation of the specific particularities of the society. Western Europe did not start the modernization process as a political project with a mission statement: ‘we want to modernize ourselves’. Its economic, social, historical and cultural evolutions led to modernization. Western modernity cannot be reproduced in non-Western societies, and, thus, the political project becomes unavoidable.</p>
<p>Tendential modernity derives from the influence of modernity on certain social categories only, identified through modern attitudes and behaviors, but having insignificant influence on the rest of the society. As with every incipient social process, modernity was supported by small groups and tended to present ideas and individual conducts taken from Western cultures and civilizations. As the modernization processes multiplied, it became obvious that Romanian modernity was further and further from the ideal-type identified in Western modernity. While the discourse created the impression that Romanians were closer to the Western ideal-type of modernity, current practices showed that they were far from conforming to this framework.</p>
<p>As many scientific studies about modernization testify (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0539018411426518">Balandier, 1985</xref>: 137), not all components within a society evolve towards modernization at the same rate. Some social groups accept change readily; by contrast, others refuse it. As a consequence, tendential modernity generates changes only at some levels of the society. These changes are sustained and promoted by groups concerned only with their own social and economic condition, interested in social change with real profit only for themselves. Tendential modernity advances slowly and laboriously through the intricate network of socio-institutional structures of the traditional and patriarchal Romanian society. It is a mosaic modernity, not one that is structured as a clear, dominant form, inexistent as a project of modernization.</p>

<title>Modernity in the context of economic underdevelopment</title>
<p>The multiple experiences of modern societies have shown that modernization is probabilistic, not deterministic. Economic development tends to alter a society in a predictable direction, but the process and the path are not inevitable. Many factors are involved in the modern development of a society. To mention just some of these multiple deterministic elements, it should be remembered that economic evolution is usually associated with important changes in the dominant values and beliefs of a society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0539018411426518">Inglehart &amp; Baker, 2000</xref>: 49).</p>
<p>In societies on the verge of modernization, the national state was created in the context of a backward economy. This type of development is different from what happened in the Western regions. The state does not intervene in the development processes of societies that are about to be modernized in the same way it did in Western countries during the first stages of their modernization, where the state assisted in creating the economic infrastructure.</p>
<p>After two centuries of modernization, Romanian society is today in a state of economic underdevelopment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0539018411426518">Dăianu, 2010</xref>). The evolution of its modernity processes has led neither to economic progress nor to a narrowing of the gap between Romanian society and the developed countries.</p>
<p>Economic underdevelopment has deep historical roots, the most important of which is economic isolation because of dependency on the geopolitical context of the Romanian space, as situated in Eastern Europe: ‘Eastern Europe was in some sense economically backward long before it was absorbed into the broader Western world market’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0539018411426518">Chirot, 1989</xref>: 3). This geopolitical position has impeded the modern and capitalist development of the area. The 16th through the 18th centuries and the first half of the 19th century, known as a thriving period in Western Europe, are characterized by the stagnation and degradation of economic life in the Romanian space. I would remind readers of the Turkish monopoly on trade in the Romanian Principalities, the prohibitions imposed by the Ottoman Empire on trade with other countries, including the Western market. The effect of these realities is that ‘for hundreds of years, nothing has been invested in agriculture, which used to be the almost unique source of income’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0539018411426518">Axenciuc, 1999</xref>: 34).</p>
<p>Underdevelopment should not be imputed to external factors alone, though. The Romanian ruling groups have not developed projects for economic modernization. They have transferred much of their wealth to Western Europe, spending luxuriously on studies, travel, temporary residence, fashionable living in big Western cities; the consequence has been a ‘long-lasting shortage of financial resources for the development of these countries [the Romanian Principalities], lasting for almost two centuries’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0539018411426518">Axenciuc, 1999</xref>: 34). For this reason, there has been no accumulation of capital for the internal social groups to invest in modern economic development, industry and services.</p>
<p>The discrepancy between the internal conditions and the forms of modern civilization appears more acute in countries with a lower economic living standard because modern political and legal institutions have not emerged in response to a natural organic evolution of the local economy, driven by a strong economic and intellectual power, promoting and supporting modern changes. In the case of the Romanian state, its poor economy has been the reason why its political and administrative institutions, although similar in form to those of any developed country, do not measure up to Western standards of modernity. The Romanian economic system has always been mercantile, stimulated and supported by foreign capital, and is only to a small degree oriented towards production and efficiency. According to the declarations made by the Governor of the National Bank of Romania, Mugur Isărescu, the largest proportion of Romania’s external debt is in the non-production sector. Almost 5 billion euros have been invested in building supermarkets. In fact 75% of private debt is in the non-production sector. And it speaks for itself that one million new cars were bought between 2007 and 2009 alone (<italic>Gândul</italic> news paper, 24 Nov. 2010, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.gandul.info/financiar">http://www.gandul.info/financiar</ext-link>). One is led to the conclusion that, currently, the Romanian economy is dominated by the non-production sector, which is why it does not have the social and economic power necessary to modernize the political, administrative, legal and cultural system.</p>
<p>It is impossible to go into all the causes of the evolution of the Romanian economy, but we can invoke as a witness the way in which the social internal actors, beginning with short-lived progress in several economic sectors, rush to present statistical data and explanations to prove that Romania is getting closer to the level of the developed countries. This triumphalism is specific to the elites, who argue not on the basis of the real effects of that progress across Romanian society, but instead in comparison with the developed countries. The Romanian public space experiences a rhetoric of progress which encourages the belief that there has been a leap in economic development. Yet in reality there is no evidence for such a leap. For instance, some of the advertised results of the economic development in the interwar period gave rise to slogans such as: ‘Romania, one of the most developed countries of Europe in the interwar period’, ‘Romania, the Belgium of the Orient’, and ‘Bucharest, the Little Paris’, all of which proved to be ‘false legends in the historical reality’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0539018411426518">Axenciuc, 2006</xref>: 51–52).</p>
<p>Although the peasantry dominated the society numerically and the economic activity was predominantly agricultural, the elites’ debates in the public space and in written works focused on how the economic level of the most industrialized countries could be reached. Romanian political elites have constantly been challenged to develop models. However, they have always looked to the Western model for solutions. The Romanian expression ‘to reach out …’ became a kind of commonplace in the collective mentality, unconditionally associated with modernization. A backward country is always like a runner trapped in an infernal race where modernity seems to be a way of overtaking others, and even yourself, in an invisible competition. The development of a society cannot be the effect of a competition that pushes the society towards a non-organic evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0539018411426518">Geană, 2000</xref>), it must instead be the consequence of a project stemming from the inner needs of modernization.</p>
<p>Modernity is associated above all with the agrarian issue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0539018411426518">Stahl, 1979</xref>). Making clear decisions concerning the capitalist transformation of agriculture and of the villages has been postponed for 200 years. Romania has experienced modern changes, some of them substantial, but in only a small proportion have they reached the rural community and affected work relations in agriculture. This can be explained by the fact that the expropriation of the ‘peasants’ and their ‘transformation into agricultural workers’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0539018411426518">Georgescu, 1992</xref>: 143) has not been internalized.</p>
<p>In Western countries, feudal relations were dismantled in all sectors of society, and industrialism, an economic factor of their intrinsic modern evolution, was installed. In Romania, however, the poor economic development of the rural areas and its effects on the living conditions of the population are due to the preservation of feudal and semi-feudal relations in agriculture. Also, the Romanian state was late in adopting agricultural reforms, which were not brought in until after the First World War.</p>
<p>In Romania, agriculture was the most important source of income and the support of the entire modern superstructure. As has been shown, the costs of modernization were paid by agriculture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0539018411426518">Platon, 2003</xref>: 36), but the beneficiaries were the elites and, more generally, the urban population. Modernization took place for the real benefit of only a minority; and the rest of the population, predominantly rural, had to pay the exorbitant costs of the existence of some institutions that did not contribute to the modernization of the villages. In exchange, the rural population gave their physical labor from which the necessary income was obtained for the consumption of the groups benefiting from modern development.</p>
<p>Capitalism entered Romanian agriculture without altering the social structure, which suffered from strong associations with serfdom (<italic>iobag</italic>). The contradictions also manifested themselves in other domains of public life; but in agriculture, the discrepancy between the domestic economic substance and the modern characteristics of the institutions was underscored by the decisive role of the agricultural sector in the development of the country, more precisely in creating national income. Before 1944, agriculture had been responsible for 70–75 % of the material production, with most of the population working in this sector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0539018411426518">Platon, 2003</xref>: 66). In the same period, the number of proletarian workers in Romania was very small: 6.62% of the population (<italic>Romanian Statistical Yearbook, 1939/1940</italic>). In 2010, over a quarter of the population in Romania was working in agriculture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0539018411426518">Mărginean, 2006</xref>), which was one of the highest proportions in the European Union.</p>
<p>Although the Romanian state has started on its way to capitalist development, the fundamental issue of the autochthonous society remains the archaic style of activity in agriculture, based mainly on the peasants’ physical labor, whose efficiency and productivity is low. The capitalist development of Romania has exposed the existence of a very serious problem: the gap between a pre-capitalist agriculture – the dominant economic sector, exploited with rudimentary means – and a Western-type political and legal organism. Historically speaking, this state of activity in agriculture derives from the under development that is specific to Eastern Europe. Economic-history researchers claim that the economic lag between Eastern and Western Europe has been evident since the Middle Ages, when agricultural productivity grew much faster in the West than in the East (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0539018411426518">Murgescu, 2010</xref>:19). If capitalist production structures have worked in other economic sectors, in agriculture they have emerged with great difficulty because the economic and the social contexts of the village have not been transformed. There is a striking disparity between those modern superstructural forms brought about by a bourgeoisie and by serf-style agriculture.</p>
<p>The Romanian social and political construction supported by modern institutions has been based on an agricultural economy not leading to modernity. Modern institutions are forced to work in an only slightly modified rural social framework. I am adamant in my observation that, although most of the resources for the development of Romania have been achieved through activities in agriculture by the rural population, the village and the peasantry have not been included in the modernization processes. This is why there is a gap between the modern world of the city and the pre-modern world of the village. The peasantry, the most numerous social class, have been excluded from the modernization projects, and they have continued working and living in a pre-modern, patriarchal world, far from the positions of producer and consumer of capitalist products. The fact that the state has not taken action to bring about radical and total change in agriculture, in the spirit of capitalism, has been the main cause of the persistent disparities in Romanian public life.</p>
<p>The patriarchal life-style is not affected by the modern legislative regulations. The present-day life of rural inhabitants does not differ in any way from the life led by peasants in the 19th century. The old patriarchal family, supported by the norms and values of the groups in the rural community, has survived in some villages. The structures of modern civilization are only lightly present in the contemporary village in Romania, a Member-State of the EU and NATO – two memberships that should have boosted and accelerated its modernization.</p>
<p>Despite all the economic progress made over time, it was very difficult to maintain a balance between the economic, social, political and national levels, and this is why Romanian modernization was accompanied by underdevelopment, as I mentioned at the beginning of this section. The Romanians were accepted into the European Union with this legacy: ‘We have 40% of the population with a toilet in the yard. Let us not forget that is the way Romania was integrated in the European Union!’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0539018411426518">Dăianu, 2010</xref>). This phase of underdevelopment goes hand in hand with the well-being of various small groups that can afford a much higher-than-average standard of living. An image of the contrasts in Romanian society can be encountered on the Romanian roads. Although, in Romania, there are only two motorways, totaling 300 km, and there are many substandard roads, this does not stop rich people driving the latest-model Ferraris. Demand for this type of car was still rising in 2010, even though Romania faced an economic crisis.</p>
<p>In the process of economic modernization, the most important actions were attributed to the state, and the financial resources were provided by the state as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0539018411426518">Axenciuc, 1999</xref>: 37). But these resources were insufficient to eliminate the lag between Romanian economic development and that of other countries. On the other hand, it was the leading groups that created the modern political and legal framework by following the pattern of Western institutions, a vital framework for the functioning of the national state.</p>
<p>The modern Romanian state transferred resources from the undeveloped agricultural sector to fuel its functioning and industrial development. It did not invest in the technical and financial means of increasing the productivity and the profits derived from the capitalist exploitation of agricultural fields; instead it proposed projects for further industrialization, although the state and the society did not have the technological means or the financial capital to sustain them. Agriculture was simply not considered to be a key sector for economic development.</p>
<p>As a consequence, one branch of the economy, agriculture, with low labor productivity, served as the source of income for the development of a modern state. This tendency was potentiated in the communist period when a program for overcoming underdevelopment was implemented. The communist regime declared Romania a developing country, a phase which had to be brought to an end by means of an extended program of industrialization. In reality, the development strategy of the communists did not decrease the gap with other countries; on the contrary, it increased the lag. As a result, the Romanian economy found itself in the position of having a relatively archaic structure as a result of expanding its resource-consuming heavy industry and neglecting the development of the service sector and agriculture. With such a development project, Romania tended to repeat, in the second half of the 20th century, a development model which, in the more-advanced countries, had already been considered modern at the end of the 19th and in the first half of the 20th century. Most of the economic indicators showed that Romania was in last place in Europe, lagging behind not only the developed capitalist countries but also a large number of socialist countries in Central-Eastern and South-Eastern Europe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0539018411426518">Murgescu, 2010</xref>: 328). This lag was extended in the post-communist period, when Romanian society distinguished itself through continuing to evolve via underdevelopment of the rural world, degradation of urban life, the creation of a pre-capitalist-type private sector and the establishment of a ‘show-case democracy’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0539018411426518">Pasti, Miroiu &amp; Codiţă, 1997</xref>: 208).</p>
<p>This phase of underdevelopment was also due to the elites’ incapacity to propose economic policies and to put them into practice. In Romania, the economic and the financial elites do not have political power, which is why they cannot impose their programs of economic development. The welfare of certain groups was not the result of obtaining profits from economic activities, but stemmed from the use of political or fiscal means or from capitalizing on their position as public servants. The process of capital accumulation depended on having political power – on being a member of the leading party, for example, or a politician at the top of the hierarchy. In a society with a tendential modernity, like Romania, political power is the main way to gain economic power, while in countries with a structured modernity, economic power serves to gain political power.</p>
<p>The intellectual elites were aware of the imperative to assert national identity through new forms of civilization and a new modern institutional framework, but these devices did not solve the huge internal social problems. On the contrary, they were making them worse (at this level, the agrarian problem was decisive). Some of the elite groups were concerned that modernization processes would affect the Romanian national identity as embodied in the peasant culture. In Western Europe, industrialization radically transformed activities in the agricultural sector, the peasant became an industrial worker and, as a consequence, peasant culture disappeared. In Romanian society, the process was different from that in Great Britain, where the industry of wool-processing led to the modernization of activities in the agricultural sector and, at the same time, to the exclusion of small-scale producers, who were forced away from the land to work in industry. On the contrary, the slow rate of industrialization, the continuing monopoly control on the production and distribution of industrial goods, the lack of investment in the creation of organizations, the low demand for goods and services from the majority of the population (which was mainly rural) and the low level of urbanization blocked the emergence of radical upheavals in agriculture and in the peasantry’s attitude towards capitalist land exploitation. What the Romanian reformers objected to was not the taking over and adoption of modern forms, but their lack of use in eliminating underdevelopment, in harmonizing progress at the political, social and economic levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0539018411426518">Schifirneţ, 2007a</xref>).</p>
<p>Nowadays, the goal of political elites is the reformation of the state in the absence of a program of economic reforms. From a performance standpoint, the Romanian economy is one of the most precarious in Europe.</p>
<p>The economic development in Romanian society has particularities derived from its combination of economic growth and the qualitative transformation of the economic and social structures. This observation is sustained by analysis of the post-war economic evolution of Romania and Ireland, both of which were in the phase of economic underdevelopment before the Second World War. A comparison between Romania, a member of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance, and Ireland, a member of the European Community, is relevant for what I define as a geopolitical space of development. Membership of the European Union has had positive outcomes for the Irish economy, mainly because of the transfers of community funds. The European Economic Community intended from the outset to act to reduce economic disparities between its regions, in the context of eliminating customs barriers and creating a Common Market, but adoption of a cohesion policy was relatively slow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0539018411426518">Murgescu, 2010</xref>). In the same period, during the 1980s, Romania, as a member of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance, did not benefit from fund transfers, since the USSR, the leader of this international economic organization, could not offer communist countries aid similar to that given by the European Community to such Western countries as Ireland. From 1961, the Romanian state expressed its opposition to Russian proposals to integrate the economies of the member countries of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance, which would have diminished their individual sovereignty and independence. The Council for Mutual Economic Assistance tended to transform itself into a supranational organism which controlled the economies of the member-states and where economic-development strategy was established by the USSR. Moreover, within the framework of the socialist economic system, Romania was meant to develop its agriculture and give up its industrialization, an activity that was assigned to Czechoslovakia and the German Democratic Republic, two industrially developed countries, in comparison with the rest of the countries of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance. However, Romanian industrialization and urbanization became possible during the communist period thanks to the support provided by the income and the products obtained from agriculture – a sector in which private property was abolished and new forms of collective agricultural exploitation were organized, these forms being totally opposed to the individualistic spirit of the Romanian peasant. All these changes affected people’s economic behavior, discouraged individual initiatives, and led to feelings of resignation and survival-oriented behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0539018411426518">Mărginean, 2006</xref>: 165).</p>
<p>The particularities of Romanian modernity were further exacerbated after 1990, in the post-communist period. While everybody was waiting for a renewed modernization of the country, a phenomenon occurred that was not to be found in developed societies: a large proportion of the population working in industry and in the cities migrated back to the agricultural sector and to the rural world, which led to the <italic>re-ruralization</italic> of Romanian society. This re-ruralization was a key element in the perpetuation of tendential modernity. Today, a significant percentage of Romanians have reverted to antebellum ways of life.</p>
<p>The transition from a socialist economy to a capitalist economy resulted in the emergence of unknown phenomena in the Romanian village: unemployment, subsistence agriculture and extreme poverty, all leading to a fall in the rural population’s living standards. The proportion of field-hands was 28%, and that of the rural population working in agriculture reached 60% (INS, <italic>Statistical Yearbook 2008</italic>), these values being among the highest in Europe. The Eurostat data (2008) showed lower rates of jobs in agriculture in Poland (19%), Croatia (16%), Greece (15%) and Portugal (15%).</p>
<p>The rural world and agriculture are the less-developed sectors of Romanian society, which is itself insufficiently developed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0539018411426518">Bădescu, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0539018411426518">Mărginean, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0539018411426518">Mărginean &amp; Precupeţu, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0539018411426518">Otiman, 2006</xref>). Retrocession of landownership due to the 1991 land law was imposed without offering owners the inherent inventory that had existed when they entered the production cooperatives. They were forced to purchase the whole agricultural inventory. Alternatively, in industry, commercial societies benefited from the administration of the capital goods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0539018411426518">Mărginean, 2006</xref>). The return to private property in agriculture did not produce progress in this area, which was largely left behind – there were many peasants and a few farmers existing in a predominantly subsistence economy. Agricultural production depends to a small extent on the application of modern production techniques, a fact assumed by the public authorities, who consider that the most important role in agricultural production must be attributed to climate conditions. One of the causes of Romania’s low agricultural productivity is that small properties predominate, an obstacle to modernization of the organizational framework of land exploitation and, consequently, to the modernization of the entire economic system.</p>
<p>It is necessary to distinguish between social and political development. The former involves urbanization, education, industrialization and means of communication. Political modernization means democracy, peaceful transfer of power through free and fair elections not through force, durable political institutions, stability, structural differentiation, development models and national integration. Even though it was politically modern, Romanian society had known many lags, contradictions and discrepancies due to the fact that the state had limited resources and the Romanian social actors did not have sufficient access to external resources. The state did control and still does control all allocation of resources. The Romanian state is thereby separated from the impetus of its own economy and production, becoming the main consumer of its own resources. Consequently, the Romanian state administrates both an underdeveloped agriculture and backward public services. The factories and the industrial companies, which transformed the life of the small cities or rural areas, have disappeared. The large-scale sectors of the economy have been transferred to foreign ownership. The landscape of some de-industrialized localities is dominated by ruins, which gives them the look of a battlefield. Furthermore, villages which have been artificially transformed into urban centers lack even minimal urban conditions. This has served the interests of some bureaucratic groups.</p>
<p>Romanian society modernized itself despite having a low level of economic development. Re-organization of its society according to free-market principles and rule of law did not bring about a modern social organization with a transparent and impartial governance, an impersonal public administration focused on the public good, a reliable civil society or a public space dominated by direct dialogue between the main social actors. The result was a non-communist social system and not a capitalist one with a market economy, because the process was reduced to replacement of state monopolies with private ones, which are not very different from the former in terms of social and economic relations. All of the anomalies, contradictions and discrepancies that emerged during the modernization process are, in fact, specific features of the new capitalist trend of development, which has manifested itself only partially in the form of a tendential capitalism or a partial capitalism, lacking the capitalist economic mechanisms, based on performance and profit.</p>
<p>In conclusion, then, during the modern period Romania did not benefit from exploitation of the historic chance offered by the reiteration of global economic growth. The institutional framework was based not so much on a specific project as on the adoption of certain forms and ideas taken from other cultures, which were not interested primarily in economic development. The resources mobilized in Romania’s modernization process were institutional, and not economic. As a result, Romanian modernization was first of all a political, legal and administrative modernization since the main problem was national; economic development – essential for every highly modernized state – was quickly submerged by issues of national concern. This argues strongly that modernization was not a factor in eliminating the economic lag.</p>

<title>The role of intellectuals in processes of modernization</title>
<p>The theory of modernity raises the issue of the role of intellectuals in all processes of modernization. It is already well-known that a society cannot move to modernity without the presence of modernizing elites. If, in the Western regions, the nation bases its existence on the rule of law and the action of society on the state, in the Eastern regions, it is the indigenous culture, especially the language and customs, which is deemed essential for describing the nation. This explains the prominent role played by lexicographers, philologists and folklorists in stating national ideas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0539018411426518">Smith, 1991</xref>). This thesis proves to be at least partially true in Romanian modern history, along with the trends noticeable in South-Eastern Europe, where modernity came about as a cleavage from tradition, produced by intellectuals in their desire for equality with the political elites. There modernization was designed in a top-down manner, and the institutional renewal started with intellectuals and with their new social and cultural functions. The Romanian bourgeoisie was joined by the Romanian intellectuals, a situation differing in so many respects from those elsewhere.</p>
<p>In transitional regimes, the intellectual elites provide the public space with a sophisticated discourse on freedom, democracy, justice, etc., but they have to live in social and economic contexts that scarcely support those values.</p>
<p>Intellectuals, either through their own initiatives, or through institutionally organized actions, appear to have been one of the essential elements of modernization in the Romanian context. Under certain conditions, intellectuals took over the role of the middle class, which stimulated the process of modernization. Intellectuals have always been the middle class in Romania. They have pleaded for modernization, although they have not had enough material and financial resources to support the affirmation of new ideas to their full extent. The capacity for dissimulation and a degree of adaptability are characteristic of many intellectuals. These capacities can be helpful in spreading ideas and exchanging contentious views about modernization.</p>
<p>It is no accident that almost all intellectuals in Romania argue for an organic evolution of the modernization processes and against some of the ‘excesses’ of the rushed development.</p>
<p>As creators and transformers of the national culture, intellectuals are aware of the necessity to found the culture on an originality that is, in the case of Romania, offered socially by the predominance of the peasants and spiritually by the folk culture, especially the rural one. Scholars are clearly interested in making the culture adequate to deal with the problems that are specific to the nation. In all events, it is worth mentioning that as scholars are becoming more and more aware of their identity, through language, historical awareness, national awareness and national solidarity in the context of ever closer relations within Europe, the need arises for that spiritual space within which to found and consolidate the nation. Historical conditions have compelled the Romanians to appeal to Europe, since the establishment of the modern Romanian nation is tightly connected to the evolution of Europe.</p>

<title>The elites caught between the rhetoric and the reality of modernity</title>
<p>Romanian elites believed that the state should be the key factor in building the nation. Due to the rapid succession of transitions, Romanian elites have had continually to create alternatives to the old ideologies and political regimes. Instead of constructing by taking over viable directions from preceding regimes, they criticized and demolished everything that had gone before, thus expending a lot of energy to no purpose. They have not been able to configure the ‘dominant of modernization’. This is why Romanian society has too many centers, with no strategic concept of where each modernization project could set out from and return.</p>
<p>Even though the elites have a high level of competencies, their social and intellectual performances do not have a significant effect on the deeper levels of Romanian society. Maybe this is the reason for the discrepancy between the civic orientation of the elites and the indifference of society at large to civic problems. The lack of communication and real solidarity between all segments of the society, between elites and other social groups, is a proof of tendential modernity. The elites have been too preoccupied with the cultivation of national identity to educate the Romanian people.</p>
<p>When I talk about elites, I am referring to all kind of elites: political, scientific, cultural, financial, economic, etc. In a society characterized by tendential modernity, the elites tend to conform strongly to the decisions taken outside the national framework. In fact, today, we witness a concentration, a spatial organization of the elites in special structures. The technocratic, financial elites ask for specific spatial features with regard to the material support of their interests and practices:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>In short: elites are cosmopolitan, people are local. The space of power and wealth is projected throughout the world, while people’s life and experience are rooted in local places, in their culture, in their history. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0539018411426518">Castells, 2010</xref>: 446)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Although outward-looking, Romanian elites are not fully cosmopolitan; they vacillate between cosmopolitanism and localism. Some members of the elites belong to cosmopolitan networks, but they do not have enough force to decisively influence the evolution of Romanian society, and that is why the action of the masses seems to be more powerful than the pressure of the elites.</p>
<p>One may observe the lack of a definite dominant at the level of the modernization process, with the exception of the chaotic synchronization generated by the acceptance of some general European values. These are assimilated by the governing elites through adopting various directives wholesale, without trying to adapt them to Romanian foundations. One example of this effect is the adoption of all regulations deriving from the European Aquis.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-0539018411426518">2</xref></sup> This has been more of a linguistic exercise than an exercise in modernizing Romanian society around a clear dominant.</p>
<p>The elites, especially the intellectual and political ones, put forward a modern vision of the evolution of social life, and they search for arguments to support Romanian modernity as being similar to that of Western countries; but they disregard the real difficulties a society encounters in introducing changes that deviate from the traditional social order.</p>
<p>In reality, within Romanian society, the judicial system and the modern intellectual system have been imported despite the traditional cultural order, so that they have been altering each other, thereby making the orientation of the social actor particularly complex and difficult. The two-century evolution of the idea of modernity in the Romanian space shows a strong resistance on the part of the traditional social order to influences and actions coming from the modern social order. The traditional cultural model continues to provide the social actors with axiological and pragmatic points of reference, which are often stronger than the legal order and modern democratic ideology. Most of the population continues to live by standards that differ from the modern and pro-modern norms of the elites. These modern and pro-modern norms claimed by the elites exist only at a declarative level, however, because, in point of fact, even the elites act in accordance with non-modern principles. Although Romanian cultural elites adhere to modernity in their theoretical and public discourses (philosophical, scientific, political, etc.), they hardly ever succeed in finding specific, practical approaches to modern development and, like ordinary social actors, they act as if they had no attachment to the behaviors implicit in a modern democracy. The elites are representatives of a formal order, which is not clearly defined, and they make broad declarative use of it, in oral and written discourses and programs. But when they follow their own projects and interests in their everyday life, they cannot escape the kind of social order that is based primarily on communitarian-traditional values and norms:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>We have here not only a distance between what is said and what is done, which the recent sociological research signals, but also a sharp distinction between the social space of institutional positions (structural positions) and the social space of everyday life (position in situation/context). (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0539018411426518">Stanciulescu, 2002</xref>: 37–38)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>On the other hand, the economic and institutional modernization visible in the behavior and mentality of some representatives of the elites is not reflected in the profound structures of the society, which are mainly rural. Here there are signs of poverty, of status relations, of survival behavior, while capitalist attributes, such as performance, risk and competition, are missing altogether.</p>
<p>I thus note that modernity is a consequence of the blending between what is traditional and what is modern. Modernization programs have always imported landmarks from the West, predominantly through books; but encountering the reality of social organization can diminish much of their application to the national context. Western standards of modernity can impose constraints, unacceptable in certain national contexts and therefore of dubious legitimacy, without facilitating changes that individuals can perceive as potentially beneficial. This is why modernity appears as a tendency which does not reach the classical standards. The cleavage between the elites and society in general is explained by the acts of the elites, who distance themselves from the values of modernity in order to achieve their own purposes within the given conditions and to enhance their own benefits from the modernization experience.</p>
<p>Modern institutions, such as the university, still work according to paternalistic- oligarchic principles. The universities disseminate the most important stock of ideas about modernity, but these self-same universities have difficulty changing because of mechanisms such as those imposed by our particularly complex structural pluralism, intensified by the precarious material and financial conditions in which they operate.</p>
<p>In order to survive in such a context as this heterogeneous, complex and hard-to-read structural pluralism, and within a society with a low standard of living and insufficient financial resources, a significant element among the bureaucratic elites and intellectuals support each other in articulating a melting-pot of different landmarks belonging to different social orders, in order simultaneously to achieve their purposes and to create the appearance of being politically, and legally, and intellectually, and interactionally correct. This is the ethic of demonstrative complicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0539018411426518">Stanciulescu, 2002</xref>: 71–91).</p>
<p>The elites’ rhetoric of modernity emphasizes social reformation through imitation or through the importation of institutions and laws from developed societies, especially in the West; but it ignores the contexts in which those laws and institutions were adopted as models emerged, and, because of it, they have failed to generate a Western democratic society, and have instead become its product. Change has to come gradually, and ‘building a sound framework of social, political, and state institutions is the work of generations’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0539018411426518">Johnston, 2005</xref>: 198), such that modernity is generated by values and social and political practices which are fundamental for a society and have support from the social actors.</p>
<p>The dilettantism of the elaboration and of the enactment of Romanian legislation is proof of what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0539018411426518">Pridham (2006)</xref> says about the difference between the will and the capacity of the Romanian political elites. In reality, the political and the administrative elites do not have the ability to produce and to sustain a qualitative and competitive social development. This is why every change without a strong foundation is reduced to an experiment, with social effects that cannot be foreseen or anticipated. A specific feature of Romanian administration is a discontinuity in their reforms to bring about changes in political power:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>… the most obvious strategy, which characterizes the changes in power in post-communist Romania, was that the first concern of any party gaining power was to interrupt any reforms the former government might have started and design them all over again. This led of course to frequent institutional changes, to confusion and to ever protracted reforms. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0539018411426518">Pârvulescu, Demsorean &amp; Vetrici-Soimu, 2006</xref>: 46)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>Tendential modernity is the direct effect of inadequate social management. There is a lack of managerial competencies able to generate a modernity oriented towards the future. A frequently found feature remains the lack of institutional rigor, together with institutional instability and a lack of clear institutional regulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0539018411426518">Stanciulescu, 2010</xref>). From this state of affairs springs the mistrust between agencies and social actors. The predominant attitude is one of general suspicion of the actions, ideas and efficiency of active, dynamic and performance-oriented individuals or groups. To all these, we may add the frustrations resulting from the inability to attain certain social positions. The political system is seen by public opinion as a driver of transition, full of failures and responsible for the inefficient functioning of the institutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0539018411426518">Zamfir, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>The political elites are often modern and post-modern only in their declarations, but non-modern in their practices. We refer briefly to some examples. For instance, they have decided in favor of and adopted the uninominal vote by which election to Parliament is by direct vote for an individual candidate, not to a list, a method that is supposed to give a modern character to the Romanian system of Parliamentary elections. The ‘uninominal vote’ was thought to make representation between the citizen and the elected parliamentarian more effective, mainly in the citizens’ interest. In reality, this electoral system has led neither to an increase in the feeling of responsibility on the part of the politicians to their electorate, nor to a stronger civic spirit on the part of the electorate. It was overlooked that Romanian political life depended on other factors, related to historical context, tradition, history, dominant political culture, social structure, etc.: ‘the election system can be, at most, a premise, which is necessary, but not sufficient for the change of a political reality considered unsatisfactory’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0539018411426518">Buti, 2009</xref>: 41). The modernity of a new electoral system thus remains an inclination towards a desideratum that has not yet been achieved.</p>
<p>Another example which explains tendential modernity is the adoption of political strategies from other countries, great significance being attributed at present to the <italic>Contract with Romania</italic>, a programmatic document elaborated by the Romanian Democratic Convention (RDC) in 1996, based mainly on the election manifesto of the US Republican Party (<italic>Contract with America</italic>). In this document, the RDC promised the electorate that, within 200 days from the time they became the leading party, they would pass laws to improve the economic and social situation of the country. It must be remembered that the RDC was sending a message of wide support offered by the Western democracies and, as a consequence, they insisted on inviting many foreign investors to Romania. It was estimated that Romania would benefit from 60 billion dollars in investments, and the result would be a considerable development of the country. Moreover, the existence of a large number of specialists (15,000) prepared to take over the leading positions in the administration and economy was intensively discussed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0539018411426518">Pavel &amp; Huiu, 2003</xref>). In the event that they would not be able to fulfil the promises made in the <italic>Contract with Romania</italic>, the RDC committed itself to relinquish its political power. These objectives were not fulfilled, but the RDC continued governing for the entire period of its legislative term, 1996–2000.</p>
<p>The conduct and the mentality of the Romanian political elites reveal the same idea as the concept defined by the Romanian philosopher C Rădulescu-Motru – ‘politicianism’, which he defined as:</p>
<p><disp-quote>
<p>… a genre of political activity, or, rather, a refined practice of political privileges, through which some of the citizens attempt and sometimes succeed in transforming the institutions and the public services from means of creating public welfare, which they should be, into means of achieving personal goals. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0539018411426518">Rădulescu-Motru, 1904</xref>: 3)</p>
</disp-quote></p>
<p>The elites, especially the intellectuals, argued that the society was aiming at inappropriate objectives and not at the priorities of a post-communist society. For example, a widespread idea concerned returning to the pre-Second World War Romanian social organization model, seen as the ‘golden age’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0539018411426518">Murgescu, 2010</xref>), although Romanian society in the last years of the 20th century consisted of other social categories and existed in a different geopolitical context. This is an argument which maintains that the elites embrace the easy option for ideas and explanations taken from other cultures or other historical periods, thus proving their inability to propose strategies of modernization in accordance with present-day social and economic realities.</p>
<p>The elites imposed by the new social system acted in pursuit of a new beginning, showing a tendency to deny the legacy of the former social system or political regime. This is why Romanian modernity seems to be an unfinished process. For instance, the public discourse of the elites is mainly critical of communism, although the better part of the population is faced with other social and economic problems, which affect their standard of living. This cleavage between the intellectual elites’ anticommunist discourse and present-day Romanian social reality is confirmed by a survey conducted between 22 October and 1 November 2010 by the Institute for the Investigation of Crimes of Communism and the Memory of Romanian Exile and by the Center for Opinion and Market Research, on a sample of 1123 persons aged 15 years and over. This research concluded that 83% of Romanians polled stated that they had not suffered because of communism (neither themselves, nor their families). Only 3% of the subjects mentioned that they were badly affected by communism (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.crimelecomunismului.ro">http://www.crimelecomunismului.ro</ext-link>).</p>
<p>Indeed, nowadays, the Romanian people have an ambivalent attitude towards the communist period and its meaning: on the one hand, the majority of the population thinks that a form of repression existed, that the communist leaders took advantage of different privileges, that the victims of the communist regime should be indemnified; on the other, many of them believe that the communist system was a positive thing and that communism stood for a good idea. Forty-four percent of the people questioned said that communism was a good idea, but a badly applied one. In addition, almost one in eight subjects considered that communism was a good idea, and that it was well applied too (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.crimelecomunismului.ro">http://www.crimelecomunismului.ro</ext-link>). Many Romanians have a lower living standard today than during the communist period.</p>
<p>We will not discuss here the causes that led to the fall of communism, but it has to be underlined that the transition from communism to capitalism did not lead to the affirmation of meritocracy and professional competence in society, to overcoming the lack of economic development of the socialist period or to the improvement of the standard of living, which should have been superior to what was achieved under communism. Public opinion expresses its belief that privatization, the main path of the transition to a capitalist economy, was often actually a massive theft of the public property created during the communist period, and that the new economic and financial elites were beneficiaries of the capital derived from this privatization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0539018411426518">Pasti, 2006</xref>).</p>
<p>The post-communist period in Romania led to the emergence of two categories of elite: an elite with political power and an economic elite. Romania, a member of the EU, is struggling against economic chaos and against the deepening impoverishment of the population, a process opposed to the stability provided by the communist regime for the majority. Obviously, businessmen, a segment of the elite who live in the richest areas of Romanian cities, think that communism was exclusively negative, without acknowledging any of its achievements.</p>
<p>Although a political and legal institutional framework has been established, based mainly on European legislation and norms, I have to say that the foundations of capitalist and democratic development are still precarious in Romanian society today. One of the causes of this situation lies in the fact that there is no critical mass of reformers in society willing to devote more effort towards the construction of modernity. The political class and the intellectual elites have a modernity-oriented discourse, but they fail to create a consistent project of development and of modernization. The rapid construction of an institutional system identical with that of Western Europe was galvanized by two big national priorities: the creation of the nation-state and its independence, priorities organically dependent on a modern political and juridical system. But this modern institutional construction lacked a theoretical project, unlike the case of France, where a broad and deep spiritual and cultural movement preceded the Revolution of 1789. By contrast with other cultures, Romania proposed, most of the time, a <italic>post festum</italic> theoretical project. This means that it explained only the effects produced by a certain national or social event, but did not elaborate on a theoretical vision of the future evolution of Romanian society. Romanian culture is oriented mainly towards the past and only to a small degree is it focused on creating scenarios of future evolution. None of the important moments of modern Romanian history, including the 1989 Revolution, have been based on a theoretical project.</p>
<p>Romanians are influenced and shaped by their own history and social world, which continues to perpetuate mentalities and behaviors that are not compatible with the culture characteristic of European modernity. Tendential modernity expresses clearly enough the duality of people’s thinking and acting. Romanian modernity is happening as a top-down change, through institutions led by a minority educated in the spirit of modernity, which is trying to modernize a hostile or indifferent majority because modern behavior and values are not intrinsic to the lifestyle of any individual or social group. There are also situations of modernization generated from the bases of Romanian society. For instance, Romanian migration to other countries, especially to Europe, is a factor of modernization independent from the state. For the first time in their history, all Romanians are free to travel, a fact that has generated a profound revolution in their daily thinking and behavior. One-fifth of Romanian villages could be classified as ‘transnational villages’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0539018411426518">Sandu, 2005</xref>: 565). Another example of modernization in this sense is the increase in educational levels during the communist period. This is a very strong factor of latent modernization, with the support of state input, but with the massive participation of the population.</p>
<p>Modernity exists and it cannot be denied since today Romanian society is experiencing the effects of modernization: urbanization, industrialization, alphabetization, increase in educational level, democratization of the relationships between people, flexibility of the interaction between social groups. It is not modernity that is to be questioned here, but the level of modernization of all social components. Romanian modernity is characterized by ambiguity and ambivalence. The project of modernity is ambiguous, non-unitary and shot through with compromises. I would say that, because of this, Romania has modernity, but it does not have the modern man, or only to a small degree, within the urban population with its higher levels of education.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Tendential modernity is a universal phenomenon; it also appears in states with a well-structured, functional modernity. There is even a tendency to surpass the status quo, to go further towards something new in respect of the establishment. The concept of tendential modernity covers a dynamic reality, but in reality it is a continuum whose beginning and end are hard to identify. Unlike societies with a well-structured modernity due to a solid, efficient and productive economic base, it seems that the society characterized by tendential modernity will never settle. Its modernizations consist always and only of tendencies. Here, in contrast to other spaces of culture and civilization, the duration of these kinds of phenomena is much longer.</p>
<p>The concept I propose ensures a structured understanding of modernity in spaces where the rhythm of cultural and political modernization is faster than the slow evolution of the economy. Under these circumstances, the economy has a different specific trend, one that we call tendential modernity. Tendential modernity refers to actions and ideas concerning modernization which remain partial and not finalized. This modernity is more an aspiration, a goal to be reached, but which is never fully attained. Due to the fact that modernity is merely a tendency, never finalized, the transitions are never finished. Tendential modernity moves slowly and with difficulty through the intricate network of socio-institutional structures of the patriarchal and traditional society. It is an inlay modernity, not structured under a clear and dominant form.</p>
<p>I have applied my thesis to the study of the modernization of Romanian society through all its stages: the emergence of the national state, the period between the two World Wars, the communist period, and the post-communist period. Even though these periods do not have a homogeneous rate of development, I believe that tendential modernity is the essence of modern Romania’s evolutionary process. Throughout this whole period, from the late 18th century until today, cultural, political and intellectual modernization was way ahead of economic modernization because of the gap between the rate of institutional renewal and economic progress. This is why many of the modernization processes in Romania are similar to those in countries with insufficiently developed economies, a situation that can also be found in some states of the European Union. The processes of modernization are extremely diverse and the comparative analysis of some regions, like the Balkans, the ex-Soviet Union, Latin America or Asia, may reveal something specific to the modern evolution of Romania.</p>
<p>Tendential modernity appears in societies where social and institutional actors act in different directions and without organic adherence to a common and constant project, with the result that this project fails to become one to which local funds are directed in order to reach a dominant modernity. For instance, Romanian modernity today lacks a national development program, one that has a strategic concept – the dominant of the entire modernization project – assumed by the intellectual and political elite of Romania. This example demonstrates that modernity, as it has been developed in Western Europe, is not possible here because the institutional forms adopted from Western societies do not have the same contexts and economic conditions, and thus cannot function as they do in Western Europe. Tendential modernity exists side by side with Western reflexive modernity. Romanian modernity is mainly tendential because it has too many particularities and too few alignments with contemporary Western modernity, especially with the Western modernity of the 19th century.</p>
<p>Romanian society is today in another geopolitical position because of its integration into Euro-Atlantic structures. This is a position of security in respect of any threats. The circumstances of tendential modernity will persist until a wide-ranging and deep-seated process of Europeanization of all social structures takes place under the direct and indirect influence of decisions made by the EU institutions regarding the social actors and institutions of its Member-States.</p>

<p>I used the concept of tendential modernity to explain the theory of forms without substance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0539018411426518">Schifirneţ, 2007a</xref>: 205). The forms without substance are systems of laws and modern institutions mechanically imported by the Romanian elites from Western societies in order to accelerate the process of social modernization, without adapting them to the historical, social and cultural particularities of the internal context. Due to this institutional mimesis, these forms or modern institutions do not prove their functionality on all levels of Romanian society. In other studies I have used the term ‘tendentious modernity’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0539018411426518">Schifirneţ, 2007b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0539018411426518">2007c</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0539018411426518">2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0539018411426518">2009a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0539018411426518">2009b</xref>).
