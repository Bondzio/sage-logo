<abstract>
<p>Sales career opportunities are growing, and the number of women in sales is increasing. Educators must adequately prepare both men and women for today’s ethical sales dilemmas. Using the Personal Selling Ethics Scale, the current study analyzes the impact of idealism and relativism on the sales ethics evaluations of men and women. Results indicate that women evaluate sales ethics scenarios as less ethical than males and that varying positions on these ethical frameworks partially explain the divergence. Results also imply that today’s sales educators should primarily emphasize moral idealism when teaching sales ethics. Ethical codes and situation-based frameworks can aid this effort. When teaching relativistic individuals, educators can supplement idealistic methods via the use of cognitive moral development frameworks.</p>

<p>Sales career opportunities are growing at a 9% rate through 2016, and the number of women in sales and related occupations is nearing the 50% mark (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0273475311430805">Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2010</xref>). However, positive impressions of sales have not kept pace with the growth, and sales is widely considered to be a prime arena for ethical abuse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-0273475311430805">Luthy, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-0273475311430805">Ramsey, Marshall, Johnston, &amp; Deeter-Schmelz, 2007</xref>). Although females are generally found to be more sensitive to ethical issues in business and sales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0273475311430805">Dawson, 1992</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-0273475311430805">1997</xref>), there is little recent research reviewing the relative ethical sensitivities of males and females in sales situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0273475311430805">O’Fallon &amp; Butterfield, 2005</xref>). Since women are now heavily represented within sales, an understanding of the manner in which each gender evaluates personal selling ethics is required. The current study seeks to further this understanding by analyzing gender responses to ethical sales situations and by suggesting possible reasons behind the differences. Findings may be useful for the preparation of pedagogical methods and ethical codes within academia and industry.</p>
<p>The article begins by reviewing past research on gender-specific ethical evaluations. Particular attention is paid to idealism and relativism since the two constructs are hypothesized to influence the manner in which individuals respond to ethics scenarios in marketing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0273475311430805">Singhapakdi, 2004</xref>). Next, male and female responses to various ethical situations in sales are tested. Results are compared with results from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0273475311430805">Forsyth’s (1980)</xref> moral relativism/idealism test to help uncover possible reasons behind the gender divide. The article concludes with pedagogical recommendations.</p>
<sec id="section1-0273475311430805">
<title>Literature Review and Hypotheses</title>
<p>Two streams of associated research must inform a review of gender and ethical evaluations. The first addresses the manner in which gender influences ethical evaluations, and the second addresses the manner in which preexisting moral frameworks influence ethical evaluations. The latter offers a means to determine possible factors behind the hypothesized gender divide. The present section offers the research context for each stream.</p>
<sec id="section2-0273475311430805">
<title>Gender and Ethical Evaluations</title>
<p>During the 1960s and 1970s, feminist research generally sought to minimize the notion of gender differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-0273475311430805">Grant, 1988</xref>). By the 1980s the effort had largely failed and was replaced by a research stream, continuing to the present day, that recognizes both the divergence and complementarity of the sexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0273475311430805">Pool, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-0273475311430805">Smith &amp; Rogers, 2000</xref>). The current section reviews gender research related to general ethical evaluations.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that both genders view their ethical standards as higher than the other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0273475311430805">Kidwell, Stevens, &amp; Bethke, 1987</xref>), research over the past generation has indicated that the ethical evaluations of men are often less sensitive than those of women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0273475311430805">Beu, Buckley, &amp; Harvey, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-0273475311430805">Dobson &amp; White, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0273475311430805">Gilligan, 1982</xref>). Some researchers disagree with the notion of an ethical gender divide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-0273475311430805">Sikula &amp; Costa, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr58-0273475311430805">Walker, 1984</xref>), but <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0273475311430805">Collin’s (2000)</xref> survey of 47 studies in the <italic>Journal of Business Ethics</italic> revealed that few empirical analyses of gender and ethics conclusively confirmed that a divergence does not exist. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-0273475311430805">O’Fallon and Butterfield’s (2005)</xref> review of 49 articles moderated Collin’s consensus through uncovering that almost half of the articles (23 studies) showed few differences between male and female ethical evaluations. However, the remaining 26 studies indicated that, in most situations, women are more ethically sensitive. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-0273475311430805">Ford and Richardson’s (1994)</xref> review of 14 studies on ethical values indicated that one-half found a difference, and the other half found no difference. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0273475311430805">Weeks, Moore, McKinney, and Longenecker (1999)</xref> found similar inconsistencies across studies. However, among the studies finding a difference, women uniformly emerged as evaluating ethical situations more stringently. Less ethically sensitive male evaluations were seen across a spectrum of issues ranging from broad social issues to double standards to sexual exploitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-0273475311430805">Smith &amp; Oakley, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-0273475311430805">Vermeir &amp; Van Kenhove, 2008</xref>). Therefore, women are more likely to view ethical misconduct unfavorably, especially in business settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0273475311430805">Franke, Crown, &amp; Spake, 1997</xref>). This suggestion particularly holds true during the early years of a person’s career.</p>
<p>Explanations for the apparent divide vary. Trait-driven approaches seek to explain the divergence by reviewing the generalized traits of male instrumentalism versus female sensitivity, emotional understanding, and moderated competitiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0273475311430805">Grimshaw, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0273475311430805">Hunt, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr59-0273475311430805">Weeks et al., 1999</xref>). Innately different biological roots have also been considered to be the primary driver behind differing ethical evaluations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-0273475311430805">Pool, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>Alternate explanations use gender socialization theory to suggest that differing ethical evaluations primarily stem from divergent socialization processes. Gender socialization theory traces its foundations to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0273475311430805">Freud (1925)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-0273475311430805">Piaget (1932)</xref> and suggests that varying socialization methods, rather than innate biological differences, primarily account for differences between male and female orientations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-0273475311430805">Lever, 1978</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-0273475311430805">Gilligan’s (1982)</xref> pioneering research applied gender socialization theory to ethical evaluations and suggested divergent patterns were related to unique socialization experiences. Men are generally rewarded for succeeding through competition and women are generally rewarded for exhibiting nurturing behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0273475311430805">Kohlberg, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-0273475311430805">Roxas &amp; Stoneback, 2004</xref>). Therefore, gender socialization theory suggests that since the cutting of ethical corners is usually more tempting in competitive versus nurturing situations, males can be expected to exhibit less sensitive ethical evaluations.</p>
<p>In sales, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0273475311430805">Dabholkar and Kellaris’s (1992)</xref> Personal Selling Ethics Scale (PSE) has been used to test gender evaluation differences. The PSE presents a range of ethical situations in sales and requests users to rate the degree to which they feel the situation is or is not ethical. Four of the sales ethics scenarios in the original PSE revealed statistically significant gender differences. Subsequent studies have encountered evaluation differences across a wide array of PSE scenarios (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-0273475311430805">Donoho et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-0273475311430805">Donoho, Herche, &amp; Swenson, 2003</xref>). The current study uses an updated version of the PSE, referred to as the Personal Selling Ethics Scale–2 (PSE-2; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0273475311430805">Donoho &amp; Heinze, 2011</xref>). The PSE-2 is reproduced in the <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0273475311430805">appendix</xref> and is used to test the following sales ethics evaluation hypothesis:</p>

<title>Moral Frameworks–Moral Idealism Versus Relativism</title>
<p>The philosophical frameworks that guide actions are important, offering the basis for a nuanced understanding of ethical gender variations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0273475311430805">Schminke, 1997</xref>). The current section highlights the reasoning behind this study’s utilization of an idealism/relativism framework and then offers a review of that framework.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0273475311430805">Hunt and Vitell’s (1986)</xref> general theory of marketing ethics has enjoyed widespread use within marketing and sales (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0273475311430805">McClaren, 2000</xref>) and provides an umbrella framework for the study of ethical evaluations within specific sales situations. The model suggests that an individual’s perception of ethical problems and alternatives is influenced by various background factors such as, among others, normative moral philosophies. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0273475311430805">Forsyth’s (1980</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0273475311430805">1992)</xref> pioneering work on moral philosophies resulted in the development of the Ethics Position Questionnaire (EPQ). Underlying and fundamental to the EPQ were the notions of moral idealism and relativism. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-0273475311430805">Schlenker and Forsyth (1977)</xref> argued that idealism and relativism were two foundational dimensions of personal moral philosophies, and the two constructs went on to provide a descriptive scale for reviewing moral philosophies such as situationalism, absolutism, subjectivism, and exceptionalism.</p>
<p>Based on a set of universal absolutes, moral idealism judges actions as moral or immoral, while also contending that it is possible to avoid harming others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0273475311430805">Forsyth, 1992</xref>). Conversely, individuals who are less idealistic are willing to settle for the “lesser of two evils” in order to accomplish some supposed good (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0273475311430805">Forsyth, 1980</xref>).</p>
<p>In contrast to idealism, moral relativism asserts that universal absolutes should not inform ethical judgments. Rather, situational factors and participant variables should drive moral decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-0273475311430805">Forsyth, 1992</xref>). Individual characteristics and circumstantial factors trump rules. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0273475311430805">Singhapakdi (2004)</xref> additionally points out that culture and society may be a broad circumstantial factor that influences relativists.</p>
<p>Though not specifically used to evaluate scenarios within the personal selling process, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0273475311430805">Forsyth’s (1980)</xref> categorizations and their underlying dimensions (idealism and relativism) have been used in many sales studies, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-0273475311430805">Stead, Worrell, and Stead (1990)</xref> proposed that idealism and relativism should be universally added to ethical models. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-0273475311430805">McClaren’s (2000)</xref> review of sales ethics research demonstrates that a sales manager’s ability to develop and train subordinates is aided by understanding the divergent moral ideologies of salespeople. However, divergent ideological orientations do not explain all variations in ethical evaluation. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-0273475311430805">Sivadas, Kleiser, Kellaris, and Dahlstrom (2003)</xref> found that although moral relativism did influence sales managers’ opinions of ethical situations, moral idealism had no effect. Likewise, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0273475311430805">Singhapakdi (2004)</xref> illustrated that moral idealism had no effect on ethical intentions, whereas relativism shared a reverse relationship with ethical intentions. The study uncovered that marketing students who held higher relativistic perspectives were less likely to demonstrate positive ethical intentions.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, an array of studies supports the contention that both relativism and idealism affect ethical intentions and actions. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr57-0273475311430805">Vitell and Singhapakdi (1993)</xref> demonstrated that idealistic marketers exhibited higher ethical judgments and were less likely to act dishonestly. Additionally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0273475311430805">Bass, Barnett, and Brown (1999)</xref> found that idealists were more inclined to judge questionable selling practices as unethical. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0273475311430805">Valentine and Bateman (2011)</xref> determined that, along with issue contingencies and environmental constructs, ethical ideologies influenced ethical issue recognition and intentions. In particular, idealistic individuals were found to be more sensitive and relativistic individuals were found to be less sensitive to ethical misconduct in sales. Therefore, as background factors within <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0273475311430805">Hunt and Vitell’s (1986)</xref> model, idealism and relativism represent individual differences that can influence both the manner and method of ethical judgments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0273475311430805">Barnett, Bass, &amp; Brown, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-0273475311430805">Tansey, Brown, Hyman, &amp; Dawson, 1994</xref>).</p>
<p>Gender research regarding ethical philosophies is surprisingly scarce. Although numerous studies over the past 20 years have reviewed gender evaluation differences in business ethics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-0273475311430805">Franke et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0273475311430805">Gaedeke, Kelley, &amp; Tootelian, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-0273475311430805">Malinowski &amp; Berger, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-0273475311430805">Peterson, Beltramini, &amp; Kozmetsky, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-0273475311430805">Ruegger &amp; King, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr60-0273475311430805">Whipple &amp; Wolf, 1991</xref>), few have specifically reviewed gender differences in terms of normative moral philosophies. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0273475311430805">Schminke (1997)</xref> offered an exception by finding that ethical frameworks are fairly consistent across genders, with both males and females leaning toward relativism. Further refinement of the study illustrated that slight differences can be teased out. In business settings, women more strongly favored Kant’s categorical imperative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-0273475311430805">Schminke &amp; Ambrose, 1997</xref>). However, in nonbusiness settings, women preferred an idealistic approach (the Golden Rule) whereas men leaned toward a relativistic framework.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0273475311430805">Loe and Weeks (2000)</xref> touched on moral philosophies by uncovering that females use higher levels of moral reasoning than males. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-0273475311430805">Singhapakdi and Vitell’s (1994)</xref> review of American Marketing Association collegiate chapters indicated that male marketing students were less idealistic and less relativistic than females. Subsequent research indicated that the intentions of female marketing students were more ethical than the intentions of male students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0273475311430805">Singhapakdi, 2004</xref>).</p>
<p>Therefore, despite their limitations, idealism and relativism should still be considered when reviewing sales ethics since they inform ethical actions in a fairly consistent manner across the genders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-0273475311430805">Schminke, 1997</xref>). In light of the general findings associated with gender, moral frameworks, and ethical evaluations, the following hypotheses are proposed:</p>
<list id="list2-0273475311430805" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 2</italic>: Females will score higher on moral idealism than males.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 3</italic>: Males will score higher on moral relativism than females.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 4</italic>: Sales ethics evaluations are negatively related to moral idealism. Students higher in moral idealism are less tolerant of sales ethical dilemmas.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 5</italic>: Sales ethics evaluations are positively related to moral relativism. Students higher in moral relativism are more tolerant of sales ethical dilemmas.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p><italic>Hypothesis 6</italic>: Sales ethics evaluations will not be affected by gender differences when moral idealism and moral relativism are taken into account (gender differences will not be significant).</p></list-item>

<title>Method</title>
<p>To test the philosophical frameworks in sales-specific situations, two questionnaires were used. First, an updated version of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0273475311430805">Dabholkar and Kellaris’s (1992)</xref> PSE was used to test whether an ethical gender divide exists in sales situations. The new scale is referred to as PSE-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0273475311430805">Donoho &amp; Heinze, 2011</xref>). Second, a modified version of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0273475311430805">Forsyth’s (1980)</xref> EPQ was used to test whether idealism and relativism may influence gender evaluation differences.</p>
<sec id="section5-0273475311430805">
<title>Data Collection and Sample Characteristics</title>
<p>Study data were collected as part of a larger multisemester, multisurvey questionnaire administered to over 1000 students in marketing classes at a public university in the West. The first questionnaire included the PSE-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0273475311430805">Donoho &amp; Heinze, 2011</xref>) and an array of demographic questions. The PSE-2 (see the <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-0273475311430805">appendix</xref>) is composed of 20 ethical sales situations which participants evaluate using a 7-point semantic differential scale (1 = <italic>very unethical</italic>, 7 = <italic>very ethical</italic>). A subsequent survey of a smaller subset of students included <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-0273475311430805">Forsyth’s (1980)</xref> EPQ moral idealism and relativism scales (5-point Likert-type scale with 1 = <italic>strongly disagree</italic>, 5 = <italic>strongly agree</italic>). The surveys were administered via an online survey tool. Taking an average total time of 20 minutes to complete, the survey items for the current study were completed by 429 students who received course credit. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0273475311430805">Table 1</xref> presents sample characteristics by gender.

<title>Scale Characteristics</title>
<p>The PSE and EPQ (moral idealism and moral relativism) scales are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0273475311430805">Tables 2</xref>, 3, and 4. Reliability assessment using Cronbach’s alpha was .79 for the PSE2. There was a relatively wide range of mean scores (1 = <italic>very unethical</italic>, 7 = <italic>very ethical</italic>) for the 20 PSE-2 items, ranging from “stealing from competitor at trade show” (males, 1.84; females, 1.84) to “puffery” (males, 5.10; females, 5.22). The standard deviations for the mean scores were smaller for sales scenarios evaluated as less ethical and increased for scenarios evaluated as more ethical. This is supported by regression results of mean ethical evaluation by standard deviation (males, adjusted <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = .458, <italic>p</italic> = .001, standardized Beta coefficient = .698; females, adjusted <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = .504, <italic>p</italic> = .000, standardized Beta coefficient = .728).</p>
<p>Cronbach’s alpha for the EPQ was .82 for moral idealism, and .71 for moral relativism. These values are consistent with previous use of these scales and are considered adequate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-0273475311430805">Nunnally, 1978</xref>). A wide array of studies have used the EPQ (or associated variations) and have experienced similar results. Reported reliabilities for moral idealism and relativism have included the following: Singhapadki (2004), .87 and .79; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0273475311430805">Kleiser, Sivadas, Kellaris, and Dahlstrom (2003)</xref>, .81 and .70; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-0273475311430805">Valentine and Bateman (2011)</xref>, .84 and .81; and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0273475311430805">Bass, Barnett, and Brown (1998)</xref>, .86 and .81.</p>
<p>A factor analysis constraining the EPQ scale items to two factors resulted in appropriate loadings that matched the idealism and relativism constructs. Factor loadings varied from .41 to .78 for moral idealism and .49 to.63 for moral relativism, except for idealism scale item 7 (.268) and relativism scale item 1 (.377). Deletion of these items from the analysis did not significantly improve Cronbach’s alpha scores. Therefore, the scales were used in their complete form.</p>
<p>The mean score for the PSE-2 (males, 3.40; females, 3.29) fell between <italic>neither unethical nor ethical</italic> and <italic>somewhat unethical</italic>, using a 7-point Likert-type scale. Mean scores for moral idealism (males, 3.46; females, 3.63) and moral relativism (males, 3.21; females, 3.15) fell between <italic>neither disagree nor agree</italic> and <italic>agree</italic>, using a 5-point Likert-type scale.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Hypothesis 1 was supported. There are gender differences in the PSE-2 Scale. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0273475311430805">Table 2</xref> presents the results. A multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) of the 20 PSE-2 scale items by gender was conducted, resulting in significant gender differences (Wilks’s Λ = 2.408, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). Individual analyses of variance (ANOVAs) revealed that five scale items (inflating expense report, offering a monetary bribe to buyer, charging customers different prices, sneaking vacations on company time, and cheating on the bidding process) were responsible for the rejection. All five items were in the hypothesized direction, being viewed as less ethical by females (<italic>p</italic> &lt; .05) than by males. In all, 14 of the 20 PSE-2 scale items were in the hypothesized direction. The mean for all 20 PSE-2 items was significantly lower for females than for males (<italic>F</italic> = 3.83, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .003).</p>

<p>Generating significant MANOVA results, Hypothesis 3 was partially supported. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-0273475311430805">Table 4</xref> presents the relationship between gender and moral relativism. The MANOVA for all 10 scale items was significant (Wilks’s Λ <italic>F</italic> = 2.349, <italic>p</italic> &lt; .010). Rejection of the hypothesis was driven by only 2 of the 10 relativism scale items. Males scored higher on moral relativism for both items.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The current study’s results partially explain the mixed results associated with prior gender research. Although the current study uncovered gender differences in the evaluation of sales ethics scenarios, these differences were not significant when moral idealism and relativism positions were taken into account. Therefore, gender differences in sales ethics evaluations are partially the result of ethical position differences. Though both men and women weigh moral idealism similarly, men are more prone to hold relativistic positions. This positional variance results in lower, less sensitive sales ethics evaluations on the part of males. Though findings confirm the relevance of background factors within (idealism and relativism) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0273475311430805">Hunt &amp; Vitell’s (1986)</xref> model, idealism and relativism do not entirely explain the differences in sales ethics evaluations. Additional causal constructs are present, and the uncovering of these constructs represents an opportunity for future research.</p>
<sec id="section9-0273475311430805">
<title>Implications for Sales Ethics Training</title>
<p>The study’s first implication extends beyond gender and points to the critical importance of vigorously including ethical training within today’s sales and marketing classes. The current study’s overall mean PSE-2 score (males, 3.40; females, 3.29) indicates that students do not view today’s sales dilemmas in an ethically sensitive manner. All PSE-2 scenarios involve lying, misrepresentation, or withholding information for the purposes of benefiting the sales representative at another party’s expense. However, when asked to rate the degree to which the described action/scenario was unethical, students replied with an average response that falls between “somewhat unethical” and “neither unethical nor ethical.” Given this average response, it can be assumed that a large percentage of respondents might behave in an ethically problematic manner when confronted by ethical sales dilemmas.</p>
<p>The study’s second implication is that morally idealistic frameworks should be used to effectively teach ethics in the sales profession. Regardless of gender, individuals who subscribe to an idealistic moral framework generally demonstrate increased sensitivity to ethical issues. Therefore, as suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-0273475311430805">Singhapakdi (2004)</xref>, teaching and encouraging morally idealistic perspectives may increase the likelihood that students will pursue ethical alternatives when faced with questionable sales scenarios. Incorporating moral idealism tools within the classroom may include using codes of ethics or practical representations of these codes such as the PSE-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-0273475311430805">Donoho &amp; Heinze, 2011</xref>). Reviewing the individual items of the PSE-2 provides a relatively comprehensive overview of the dilemmas covered by sales codes or encountered in the sales process. The situations within the PSE-2 could be used as a codified framework for discussing these dilemmas, or as the basis for research, role-plays, and assessments regarding the dilemmas.</p>
<p>Finally, the large number of students (especially men) who hold relativistic ethical frameworks suggests the inclusion (alongside idealistic approaches) of utilitarian arguments for ethical behavior. The PSE-2 includes items that are problematic for students holding a utilitarian perspective (e.g., anticipated negative consequences from the situation is clear and would result from the action), and these situations could be used to emphasize the negative utility associated with unethical sales actions.</p>
<p>Another recommended approach for instructing relativists is based on cognitive moral development. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr14-0273475311430805">Ferrell and Gresham (1985)</xref> discussed the framework, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0273475311430805">Wortruba (1990)</xref> developed an ethical decision-making process, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0273475311430805">Loe and Weeks (2000)</xref> confirmed its effectiveness. The <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr61-0273475311430805">Wortruba (1990)</xref> approach is as follows:</p>
<list id="list3-0273475311430805" list-type="order">
<list-item><p>Recognize what actions are possible in a given situation, what the outcomes would be, and who would be affected by each alternative outcome (possible consequences);</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Determine which alternative is morally right and therefore represents what one ought to do in that situation from an ethical perspective (moral idealism);</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Assign priority to ethical and moral values relative to other values (relativism; such as economic), producing the intention to do what is ethically right; and</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Convert the intention into action—an ethical decision or behavior.</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Therefore, it is recommended that although educators should primarily emphasize idealistic perspectives, utilitarian appeals should also be used when dealing with relativistic students.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="section10-0273475311430805">
<title>Future Research and Limitations</title>
<p>Since moral idealism and relativism explain a relatively small portion of the variance in PSE-2 scores, other constructs should also be considered. As suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-0273475311430805">Hunt and Vitell (1986)</xref>, ethical evaluations are antecedent to decision making in a macro marketing ethics model. A complete model also reviews intentions and behaviors, and these constructs could be tested via an experimental methodology in which scenarios are manipulated based on the degree of unethical behavior and the anticipated consequences of that behavior.</p>
<p>Evaluating sales managers and trainers is also recommended since their focused leadership efforts, via the institutionalization of ethical standards, can minimize ethical breaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0273475311430805">Ingram, LaForge, &amp; Schwepker, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-0273475311430805">Singhapakdi &amp; Vitell, 2007</xref>). Evaluating sales managers, corporate trainers, and academic instructors could help determine whether the personal moral frameworks of managers or educators influence their pedagogical methods. Future research should also examine the manner in which sales educators view sales ethics evaluations, and attention should be paid to the methods they use to instill ethical sensitivity in sales situations.</p>
</sec>
</sec>
<sec id="section11-0273475311430805" sec-type="conclusions">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Given the growth in sales career opportunities and the number of women pursuing those opportunities, educators must adequately prepare both men and women for facing today’s ethical sales dilemmas. The current study tested the effect that idealism and relativism have on the manner in which each gender evaluates ethical situations in sales. Results indicate that men and women vary in their evaluations of sales ethics scenarios, and that the ethical frameworks used to guide decision making influence these evaluations. Idealistic and relativistic frameworks were examined, and although men and women weight moral idealism similarly, men are more prone to hold relativistic ethical frameworks. When these ethical frameworks are taken into consideration, the gender effect disappears. Therefore, gender evaluation differences can be partially explained by differences in ethical frameworks. Future research should examine additional causal factors.</p>
<p>Study implications include the suggestion that today’s sales educators should primarily emphasize moral idealism. Ethical codes and situation-based frameworks such as the PSE-2 can help educators in this effort. When teaching relativistic individuals, educators can supplement idealistic methods with the use of cognitive moral development frameworks.</p>

Y felt that this not exactly “stealing” because the samples were there to be taken for free anyway. “Besides,” Y thought, “if they’re stupid enough to leave their exhibit unattended. . . .” When the competitor returned it was discovered that the product samples were missing and no more were available for prospective buyers attending the trade show.</p>

<p>When Salesperson V gets a hotel room and rents a car to make out-of-town calls, V sometimes keeps the room and the car an extra day or two for personal use. This allows V to sneak in “mini vacations” without taking time off. This is common practice in the company and V feels that the relaxation makes for a more effective employee for the company. V has always been a top 10% performer in his company’s sales force.</p>

<list-item><p>5. Conflicts of interest: Moonlighting</p></list-item>
</list>
<p>Salesperson M is a former computer programmer who now sells computer hardware for XYZ Company. In M’s spare time, M developed some software that M sells “on the side.” Most of the buyers of M’s software are company’s customers that M contacted through the job. The company also sells software to run on its equipment. M sees no problem with this situation because M feels it’s up to the customer to decide which product is best for them.</p>

<list-item><p>6. Entertainment: Lavish entertaining</p></list-item></list>
<p>Salespeople at Manufacturer ABC often spend large amounts of money on entertaining clients and prospective clients. It is not unusual for a salesperson at A to invite a client and their spouse to an expensive ($500) dinner. The client’s company has a policy against accepting gifts, but, as the salesperson at ABC likes to say, “everybody’s got to eat. . . .”</p>
<list id="list10-0273475311430805" list-type="simple">
<list-item><p>7. Taking advantage: Cheating on sales contest</p></list-item></list>
<p>The D Company sometimes holds sales contests for its sales force. The salesperson with the most sales during the contest period (usually one month) would win a cash bonus. Salesperson V found an easy way to “boost sales” during the contest. V simply held the orders from previous weeks and did not turn them in until after the contest period began. To this V added regular orders taken during the contest period.</p>
<list id="list11-0273475311430805" list-type="simple"><list-item><p>8. Overpromising and passing blame: False promises used to close sale</p></list-item></list>
<p>Salesperson R was young, inexperienced, and eager to make a sale. To close a sale, R promised a customer a delivery time that R knew the company probably could not meet. R thought, “if the customer complains about the order arriving late, I’ll just blame it on the shipping department.”</p>
<list id="list12-0273475311430805" list-type="simple"><list-item><p>9. Misusing confidential information: Cheating on the bidding process</p></list-item></list>
<p>Salesperson S would sometimes ask customers for information about the competitors’ prices. This frequently enabled S to underprice the competition when bidding for the job.</p>
<list id="list13-0273475311430805" list-type="simple"><list-item><p>10. Manipulation: Fear appeal to close sale</p></list-item></list>
<p>Psychological research has revealed that irrational social anxiety and a fear of growing old are primary motives underlying consumer’s use of a certain group of products. A door-to-door salesperson for a company that markets such products has used this information to increase sales dramatically. “It’s easy to sell [our products] if you just work on [the prospect’s] natural fears.”</p>
<list id="list14-0273475311430805" list-type="simple"><list-item><p>11. Misusing company assets: Frequent flyer abuse</p></list-item></list>
<p>A company that has many out-of-town clients has negotiated a special rate with airline E—a 35% discount between designated cities—and encourages its employees to use that airline whenever possible. Salesperson T prefers to use Airline D because of their “frequent flier” program (which allows him to earn free personal trips). In some cases, T has booked flights on Airline D even though the tickets cost up to $200 more than similar flights on Airline E, just so T could “rack up those frequent flier points.” T doesn’t use the points for business travel.</p>

To gain favor with one customer, B would sometimes “let something slip” about another customer. B felt that this was acceptable as long as that customer had not explicitly asked him to hold a piece of information in confidence.</p>
