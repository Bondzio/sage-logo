<p>David Harper and Andrew Thompson’s book <italic>Qualitative Research Methods in Mental Health and Psychotherapy</italic> provides a reference for students and practitioners who are using qualitative research to explore topics related to mental health. The book provides a rich and comprehensive text, with contributions from specialized authors on a number of key themes and research methods relevant to qualitative research. Despite being specifically aimed at those researching mental health issues, this text would be useful for any student or practitioner who wishes to get to grips with ‘big q research’, that is, research that collects and engages with data in a ‘more reflexive fashion, acknowledging (and using) the <italic>intersubjective relationship</italic> between the researcher and the researched’ (p. 6). There are a number of cross cutting themes running through the text. Service user involvement is addressed in all chapters of the book, as are issues of quality in qualitative research and the importance of establishing the epistemological assumptions of the research method used.</p>
<p>The book is divided into three parts. Part I, ‘Getting Started’, includes chapters on searching and synthesizing qualitative literature, ethical issues in qualitative research, user involvement in research and advice on choosing a research method. The first chapter in this section, by Rachel Shaw, takes the reader step-by-step through the process of locating, reviewing and synthesizing qualitative literature. The debates surrounding synthesizing qualitative evidence are briefly explored and a comparison between interpretative synthesis and integrative synthesis provided. The author then takes the reader through a worked example of a meta-ethnography, useful to a new researcher embarking on their own synthesis of the literature. Issues such as transparency and reflexivity in the research process and the contribution these make to the quality of a synthesis of the literature are discussed, as well as the challenges of synthesizing literature, which use different methods and epistemological backgrounds.</p>
<p>In Chapter 3, Andrew Thompson and Eleni Chambers discuss the ethical issues that might arise during the conduct of qualitative research in mental health and how these might be addressed. Conflicts between professional codes of practice and the principles that guide ethics of research are discussed. For example the decision on whether or not to breach confidentiality where there is disclosure of potential self-harm from participants is often a dilemma faced by those conducting research with service users. The authors identify the dangers of viewing ethical issues ‘simply as a set of procedural tasks to be dealt with before research commences’ (p. 26), an attitude they claim prevents the potential for on-going reflexivity of the researcher. Thompson and Chambers propose that involvement of potential participants early in and throughout the research process is one way to ensure that good ethical research practice is followed. Issues concerning informed consent, confidentiality, multiple roles of the researcher (for example as both researcher and practitioner) and the existing power relationships that exist between researcher and participant are explored. The authors also challenge the labels used to describe participant groups such as ‘marginalized’ and ‘vulnerable’ and how these might disempower and devalue those who participate in research.</p>
<p>The theme of service user involvement is taken up again in Chapter 4 where Alison Faulkner espouses the empowering and emancipatory attributes of qualitative research for survivors and users of mental health services. Faulkner suggests that for research to be practical, relevant and useful it has to involve the people who are at the receiving end of health and social care provision. However, she also recognizes the challenges to achieving this, for example the reluctance of some researchers to relinquish power and control, the additional resources needed to involve participants in terms of money and time, and some of the attitudinal difficulties towards service uses, for example, those individuals with mental health problems are often seen as being unable to contribute to a rational process.</p>
<p>Chapters 5 and 6 focus on methods of data collection specific to research in mental health. In Chapter 5, Hannah Frith and Kate Gleeson begin the chapter by suggesting researchers choose their research method by asking the question ‘what knowledge is the research trying to produce?’ Through a series of questions, involving epistemological assumptions of the research and methods chosen, participant ability and interests, level of engagement between researcher and participant and the perception of participant in the method of data collection chosen, the authors help the researcher chose the most appropriate data collection method for their research question. Chapter 6 also discusses data collection - this time specifically related to psychotherapy. In this chapter Roger Thompson explains that research evaluating psychotherapy traditionally comments on either change process or outcome process. Change process research (CRT), however, professes to bridge the evaluation of both outcome and process and can tell us not only which therapies are associated with positive client outcomes but also what in the therapy clients use to bring about changes in themselves.</p>
<p>Part I concludes with a further chapter on choosing a research method, this time from the perspective of analyzing data as opposed to collecting data. In Chapter 7, David Harper uses three main epistemological frameworks to offer a classification of qualitative research methods, namely realism, phenomenology and social constructionism. Harper gives a comprehensive and clear description of the assumptions of each epistemological framework and any subsidiary approaches that might exist. The author explains how any one of these three epistemological frameworks might be applied to answer questions posed in research involving mental health issues. The classification of the main epistemological frameworks discussed in Chapter 7 offers a reference for the range of methods discussed in section 2 where each of the authors offers ‘practical information as to how to go about conducting a study within the approach.’ (p. 7).</p>
<p>Part II of the book, ‘Methods’ discusses a range of methods used in qualitative research from the perspective of data analysis. The authors do this by presenting not only the key epistemological assumptions offered by the method presented, but also step-by-step guides on how to use each method. Each chapter is richly illustrated with worked examples, consideration of how the method might influence policy and practice and any recent innovations in the use of the methods. As suggested by the editors, the consistency provided in the presentation and content of the chapters aids comparison between methods and can help the researcher select the method best suited to the research question. Part II does not provide an exhaustive list of methods, but does include chapters on the main methods used in qualitative research including Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis, Existentialist-Informed Hermeneutic Phenomenology, Grounded Theory, Discourse Analysis, Ethnomethodology, Conversational Analysis, Q Methodology and Thematic Analysis. All methods proposed also include a discussion on how service users and participants might become involved in the research process.</p>
<p>In the final section of the book, ‘Establishing Good Quality Qualitative Research in Mental Health’, Liz Spencer and Jane Ritchie contribute to the on-going debate on how the quality of qualitative research might be assessed. Assessing the quality of qualitative research is often problematic and contentious and the most appropriate criteria to use when assessing qualitative research is often difficult to establish. In this chapter Spencer and Ritchie review the key concerns in using criteria traditionally used to assess quality in quantitative research in qualitative research. The authors suggest that rather than proposing a set of prescriptive rules or standards, as is commonly done, the way forward might be through adopting a set of guiding principles that retain a role for individual judgment. In Chapter 16 the authors do this by recommending three principles with which to evaluate quality, namely contribution, rigor and defensibility. The authors offer a practical explanation of how these principles might be applied to establish the quality of the research through asking a series of questions of the study. There is an agreement, however, that any assessment of quality would, of course, depend on the philosophical and methodological basis of the study. The chapter concludes, although rather unconvincingly, with the importance and relevance of user involvement to the contribution of quality in qualitative research. It is not really clear how that might happen, though. Considerations of reflexivity, diversity and cultural sensitivity are also made in establishing quality issues in this chapter.</p>
<p>This is an interesting and valuable book; however, it is not always an easy read, especially the discussions involving epistemological frameworks and assumptions in Part II on Methods. The book may go towards dispelling the belief that some students and practitioners have, that is, that doing qualitative research is an ‘easy option’, especially in comparison to studies using quantitative methods. The authors have made the distinction that the aims of the book are to support qualitative research with a ‘big q’ rather than a ‘little q’ and that distinction is made clear and the complexity of conducting a study using qualitative methods comes through firmly. I would suggest, however, that anyone wishing to conduct a qualitative research project, especially those who are new to qualitative methods, would benefit from having the support of an experienced supervisor or advisor. I doubt that any book, including this one, would replace the advice or support that is necessary in producing high quality qualitative research.</p>
<p>One concern is the issue of reflexivity which is often seen as central to the conduct of ‘big q’ qualitative research. Although the editors do indicate the importance of addressing both empirical and personal reflexivity in qualitative research, the issue of personal reflexivity is not fully explored within this text. Personal reflexivity, how this might be conducted and documented within a research project and the contribution it might make to the quality of qualitative research are never really fully explored and the reader is left wondering how it might work. Personal reflexivity and its contribution to the research process are often confusing to those new to qualitative research. I feel that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0959353512472478">Holloway (2005)</xref> or <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-0959353512472478">Mason (2006)</xref> might give more comprehensive explanations on the role of personal reflexivity in qualitative research than this text offers. Another suggestion might be the inclusion of other professional groups as contributors. Although the book is aimed at a range of practitioners, the contributions are mainly from health psychologists, clinical psychologists and one psychotherapist. There are a wide variety of disciplines involved in carrying out qualitative research in mental health, i.e. midwives, nurses (and psychotherapists!) and it may have enriched the discussions to have included some of these other professional groups as contributors.</p>
<p>In summary, this text offers a good reference for those conducting qualitative research in mental health. Several cross cutting themes can be identified throughout the book, namely epistemological assumptions of methods used in qualitative research, the importance of service user involvement and the specific ethical issues of qualitative research in mental health. The section on methods is presented consistently and would be of great help to any researcher engaged in qualitative research. However, as in any research project a text book is rarely a substitute for the expertise of an experienced supervisor, that, I feel is particularly relevant in qualitative research.</p>
