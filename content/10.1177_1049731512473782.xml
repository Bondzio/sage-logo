<title>Introduction</title>
<p>How do parents perceive adversity? How do their beliefs about adversity affect their family adaptation, parenting goals, and socialization strategies? Obviously, the answers to these questions have important practical implications on the design and delivery of family social work services. These questions are especially meaningful for families facing adversity, such as those experiencing economic disadvantage. The answers would provide some clues for social workers and policy makers in responding to intergenerational poverty.</p>
<p>Adversity is “the state of hardship or suffering associated with misfortune, trauma, distress, difficulty, or a tragic event” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr16-1049731512473782">Jackson, Firtko, &amp; Edenborough, 2007</xref>, p. 3). In the social science literature, the study of adversity is often linked to developmental and environmental risk factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr38-1049731512473782">Rutter, 1999</xref>), the concept of resilience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-1049731512473782">Luthar, Cicchetti, &amp; Becker, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr50-1049731512473782">Tugade &amp; Fredrickson, 2004</xref>), and coping mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr18-1049731512473782">Lazarus &amp; Folkman, 1984</xref>). Broadly speaking, there are three categories of coping in face of adversity: appraisal-focused coping, problem-focused coping, and emotion-focused coping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1049731512473782">Moos &amp; Billings, 1982</xref>). However, research attention has been put on the latter two categories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1049731512473782">Carver &amp; Scheier, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1049731512473782">Folkman &amp; Lazarus, 1985</xref>), with appraisal-focused coping having neglected in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1049731512473782">Pan, Wong, Chan, &amp; Chan, 2008</xref>). It was until recently that researchers started to pay attention to study how people interpret the meanings of adversity and how these interpretations affect individual behaviors and family processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1049731512473782">Folkman &amp; Moskowitz, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1049731512473782">Pan et al., 2008</xref>).</p>
<p>In the familial context, meaning of adversity is particularly important for members to cope with the challenge of adversity. In the Family Adjustment and Adaptation Response (FAAR) model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1049731512473782">Patterson, 1988</xref>), family meanings interact with family demands and family capabilities to reach a level of family adjustment or adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1049731512473782">Patterson, 1988</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1049731512473782">1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1049731512473782">2002a</xref>). There are three levels of family meanings that are described in the FAAR Model: (a) families’ definitions of the adversity and their capacity to overcome it, (b) their identity with the family; and (c) their worldview (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr32-1049731512473782">Patterson, 1993</xref>). These meanings sculpt the nature and magnitude of risk as well as the protective strengths within the family. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr34-1049731512473782">Patterson (2002b</xref>) concluded that “the meaning-making process is a critical component of family resilience, especially when the significant stress is due to adversity or trauma” (p.244). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr51-1049731512473782">Walsh (2003</xref>) found that family beliefs on the meaning of adversity perform two main functions. First, through normalizing and contextualizing adversity and distress, family members enlarge their perspective to see that they can overcome difficulties and hurdles. Second, families gain a sense of coherence to define a crisis as a challenge that is manageable and somewhat meaningful.</p>
<p>The above literature leads to another question: What factors contribute to family beliefs or meanings about adversity? <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1049731512473782">Pepitone (2001</xref>) suggested that beliefs are “social constructions that are part of a culture and have guided the socialization of those who share that culture” (p. 186). Culture has the distinctive feature of “symbolic and behavioral inheritance” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr45-1049731512473782">Shweder, Goodnow, Levine, Markus, &amp; Miller, 1998</xref>, p. 867) that is historically developed and traditionally accepted. Cultural beliefs influence how people perceive, approach, and tackle adversities in life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1049731512473782">Lee, Kwong, Cheung, Ungar, &amp; Cheung, 2010</xref>). As <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1049731512473782">Walsh (2006</xref>) pointed out, “the definition and meaning of struggle and adversity is culturally varied” (p. 67). As such, family beliefs about adversity are culturally specific in nature.</p>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1049731512473782">Shek (2005</xref>) summarized that there are three ways cultural beliefs influence individuals experiencing adversity. First, cultural beliefs may influence how adversity is defined and conceptualized. Second, cultural beliefs may shape coping resources and behaviors. Third, cultural beliefs may produce stressors that affect one’s adjustment. It was found that individuals with strong beliefs to overcome adversity tend to act positively in the face of difficulties and challenges, which in turn may result in better psychological well-being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1049731512473782">Shek et al., 2003</xref>). On the contrary, individuals with negative beliefs that adversity is uncontrollable may exhibit a sense of learned helplessness, which in turn may infer a “motivational deficit” (believing action is useless), “cognitive interference” (difficulty in learning that action can produce positive outcomes in new situations), and “affective reaction” (depression or resignation; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr17-1049731512473782">Kane, 1987</xref>, p. 411).</p>
<p>Theoretically, there are indigenous conceptions of beliefs about adversity in the Chinese culture. Deeply embedded in the Confucius beliefs that one’s ascribed status was defined by ethics, as well as the traditional Chinese Buddhist and Taoist concepts of transitory existence and impermanence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr49-1049731512473782">Trainor, 2001</xref>), adversity has been regarded as a part of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1049731512473782">Pan et al., 2008</xref>). Chinese are taught to follow the “order of Heaven” (<italic>an yu tian ming</italic>). Nevertheless, though life trajectories go beyond one’s control, people’s attitudes and values toward adversity could be very different according to different Chinese philosophies. Chinese may adopt a positive cultural value of adversity, rooted in Confucian thoughts, with inner strengths and virtues such as perseverance and tolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1049731512473782">Shek, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1049731512473782">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1049731512473782">Shek et al. 2003</xref>). With the characteristics of modesty and human malleability in Chinese culture, Confucian emphases of perseverance, forbearance, and self-discipline are crucial Chinese values in facing adversity. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-1049731512473782">de Vos (1998</xref>) argued that the focus of self-discipline is “to put off present gratification, but with future social purpose and future social and occupational mastery in mind. A sense of mastery … is the goal of Confucian self-development defined within one’s prescribed social role” (p.332). On the contrary, Taoist thought would recommend the principle of “wu-wei,” or active non-doing, to cope with uncontrollable circumstances (Redding, 1990). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1049731512473782">Shek (2004</xref>) classified this category of beliefs as “negative beliefs about adversity.” They emphasize the impossibility and people’s incapability to change adverse situations, as adversity may be due to fate or superstition. Not surprisingly, it has been argued that there is a strong sense of fatalism in this school of thought (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1049731512473782">Bond, 1986</xref>).</p>
<p>Cultural beliefs not only influence people’s attitudes toward adversity but also shape one’s causal attributions to success and failure. According to the attribution theory, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1049731512473782">Weiner (1985</xref>) proposed a three-dimensional taxonomy: (1) locus—the degree to which a person believes the cause is internal or external to the actor; (2) stability—how much the cause varies over time; and (3) controllability—whether the cause can be controlled by one’s desire and effort. He further suggested four dominant attributions of perceived causes of success and failure: ability, effort, influence of others, and luck. Ability and effort are internal loci, with ability being stable and uncontrollable whereas effort is unstable and controllable. Influences of others and luck are external foci, with influences of others being relatively stable but uncontrollable, and luck being unstable and uncontrollable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr55-1049731512473782">Weiner, 1985</xref>). When a person adopts positive cultural values of perseverance, forbearance, and self-discipline, he or she would perceive success as attributed by internal factors such as effort. On the contrary, if one adopts negative cultural beliefs of fate and superstitions, he or she might find that success and failure determined by external factors that are uncontrollable.</p>
<p>Though Chinese beliefs are crucial for one’s values and behaviors in facing adversity, there is a severe lack of psychosocial assessment tools measuring the beliefs systems in the Chinese culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr41-1049731512473782">Shek, 2010</xref>). The problems may due to the difficulties on theorization and conceptualization of beliefs, as well as the cultural specificity of the beliefs system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr21-1049731512473782">Leung &amp; Shek, 2011</xref>).This is particularly problematic in the Chinese context as Chinese people have a unique culture developed for over 5,000 years under the influence of Confucianism, Taoism, and Buddhism. Furthermore, it was criticized the measurement on beliefs is “superficial, poorly defined, and while often in face validity, it is sorely lacking in providing information about construct and content validity” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr46-1049731512473782">Sigel, &amp; McGillicuddy-De Lisi, 2002</xref>, p. 497). Obviously, the severe lack of indigenous objective assessment tools in the Chinese communities has hindered the exploration of family meanings toward adversity, and this further hampers the development of evidence-based research on the study of Chinese models on family resilience. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-1049731512473782">Leung (1996</xref>) commented that “there is a dearth of theorizing and data on the beliefs systems of Chinese” (p. 262).</p>
<p>Despite the severe lack of measurement tools in assessing the meaning of adversity in the Chinese context, some scholars attempted to develop and validate useful assessment tools that adequately measure the Chinese’s perception on meanings of adversity. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-1049731512473782">Pan, Wong, Chan, and Chan (2008</xref>) developed the 12-item Chinese Making Sense of Adversity scale (CMSAS) through interviewing the Mainland Chinese graduate students. The scale was validated by 627 Chinese international students in Australia and Mainland Chinese students in Hong Kong, showing good internal consistency and concurrent validity. Two factors, making positive sense and making negative sense of adversity, were extracted from the scale. However, the scale was developed and validated with the samples of Chinese international students and employed the acculturative stressors as the foci of adversity. The specific emphasis on acculturative experiences of Chinese international students limits the scope of adversity as well as the ability to represent the general Chinese population.</p>
<p>Another multidimensional measurement tool to measure the Chinese cultural beliefs about adversity was the Chinese Cultural Beliefs about Adversity scale (CBA; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1049731512473782">Shek, 2004</xref>). It is a 9-item assessment tool developed by a group of psychologists and social workers. Based on the response of 1,519 secondary school students aged between 11 and 18 years, it was found that the tool showed good reliability and factorial validity. Two factors, positive Chinese beliefs about adversity (PCBA) and negative Chinese beliefs about adversity (NCBA), were yielded when principal components analysis was performed.</p>
<p>This scale has been used to assess the relationship between Chinese beliefs about adversity and adolescent psychological development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1049731512473782">Shek, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1049731512473782">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr43-1049731512473782">Shek et al., 2003</xref>). Results showed that positive endorsement of Chinese cultural beliefs about adversity among adolescents was related to better well-being and less problem behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1049731512473782">Shek, 2005</xref>).</p>
<p>While CBA showed good psychometric properties in the adolescent sample, it was found that not much effort has been put on understanding how parents perceive Chinese cultural beliefs about adversity. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr35-1049731512473782">Paulson and Sputa (1996</xref>) reminded researchers to be cautious that “what parents think they may be doing in the home may not be what the adolescent perceives” (p. 371). Also, it is of critical importance to understand Chinese cultural beliefs about adversity from the parents’ perspective, as their beliefs may influence their family goals, parental roles and parenting practices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-1049731512473782">Padmawidjaja &amp; Chao, 2010</xref>). Their beliefs enable them to cope with everyday challenges, preserve their self-esteem, generate parental behaviors in meeting parenting demands, and set standards for complying with parental roles and responsibilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr25-1049731512473782">McGillicuddy-De Lisi &amp; Sigel, 1995</xref>). There is evidence showing that parental beliefs of adversity were associated with family functioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr22-1049731512473782">Leung &amp; Shek, in press-a</xref>) and parenting style (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-1049731512473782">Leung &amp; Shek, in press-b</xref>).</p>
<p>Another important point is that the psychometric properties of CBA have not been assessed in individuals and communities facing adversity and trauma. In particular, though poverty has been a social concern in the global context, research on persons and families experiencing economic disadvantage has been underresearched (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr42-1049731512473782">Shek, 2011</xref>). As there were 130,400 children and adolescents aged between 6 and 14 living in poverty in 2011, covering 24.8% of the children population in Hong Kong (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr15-1049731512473782">Hong Kong Council of Social Service, 2012</xref>), understanding how poor families believe about adversity is crucial for researchers, social workers, and policy makers to develop effective intervention strategies and policies to help the families to face adversity. It is also meaningful for researchers to understand more about parental values and attitudes in facing economic constraints. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr30-1049731512473782">Pareek (2002</xref>), when poor people believe that their life chance is determined by fate and their poor situation is beyond their control, the powerlessness they perceive may induce a specific pattern of motivation with low need for achievement, low need for extension, and high need for dependence, and further display the behavioral outcomes of disproportionate risk taking, interest in chance, lack of interest in feedback, lack of activity or initiative, lack of faith and trust, avoidance behaviors, seeking favors of superiors and overconformity. On the contrary, economically disadvantaged families that have positive beliefs about adversity may build up resilience in facing adversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1049731512473782">Patterson, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr53-1049731512473782">Walsh, 2011</xref>), which may in turn influence the psychosocial competence of children and adolescents living in poverty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1049731512473782">Garmezy, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr47-1049731512473782">Smith &amp; Carlson, 1997</xref>). Thus, it is of paramount importance to examine the psychometric properties of CBA that measures the cultural beliefs about adversity of family members in the context of poverty.</p>
<p>For a measurement to be objectively used in research and practice contexts, it is essential to establish its psychometric properties. Typically, three aspects of the psychometric properties of the scale should be examined. First, reliability of the measure should be clarified. Second, validity of the scale should be explored. Third, dimensionality of measure (i.e., factorial validity) with reference to the proposed conceptual framework should be examined. In particular, assessment of the stability of factor structure is important to evaluate whether the measure could be used in different samples under different specific contexts.</p>
<p>Against this background, the purpose of the article is to present findings on the psychometric properties of the CBA. The data were collected from a parent sample experiencing economic disadvantage. If the CBA has good psychometric properties, it should show several attributes. First, it should have acceptable internal consistency (i.e., reliability). Second, as predicted by the conceptual framework and previous research findings, two factors (positive beliefs and negative beliefs) should be extracted from the scale (i.e., factorial validity). Third, as predicted by theory, the total and subscale scores should have significant correlation with measures of parental attributions (i.e., construct validity).</p>

<title>Participants and Procedures</title>
<p>A cross-sectional survey with purposeful sampling was conducted. Fathers and mothers having at least one child aged 11 to 16 from intact Chinese families experiencing economic disadvantage were invited to participate in the study. The concept of relative poverty was adopted, with 50% of monthly median domestic household income according to Hong Kong Population By-census 2006 used as the poverty threshold. Families experiencing economic disadvantage were identified and recruited by children and youth service centers, school social work services, and community centers across Hong Kong. Finally, there were 276 families participated in the study. There was one set of invalid questionnaires, leaving 275 sets of questionnaires for analyses.</p>
<p>Either the first author or trained social workers conducted the data collection. Both fathers and mothers were given explanations about the purpose of the research, procedure of data collection, the rights of respondents to voluntarily participate and withdrawal from the study, as well as the use of the data in the study. Informed consent was obtained. Fathers and mothers were requested to complete the Father Questionnaire and Mother Questionnaire, respectively, which contained measures of Chinese cultural beliefs about adversity and causal attributions of children’s success and failure. To ensure confidentiality, the questionnaire was completed by each participant separately. The questionnaire was administered in a self-administered format. In case the participants had difficulties comprehending the questionnaires, the first author or trained social workers would ask questions or items in an interview format. Parents took around 45 minutes to 1 hour to complete the questionnaires, depending on their literacy level.</p>
<p>The mean ages of the fathers and mothers were 49.9 (<italic>SD</italic> = 9.28) and 42.2 (<italic>SD</italic> = 4.97), respectively. Most fathers were born in Hong Kong (<italic>n</italic> = 98, 35.6%) or had resided in Hong Kong for more than 20 years (<italic>n</italic> = 115, 41.8%), whereas the mode of duration of stay of mothers in Hong Kong was between 6 and 10 years (<italic>n</italic> = 103, 37.5%). Regarding the educational attainment of fathers and mothers, a majority were of low educational standard, with 205 fathers (74.5%) and 204 mothers (74.2%) at the junior secondary level or lower. There were 211 (76.7%) fathers who had a job, 30 (10.9%) were unemployed, and 26 (9.5%) were retired. A high proportion of mothers were housewives (<italic>n</italic> = 199, 72.4%). The average number of children in the families was 2.3 (<italic>SD</italic> = .90). There were 96 families receiving Comprehensive Social Security Assistance from the Government, representing 34.8% of the sample.</p>

<title>Chinese Beliefs about Adversity Scale (CBA)</title>
<p>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1049731512473782">Shek (2004</xref>) developed a 9-item CBA with a group of psychologists and social workers. The scale attempts to measure the cultural beliefs of Chinese people about adversity. While 2 items (Items 2 and 5) are concerned with negative cultural beliefs about adversity, the rest assess positive cultural beliefs. For each item, the respondents are asked to rate their degree of agreement with the item on a 6-point scale. Examples of the items are “Chi de ku zhong ku, fang wei ren shang ren” (hardship increases stature); “Hao chou ming sheng cheng” (whether a life is good or bad depends on fate). Factor analysis was performed to determine the factor structure and internal consistency of the scale in a sample of adolescents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1049731512473782">Shek, 2004</xref>). Two factors—positive Chinese beliefs about adversity (PCBA) and negative Chinese beliefs about adversity (NCBA)—were extracted. Reliability analysis showed that the two subscales were reliable (Cronbach’s α of PCBA = .88, Cronbach’s α of NCBA = .60; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1049731512473782">Shek, 2004</xref>).

The CASQ was developed within the framework of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr54-1049731512473782">Weiner’s (1974</xref>, 1985) theory of attribution of one’s success/failure and the literature on strategy attributes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-1049731512473782">Borkowski, Weyhing, &amp; Carr, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049731512473782">Chan, 1994</xref>). Four attributes—effort, ability, strategy use, and luck—were identified for success and failure in school children in relation with their schoolwork (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-1049731512473782">Chan, 1994</xref>). There are totally 24 items, with 12 statements reflecting success and 12 reflecting failure. Each statement is representative of one of the four causes (effort, ability, strategy use, and luck). Parents are requested to rate their agreement with each statement on a Likert-type scale ranging from <italic>Strongly disagree</italic> to <italic>Strongly agree</italic>. An example item is: “If my child completes a worksheet well, it is most likely because he/she works hard.” The scale showed internal consistency and factorial validity in previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr37-1049731512473782">Phillipson, 2006</xref>). In the present study, the subscales on “attribution of children’s success and failure to effort” (FAQ-E for fathers’ responses and MAQ-E for mothers’ responses, respectively) and “attribution of children’s success and failure to luck” (FAQ-L for fathers’ responses and MAQ-L for mothers’ responses, respectively)” were used to indicate parental attributions of children’s success and failure to effort and luck, respectively. There are 6 items in the subscale of “attribution of children’s success and failure to effort” and 6 items in the subscale of “attribution of children’s success and failure to luck.” Reliability analyses showed that FAQ-E, MAQ-E, FAQ-L, and MAQ-L had acceptable reliability in this study (α = 0.70 for FAQ-E, α = 0.74 for MAQ-E, α = 0.86 for FAQ-L, α = 0.82 for MAQ-L, respectively).</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>From the data of parent sample, the mean score of fathers’ responses of Chinese Cultural Beliefs about Adversity scale (FCBA) was 43.12 (<italic>SD</italic> = 5.90), ranging from the scores of 13 to 54. The mean score of mothers’ responses of Chinese Cultural Beliefs about Adversity scale (MCBA) was 44.08 (<italic>SD</italic> = 5.29), with the scores ranging from 16 to 54. It was found that the Cronbach’s α of FCBA was .66, which was considered acceptable reliability. The Cronbach’s α of MCBA was .61, which also showed acceptable reliability. The average item-total correlation of FCBA and MCBA were 0.39 and 0.36, respectively. It was found that Item 2 “Hao chou ming sheng cheng” (whether a life is good or bad depends on fate) had a lower item-total correlation. The mean interitem correlations of FCBA and MCBA were .24 and .23, respectively, showing small to moderate effect according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049731512473782">Cohen’s (1988)</xref> suggestion. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1049731512473782">Table 1</xref> lists the item-total statistics of FCBA and MCBA.</p>

<p>To examine the dimensionality of the scale, factor analyses using principal components analysis with varimax rotation was performed. Several statistical analyses were employed to test the statistical assumptions for performing factor analysis. It was found that the Kaiser–Meyer–Olkin measures of sampling adequacy of FCBA and MCBA were 0.82 and 0.81, respectively. The Bartlett’s test of sphericity of FCBA and MCBA were statistically significant (χ<sup>2</sup> = 618.15, <italic>df</italic> = 36, <italic>p &lt;</italic> .001 for FCBA; χ<sup>2</sup> = 646.01, <italic>df</italic> = 36, <italic>p &lt;</italic> .001 for MCBA), showing that both FCBA and MCBA satisfied the requirement for performing factor analysis. Consistent with the conceptual framework, two factors were extracted from FCBA and MCBA that had eigenvalue greater than unity, with the factors explaining 52.87% and 54.72% of total variance of FCBA and MCBA, respectively. Further analyses using the scree test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-1049731512473782">Cattell, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1049731512473782">Gorsuch, 1983</xref>) showed that two factors were meaningfully extracted. The two factors of FCBA could be labeled “positive Chinese cultural beliefs about adversity” (FCBA-P; Items 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9) and “negative Chinese cultural beliefs about adversity” (FCBA-N; Items 2 and 5). All items had factor loading of more than 0.32 which could be interpreted meaningfully (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1049731512473782">Tabachnick &amp; Fidell, 2007</xref>). The same factors—positive Chinese cultural beliefs about adversity (MCBA-P) and negative Chinese cultural beliefs about adversity (MCBA-N) were also extracted from MCBA. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1049731512473782">Table 2</xref> lists the factor loadings of FCBA and MCBA.</p>

<p>Further examination of the reliability of positive Chinese cultural beliefs about adversity (FCBA-P and MCBA-P) and negative Chinese cultural beliefs about adversity (FCBA-N and MCBA-N) was performed. It was found that the reliability of FCBA-P and MCBA-P was 0.80 and 0.78, respectively, with average item-total correlations of 0.55 and 0.54 and mean interitem correlations of 0.39 and 0.39, respectively.

Regarding negative Chinese cultural beliefs about adversity (FCBA-N and MCBA-N), it was found that the reliability of FCBA-N and MCBA-N was 0.52 and 0.65 respectively, with the mean interitem correlations of 0.35 and 0.48, respectively, showing moderate and great effects according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-1049731512473782">Cohen’s (1988)</xref> suggestion.</p>

<p>To further examine the validity of the scale and subscales of CBA, convergent validity was examined. The relationships between the Chinese Cultural Beliefs about Adversity scale (FCBA and MCBA), the positive Chinese cultural beliefs about adversity subscale (FCBA-P and MCBA-P) and negative Chinese cultural beliefs about adversity subscale (FCBA-N and MCBA-N), and parental attributions of children’s success and failure to effort subscale (FAQ-E and MAQ-E) and parental attributions of children’s success and failure to luck subscale (FAQ-L and MAQ-L) were evaluated. In order to decrease the chance of committing Type I error, a conservative α level based on Bonferroni correction was performed. As there were six hypotheses being tested in each sample, the α was determined with the formula of .05/6, that is, .008.

<title>Discussion and Implications to Social Work Practice</title>
<p>The primary objective of this study was to examine the psychometric properties of the CBA from a parent sample experiencing economic disadvantage. Internal consistency and factor structure of the measure as well as convergent validity of the scale and subscales of the CBA were examined in both father and mother samples.</p>
<p>From the perspectives of Chinese fathers and mothers in the context of poverty, it was found that CBA has acceptable internal consistency in both samples. When studying the factor structure of the measure, it was found that two distinct factors, the positive Chinese cultural beliefs about adversity (Items 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, and 9) and negative Chinese cultural beliefs about adversity (Items 2 and 5), were extracted in the factor analysis. The findings support the conceptual model on Chinese cultural beliefs about adversity underlying the measure. The positive and negative Chinese cultural beliefs about adversity are originated from different Chinese schools of thoughts, with positive beliefs based on Confucian thoughts that promote positive virtues of forbearance, perseverance, and self-discipline, whereas some negative beliefs originated from Taoist and Buddhist thoughts that emphasize the uncontrollable life chance human endures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1049731512473782">Shek, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr40-1049731512473782">2005</xref>). In fact, convergent validity tests of assessing the relationships between positive and negative Chinese cultural beliefs about adversity and parental attributions of children’s success and failure to effort and luck support the argument. While positive Chinese beliefs about adversity were significantly related to parental attributions of children’s success and failure to effort, negative Chinese beliefs about adversity were significantly related to parental attributions of children’s success and failure to luck. The two factors (positive beliefs about adversity and negative beliefs about adversity) extracted from the factor analyses as well as their correlations with parental attributions of children’s success and failure to effort and luck, respectively, reaffirm that the CBA is a multidimensional measurement that assess the positive and negative aspects of Chinese cultural beliefs about adversity. The findings provide additional support for the psychometric properties of the CBA.</p>
<p>From the analyses, the inclusion of negative Chinese cultural beliefs about adversity (FCBA-N and MCBA-N) in Chinese Cultural Beliefs about Adversity scale (FCBA and MCBA) has broadened our understanding of how Chinese parents interpret adversity from a relatively pessimistic perspective. The factor also improved the factorial validity of the scale. However, the negative Chinese cultural beliefs about adversity only contained 2 items, which resulted in a lower level of internal consistency. Fortunately, the mean interitem correlations of FCBA-N and MCBA-N showed moderate and high effect size, respectively.</p>
<p>However, Item 7 (“Ren ding sheng tian,” man is the master of his own fate) of MCBA had factor loading of only 0.34, though it was still acceptable for interpretation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr48-1049731512473782">Tabachnick &amp; Fidell, 2007</xref>). There may be two possible reasons explaining its relatively lower factor loading. One is that mothers experiencing economic disadvantage may be pessimistic about controlling their own fate. Another possibility is that they perceive nature as divine and powerful, and thus human beings could not supersede its power. This explanation is consistent with the beliefs of Taoism and Buddhism that life trajectories go beyond one’s control. Further examination of the item in future is necessary.</p>
<p>By computing coefficients of congruence across the present study and Shek’s (2004) study in adolescents, it was found that the scale has stable factor structure of measures of beliefs about adversity across different studies. Deeply rooted in the Chinese culture and greatly influenced by the Chinese philosophies, parents and adolescents, poor and nonpoor groups may have congruent interpretation in meanings of adversity. This suggests that the interpretation of cultural beliefs about adversity is stable in the global Chinese context, regardless of their demographic status (parents and adolescents) and economic background (poor and nonpoor).</p>
<p>In summary, the CBA has acceptable internal consistency. Furthermore, the CBA showed factorial validity in both father and mother samples. The CBA and subscales of positive and negative Chinese cultural beliefs about adversity also showed convergent validity when correlated with parental attributional beliefs of children’s success and failure to effort and luck, respectively. The validity of the scale and subscales of CBA was also supported. Finally, the scale has stable factor structure of measures of beliefs about adversity across different studies. Thus, CBA is a reliable and valid measurement tool to measure the Chinese cultural beliefs about adversity.</p>
<p>The findings suggest that the CBA could serve as a useful measurement tool to measure cultural beliefs of Chinese in face of adversity, especially for those families living in poverty. Apart from problem-focused coping and emotion-focused coping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-1049731512473782">Moos &amp; Billings, 1982</xref>) that are essential coping strategies for families to overcome economic hardship, validation of the CBA represents a progressive development of indigenous psychometric assessment that explores how Chinese economically disadvantaged families evaluate adversity through assigning cultural meaning of adversity in their cognitive appraisal process.</p>
<p>It is the primary mission of social work profession to “enhance human well-being and to meet the basic human needs of the people, especially to the needs and empowerment of people who are vulnerable, oppressed, and living in poverty” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-1049731512473782">National Association of Social Workers, 2012</xref>; Code of Ethics: Preamble). Thus, to reduce the detrimental effects of poverty to families has been the prime concern in social work intervention. Unfortunately, the severe lack of indigenous measurement tools in exploring family meanings toward adversity undermines the development of appraisal-focused coping strategies of Chinese families in facing poverty, which further obstructs the building of Chinese models of family resilience. This article presents a study on examining the psychometric properties of the CBA from the perspective of parents experiencing economic disadvantage. In view of paucity of research in this area, the research is an important addition to the literature.</p>
<p>The stability of factor structure of CBA across different samples (fathers, mothers, adolescents) in different socioeconomic contexts (poor and nonpoor) suggests that the measure could be used in measuring Chinese cultural beliefs in various demographic and socioeconomic contexts. Thus, the CBA could be widely used to assess the cultural beliefs about adversity in the Chinese contexts.</p>
<p>Practically, the CBA is a useful tool to measure individual’s attitudes toward adversity, which provides important clues for social workers to assess the motivation and coping of individual to strive for changes in adversity and trauma. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-1049731512473782">Lee, Kwong, Cheung, Ungar, and Cheung (2010</xref>) suggested that cultural beliefs shape the degree of optimism and coping mechanism of a person in facing hardship. Social workers should be sensitive to the orientation of individual’s cultural beliefs about adversity when assessing one’s motivation for changes.</p>
<p>At family level, the CBA can be used to measure family beliefs about adversity in facing adverse environment. As suggested by the FAAR model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-1049731512473782">Patterson, 1988</xref>), family meanings of adversity would have direct impacts on family adjustment or adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr33-1049731512473782">Patterson, 2002a</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1049731512473782">Walsh (2006</xref>) has reminded us that “how families make sense of a crisis situation and how they endow it with meaning are most crucial for resilience … when hardship or tragedy can be viewed as instructive and can serve as an impetus for growth” (pp. 66–67). As such, it is essential to assess the cultural beliefs about adversity of family members in family social work, as it provides valuable information for social workers to formulate intervention to help the families in facing adversity.</p>
<p>In clinical practice, the cultural dimension should be stressed in counseling and therapeutic treatment. In particular, cultural beliefs about adversity can be utilized by social workers and counselors in the intervention process. According to cognitive behavioral therapy, assessing the core beliefs and schemas of clients as well as modifying their distorted interpretation of dysfunctional beliefs are critical steps in clinical treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1049731512473782">Beck, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1049731512473782">Dobson &amp; Dobson, 2009</xref>). Social workers and counselors may encourage the clients to endorse positive cultural beliefs in the midst of adversity, while help them challenge against the negative cultural beliefs about adversity that may underestimate their coping resources. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr44-1049731512473782">Shiang, Kjellander, Huang, and Bogumill (1998</xref>) explicitly suggested that “the incorporation of specific cultural beliefs and behaviors into standard clinical treatments is sorely needed to improve our ability to provide services to people from diverse settings” (p. 182).</p>
<p>At the societal level, positive Chinese cultural beliefs about adversity may be essential in building resilience against adverse conditions such as global economic depression. In the resilience literature, it was found that positive beliefs about adversity and constructive outlook of life are associated with resilience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr39-1049731512473782">Shek, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr52-1049731512473782">Walsh, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr56-1049731512473782">Werner, 1989</xref>). The stability of factor structure of CBA in poor sample suggests that the measure can be used to assess the Chinese cultural beliefs about adversity in the context of poverty. As suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr36-1049731512473782">Pepitone (2001</xref>), beliefs serve to enhance group solidarity by fostering common identity among members. Social workers and policy makers can make use of the measure to study how people facing economic hardship perceive adversity in a global cultural context, which provides important clues for formulation of social policy and cultivating social consensus in poverty alleviation and resilience building.</p>
<p>There are several limitations of the present study. First, the limitation of purposeful sampling should be realized. As families were not randomly sampled, generalizability of the findings may be limited. Second, as the findings presented in the study are based on economically disadvantaged families in Hong Kong, there is a need to assess generalizability of the findings in different Chinese communities (e.g., mainland China) and Chinese people living in non-Chinese contexts (e.g., Chinese–Americans) in future study. Third, the limitations of using exploratory factor analysis in examining the factor structure of CBA should be recognized. As this is the first scientific study that examines the factor structure of CBA based on a parent sample experiencing economic disadvantage, the employment of exploratory factor analysis is justified. This is proposed that confirmatory factor analyses should be employed to confirm the findings based on the exploratory factor analyses in the future. Fourth, Item 7 (“Ren ding sheng tian,” man is the master of his own fate) has low item-total correlations and factor loading in CBA reported by mothers. Hence, it would be desirable to further examine the psychometric properties of the scale in the future. In particular, the employment of other qualitative methodologies (e.g., interviews with the informants) would give additional insight on how Chinese people perceive adversity culturally.</p>
<p>Despite these limitations, the present findings are stimulating and contributive in understanding the psychometric properties of the CBA in parents experiencing economic disadvantage. Essentially, the study is a constructive response to the urge of development of validated indigenous Chinese measures so as to facilitate the development of Chinese family research (Shek, 2006).</p>
