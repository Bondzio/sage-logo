<p>What President Obama’s reelection will turn out to mean is hard to foretell at this early time. This is particularly the case with regard to the fate of the labor movement, which invested so many human and financial resources in his campaign. Much depends on the course of the economy. So, too, whether or not the Tea Party continues to exercise decisive influence within Republican ranks will help shape the political framework Obama must operate within. Gordon Lafer provides an analysis of the elections to help us get oriented to what might lie ahead.</p>
<p>One worrying prospect seems certain. Both parties and the president are committed to some form of austerity to solve a debt crisis that many in the progressive community don’t agree exists, at least not in the short term (on this misguided official perception see Robert Pollin’s column later in this issue).This kind of belt tightening is likely to exacerbate the underlying economic dilemmas facing working people already struggling to survive severe budget cuts and mired in debt.</p>
<p>Debt of every conceivable variety weighs heavily on homeowners and consumers, low-wage workers and those earning middle-range incomes, the unemployed, and students. In this issue of <italic>New Labor Forum</italic>, Andrew Ross examines the financial crisis in higher education, and in particular student debt. He argues that a combination of profit-taking by leading financial institutions and government cutbacks have left college students with a future even grimmer than the poor economy alone already predicts. At the same time, faculty unions, like unions everywhere, are on the defensive as colleges and universities mimic lean and mean corporations. Dan Clawson maintains that unless these unions find ways to aggressively reach out to other constituencies, including students and working-class communities, using bold strategy and tactics, their defensive posture will prove self-defeating.</p>
<p>Obama’s victory means at least one thing for sure: there will be no repeal of the Affordable Care Act. But questions remain, especially as we enter further into the politics of austerity. Is the new health care law financially able to deliver on its promises? Marcia Angell argues that it is not and that this may create serious political fallout for the Obama regime in the years ahead. How does the law affect collective bargaining? Malini Cadambi Daniel and Erica Rafford Noyes do a ground-level assessment of what the Massachusetts health reform has meant for unions in that state.</p>
<p>Race and the Tea Party were salient aspects of the presidential election. Our series on “The Marxist Moment” treats both subjects. Adolph Reed explores how Marxism can help us root our understanding of racism in concrete, historically specific terms and distinguish a class-based approach to racism from a neoliberal one. In his article about the Tea Party, Lee Sustar uses Marxist thinking to look at right-wing populist movements of the middle class, examining their relationship to big business on the one hand and to oppositional movements on the other.</p>
<p>Where will the human resources come from to fight back against the austerity that seems headed our way? High hopes for Occupy Wall Street have diminished along with its visible presence. Its future is uncertain. But it was in its own way a reaction to the austerity brought on by the banking establishment. In “On the Contrary,” Michael Yates applauds the genius of the movement’s “We are the 99%” slogan, defending it against those who think it too vague.</p>
<p>Hurricane Sandy suggests another arena of opposition to austerity and politics as usual (as Occupy Wall Street was the first to recognize). Global warming is not going away no matter who runs Washington. Although the president hardly talked about climate change during the campaign, the Obama administration has given off mixed signals about addressing it. Inside the labor movement a fierce debate is taking place between unions ready to opt for a green economy strategy that would create jobs down the line and those unions still invested in fossil fuel production. Jeremy Brecher and the Labor Network for Sustainability investigate those divisions and make the case for building a green economy coalition made up of the labor movement, environmentalists, and progressives that might push national policy in that direction.</p>
<p>Presidential elections feed an already exaggerated sense that nothing much matters outside the borders of the United States. However, one of the most striking developments of the last generation is the enormous growth of the informal workforce (including wage workers without employment contracts as well as the vast array of the self-employed around the world). Martha Alter Chen dissects this multimillion person category that throughout the global South comprises most of the active economic population. She describes the uniformly awful conditions of labor and material survival and reports on efforts to organize this heterogeneous universe, efforts that could eventually shift the balance of power in the global economy.</p>
<p>Our regular columnists engage issues of critical importance. In addition to Robert Pollin’s column on the dangers of austerity, in “Caught in the Web” Liza Featherstone unearths valuable websites for those fighting back against privatization in education and student debt, and for health care reform. A few decades ago, Sue Doro and Donna De Graaf-Smith broke the gender barrier in their respective heavy industrial workplaces—they relive some of their experiences and struggles in this issue’s “Working-Class Voices” section. Peter Dreier in “Roots of Rebellion” recounts the long-term battle by community groups in Los Angeles to resist the aggressive efforts of the University of Southern California to take over surrounding neighborhoods and get rid of their working-class residents. In “Under the Radar,” Ben Becker includes a summary of the recent strikes and mass actions against Walmart, largely ignored by mainstream media. Steve Fraser and Joshua B. Freeman write about the transformation of the Republican Party since the days of Robert Taft at the end of World War II in “In the Rearview Mirror.”</p>
<p>With this issue we say goodbye to Sherry Linkon and John Russo, who have so expertly functioned as the “Books and Arts” editors. They have done a fine job for which we are deeply grateful, but now are moving on to other projects. They will be replaced, beginning with the Spring 2013 issue, by Professor Rachel Sherman of the New School. We welcome Rachel aboard.</p>
<p>Sherry and John have prepared their finale well. It includes a book review by Sherry. She tackles a book about workers in the food industry. Three other reviews examine books about union democracy, organizing hospital workers, and the relationship between health care workers and their patients. As always, “Out of the Mainstream” contains precious tidbits about books you won’t want to miss, but might never hear of. And we close with a selection of poems in which three women vividly recall their waitressing days.</p>
