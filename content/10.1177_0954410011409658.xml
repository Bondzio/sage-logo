<abstract>
<p>Swept angle is one of the most important geometric parameters of the strut in scramjet. The change in swept angle will make the geometric shape of the strut different and lead to distinct performances. Computational fluid dynamics method has been used in this study to obtain the cold-state flow field of scramjet model with struts of different swept angles at freestream Mach numbers 5 and 6. The results show that the effect of strut swept angle (from 0° to 60°) on the flow-field structure, total pressure losses, and drag coefficients is less. However, in the cases when strut swept angle is larger than 60°, the shock waves have been weakened significantly and so are the total pressure losses and the strut drag coefficients. In addition, the drag coefficients of all the struts are overall very small because of the small wedge angle of the leading edge. Also, the drag coefficient on the struts reduces when Mach number of freestream increases.</p>

<sec id="sec1-0954410011409658"><title>1 INTRODUCTION</title>
<p>Scramjet is the most potential power device for hypersonic flight in the atmosphere [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-0954410011409658">1</xref></bold>–<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr3-0954410011409658">3</xref></bold>]. The velocity of air flowing through the engine is so high that the residence time of fuel is too short, which leads to critical issues in fuel injecting penetration, mixing enhancement [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-0954410011409658">4</xref></bold>], and flame holding [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr5-0954410011409658">5</xref></bold>]. These problems limit the engine operation performance, especially its net thrust output. There are two approaches to maximize the engine net thrust: maximize the energy added into the thermal cycle process by appropriate combustion organization; and minimize the drag and losses by optimal structure design. For the combustion chamber, selecting and designing proper duct structure, fuel injection device, and flame holder are the main concrete measures to enhance mixing and improve combustion, and also to reduce the drag and total pressure losses.</p>
<p>Strut is a commonly used fuel injection device in scramjet, and it can also be used to compress airstream and hold flame. Compared with wall injection techniques such as cavity, fuel was injected into the core stream directly from strut, which can result in a better distribution of fuel in the core stream and lower wall temperature and higher value in the core stream. In addition, the improved combustion performance brings larger thrust increment [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr6-0954410011409658">6</xref></bold>, <bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr7-0954410011409658">7</xref></bold>], which can overcome the drag caused by strut. However, the drag cannot be neglected in the cold-state flow. In the current level of scramjet research, the large difficulty in getting adequate net thrust makes drag still an important factor to consider in the design and application of strut.</p>
<p>Previous investigations of strut have been carried out on configuration designing, working performance, and research methods, and some useful results have been presented. The turbulent vortices induced by strut were beneficial for fuel/air mixing enhancement and mixing length reduction [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr8-0954410011409658">8</xref></bold>–<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr19-0954410011409658">19</xref></bold>]. The recirculation region behind the strut played an important role in flame holding and combustion improvement [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr20-0954410011409658">20</xref></bold>–<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr23-0954410011409658">23</xref></bold>]. The drag and total pressure losses of strut was larger than other injectors, while the engine thrust increment was larger for the increasing combustion efficiency as well [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr24-0954410011409658">24</xref></bold>–<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr26-0954410011409658">26</xref></bold>].</p>
<p>Experimental investigation of the effect of height and swept angle on drag of strut in both the cold-state and combustion-state flow has been carried out by Su and Liu [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0954410011409658">27</xref></bold>] in the National University of Defense Technology of China. They measured the total thrust of the air heater and the combustor by a thrust-measuring system in a scramjet direct-connected wind tunnel facility and obtained the drag of strut by subtracting the measured force of the system with strut from the value of the case without strut. They found that the short swept strut brought lower drag, which pointed out the direction for strut designing.</p>
<p>However, there were some imperfections in their work. The degree of uncertainty in their drag measurement was high in principle, because the drag of strut was just about 3 per cent of the total thrust in the experiments. On the other hand, the largest strut swept angle in their investigation was 45° and the explanation of the experimental results was limited. Therefore, more systematic studies are required to gain the characteristics and mechanism of the effect of strut swept angle on drag.</p>
<p>In the history of the aircraft, higher flight velocity was a very important requirement during some development phases. Nevertheless, as the flight speed increased, drag on the wings grew increasingly and countervailed more power increment, especially in the cases of high subsonic or supersonic vehicles. Swept back wing [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0954410011409658">28</xref></bold>] was a simple and effective method that was suggested to reduce drag and gradually replace straight wing in high-speed air craft designing. In addition, the flow in the scramjet combustion chamber is also supersonic. Thus, it is reasonable that struts with different swept angles can lead to different performances as well as different shapes. In consideration of that, in this study, single strut with a leading edge swept angle of 0° to 75° has been installed in a combustor segment with constant cross-sectional area, and flow fields have been simulated in two conditions with freestream Mach numbers 5 and 6. The characteristics of the strut flow field has been analysed, and as the strut swept angle varied in a large range, the change principles of flow field, total pressure, and drag coefficient have also been obtained, which is significant for the future strut designing.</p></sec>

<sec id="sec3-0954410011409658"><title>2.1 Combustor and strut configuration</title>
<p>The numerical analysis model is a straight-wall scramjet combustion chamber with a single strut, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954410011409658">Fig. 1</xref>. The inside wall surfaces are straight from the entrance, the left side in the figure, to the exit, the right side. The cross-sectional size is 100 × 40 mm<sup>2</sup> and the length 300 mm. The overall height strut, which is similar to as the strut-F structure in Tam <italic>et al.</italic> [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr29-0954410011409658">29</xref></bold>], is installed at the top wall of the chamber, leaving a 5 mm wide gap between the top surface of strut and the bottom wall of the chamber, for the setting of strut in a future experiment. The strut swept angle is defined as the angle between the strut leading edge and the normal direction of the combustor top wall, as the angle <italic>θ</italic> shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954410011409658">Fig. 1</xref>. Also, the strut leading and trailing edges have the same swept angle. The cross-section of the strut in the plane perpendicular to <italic>y</italic> coordinate is shown at the bottom of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0954410011409658">Fig. 1</xref>, keeping the shape invariant in numerical analysis. No fuel is injected into the flow because the analysis is conducted in a cold state. Furthermore, as the model is symmetrical in <italic>z</italic>-axis, the analysis zone is just half of the model to reduce the computational cost.

<sec id="sec7-0954410011409658"><title>3.1 Comparison with experimental data</title>
<p>In order to demonstrate the validation of the numerical method, a strut with a swept angle of 45° and a leading edge wedge angle of 40° is set in the combustor and calculation is carried out with the flight Mach number of 5 for comparison with the experimental data in Su and Liu [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr27-0954410011409658">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr31-0954410011409658">31</xref></bold>].</p>
<p>Comparison between the calculated flow field and experimental data is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954410011409658">Figs 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954410011409658">3</xref>. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954410011409658">Fig. 2</xref>, the schlieren picture shows the flow structure in the combustor installed with a strut having a swept angle of 45° and a flat trailing surface. The image is obtained in the vertical blade direction, which represents the gradient distribution of density in the flow direction. The dark region in the picture means large density difference in this position, and the evident dark strip indicates the location of shock waves. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954410011409658">Figure 3</xref> shows the density contour plots of three cross-sections parallel to the duct upper wall, on which the strut is installed.

<p>Clearly seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0954410011409658">Figs 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954410011409658">3</xref> are the overall complex flow structures near the strut: a bow shock (label 1 in the figures) detached from the leading edge slightly; two oblique shock waves (label 2) existing outside the wedge of strut; flow separation (label 3) caused by the interaction of the oblique shock waves and the boundary layers on the combustor side walls; shock reflections (label 4) from the separation regions; recirculation zone (label 5) behind the strut trailing edge; shear layers (label 6) between the recirculation region and the high-speed incoming flow; two re-compression shock waves (label 7) deriving from the supersonic flow impact following the circulation region; and some other shock reflections and deflections. The shock waves near the two side walls of the combustor chamber are not completely symmetric in the schlieren diagram, possibly because the asymmetric distribution of manufacturing error at the two side walls leads to unsymmetrical and less-uniform incoming flow for the strut.</p>
<p>Though the main flow-field structures are captured, the sizes of the separation zones at the side walls are much smaller and the detached bow shock is slightly weaker than that of the experimental data, as shown in the comparison. The former difference is possibly because the spacing rate of grid near the wall and the standard wall functions are unfit for flow separation computation. The probable reason of the latter one is that the leading edge of the strut in experiment cannot be practically manufactured as sharp as the one in simulation. Anyway, the calculated overall flow-field structure agrees with the experimental result well.</p>
<p>The drag coefficient obtained by <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="disp-formula1-0954410011409658">equation (1)</xref> in the accuracy analysis simulation case is 0.06, which is slightly less than the value in experiment, 0.07, gained by the same formula. The deviation between the two results is less than 15 per cent, which is in the acceptable range. Actually, the manufacturing error and installation deviation of strut in experiments would make the leading edge shock stronger and windward area larger, and thus the measured drag larger than that in perfect conditions. In short, the computations of cold-state flow in this article are valid for qualitative research.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec8-0954410011409658"><title>3.2 Grid independence study</title>
<p>Grid independence study is carried out to determine the appropriate meshing scheme. In the computations in this section, a strut with a swept angle of 75° and a leading edge wedge angle of 11.4° is set in the combustor. Five cases with different quantities of mesh nodes are simulated in the condition with a flight Mach number of 5. The node numbers of the five meshes are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0954410011409658">Table 2</xref>. The case of meshapp-1 is an adaptive mesh refined from the convergent flow field of the case of meshapp by the gradient of static pressure. The relationship between cases meshcomp-1 and meshcomp is the same, and so is that between the cases meshcomp-2 and meshcomp-1.

<p>The total pressure recovery and drag coefficients calculated in those five cases are also presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0954410011409658">Table. 2</xref>. Though the mesh node numbers deviate very much from each other, the bias between the maximum and minimum total pressure recovery coefficients of those five cases is 0.009, about 1.1 per cent of the average value; and the difference between the maximum and minimum drag coefficients of those five cases is 0.0003, about 1.5 per cent of the average value. That is to say, the influence of mesh spacing rate on the calculation of drag in a cold state can be negligible.</p>
<p>Comparison of the density contour plots in the plane <italic>y</italic> = 0 calculated with the five meshes is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-0954410011409658">Fig. 4</xref>.

<p>The above-mentioned results show that the cold-state flow simulations of a scramjet combustor model with strut in this article are independent of mesh spacing rate.

<sec id="sec9-0954410011409658"><title>4 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</title>
<sec id="sec10-0954410011409658"><title>4.1 A typical flow field in the chamber with swept strut</title>
<p>The supersonic flow field of swept strut is apparently a three-dimensional (3D) flow field, because it is impossible to find a cross-section containing all the geometric features of a swept strut. The following flow field, which is the case with a leading edge wedge angle of 11.4°, a swept angle of 45°, and a freestream Mach number 5, displays the 3D characteristics.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954410011409658">Figure 5</xref> displays the flow field structure of some important <italic>x–z</italic> cross-sections and the flow non-uniformity in the direction of strut height deriving from the non-zero strut swept angle. In the domain beside strut, the area and intensity of flow disturbance caused by the strut leading edge increases gradually from the top wall to the lower wall of the combustor, and so does the flow irregularity in the shock reflection regions near the combustor side walls. Reverse variation is seen for the recirculation zone behind the strut trailing edge. Different from the case shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954410011409658">Fig. 3</xref>, the supersonic airstream generates two attached oblique shock waves instead of a detached bow shock when it flows over the wedge surfaces of the strut leading edge. The shock angle is smaller than that in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3-0954410011409658">Fig. 3</xref>, and thus the flow loss is less. These diversities derive from the lower leading edge wedge angle of the strut in this case, which is the unique difference from the validation case.
<fig id="fig5-0954410011409658" position="float"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><p>Contour plots of Mach number and pressure in <italic>x–z</italic> cross-sections</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954410011409658-fig5.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The last two images in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5-0954410011409658">Fig. 5</xref> display the flow field in the gap between the top surface of strut and the bottom wall of the chamber. Originally, airstream can flow through the gap freely, but a similar flow field structure is found there. Actually, velocity in <italic>y</italic>-axial direction of the air flow near the strut leading and trailing surfaces is not zero because of the strut swept angle and that blocks the airstream flowing in the <italic>x</italic>-axial direction in the gap and acts as strut surfaces. The virtual strut surfaces make the similar flow field structure.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0954410011409658">Figure 6</xref> shows the flow field of some sections perpendicular to the <italic>x</italic>-axial direction. Unlike the similar flow-field configurations in the sections perpendicular to the <italic>y</italic>-axial direction, they are much more different from each other in the <italic>x</italic>-planes. Comparison between the almost uniform flow in plane <italic>x</italic> = 20 mm and the greatly non-uniform field in plane <italic>x</italic> = 120 mm shows acute parameter changes of flow in the streamwise direction. The flow disturbance variation in the direction of strut height is presented as well in the <italic>x</italic>-planes shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6-0954410011409658">Fig. 6</xref>. The non-uniformity originating from the non-zero strut swept angle implies to a certain extent the inconformity of mixing performance even with coincident fuel injection in strut height direction.

<p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954410011409658">Fig. 7</xref>, the contour plots of pressure in plane <italic>y</italic> = 0 and <italic>z</italic> = 0 are presented for the flow field with different strut swept angles, under the flight condition of <italic>M</italic> = 6. The diversities between the flow parameter distributions show the effect of strut swept angle on the flow field.
<fig id="fig7-0954410011409658" position="float"><label>Fig. 7</label><caption><p>Contour plots of pressure in the strut flow field with different swept angles</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954410011409658-fig7.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The top seven images of the left side in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954410011409658">Fig. 7</xref> show almost no difference among the cases that the strut swept angle is less than 60°, except the slightly decreasing strength of the tail of the leading edge oblique shock waves and of the flow separation zones near the two side walls caused by the shock incidence. However, when the strut swept angle is greater than 60°, huge diversities are observed in the bottom four images of the left side in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954410011409658">Fig. 7</xref>. It is obvious that the intensity of the leading edge oblique shocks and the wake region behind the strut are much less in the flow field with larger strut swept angle. Especially in the cases with strut swept angle of 70° and 75°, the oblique shocks and the weak region are so faint that the non-uniformity of the flow field is quite small, which donates less flow losses with larger strut swept angle.</p>
<p>The change of the weak region behind struts with different swept angles is also observed in the right-side images of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954410011409658">Fig. 7</xref>. Notably, in the gap between the strut tip and the combustor lower wall, when the strut swept more and more, a high-pressure region forms, strengthens, and moves to the strut leading edge gradually, while the low-pressure region corresponding to the strut wake is becoming weaker and weaker. The reason is that a velocity component in the <italic>y</italic>-direction is generated when the airstream flows over the swept leading surface, as the velocity vector plot shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8-0954410011409658">Fig. 8</xref>. In this picture, the region in yellow represents high pressure that is formed by the compression effect of the strut leading surface to the airstream and pushes the stream near the strut surface turning to the lower wall of combustor. Also, this <italic>y</italic>-velocity component is larger in the flow field with a larger strut swept angle. The incoming flow impacts with this vertical stream like a virtual extended leading surface and forms a high-pressure region thereby.

<p>The variation of flow disturbance caused by swept strut introduced in the previous section is also presented in the right-side images of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954410011409658">Fig. 7</xref>. In addition, the flow difference around the strut in its height direction is more apparent as the strut swept angle is larger, especially in the recirculation region. It is obvious that some offset should be considered in setting fuel injecting position and amount on a swept strut to obtain better mixing performance.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec12-0954410011409658"><title>4.3 Effect of strut swept angle on total pressure losses</title>
<p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9-0954410011409658">Fig. 9</xref>, the total pressure recovery coefficient of the flow field with different strut swept angles is presented in the flight conditions with freestream Mach numbers 5 and 6. The total pressure in the inlet and outlet, which is used to obtain the coefficient, is calculated both by the mass flowrate averaged method. The curves show slight reduction of total pressure losses in the flow fields with different strut swept angles until the angle becomes larger than 60°, which is consistent with flow-field change to the strut swept angle. When the strut swept angle is larger than 60°, an evident increment of the total pressure recovery coefficient is seen clearly in the figure.
<fig id="fig9-0954410011409658" position="float"><label>Fig. 9</label><caption><p>Total pressure recovery coefficient of the flow field with different strut swept angles</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954410011409658-fig9.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>The leading edge oblique shock waves and the shock reflections and recirculation region are important sources for total pressure losses. According to the flow changes shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7-0954410011409658">Fig. 7</xref>, the strut with large swept angle, such as 70° or 75°, brings weak flow disturbance and makes the flow non-uniformity faint, thus leading to large total pressure recovery coefficient in the exit of the combustor section. The airstream out of this combustor section, therefore, has a larger power capability when the strut swept angle is large enough. Large swept strut certainly has disadvantages such as the increase of wet area of leading and trailing surfaces, which would enlarge the friction. Large swept angle also makes strut long but brings no weight penalty because the volume of strut is the same in all the cases with invariant cross-sectional shape in <italic>y</italic>-plane and the same height.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec13-0954410011409658"><title>4.4 Effect of strut swept angle on the drag</title>
<p>The drag coefficient of the struts with different swept angles is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10-0954410011409658">Fig. 10</xref>, with freestream Mach numbers 5 and 6, respectively. Drag coefficient of all the struts is found to be small, especially when compared with the value in the previous case, compared with experimental data. That is because the wedge angle of the strut leading edge selected in this section is much smaller, leading to the condition that the airstream is not intensively compressed and the static pressure at the strut leading surface does not increase much.
<fig id="fig10-0954410011409658" position="float"><label>Fig. 10</label><caption><p>Drag coefficient with different strut swept angles</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0954410011409658-fig10.tif"/></fig></p>
<p>Non-linear function of the drag coefficient to the strut swept angle can be found in the figure. The drag coefficient changes little, though the strut swept angle varies in a large range from 0° to 60°. However, the drag reduces much when the strut swept angle is greater than 60°. In the case with a strut swept angle of 75°, strut drag coefficient reduces more than one-fifth of those with 60° swept angle under flight condition of <italic>M</italic><sub>∞</sub> = 6, and even one-fourth when <italic>M</italic><sub>∞</sub> = 5. This tendency is consistent with the mentioned trends that the leading edge shock wave strength and the total pressure losses decrease slowly until the strut swept angle is increased to larger than 60°. In the cases with a large strut swept angle, the significant weakening of both the pressure rise in the windward region caused by compression of leading edge oblique shock and the pressure drop in the leeward recirculation zone results in a remarkable reduction of pressure differential on strut. Though frictions are enlarged because of the increase in wet area of strut leading and trailing surfaces, the total drag decreases observably since pressure drag plays an important role in the drag of strut for its non-streamlined structure.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there is some reduction of drag coefficient when Mach number of freestream is higher, because of the lower stream density in higher altitude. Thus, it is favourable for the application of strut in the occasions of higher speed.</p></sec>
<sec id="sec14-0954410011409658"><title>4.5 Discussion on drag characteristic difference between strut and wing</title>
<p>The change trend of strut drag coefficient to its swept angle is different to the relationship in Hamel [<bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr28-0954410011409658">28</xref></bold>] between the drag coefficient and swept angle of aircraft wing. The reason for this diversity is the different definition of the leading edge wedge angle. In the case of aircraft wing, the 2D airfoil is defined in the plane perpendicular to the leading edge; whereas in the case of strut in this article, the <italic>x–z</italic> plane, in which the invariant wedge angle of the leading edge is defined, is not vertical to the leading edge when the swept angle was non-zero. When the strut swept angle becomes larger, the component of Mach number vertical to the leading edge decreases, which leads to the reduction of drag; however, the leading edge wedge angle in the plane perpendicular to the leading edge, which is defined similar to the aircraft wing airfoil, increases gradually, and brings drag increment. The combination of the two effects results in the almost unchanging drag coefficient when the strut swept angle is less than 60°, because the intensity of the leading edge oblique shock changes scarcely.</p>
<p>When the strut swept angle increases further, the component of Mach number vertical to the leading edge decreases close to or less than 1, the oblique shock at the leading edge weakens much, or even disappears, leading to the force reduction at the windward side of strut; simultaneously, the low-pressure region behind strut weakens as well, resulting in a force increment at the leeward side of strut. Under the force shifts at both the windward and leeward sides, the drag coefficient reduces significantly.</p></sec></sec>
<sec id="sec15-0954410011409658"><title>5 CONCLUSIONS</title>
<p>In addition to the drag-reducing effect of swept wings used in aircraft design, swept strut is considered to lower drag of the fuel injection device in scramjet. In order to obtain the influence rules of swept angle on the drag of strut, numerical analysis of cold-state flow field has been carried out in a straight-wall scramjet combustion chamber with a single strut, when the strut swept angle changed from 0° to 75°, and at freestream Mach numbers 5 and 6.</p>
<p>Numerical results show apparent 3D characters of flow field in the chamber with swept strut. Because of the airstream velocity component in <italic>y</italic>-direction near the strut leading and trailing edges, the flow field structure in the gap between the top surface of strut and the bottom wall of the combustion chamber is similar to other sections perpendicular to <italic>y</italic>-axis. The flow non-uniformity implies to a certain extent that some offset should be considered in setting fuel injecting position and amount on a swept strut to obtain better mixing performance.</p>
<p>Simulation presents little difference among the strut flow fields with the strut swept angle less than 60°, as well as the total pressure losses and drags. Whereas in the flow field with a strut swept more, the leading edge oblique shock waves and recirculation region are weakened notably, leading to significant reduction of total pressure losses and drag. In the case with a strut swept angle of 75°, strut drag coefficient reduces more than one-fifth of those with 60° swept angle under flight condition of <italic>M</italic><sub>∞</sub> = 6 and even one-fourth when <italic>M</italic><sub>∞</sub> = 5. The drag will be small if a strut is designed with leading edge swept enough.</p></sec>
